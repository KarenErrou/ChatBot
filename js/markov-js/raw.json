	"pf": ["A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace HIS GIRL FRIDAY fashion.No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but –– but you forget about it in a day or two -– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.You sound like a duck.     (imitates a duck)Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.After tonight.The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.Correct. I got all tonight to quack.Can I get anybody anymore coffee?Oh yes, thank you.The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette.I'm doin' fine.The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.The Young Man goes right back into it.I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er.Did it work?Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.Did they hurt the little girl?I don't know. There probably never was a little girl – the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.You wanna rob banks?I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.So you don't want to be a bank robber?Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.And no more liquor stores?What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: Empty out the register, and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.I'm not gonna kill anybody.I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.Well, what else is there, day jobs?Not this life.Well what then?He calls to the Waitress.Garcon! Coffee!Then looks to his girl.This place.The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.Garcon means boy.She splits.Here? It's a coffee shop.What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.     (taking to idea)I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues in a low voice.See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?Yeah.Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.Uh-huh.That was a good idea.Thanks.We made more from the wallets then we did the register.Yes we did.A lot of people go to restaurants.A lot of wallets.Pretty smart, huh?The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information.She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.Pretty smart.     (into it)I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.Got it.They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on the table. He looks at her and she back at him.I love you, Pumpkin.I love you, Honey Bunny.And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.     (yelling to all)Everybody be cool this is a robbery!Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.– Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?What so you want to know?Well, hash is legal there, right?Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.Those are hash bars?Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?What?It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.Examples?Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.What'd they call it?Royale with Cheese.     (repeating)Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?What?Mayonnaise.Goddamn!I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.Uuccch!The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking them.We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.How many up there?Three or four.Counting our guy?I'm not sure.So there could be five guys up there?It's possible.We should have fuckin' shotguns.They CLOSE the trunk.Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.We TRACK alongside.What's her name?Mia.How did Marsellus and her meet?I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.She ever do anything I woulda saw?I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.What's a pilot?Well, you know the shows on TV?I don't watch TV.Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?Yeah.Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.They enter the apartment building.Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator.You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.Yeah maybe, fat right?I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem.  What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.I think I know who you mean, what about him?Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.  And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.The elevator arrives, the men step inside.What'd he do, fuck her?No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.Well what then?He gave her a foot massage.A foot massage?Jules nods his head: Yes.That's all?Jules nods his head: Yes.What did Marsellus do?Sent a couple of guys over to his place.  They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses – nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.That's a damn shame.STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall.Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.Whaddya mean?You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.You don't think he overreacted?Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out – no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.Jules stops Vincent.Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.Not the same thing, the same ballpark.It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.Foot massages don't mean shit.Have you ever given a foot massage?Don't be tellin' me about foot massages – I'm the foot fuckin' master.Given a lot of 'em?Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.Fuck you.He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind.How many?Fuck you.Would you give me a foot massage – I'm kinda tired.Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed – this is the door.The two men stand in front of the door numbered 49. They whisper.What time is it?     (checking his watch)Seven-twenty-two in the morning.It ain't quite time, let's hang back.They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering.Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass-motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.What's her name again?Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.Take care of her?Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.Hey kids.The two men stroll inside.The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner.ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a Flock of Seagulls haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.How you boys doin'?No answer.Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.We're doin' okay.As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.Do you know who we are?Brett shakes his head: No.We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?No answer.Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?I'm Brett.I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?I remember him.Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?Hamburgers.Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?Cheeseburgers.No, I mean where did you get'em?MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, where?Big Kahuna Burger.Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?They're good.Mind if I try one of yours?No.Yours is this one, right?Yeah.Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?No.Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.          You wanna bite, they're real good.          I ain't hungry.          Well, if you like hamburgers give           'em a try sometime. Me, I can't           usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's           a vegetarian. Which more or less           makes me a vegetarian, but I sure           love the taste of a good burger.               (to Brett)          You know what they call a Quarter           Pounder with Cheese in France?          No.          Tell 'em, Vincent.          Royale with Cheese.          Royale with Cheese, you know why           they call it that?          Because of the metric system?          Check out the big brain on Brett.           You'a smart motherfucker, that's           right. The metric system.          What's in this?          Sprite.          Sprite, good, mind if I have some of           your tasty beverage to wash this           down with?          Sure.Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.          Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!          You, Flock of Seagulls, you know           what we're here for?Roger nods his head: Yes.          Then why don't you tell my boy here           Vince, where you got the shit hid.          It's under the be –          – I don't remember askin' you a           goddamn thing.          You were sayin'?          It's under the bed.Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase.          Got it.Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent just stares at it, transfixed.          We happy?No answer from the transfixed Vincent.          Vincent!Vincent looks up at Jules.          We happy?Closing the case.          We're happy.                      BRETT               (to Jules)          Look, what's your name? I got his           name's Vincent, but what's yours?          My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'           your ass outta this shit.                      BRETT          I just want you to know how sorry we           are about how fucked up things got           between us and Mr. Wallace. When we           entered into this thing, we only had           the best intentions –As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.               (to Brett)          Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your           concentration? I didn't mean to do           that.  Please, continue. I believe           you were saying something about best           intentions.Brett can't say a word.          Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through           anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would           you describe for me what Marsellus           Wallace looks like?Brett still can't speak.Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator.          What country you from!                      BRETT               (petrified)          What?          What ain't no country I know! Do           they speak English in What?                      BRETT               (near heart attack)          What?          English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-          it?                      BRETT          Yes.          Then you understand what I'm sayin'?                      BRETT          Yes.          Now describe what Marsellus Wallace           looks like!                      BRETT               (out of fear)          What?Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's cheek.          Say What again! C'mon, say What           again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya           motherfucker, say What one more           goddamn time!Brett is regressing on the spot.          Now describe to me what Marsellus           Wallace looks like!Brett does his best.                      BRETT          Well he's... he's... black –          – go on!                      BRETT          ...and he's... he's... bald –          – does he look like a bitch?!                      BRETT               (without thinking)          What?Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in the chair.          Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!                      BRETT               (in agony)          No.          Then why did you try to fuck 'im           like a bitch?!                      BRETT               (in spasm)          I didn't.Now in a lower voice.          Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck           'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?                      BRETT               (in spasm)          Yes.          There's a passage I got memorized,           seems appropriate for this situation:           Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the           righteous man is beset on all sides           by the inequities of the selfish and           the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is           he who, in the name of charity and           good will, shepherds the weak through           the valley of darkness, for he is           truly his brother's keeper and the           finder of lost children. And I will           strike down upon thee with great           vengeance and furious anger those           who attempt to poison and destroy my           brothers. And you will know my name           is the Lord when I lay my vengeance           upon you.The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting Brett.AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:FADE IN:prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is like a cross between a gangster and a king.

Besides, even if           you went all the way, what would you           be? Feather-weight champion of the           world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you           can even get a credit card based on           that.A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of Butch. Butch picks it up.          Now the night of the fight, you may           fell a slight sting, that's pride           fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride           only hurts, it never helps. Fight           through that shit. 'Cause a year           from now, when you're kickin' it in           the Caribbean you're gonna say,           Marsellus Wallace was right.          I got no problem with that.          In the fifth, your ass goes down.Butch nods his head: yes.          Say it!          In the fifth, my ass goes down.                                                     CUT TO:INT.

How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'           American?                      ENGLISH DAVE          Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia           out tomorrow?          At Marsellus' request.                      ENGLISH DAVE          Have you met Mia?          Not yet.English Dave smiles to himself.          What's so funny?                      ENGLISH DAVE          Not a goddamn thing.          Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big           man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit           across a table, chew my food with my           mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and           that's all I'm gonna do.English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.                      ENGLISH DAVE          My name's Paul, and this is between           y'all.Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his cup of Plain ol' American.               (to English Dave)          Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?                      ENGLISH DAVE          Filters?          Non.While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.          Lookin' at somethin', friend?          I ain't your friend, palooka.Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.          What was that?          I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...          Vincent Vega has entered the building,           git your ass over here!Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching business.that is Marsellus.Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.                      ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)          Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.                                                DISSOLVE TO:A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in her lips, eyebrows and nose.          ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great           book on body piercing.Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.                      TRUDI          You know how they use that gun when           they pierce your ears? They don't           use that when they pierce your           nipples, do they?          Forget that gun. That gun goes against           the entire idea behind piercing. All           of my piercing, sixteen places on my           body, every one of 'em done with a           needle. Five in each ear. One through           the nipple on my left breast. One           through my right nostril.  One through           my left eyebrow. One through my lip.           One in my clit. And I wear a stud in           my tongue.Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear and out the other, until that last remark.               (interrupting)          Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm           curious, why would you get a stud in           your tongue?Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.          It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent to ponder the truth of her statement.          Vince, you can come in now!Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a Speed Racer tee-shirt.Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.          Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very           good stuff. This is Bava, different,           but equally good. And this is Choco           from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.           Now the first two are the same, forty-          five an ounce – those are friend           prices – but this one...               (pointing to the Choco)          ...this one's a little more expensive.            It's fifty-five. But when you shoot           it, you'll know where that extra           money went.  Nothing wrong with the           first two. It's real, real, real,           good shit. But this one's a fuckin'           madman.          Remember, I just got back from           Amsterdam.          Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?           No.  You're in my house. White people           who know the difference between good           shit and bad shit, this is the house           they come to. My shit, I'll take the           Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit           any ol' day of the fuckin' week.          That's a bold statement.          This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is           a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'           dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back           in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole           seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,           they're as hot as hell.Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse to death.          Give me three hundred worth of the           madman.  If it's as good as you say,           I'll be back for a thousand.          I just hope I still have it. Whaddya           think of Trudi? She ain't got a           boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get           high?          Which one's Trudi? The one with all           the shit in her face?          No, that's Jody. That's my wife.Vincent and Lance giggle at the faux pas.          I'm on my way somewhere. I got a           dinner engagement. Rain check?          No problem?Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting up).          You don't mind if I shoot up here?          Me casa, su casa.          Mucho gracias.Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two continue to talk, Vince shoots up.          Still got your Malibu?          You know what some fucker did to it           the other day?          What?          Fuckin' keyed it.          Oh man, that's fucked up.          Tell me about it. I had the goddamn           thing in storage three years. It's           out five fuckin' days – five days,           and some dickless piece of shit fucks           with it.          They should be fuckin' killed. No           trial, no jury, straight to execution.As he cooks his heroin...          I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,           ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything           to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been           worth his doin' it, if I coulda just           caught 'em, you know what I mean?          It's chicken shit. You don't fuck           another man's vehicle.Going into Vincent's vein.Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.Pushing down on the plunger.Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the doorHi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.          Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.           The door's open. Come inside and           make yourself a drink.Music in.Vincent enters on the background.          Hello?the background. Dusty Springfield is singing SON OF A PREACHER MAN.Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.Vincent turns.          Vincent. I'm on the intercom.          It's on the wall by the two African           fellas.          To your right.Vincent walks.          ...warm. Warmer. Disco.Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.          Push the button if you want to talk.          Go make yourself a drink., and I'll           be down in two shakes of a lamb's           tail.          The bar's by the fireplace.          Okay.A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty Springfield song continues.Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video camera in Marcellus' living room.Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle, and then pours it into a glass.A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.Mia sniffs the cocaine.Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the wall.Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record. The Dusty Springfield song stops.          Let's go.In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're all basically the same. Decor out of an Archie comic book, Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit.But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners.Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that is the slogan: Next best thing to a time machine.          What the fuck is this place?          This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis           man should love it.          Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.          You can get a steak here, daddy-o.           Don't be a...Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.          After you, kitty-cat.Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over the wallTHE CRAB MONSTER, and MACHINE GUN KELLY). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, No shoes allowed. Some wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please me.          Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?          I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.          How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,           or bloody as hell?          Bloody as hell. And to drink, a           vanilla coke.          How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?          I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –           bloody – and a five-dollar shake.          How d'ya want that shake, Martin and           Lewis, or Amos and Andy?          Martin and Lewis.          Did you just order a five-dollar           shake?          Sure did.          A shake? Milk and ice cream?          It costs five dollars?          Yep.          You don't put bourbon in it or           anything?          Nope.          Just checking.Buddy exits.Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.          Whaddya think?          It's like a wax museum with a pulse           rate.Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke.After a second of watching him –          What are you doing?          Rollin' a smoke.          Here?          It's just tobacco.          Oh. Well in that case, will you roll           me one, cowboy?As he finishes licking it –          You can have this one, cowgirl.He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's hand. He lights it.          Thanks.          Think nothing of it.He begins rolling one for himself.As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.Back to Mia and Vincent.          Marsellus said you just got back           from Amsterdam.          Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.          That was my fifteen minutes.          What was it?          It was show about a team of female           secret agents called Fox Force Five.          What?          Fox Force Five. Fox, as in we're a           bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in           we're a force to be reckoned with.           Five, as in there's one... two ...           three... four... five of us. There           was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal           from that show Baton Rouge, she           was the leader. A Japanese one, a           black one, a French one and a brunette           one, me.  We all had special skills.           Sommerset had a photographic memory,           the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,           the black girl was a demolition           expert, the French fox' specialty           was sex...          What was your specialty?          Knives. The character I played, Raven           McCoy, her background was she was           raised by circus performers. So she           grew up doing a knife act. According           to the show, she was the deadliest           woman in the world with a knife. But           because she grew up in a circus, she           was also something of an acrobat.           She could do illusions, she was a           trapeze artist – when you're keeping           the world safe from evil, you never           know when being a trapeze artist's           gonna come in handy. And she knew a           zillion old jokes her grandfather,           an old vaudevillian, taught her. If           we woulda got picked up, they woulda           worked in a gimmick where every           episode I woulda told and ol joke.          Do you remember any of the jokes?          Well I only got the chance to say           one, 'cause we only did one show.          Tell me.          No. It's really corny.          C'mon, don't be that way.          No. You won't like it and I'll be           embarrassed.          You told it in front of fifty million           people and you can't tell it to me?           I promise I won't laugh.               (laughing)          That's what I'm afraid of.          That's not what I meant and you know           it.          You're quite the silver tongue devil,           aren't you?          I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.          That's not what you said Vince. Well           now I'm definitely not gonna tell           ya, 'cause it's been built up too           much.          What a gyp.Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake.          Yummy!          Can I have a sip of that? I'd like           to know what a five-dollar shake           tastes like.          Be my guest.She slides the shake over to him.          You can use my straw, I don't have           kooties.Vincent smiles.          Yeah, but maybe I do.          Kooties I can handle.He takes a sip.          Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'           good milk shake.          Told ya.          I don't know if it's worth five           dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'           good.He slides the shake back.Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.          Don't you hate that?          What?          Uncomfortable silences. Why do we           feel it's necessary to yak about           bullshit in order to be comfortable?          I don't know.          That's when you know you found           somebody special. When you can just           shit the fuck up for a minute, and           comfortably share silence.          I don't think we're there yet. But           don't feel bad, we just met each           other.          Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to           the bathroom and powder my nose,           while you sit here and think of           something to say.          I'll do that.INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHTMia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.               (imitating Steppenwolf)          I said goddamn!INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHTVincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.Mia comes back to the table.          Don't you love it when you go to the           bathroom and you come back to find           your food waiting for you?          We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy           Holly doesn't seem to be much of a           waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn           Monroe's section.          Which one, there's two Marilyn           Monroes.          No there's not.Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.          That's Marilyn Monroe...capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –          ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I           don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it           must be her night off.          Pretty smart.          I have moments.          Did ya think of something to say?          Actually, there's something I've           wanted to ask you about, but you           seem like a nice person, and I didn't           want to offend you.          Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like           mindless, boring, getting-to-know-          you chit-chat. This sounds like you           actually have something to say.          Only if you promise not to get           offended.          You can't promise something like           that. I have no idea what you're           gonna ask. You could ask me what           you're gonna ask me, and my natural           response could be to be offended.           Then, through no fault of my own, I           woulda broken my promise.          Then let's just forget it.          That is an impossibility. Trying to           forget anything as intriguing as           this would be an exercise in futility.          Is that a fact?Mia nods her head: Yes.          Besides, it's more exciting when you           don't have permission.          What do you think about what happened           to Antwan?          Who's Antwan?          Tony Rocky Horror.          He fell out of a window.          That's one way to say it. Another           way is, he was thrown out. Another           was is, he was thrown out by           Marsellus. And even another way is,           he was thrown out of a window by           Marsellus because of you.          Is that a fact?          No it's not, it's just what I heard.          Who told you this?          They.Mia and Vincent smile.          They talk a lot, don't they?          They certainly do.          Well don't by shy Vincent, what           exactly did they say?Vincent is slow to answer.          Let me help you Bashful, did it           involve the F-word?          No. They just said Rocky Horror gave           you a foot massage.          And...?          No and, that's it.          You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror           out of a four-story window because           he massaged my feet?          Yeah.          And you believed that?          At the time I was told, it seemed           reasonable.          Marsellus throwing Tony out of a           four story window for giving me a           foot massage seemed reasonable?          No, it seemed excessive. But that           doesn't mean it didn't happen. I           heard Marsellus is very protective           of you.          A husband being protective of his           wife is one thing. A husband almost           killing another man for touching his           wife's feet is something else.          But did it happen?          The only thing Antwan ever touched           of mine was my hand, when he shook           it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding           – then never again.  The truth is,           nobody knows why Marsellus tossed           Tony Rocky Horror out of that window           except Marsellus and Tony Rocky           Horror. But when you scamps get           together, you're worse than a sewing           circle.                                                     CUT TO:               (into microphone)          Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment           you've all been waiting for, the           worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist           contest.Patrons cheer.Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.          ...One lucky couple will win this           handsome trophy that Marilyn here is           holding.Marilyn holds the trophy.          ...Now, who will be our first           contestants?Mia holds her hand.          Right here.Vincent reacts.          I wanna dance.          No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.               (overlapping)          No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do           believe Marsellus, my husband, your           boss, told you to take me out and do           whatever I wanted, Now, I want to           dance. I want to win. I want that           trophy.               (sighs)          All right.          So, dance good.          All right, you asked for it.Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.          Let's hear it for our first           contestants.Patrons cheer.Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.          Now let's meet our first contestants           here this evening. Young lady, what           is your name?          Missus Mia Wallace.          And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?          Vincent Vega.          All right, let's see what you can           do. Take it away!Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's YOU NEVER CAN TELL. They make hand movements as they dance.The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.Then...The two just stand face to face looking at each other.          Was than an uncomfortable silence?          I don't know what that was.               (pause)          Music and drinks!Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.          I'm gonna take a piss.          That was a little bit more information           than I needed to know, but go right           ahead.Vincent shuffles off to the john.Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.          Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,           you've been holding out on me.Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror.          One drink and leave. Don't be rude,           but drink your drink quickly, say           goodbye, walk out the door, get in           your car, and go down the road.Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line.Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. Then... the rush hits...Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror.          ...It's a moral test of yourself,           whether or not you can maintain           loyalty. Because when people are           loyal to each other, that's very           meaningful.Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.Vince continues.          So you're gonna go out there, drink           your drink, say Goodnight, I've had           a very lovely evening, go home, and           jack off.  And that's all you're           gonna do.Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of that door. So he goes through it.We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. Slack-jawed.          Jesus Christ!Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.          I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.          me honey, what did you take?Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the rack.He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.          Okay honey, we're getting you on           your feet.He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.          We're on our feet now, and now we're           gonna talk out to the car. Here we           go, watch us walk.We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when he glances over at Mia.Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag of water.Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches a number.drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, TAFT, CALIFORNIA, and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an ashtray.On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three Stooges, and they're getting married.          Hold hands, you love birds.The phone RINGS.Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.It RINGS again.Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.          Lance! The phone's ringing!          I can hear it!          I thought you told those fuckin'           assholes never to call this late!          I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna           tell this fuckin' asshole right now!               (he answers the phone)          Hello, do you know how late it is?           You're not supposed to be callin' me           this fuckin' late.Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the conversation.          Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big           fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way           to your place.          Whoa, hold you horses man, what's           the problem?          You still got an adrenaline shot?          Maybe.          I need it man, I got a chick she's           fuckin'  Doing on me.          Don't bring her here!  I'm not even           fuckin' joking with you, don't you           be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt           to my house!          No choice.          She's ODin'?          Yeah. She's dyin'.          Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take           'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!          Negative.          She ain't my fuckin' problem, you           fucked her up, you deal with it –           are you talkin' to me on a cellular           phone?          Sorry.          I don't know you, who is this, don't           come here, I'm hangin' up.          Too late, I'm already here.coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out of SHATTERS from the impact.          What the hell was that?Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn.Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out.          Have you lost your mind?! You crashed           your car in my fuckin' house! You           talk about drug shit on a cellular           fuckin' phone –          If you're through havin' your little           hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get           your needle and git it now!          Are you deaf? You're not bringin'           that fucked up bitch in my house!          This fucked up bitch is Marsellus           Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'           croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But           before he turns me into a bar soap,           I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about           how you coulda saved her life, but           instead you let her die on your front           lawn.WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it.We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room.          It's only one-thirty in the goddamn           mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on           out here?As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room.From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.          Who's she?Lance looks up at Jody.          Get that black box in the bedroom I           have with the adrenaline shot.          What's wrong with her?          She's ODing on us.          Well get her the hell outta here!               (in stereo)          Get the fuckin' shot!          Don't yell and me!She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot.WE MOVE into the room with the two men.               (to Lance)          You two are a match made in heaven.          Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?          While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta           get a medical book.          What do you need a medical book for?          To tell me how to do it. I've never           given an adrenaline shot before.          You've had that thing for six years           and you never used it?          I never had to use it. I don't go           joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all           of my friends can handle their highs!          Well then get it.          I am, if you'll let me.          I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.          Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'           to her.WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, Come on, endlessly.From OFF SCREEN we hear:          Hurry up man! We're losin' her!          I'm looking as fast as I can!Lance continues his frenzied search.WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.          What's he lookin' for?          I dunno, some medical book.          What are you lookin' for?          My black medical book!As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, Jody appears in the doorway.          Whata're you looking for?          My black fuckin' medical book. It's           like a text book they give to nurses.          I never saw a medical book.          Trust me, I have one.          Well if it's that important, why           didn't you keep it with the shot?Lance spins toward her.          I don't know! Stop bothering me!          While you're lookin' for it, that           girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're           never gonna find it in all this shit.            For six months now, I've been telling           you to clean this room –          – get your ass in here, fuck the           book!Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT heading for the living room.Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room.          Quit fuckin' around man and give her           the shot!Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.          While I'm doing this, take her shirt           off and find her heart.Vince rips her blouse open.Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.          Does it have to be exact?          Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving           her an injection in the heart, so I           gotta exactly hit her in the heart.          Well, I don't know exactly where her           heart is, I think it's here.Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and nods.          That's it.As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.          I need a big fat magic marker, got           one?          What?          I need a big fat magic marker, any           felt pen'll do, but a magic marker           would be great.          Hold on.Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.          It's ready, I'll tell you what to           do.          You're gonna give her the shot.          No, you're gonna give her the shot.          I've never does this before.          I've never done this before either,           and I ain't starting now. You brought           'er here, that means you give her           the shot. The day I bring an ODing           bitch to your place, then I gotta           give her the shot.Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand.          Got it.Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.          Okay, what do I do?          Well, you're giving her an injection           of adrenaline straight to her heart.           But she's got a breast plate in front           of her heart, so you gotta pierce           through that. So what you gotta do           is bring the needle down in a stabbing           motion.Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like The Shape killing its victims in HALLOWEEN.          I gotta stab her?          If you want the needle to pierce           through to her heart, you gotta stab           her hard.Then once you do, push down on the plunger.          What happens after that?          I'm curious about that myself.          This ain't a fuckin' joke man!          She's supposed to come out of it           like that.Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion.He looks down on Mia.Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.          Count to three.Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect.          One...RED DOT on Mia's body.Needle raised ready to strike.          ...two...Jody's face is alive with anticipation.NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.          ...three!The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the chest.Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline out through the needle.Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest – SCREAMING.Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of air.The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright.          If you're okay, say something.Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice.          Something.Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death Mia came.          Anybody want a beer?Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says anything, both are still too shaken.The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door.She turns around.Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big distance between the two.          What are your thoughts on how to           handle this?          What's yours?          Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus           can live his whole live and never           ever hear of this incident.Mia smiles.          Don't worry about it. If Marsellus           ever heard of this, I'd be in as           much trouble as you.          I seriously doubt that.          If you can keep a secret, so can I.          Let's shake on it.The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do.          Mum's the word.Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.Vincent smiles.          If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home           and have a heart attack.Mia giggles.Vincent turns to leave.          You still wanna hear my FOX FORCE           FIVE joke?Vincent turns around.          Sure, but I think I'm still a little           too petrified to laugh.          Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's           not funny. But if you still wanna           hear it, I'll tell it.          I can't wait.          Three tomatoes are walking down the           street, a poppa tomato, a momma           tomato, and a little baby tomato.           The baby tomato is lagging behind           the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa           tomato gets mad, goes over to the           momma tomato and stamps on him and says: catch up.They both smile, but neither laugh.          See ya 'round, Vince.Mia turns and walks inside her house.After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu START UP and DRIVE AWAY.FADE UP On the cartoon SPEED RACER.  Speed is giving a detailed description of all the features on his race car The Mac-5, which he does at the beginning of every episode.OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .          Butch.We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old boy.          Butch, stop watching TV a second. We           got a special visitor. Now do you           remember when I told you your daddy           dies in a P.O.W. camp?          Uh-huh.          Well this here is Capt. Koons. He           was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent.          Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard           a bunch about you. See, I was a good           friend of your Daddy's. We were in           that Hanoi pit of hell over five           years together.  Hopefully, you'll           never have to experience this           yourself, but when two men are in a           situation like me and your Daddy           were, for as long as we were, you           take on certain responsibilities of           the other. If it had been me who had           not made it, Major Coolidge would be           talkin' right now to my son Jim. But           the way it worked out is I'm talkin'           to you, Butch. I got somethin' for           ya.The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.          This watch I got here was first           purchased by your great-granddaddy.           It was bought during the First World           War in a little general store in           Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought           by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge           the day he set sail for Paris. It           was your great-granddaddy's war watch,           made by the first company to ever           make wrist watches. You see, up until           then, people just carried pocket           watches. Your great-granddaddy wore           that watch every day he was in the           war. Then when he had done his duty,           he went home to your great-          grandmother, took the watch off his           wrist and put it in an ol' coffee           can. And in that can it stayed 'til           your grandfather Dane Coolidge was           called upon by his country to go           overseas and fight the Germans once           again. This time they called it World           War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave           it to your granddad for good luck.            Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as           good as his old man's. Your granddad           was a Marine and he was killed with           all the other Marines at the battle           of Wake Island. Your granddad was           facing death and he knew it. None of           those boys had any illusions about           ever leavin' that island alive. So           three days before the Japanese took           the island, your 22-year old           grandfather asked a gunner on an Air           Force transport named Winocki, a man           he had never met before in his life,           to deliver to his infant son, who he           had never seen in the flesh, his           gold watch. Three days later, your           grandfather was dead. But Winocki           kept his word. After the war was           over, he paid a visit to your           grandmother, delivering to your infant           father, his Dad's gold watch. This           watch. This watch was on your Daddy's           wrist when he was shot down over           Hanoi. He was captured and put in a           Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew           if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd           be confiscated. The way your Daddy           looked at it, that watch was your           birthright. And he'd be damned if           and slopeheads were gonna put their           greasy yella hands on his boy's           birthright. So he hid it in the one           place he knew he could hide somethin'.           His ass. Five long years, he wore           this watch up his ass. Then when he           died of dysentery, he gave me the           watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk           of metal up my ass for two years.           Then, after seven years, I was sent           home to my family. And now, little           man, I give the watch to you.Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes into FRAME to accept it.The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.          It's time, Butch.          I'm ready.Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB outside.He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him COOLIDGE.The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for Butch.As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room.          Well Dan, that had to be the           bloodiest and, hands-down, the most           brutal fight this city has ever seen.The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from inside.          ...Coolidge was out of there faster           than I've ever seen a victorious           boxer vacate the ring. Do you think           he knew Willis was dead?          My guess would be yes, Richard. I           could see from my position here, the           frenzy in his eyes give way to the           realization of what he was doing. I           think any man would've left the ring           that fast.Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup.The Sportscasters continue their coverage.          Do you feel this ring death tragedy           will have an effect on the world of           boxing?          Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't           help but shake the world of boxing           to its very foundation. But it's of           paramount importance that during the           sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the           W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below.ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground.Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror:          Are you the man I was supposed to           pick up?          If you're the cab I called, I'm the           guy you're supposed to pick up.          Where to?          Outta here.The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.The meter is FLIPPED on.Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.          Mia. How you doin'?          Great. I never thanked you for the           dinner.In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – dead.His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.          What'cha got?          He booked.          I'm prepared to scour the earth for           this motherfucker. If Butch goes to           Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'           in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a           cap in his ass.          I'll take care of it.Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't find the roll bar.          Hey, how do I open the window back           here?          I have to do it.She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying the other one.Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.          Hey, mister?          What?          You were in that fight? The fight on           the radio – you're the fighter?As he tosses his other glove out the window.          Whatever gave you that idea?          No c'mon, you're him, I know you're           him, tell me you're him.          I'm him.          You killed the other boxing man.          He's dead?          The radio said he was dead.He finished wiping himself down.          Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.He tosses the towel out the window.Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.          What does it feel like?          What does what feel like?          Killing a man. Beating another man           to death with your bare hands.Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.          Are you some kinda weirdo?          No, it's a subject I have much           interest in. You are the first person           I ever met who has killed somebody.           So, what was it like to kill a man?          Tell ya what, you give me one of           them cigarettes, I'll give you an           answer.Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.          Deal!Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in it.Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.He takes a long drag.          So...He looks at her license.          ...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that           Mexican?          The name is Spanish, but I'm           Columbian.          It's a very pretty name.          It mean Esmarelda of the wolves.          That's one hell of a name you got           there, sister.          Thank you. And what is your name?          Butch.          Butch. What does it mean?          I'm an American, our names don't           mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,           what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?          I want to know what it feels like to           kill a man I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know           he was dead 'til you told me he was           dead. Now I know he's dead, do you           wanna know how I feel about it?Esmarelda nods her head: yes.          I don't feel the least little bit           bad.We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.          What'd I tell ya, soon as the word           got out a fix was in, the odds would           be outta control. Hey, if he was a           better fighter he's be alive. If he           never laced up his gloves in the           first place, which he never shoulda           done, he'd be alive. Enough about           the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's           talk about the rich and prosperous           Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you           spread it around with?          Eight? How long to collect?          So by tomorrow evening, you'll have           it all?          Good news Scotty, real good news – I           understand a few stragglers aside.           Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in           the morning. It should take us a           couple days to get into Knoxville.           Next time we see each other, it'll           be on Tennessee time.Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to take him wherever he wants to go.          Fabienne my love, our adventure           begins.Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.Handing her the money.          Merci beaucoup. And here's a little           something for the effort.Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out of reach.          Now if anybody should ask you about           who your fare was tonight, what're           you gonna tell 'em?          The truth. Three well-dressed,           slightly toasted, Mexicans.He gives her the bill.          Bon soir, Esmarelda.          Sleep well, Butch.He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She drives off.Butch enters and turns on the light.Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to           Keep the light off.Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.          Is that better, sugar pop?          Oui. Hard day at the office?          Pretty hard. I got into a fight.          Poor baby. Can we make spoons?Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk.          I was looking at myself in the mirror.          Uh-huh?          I wish I had a pot.          You were lookin' in the mirror and           you wish you had some pot?          A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are           sexy.          Well you should be happy, 'cause you           do.          Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!           I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna           when she did Lucky Star, it's not           the same thing.          I didn't realize there was a           difference between a tummy and a pot           belly.          The difference is huge.          You want me to have a pot?          No. Pot bellies make a man look either           oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a           woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The           rest of you is normal. Normal face,           normal legs, normal hips, normal           ass, but with a big, perfectly round           pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a           tee-shirt two sizes too small to           accentuate it.          You think guys would find that           attractive?          I don't give a damn what men find           attractive. It's unfortunate what we           find pleasing to the touch and           pleasing to the eye is seldom the           same.          If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in           it.          You'd punch me in my belly?          Right in the belly.          I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your           right on your face 'til you couldn't           breathe.          You'd do that to me?          Yes!          Did you get everything, sugar pop?          Yes, I did.          Good job.          I never listen to your fights. Were           you the winner?          I won alright.          Are you still retiring?          Really?! He won't be fighting no           more?!          So it all worked out in the finish?          We ain't at the finish, baby.Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.          We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?Butch nods his head: yes.          If they find us, they'll kill us,           won't they?Butch nods his head: yes.          But they won't find us, will they?Butch nods his head: no.          Do you still want me to go with you?Butch nods his head: yes.          I don't want to be a burden or a           nuisance -Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch.Fabienne reacts.Fabienne lies her head back.Butch continues to massage her crotch.          Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?Butch kisses her on the mouth.          Will you kiss it?She nods her head: yes.          But you first.Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.          Butch my love, the adventure begins.Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up.She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.          I think I cracked a rib.          Giving me oral pleasure?          No retard, from the fight.          Don't call me retard.          My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!          Shut up fuck head! I hate that           Mongoloid voice.          Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it           back!  Can I have a towel please,           Miss Beautiful Tulip.          Oh I like that, I like being called           a tulip. Tulip is much better than           Mongoloid.She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head.          I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I           called you a retard, but I took it           back.She hands him a towel.          Merci beaucoup.          Butch?          Yes, lemon pie.          Where are we going to go?          I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.           We're gonna get a lot of money from           this. But it ain't gonna be so much,           we can live like hogs in the fat           house forever. I was thinking we           could go somewhere in the South           Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll           carry us a long way down there.          So if we wanted, we could live in           Bora Bora?          You betcha. And if after awhile you           don't dig Bora Bora, then we can           move over to Tahiti or Mexico.          But I do not speak Spanish.          You don't speak Bora Boran either.          Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta           el zapataria?          What does that mean?          Where's the shoe store?          Donde esta el zapataria?          Excellent pronunciation. You'll be           my little mama ceta in no time.Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth.Butch keeps on from the other room.          Que hora es?          Que hora es?          What time is it?          What time is it?          Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something.          Butch.She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed.She looks at him for a moment.          Forget it.She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.FADE UP:SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep in bed.Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film THE LOSERS.Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him.His start startles Fabienne.          Merde! You startled me. Did you have           a bad dream?Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.          What are you watching?          A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the           name.          Are you watchin' it?Fabienne enters the room.          In a way. Why? Would you like for me           to switch it off?          Would you please?She reaches over and turns off the TV.          It's a little too early in the morning           for explosions and war.          What was it about?          How should I know, you were the one           watchin' it.Fabienne laughs.          No, imbecile, what was your dream           about?          Oh, I... don't remember. It's really           rare I remember a dream.          You just woke up from it.          Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I           don't remember.          Well, let's look at the grumpy man           in the morning. I didn't say you           were lying, it's just odd you don't           remember your dreams. I always           remember mine. Did you know you talk           in your sleep?          I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk           in my sleep?          You did last night.          What did I say?Laying on top of him.          I don't know. I couldn't understand           you.She kisses Butch.          Why don't you get up and we'll get           some breakfast at that breakfast           place with the pancakes.          One more kiss and I'll get up.Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.          Satisfied?          Yep.          Then get up, lazy bones.Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought.          What time is it?          Almost nine in the morning. What           time does our train arrive?          Eleven.          I'm gonna order a big plate of           blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,           eggs over easy, and five sausages.               (surprised at her                potential appetite)          Anything to drink with that?Butch is finished dressing.               (referring to his                clothes)          Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a           tall glass or orange juice and a           black cup of coffee. After that, I'm           going to have a slice of pie.As he goes through the suitcase.          Pie for breakfast?          Any time of the day is a good time           for pie. Blueberry pie to go with           the pancakes. And on top, a thin           slice of melted cheese –          – where's my watch?          It's there.          No, it's not. It's not here.          Have you looked?By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.          Yes I've fuckin' looked!!He's now throwing clothes.          What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!           Are you sure you got it?Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.          Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer           –          – on the little kangaroo.          Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.          Well it's not here!               (on the verge of tears)          Well it should be!          Oh it most definitely should be here,           but it's not. So where is it?Fabienne is crying and scared.Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing.          Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'           watch. You know what my father went           through to git me that watch?... I           don't wanna get into it right now...           but he went through a lot. Now all           this other shit, you coulda set on           fire, but I specifically reminded           you not to forget my father's watch.           Now think, did you get it?          I believe so...          You believe so? You either did, or           you didn't, now which one is it?          Then I did.          Are you sure?          No.Butch freaks out, he punches the air.Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.          No! It's not your fault.          You left it at the apartment.He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.He touches her hand, she flinches.          If you did leave it at the apartment,           it's not your fault. I had you bring           a bunch of stuff. I reminded you           about it, but I didn't illustrate           how personal the watch was to me. If           all I gave a fuck about was my watch,           I should've told you. You ain't a           mind reader.He kisses her hand. Then rises.Fabienne is still sniffling.Butch goes to the closet.          I'm sorry.Butch puts on his high school jacket.          Don't be. It just means I won't be           able to eat breakfast with you.          Why does it mean that?          Because I'm going back to my apartment           to get my watch.          Won't the gangsters be looking for           you there?          That's what I'm gonna find out. If           they are, and I don't think I can           handle it, I'll split.Rising from the floor.          I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,           I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.          Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing           you could ever do would make me           permanently angry at you.          I love you, remember?          Now here's some money, order those           pancakes and have a great breakfast.          Don't go.          I'll be back before you can say,           blueberry pie.          Blueberry pie.          Well maybe not that fast, but fast.           Okay?  Okay?          Okay.He kisses her once more and heads for the door.          Bye-bye, sugar pop.          Bye.          I'm gonna take your Honda.          Okay.And with that, he's out the door.Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street.          Of all the fuckin' things she coulda           forgot, she forgets my father's watch.           I specifically reminded her not to           forget it. Bedside table – on the           kangaroo. I said the words: Don't           forget my father's watch.The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it.A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour.Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door.Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out.Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name Teriyaki Donut and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears disturbed.Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.His apartment hasn't been touched.He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there.Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator.He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom.His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of Ring Magazine with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster.Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.          Holy shit.He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it.Then... a toilet FLUSHES.Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it.Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do.The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book MODESTY BLAISE by Peter O'Donnell.Vincent and Butch lock eyes.Vincent freezes.Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction.Neither man opens his mouth.Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.That's all the situation needed.Butch's finger HITS the trigger.MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated.Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter.Then he exits the apartment, quickly.Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard......comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street......goes through the alley......and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.Butch looks out the window at his former home.          That's how you're gonna beat 'em,           Butch.  They keep underestimatin'           ya.This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!DOUBLE-TAKE: Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal.The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk.Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.          Jesus, are you okay?Butch look at him, spaced-out.          I guess.Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body.          He's dead! He's dead!This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.          If you need a witness in court, I'll           be glad to help. He was a drunken           maniac. He hit you and crashed into           that car.          Who?          Him.Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.          Well, I'll be damned.The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.          Sacre bleu.Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming.          Oh my God, I've been shot!That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.Marsellus RUNS after him.The CROWD looks agape.Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP.of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world.          Can I help you wit' somethin'?          Shut up!Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.          Now you just wait one goddamn minute           –Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face.The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back.Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face.Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.          So you like chasing people, huh?He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.          Well guess what, big man, you caught           me –          – hold it right there, godammit!Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.          Look mister, this ain't any of your           business –          – I'm makin' it my business! Now           toss that gun!Butch does.          Now you on top, stand up and come to           the counter.Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone.Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.          Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just           caught a coupl'a flies.Marsellus passes out.They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors.Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in his belt.          Nobody kills anybody in my place of           business except me or Zed.A BUZZER buzzes.          That's Zed.Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them.WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store.Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:          You said you waited for me?          I did.          Then how come they're all beat up?          They did that to each other. They           was fightin' when they came in. This           one was gonna shoot that one.          You were gonna shoot him?Butch makes no reply.          Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front           of this place?          Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?          No, it's Thursday.          Then she'll be fine.          Bring out The Gimp.          I think The Gimp's sleepin'.          Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em           up then, won't you?Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.          Wake up!Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash.He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE GIMP.The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away.          Down!The Gimp gets on its knees.Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.          Who's first?          I ain't fer sure yet.Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent Eenie, meany, miney, moe...  just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.Butch are Marsellus are terrified.Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus.Zed stands up.          Wanna do it here?          Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old           room.Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room.Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.          Up!The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.          Keep an eye on this one.The Gimp bows its head: yes. Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:          Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight           in 'em!We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.          You wanna fight? You wanna fight?           Good, I like to fight!Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free.The Gimp is laughing wildly.The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:          That's it... that's it boy, you're           goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like           that... that's good.               (grunting faster)          Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!           Zed goddammit, git over here and           hold 'em!Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt.The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.          Huhng?The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.Butch sneaks to the door.On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus.Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with.He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for:A Samurai sword.It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword.Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.          Hey hillbilly.Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach.Butch's eyes follow Zed's.          You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.Zed studies Butch.Butch looks hard at Zed.Then a VOICE says:          Step aside, Butch.Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.KABOOM!!!!Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used shotgun shell.Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:          You okay?          Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from           okay!Long pause.          What now?          What now? Well let me tell you what           now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-          hittin' niggers, who'll go to work           on homes here with a pair of pliers           and a blow torch.               (to Zed)          Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I           ain't through with you by a damn           sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on           your ass.          I meant what now, between me and           you?          Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell           ya what now between me an' you. There           is no me an' you. Not no more.          So we're cool?          Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I           ask – two things I ask: Don't tell           nobody about this. This shit's between           me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-          the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-          agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It           ain't nobody else's business. Two:           leave town. Tonight. Right now. And           when you're gone, stay gone.  You've           lost your Los Angeles privileges.            Deal?          Deal.The two men shake hands, then hug one another.          Go on now, get your ass outta here.Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.          Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta           bit of a situation.Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name GRACE on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a Frankie says, Relax tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a BOOM BOX.Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named GRACE. He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.          Butch, I was so worried!          Honey, grab your radio and your purse           and let's go!          But what about all our bags?          Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train           if we don't split now.          Is everything well? Are we in danger?          We're cool. In fact, we're super-          cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait           for you outside.Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.          Where did you get this motorcycle?          It's a chopper, baby, hop on.Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.          What happened to my Honda?          Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.          You're hurt?          I might've broke my nose, no biggie.           Hop on.She doesn't move.Butch looks at her.          Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!Fabienne starts to cry.Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand.          I'm sorry, baby-love.              (crying)          You were gone so long, I started to           think dreadful thoughts.          I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.          Everything's fine. Hey, how was           breakfast?          It was good –          – did you get the blueberry pancakes?          No, they didn't have blueberry           pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –           are you sure you're okay?          Baby-love, from the moment I left           you, this has been without a doubt           the single weirdest day of my entire           life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about           it.Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.          Butch, whose motorcycle is this?          It's a chopper.          Whose chopper is this?          Zed's.          Who's Zed?          Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.          You ever read the Bible, Brett?                      BRETT (O.S.)          Yes!          There's a passage I got memorized,           seems appropriate for this situation:           Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the           righteous man is beset on all sides           by the inequities of the selfish and           the tyranny of evil men...We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.          ...blessed is he who, in the name           of charity and good will, shepherded           the weak through the valley of           darkness. And I will strike down           upon thee with great vengeance and           furious anger those who attempt to           poison and destroy my brothers. And           you will know I am the Lord when I           lay my vengeance upon you.BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door.Then he listens to them talk.          Friend of yours?          Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around is the way to go.The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his hand cannon.          Die... die... die... die...!DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion crosses his face.Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, Are we hit? They're as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.          I don't understand –The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off.Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.          Why the fuck didn't you tell us about           that guy in the bathroom? Slip your           mind?  Forget he was in there with a           goddamn hand cannon?          We should be fuckin' dead right now.               (pause)          Did you see that gun he fired at us?           It was bigger than him.          .357.          We should be fuckin' dead!          Yeah, we were lucky.Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.          That shit wasn't luck. That shit was           somethin' else.Vincent prepares to leave.          Yeah, maybe.          That was... divine intervention. You           know what divine intervention is?          Yeah, I think so. That means God           came down from Heaven and stopped           the bullets.          Yeah, man, that's what is means.           That's exactly what it means! God           came down from Heaven and stopped           the bullets.          I think we should be going now.          Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do           that!  Don't blow this shit off!           What just happened was a fuckin'           miracle!          Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit           happens.          Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just           happen.          Do you wanna continue this theological           discussion in the car, or at the           jailhouse with the cops?          We should be fuckin' dead now, my           friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,           and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge           it!          Okay man, it was a miracle, can we           leave now?Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and Marvin in the back.          ...Ever seen that show COPS?  I           was watchin' it once and this cop           was on it who was talkin' about this           time he got into this gun fight with           a guy in a hallway. He unloads on           this guy and he doesn't hit anything.           And these guys were in a hallway.           It's a freak, but it happens.          If you wanna play blind man, then go           walk with a Shepherd. But me, my           eyes are wide fuckin' open.          What the fuck does that mean?          That's it for me. For here on in,           you can consider my ass retired.          Jesus Christ!          Don't blaspheme!          Goddammit, Jules –          – I said don't do that –          – you're fuckin' freakin' out!          I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm           through.          While you're at it, be sure to tell           'im why.          Don't worry, I will.          I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he           laughs his ass off.          I don't give a damn if he does.Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his grip.          Marvin, what do you make of all this?                      MARVIN          I don't even have an opinion.          C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came           down from Heaven and stopped the           bullets?Vincent's .45 goes BANG!Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES blood and SHAKES.          What the fuck's happening?          I just accidentally shot Marvin in           the throat.          Why the fuck did you do that?          I didn't mean to do it. I said it           was an accident.          I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in           my time –          – chill out, man, it was an accident,           okay? You hit a bump or somethin'           and the gun went off.          The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'           bump!          Look! I didn't mean to shoot this           son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went           off, don't ask me how!          Look at this mess! We're drivin'           around on a city street in broad           daylight –          – I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'           about the splatter.          Well you better be thinkin' about it           now, motherfucker! We gotta get this           car off the road. Cops tend to notice           shit like you're driving a car           drenched in fuckin' blood.          Can't we just take it to a friendly           place?          This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus           don't got no friendly places in the           Valley.          Well, don't look at me, this is your           town, Jules.Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.          Who ya callin'?          A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.          Where's Toluca Lake.          On the other side of the hill, by           Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass           ain't home, I don't know what the           fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any           other partners in 818.               (into phone)          Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.               (pause)          Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are           in some serious shit. We're in a car           we gotta get off the road, pronto! I           need to use your garage for a couple           hours.Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him.          We gotta be real fuckin' delicate           with this Jimmie's situation. He's           one remark away from kickin' our           asses out the door.          If he kicks us out, whadda we do?          Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made           a couple phone calls. But I never           want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's           my friend and you don't bust in your           friend's house and start tellin' 'im           what's what.Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at the sink.          Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He           kinda freaked out back there when he           saw Marvin.          Put yourself in his position. It's           eight o'clock in the morning. He           just woke up, he wasn't prepared for           this shit. Don't forget who's doin'           who a favor.Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.          If the price of that favor is I gotta           take shit, he can stick his favor           straight up his ass.When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red.          What the fuck did you just do to his           towel?          I was just dryin' my hands.          You're supposed to wash 'em first.          You watched me wash 'em.          I watched you get 'em wet.          I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to           get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,           I coulda done a better job.          I used the same soap you did and           when I dried my hands, the towel           didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie           pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who           cares? But it's shit like this that's           gonna bring this situation to a boil.           If he were to come in here and see           that towel like that... I'm tellin'           you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause           if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie           on account of you... Look, I ain't           threatenin' you, I respect you an'           all, just don't put me in that           position.          Jules, you ask me nice like that, no           problem. He's your friend, you handle           him.Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.          Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious           gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda           been satisfied with freeze-dried           Tasters Choice. You spring this           gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What           flavor is this?          Knock it off, Julie.          What?          I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can           stop butterin' me up. I don't need           you to tell me how good my coffee           is. I'm the one who buys it, I know           how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie           goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy           the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause           when I drink it, I wanna taste it.           But what's on my mind at this moment           isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's           the dead nigger in my garage.          Jimmie –          – I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a           question, Jules. When you drove in           here, did you notice a sign out front           that said, Dead nigger storage?Jules starts to Jimmie him –          – answer to question. Did you see a           sign out in front of my house that           said, Dead nigger storage?          Naw man, I didn't.          You know why you didn't see that           sign?          Why?          'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my           fuckin' business!Jules starts to Jimmie him.          – I ain't through! Now don't you           understand that if Bonnie comes home           and finds a dead body in her house,           I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage           counselor, no trial separation –           fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna           get fuckin' divorced. The last time           me an' Bonnie talked about this shit           was gonna be the last time me an'           Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I           wanna help ya out Julie, I really           do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife           doin' it.          Jimmie –          – don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I           can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'           you can say that's gonna make me           forget I love my wife. Now she's           workin' the graveyard shift at the           hospital. She'll be comin' home in           less than an hour and a half. Make           your phone calls, talk to your people,           than get the fuck out of my house.          That's all we want. We don't wanna           fuck up your shit. We just need to           call our people to bring us in.          Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's           in my bedroom.Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.          ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya           think she'll do?               (pause)          No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That           ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,           I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.          You got to appreciate what an           explosive element this Bonnie           situation is. If she comes home from           a hard day's work and finds a bunch           of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'           shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'           what she's apt to do.          I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm           doin' is contemplating the ifs.          I don't wanna hear about no           motherfuckin' ifs.What I wanna           hear from your ass is: you ain't           got no problems, Jules. I'm on the           motherfucker. Go back in there, chill           them niggers out and wait for the           cavalry, which should be comin'           directly.          You ain't got no problems, Jules.           I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in           there, chill them niggers out and           wait for The Wolf, who should be           comin' directly.          You sendin' The Wolf?          Feel better?          Shit Negro, that's all you had to           say.The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.          Is she the hysterical type?          When she due?          Give me the principals' names again?          Jules...We SEE his book. The page has written on it:             1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)              Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)          ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...          Expect a call around 10:30. It's           about thirty minutes away. I'll be           there in ten.He hangs up. We never see his face.A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a dime in front of Jimmie's house.A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie.          You're Jimmie, right? This is your           house?          Yeah.          I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.          Good, 'cause we got one.          So I heard. May I come in?          Please do.In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.          You must be Jules, which would make           you Vincent. Let's get down to brass           tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed           correctly, the clock is ticking, is           that right, Jimmie?          Your wife, Bonnie...               (refers to his pad)          ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is           that correct?          Uh-huh.          I was led to believe if she comes           home and finds us here, she wouldn't           appreciate it none too much.          She won't at that.          That gives us forty minutes to get           the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you           do what I say when I say it, should           by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a           car, minus a head, in a garage. Take           me to it.The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it.          Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I           smelled some coffee in there. Would           you make me a cup?          Sure, how do you take it?          Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.          About the car, is there anything I           need to know? Does it stall, does it           make a lot of noise, does it smoke,           is there gas in it, anything?          Aside from how it looks, the car's           cool.          Positive?  Don't get me out on the           road and I find out the brake lights           don't work.          Hey man, as far as I know, the           motherfucker's tip-top.          Good enough, let's go back to the           kitchen.Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.          Thank you, Jimmie.He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action.          Okay first thing, you two.          Take the body, stick it in the trunk.           Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty           domesticated house. That would lead           me to believe that in the garage or           under the sink, you got a bunch of           cleansers and cleaners and shit like           that, am I correct?          Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.          Good. What I need you two fellas to           do is take those cleaning products           and clean the inside of the car. And           I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You           need to go in the backseat, scoop up           all those little pieces of brain and           skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe           down the upholstery – now when it           comes to upholstery, it don't need           to be spic and span, you don't need           to eat off it. Give it a good once           over. What you need to take care of           are the really messy parts. The pools           of blood that have collected, you           gotta soak that shit up.  But the           windows are a different story.  Them           you really clean. Get the Windex, do           a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to           raid your linen closet. I need           blankets, I need comforters, I need           quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker           the better, the darker the better.           No whites, can't use 'em. We need to           camouflage the interior of the car.           We're gonna line the front seat and           the backseat and the floor boards           with quilts and blankets. If a cop           stops us and starts stickin' his big           snout in the car, the subterfuge           won't last. But at a glance, the car           will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –           lead the way, boys – get to work.The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.          A please would be nice.The Wolf stops and turns around.          Come again?          I said a please would be nice.The Wolf takes a step toward him.          Set is straight, Buster. I'm not           here to say please.I'm here to           tell you want to do. And if self-          preservation is an instinct you           possess, you better fuckin' do it           and do it quick. I'm here to help.          If my help's not appreciated, lotsa           luck gentlemen.          It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your           help is definitely appreciated.          I don't mean any disrespect. I just           don't like people barkin' orders at           me.          If I'm curt with you, it's because           time is a factor. I think fast, I           talk fast, and I need you guys to           act fast if you want to get out of           this. So pretty please, with sugar           on top, clean the fuckin' car.Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has.The Wolf is on the phone.          It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.          White.          Nothin', except for the mess inside.          About twenty minutes.          Nobody who'll be missed.          You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.          How we comin', Jimmie?Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.          Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand           somethin' Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.          You gotta understand something,           Winston. I want to help you guys out           and all, but that's my best linen.           It was a wedding present from my           Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and           they ain't with us anymore let me ask you a question, if you           don't mind?          Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny           millionaires?          Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And           I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and           Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they           would've furnished you with a whole           bedroom set, which your Uncle           Marsellus is more than happy to do.          I like oak myself, that's what's in           my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,           you an oak man?          Oak's nice.Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain.Both are twice as bloody as they were before.          I will never forgive your ass for           this shit. This is some fucked-up           repugnant shit!          Did you ever hear the philosophy           that once a man admits he's wrong,           he's immediately forgiven for all           wrong-doings?          Man, get outta my face with that           shit! The motherfucker who said that           never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces           of skull with his fingers on account           of your dumb ass.          I got a threshold, Jules. I got a           threshold for the abuse I'll take.           And you're crossin' it. I'm a race           car and you got me in the red. Redline           7000, that's where you are. Just           know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be           drivin' a race car when it's in the           red. It could blow.          You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a           mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!            Every time my fingers touch brain           I'm SUPERFLY T.N.T, I'm the GUNS           OF NAVARONE. I'm what Jimmie Walker           usta talk about. In fact, what the           fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're           the motherfucker should be on brain           detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'           windows and you're pickin' up this           nigger's skull.The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle.The Wolf circles the car examining it.Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done.          Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out           of this yet.          I can't believe that's the same car.          Well, let's not start suckin' each           other's dicks quite yet. Phase one           is complete, clean the car, which           moves us right along to phase two,           clean you two.Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached.          All the way?          To your bare ass.As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.          Quickly gentlemen, we got about           fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-          half comes pulling into the driveway.          This morning air is some chilly shit.          Are you sure this is absolutely           necessary?          You know what you two look like?          What?          Like a couple of guys who just blew           off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'           off those bloody rags is absolutely           necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's           garbage bag.          Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid           like puttin' that out in front of           your house for Elmo the garbage man           to take away.          Don't worry, we're takin' it with           us. Jim, the soap.He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.          Okay gentlemen, you're both been to           County before, I'm sure. Here it           comes.He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.          Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!          Better you than me, gentlemen.The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.          Don't be afraid of the soap, spread           it around.The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.          Towel 'em.Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across their bodies.          You're dry enough, give 'em their           clothes.look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met.          Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've           planned this better. You guys look           like... what do they look like,           Jimmie?          Dorks. They look like a couple of           dorks.The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.          Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,           motherfucker.          I guess you just gotta know how to           wear them.          Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert           on wearin' dorky shit that your is.          C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and           jokin' our way into prison. Don't           make me beg.The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The Wolf SLAMS is closed.          Gentlemen, let's get our rules of           the road straight. We're going to a           place called Monster Joe's Truck and           Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter           Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.            The place is North Hollywood, so a           few twist and turns aside, we'll be           goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll           drive the tainted car. Jules, you           ride with me.  Vincent, you follow           in my Porsche. Now if we cross the           path of any John Q. Laws, nobody           does a fuckin' thing 'til I do           something.          What did I say?          Don't do shit unless –          – unless what?          Unless you do it first.          Spoken like a true prodigy.               (to Vincent)          How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you           keep your spurs from jingling and           jangling?          I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went           off, I dunno how.          Fair enough.               (he throws Vince his                car keys)          I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep           up. If I get my car back any different           than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna           be disposing of two bodies.EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNINGJules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.          We cool?          Like it never happened.Jules and Vincent bump fists.          Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all           this will be hers.          Hi. You know, if they ever do I           SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE, you guys,           I'd be great.  What's with the           outfits. You guys going to a           volleyball game?Winston laughs, the boys groan.          I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.           Maybe I can drop you two off. Where           do you live?          Redondo Beach.          Inglewood.Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a DEAD ZONE trance.          It's your future: I see... a cab           ride.          Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.          Say goodbye, Raquel.          Goodbye, Raquel.          I'll see you two around, and stay           outta trouble, you crazy kids.Winston turns to leave.He turns around.          I was a pleasure watchin' you work.The Wolf smiles.          Call me Winston.He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.          You hear that, young lady? Respect.           You could lean a lot from those two           fine specimens. Respect for one's           elders shows character.          I have character.          Just because you are a character           doesn't mean you have character.          Oh you're so funny, oh you're so           funny.The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.The two men left alone look at each other.          Wanna share a cab?          You know I could go for some           breakfast.  Want to have breakfast           with me?          Sure.Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,          Thanks a bunch.          Want a sausage?          Naw, I don't eat pork.          Are you Jewish?          I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig           on swine.          Why not?          They're filthy animals. I don't eat           filthy animals.          Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste           good.          A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin           pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if           it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy           motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in           shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't           wanna eat nothin' that ain't got           enough sense to disregard its own           feces.          How about dogs? Dogs eat their own           feces.          I don't eat dog either.          Yes, but do you consider a dog to be           a filthy animal?          I wouldn't go so far as to call a           dog filthy, but they're definitely           dirty. But a dog's got personality.           And personality goes a long way.          So by that rationale, if a pig had a           better personality, he's cease to be           a filthy animal?          We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one           motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd           have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.The two men laugh.          Good for you. Lighten up a little.           You been sittin' there all quiet.          I just been sittin' here thinkin'.          About what?          The miracle we witnessed.          The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed           a freak occurrence.          Do you know that a miracle is?          An act of God.          What's an act of God?          I guess it's when God makes the           impossible possible. And I'm sorry           Jules, but I don't think what happened           this morning qualifies.          Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't           matter. You're judging this thing           the wrong way. It's not about what.           It could be God stopped the bullets,           he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found           my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge           shit like this based on merit. Whether           or not what we experienced was an           according-to-Hoyle miracle is           insignificant. What is significant           is I felt God's touch, God got           involved.          But why?          That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I           don't know why. But I can't go back           to sleep.          So you're serious, you're really           gonna quit?          The life, most definitely.Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.          Garcon! Coffee!We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.          So if you're quitting the life,           what'll you do?          That's what I've been sitting here           contemplating. First, I'm gonna           deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,           basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.          What do you mean, walk the earth?          You know, like Caine in KUNG FU.           Just walk from town to town, meet           people, get in adventures.          How long do you intend to walk the           earth?          Until God puts me where he want me           to be.          What if he never does?          If it takes forever, I'll wait           forever.          So you decided to be a bum?          I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no           more, no less.          No Jules, you're gonna be like those           pieces of shit out there who beg for           change. They walk around like a bunch           of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in           garbage bins, they eat what I throw           away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got           a word for 'em, they're called bums.           And without a job, residence, or           legal tender, that's what you're           gonna be – a fuckin' bum!          Look my friend, this is just where           me and you differ –          – what happened was peculiar – no           doubt about it – but it wasn't water           into wine.          All shapes and sizes, Vince.          Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!          If you find my answers frightening,           Vincent, you should cease askin'           scary questions.          I gotta take a shit. To be continued.Vincent exits for the restroom.Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.          Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!          Any of you fuckin' pricks move and           I'll execute every one of you           motherfuckers!  Got that?!Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING IT.          Customers stay seated, waitresses on           the floor.          Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,           do it or fucking die!Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.          You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out           here!  Asta luego!Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.          On the floor or I'll cook you ass,           comprende?They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.          I'm the manager here, there's no           problem, no problem at all –Pumpkin heads his way.          You're gonna give me a problem?He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the Manager's neck.          What? You said you're gonna give me           a problem?          No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you           any problem!          I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks           like the hero type to me!          Don't take any chances. Execute him!The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.          Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm           just a coffee shop manager. Take           anything you want.          Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll           be all over.          Everybody just be calm and cooperate           with them and this will be all over           soon!          Well done, now git your fuckin' ass           on the ground.Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, reads his MODESTY BLAISE book.INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNINGCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.          Okay people, I'm going to go 'round           and collect your wallets. Don't talk,           just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table.Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.          In the bag.Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase.          What's in that?          My boss' dirty laundry.          You boss makes you do his laundry?          When he wants it clean.          Sounds like a shit job.          Funny, I've been thinkin' the same           thing.          Open it up.Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.          'Fraid I can't do that.Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer.          I didn't hear you.          Yes, you did.This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.          What's goin' on?          Looks like we got a vigilante in our           midst.          Shoot 'em in the face!          I don't mean to shatter your ego,           but this ain't the first time I've           had gun pointed at me.          You don't open up that case, it's           gonna be the last.          Quit causing problems, you'll get us           all killed! Give 'em what you got           and get 'em out of here.          Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat           man, this ain't any of your goddamn           business!          I'm countin' to three, and if your           hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna           unload right in your fuckin' face.           Clear? One...          ...two... three.          You win.Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.          It's all yours, Ringo.          Open it.Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit.          What is it? What is it?          Is that what I think it is?Jules nods his head: yes.          It's beautiful.Jules nods his head: yes.          Goddammit, what is it?Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case.Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin.Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.          Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow           your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!           I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're           gonna fuckin' die bad!               (to Pumpkin)          Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,           bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!          Chill out, honey!          Let him go!               (softly)          Tell her it's gonna be okay.          I'm gonna be okay.          Promise her.          I promise.          Tell her to chill.          Just chill out.          What's her name?          Yolanda.Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin.          So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna           do anything stupid, are we?          Don't you hurt him.          Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're           gonna be like three Fonzies. And           what' Fonzie like?No answer.          C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?          He's cool?          Correct-amundo! And that's what we're           gonna be, we're gonna be cool.               (to Pumpkin)          Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three           and I want you to let go your gun           and lay your palms flat on the table.           But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?Pumpkin looks at him.          One... two... three.Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.Yolanda can't stand it anymore.          Okay, now let him go!          Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be           cool.  When you yell at me, it makes           me nervous.  When I get nervous, I           get scared. And when motherfuckers           get scared, that's when motherfuckers           get accidentally shot.          Just know: you hurt him, you die.          That seems to be the situation. Now           I don't want that and you don't want           that and Ringo here don't want that.           So let's see what we can do.          Now this is the situation. Normally           both of your asses would be dead as           fuckin' fried chicken. But you           happened to pull this shit while I'm           in a transitional period. I don't           wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.           But I'm afraid I can't give you the           case. It don't belong to me. Besides,           I went through too much shit this           morning on account of this case to           just hand it over to your ass.          What the fuck's goin' on here?Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at Yolanda.          It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't           do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's           cool baby, nothin's changed. We're           still just talkin'.               (to Pumpkin)          Tell her we're still cool.          It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still           cool.          What the hell's goin' on, Jules?          Nothin' I can't handle. I want you           to just hang back and don't do shit           unless it's absolutely necessary.          Check.          Yolanda, how we doin, baby?          I gotta go pee! I want to go home.          Just hang in there, baby, you're           doing' great, Ringo's proud of you           and so am I.  It's almost over.          Now I want you to go in that bag and           find my wallet.          Which one is it?          It's the one that says Bad           Motherfucker on it.Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet with Bad Motherfucker embroidered on it.          That's my bad motherfucker. Now open           it up and take out the cash. How           much is there?          About fifteen hundred dollars.          Put it in your pocket, it's yours.           Now with the rest of them wallets           and the register, that makes this a           pretty successful little score.          Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen           hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on           general principle.          You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,           now hang back and shut the fuck up.           Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.           I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.           Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?          What?          Your life. I'm givin' you that money           so I don't hafta kill your ass. You           read the Bible?          Not regularly.          There's a passage I got memorized.           Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the           righteous man is beset on all sides           by the inequities of the selfish and           the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is           he who, in the name of charity and           good will, shepherds the weak through           the valley of the darkness. For he           is truly his brother's keeper and           the finder of lost children. And I           will strike down upon thee with great           vengeance and furious anger those           who attempt to poison and destroy my           brothers. And you will know I am the           Lord when I lay my vengeance upon           you. I been sayin' that shit for           years.  And if you ever heard it, it           meant your ass. I never really           questioned what it meant. I thought           it was just a coldblooded thing to           say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped           a cap in his ass. But I saw some           shit this mornin' made me think twice.           Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're           the evil man. And I'm the righteous           man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the           shepherd protecting my righteous ass           in the valley of darkness. Or is           could by you're the righteous man           and I'm the shepherd and it's the           world that's evil and selfish.  I'd           like that. But that shit ain't the           truth. The truth is you're the weak.           And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But           I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to           be a shepherd.Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.She looks back.Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door.Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee.          It's cold.He pushes it aside.Vincent appears next to Jules.          I think we oughta leave now.          That's probably a good idea.Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase.Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing UC Santa Cruz and I'm with Stupid tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word."],

		"Hello folks. So, we're going to Texas. We're going to the border. Just spoke with some of my friends in Arizona. We have tremendous support. The Republicans are extremely united. They all want to see something happen, but they're extremely united. And I don’t think I've ever seen unity like this in the Republican Party.",
		"The media, which I call the 'opposition party', a lot of the media, in coordination with the Democrats, they're not talking about the Democrats folding. For instance, this morning, a number of people came out and said, 'You do need very strong border security, and that includes a wall or whatever it is.' A number of Democrats said that, but people don’t like to report on it. We have tremendous unity in the Republican Party.",
		"It's really a beautiful thing to see. I don’t think there will be any breakaway because they know we need border security and we have to have it. And the only you're going to have border security -- there's only way: You can have all the technology in the world. I'm a professional at technology. But if you don’t have a steel barrier or a wall of some kind -- strong, powerful -- you're going to have human trafficking; you're going to have drugs pouring across the border; you're going to have MS-13 and the gangs coming in. And we've done record apprehensions.",
		"We're doing a great job. But we need help. If we have the wall, we could have far fewer people working in terms of border security, and doing an even better job. So if we had the wall, we could have a tremendous saving. I really believe the steel barrier, or wall, would pay for itself every three or four months, and maybe even better than that, in terms of overall.",
		"So that's it. Just a couple of things, because I knew the fake news likes to say it. When, during the campaign, I would say, 'Mexico is going to pay for it.' Obviously, I never said this and I never meant they're going to write out a check. I said, 'They're going to pay for it.' They are. They are paying for it with the incredible deal we made, called the United States, Mexico, and Canada USMCA deal.",
		"It's a trade deal. It has to be approved by Congress. It probably will be, other than maybe they even hold that up because they want to have -- you know, they want to do as much harm as they can, only because of the 2020 presidential election. So, Mexico is paying for the wall indirectly. And when I said Mexico will pay for the wall, in front of thousands and thousands of people, obviously they're not going to write a check.",
		"But they are paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over, by the really great trade deal we just made. Congress has to approve the deal.",
		"Are you going to go to Davos, or are you going to cancel it?",
		"Well, I intended to go and speak in front of the world financial community in Davos. That's still on. But if the shutdown continues, which is in a while from now, but if the shutdown continues, I won't go. I had planned to go. It's been very successful when I went. We have a great story to tell. We have the best job numbers we've ever had, in many ways.",
		"Certainly with African Americans, with Hispanic, with Asian Americans. And overall, we have the best job numbers in at least 50 years. We have a lot of great things happening. The economy is incredible. We're negotiating and having tremendous success with China. And I find China, frankly, in many ways, to be far more honorable than Cryin' Chuck and Nancy.",
		"I really do. I think that China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.",
		"Mr. President, given how the meeting went yesterday, are you now going to decide to declare a national emergency? Is that your only option left?",
		"I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. The lawyers have so advised me. I'm not prepared to do that yet. But if I have to, I will. I have no doubt about it; I will. I have the absolute right to declare. This was passed by Congress. So when you say, 'Was it passed by Congress?' It was. Other Presidents have used it. Some fairly often.",
		"I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. I haven’t done it yet. I may do it. If this doesn’t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.",
		"This is a national emergency.",
		"If it's a true national emergency, why haven’t you declared a national emergency already?",
		"Because I would like to do the deal through Congress, and because it makes sense to do it through Congress. But the easy route for me would have been call a national emergency and do it. And I will tell you, this is a tremendous crisis at the border. Look at President Obama's statements from the past. Numerous statements where he calls it a crisis.",
		"This is a crisis. You have human trafficking. You have drugs. You have criminals coming in. You have gangs, MS-13. We're taking them out by the thousand and bringing them back. This is a crisis. And they don’t come in at the checkpoint, which they do also, but they go in between the checkpoints, where you don’t have any barriers.",
		"So it's a national emergency. If this doesn’t work out, you're [Inaudible], but you will do it, or are you still thinking about it?",
		"If we don’t make a deal -- I mean, I would say 100 percent, but I don’t want to say 100 percent, because maybe something else comes up. But if we don’t make a deal, I would say it would be very surprising to me that I would not declare a national emergency and just fund it through the various mechanisms.",
		"And, by the way, there's more than one mechanism. There's various mechanisms. And the lawyers tell me 100 percent. It would be nice if we could make a deal. But dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal. It's -- we need -- and I'll tell you what: A lot of Democrats -- I was looking at numbers -- a lot of Democrats agree, Steve, we need national security.",
		"And the only way you have it -- the only way you have it is you have to have a strong border. And the only way you have a strong border is you need a wall, or you need some kind of a steel -- go ahead, Gardiner.",
		"You need a -- Steve, you need a steel barrier. And if you don’t have a steel barrier, or a concrete wall, forget it.",
		"I really believe this. The Democrats don't care about crime. They've been taken over by a group of young people who, frankly, in some cases -- I've been watching -- I actually think they're crazy. But they've been taken over by a group that is so far left. I really don't think they care about crime. And, you know, sadly, they're viewing this as the beginning of the 2020 presidential race, and that's okay with me. But they have been taken over by a group of people that don't care about gangs.",
		"My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.",
		"America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources, and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.",
		"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.",
		"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase.",
		"These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims -- by far -- of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.",
		"This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.",
		"These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission, and keep America safe -- in fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.",
		"Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes, so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.",
		"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.",
		"The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They change their mind only after I was elected president.",
		"Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.",
		"My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.",
		"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security. Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."

		"Twenty five years into the AIDS epidemic, it is an opportune moment, this World AIDS Day, for all of us to take stock and reflect on both our achievements and failures, make sense of what works and move forward boldly in dealing with its continuing devastating impact. Over the last quarter of a century twenty five million people have died as a result of AIDS, and today forty million people live with HIV. AIDS is an exceptional disease and requires an equally exceptional response. It requires ongoing leadership at international, national and indeed, at community level. We applaud the increased regional collaboration demonstrated by various bodies around the world. One of the greatest challenges we face is gaping – and growing - disparities in the response to HIV between countries and regions around the world. AIDS related stigma and discrimination is pervasive and a real barrier to stopping the expansion of this disease. The vast majority of the 40 million estimated people living with HIV are unaware of their status. Fear of being stigmatized is a great factor. It requires bold and visible action by top leadership - at all levels of society - to root out this deadly form of discrimination. It is evident, that as we contemplate the next 25 years of this epidemic, we should remind ourselves that AIDS remains very much a human rights issue. Let me reiterate: we have to act, we have act decisively and above all, we must work together. The answer to turning around the devastating impact of this epidemic lies within us. Thank you.",
		"In March 2001 I met President Kim Dae Jung to discuss the possibility that the very symbol of division on the Korean peninsula - the demilitarised zone - could serve as a bridge to closer relations and even maybe re-unification. I did so, not only because of the obvious advantages it would bring to the region, but specifically for the fact that such a step will enlarge the horizons of human hope and advance the prospects of peace and social justice in the rest of the world. President Kim Dae Jung reacted positively and encouraged me to continue the dialogue with his counterpart in North Korea, Kim Chong-il. Unfortunately no formal meeting could be arranged with the latter. What is it that I wanted them to do? I wanted them to consider the DMZ becoming a peace park - similar to what we were establishing in Southern Africa. Twenty-two peace parks cutting across international boundaries are being established in our region. A further 169 have been identified internationally covering 113 countries. I know of no political movement, no philosophy, no ideology and no religion that does not agree with the peace parks concept as we see it going into fruition today. It is truly a concept that can be embraced by all. We are grateful for the success of the concept in Southern Africa. At the same time one recognises certain similarities between Africa and the two Koreas. In 1884 Africa was dealt like a pack of cards to the colonial powers. The new national boundaries proclaimed in colonial times cut across tribal and clan groupings, across animal migration routes, fragmenting eco-systems and led to bio-diversity being destroyed. Because of the way the DMZ was set up, their bio-diversity has been remarkably protected, but not their people. And at what cost: millions of innocent compatriots, foreign friends and soldiers on both sides died. Surely it is now the time to establish the world’s most significant peace park - a park to literally embody peace between human and human, and peace between human beings and nature. Although I cannot be present at this conference where our dream for a peace park in the DMZ will be discussed between stakeholders, I want to assure you all of my personal support. I pray that you will find the energy and momentum, the decency and love for one another to make this dream come true. There is no reason to fear its implications.",
		"This is a very special month and period in South Africa. And because the international community contributed so much to bring about the special situation we are celebrating in our country we believe that this is also a special period for the world. We in South Africa are celebrating a decade of non-racial, non-sexist, non-discriminatory democracy. We went to the polls in our third democratic election just this past week. All of this stood in celebration of our democracy, based on the values of human dignity, the achievement of human equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms. Under the equality clause in our constitution’s bill of rights we affirm that, and I quote: The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. The constitution continues to affirm that no person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more of the grounds mentioned above. We have striven to give legislative and regulatory content to these founding precepts in our nation-building constitution. We have in this past decade progressed, slow as it may have been, towards living together in the acknowledgement of the basic equality and right to dignity of all human beings. We have tried to give special emphasis to the rights of people living with disability. It is so easy to think of equality demands with reference primarily to race, colour, religion and gender; and to forget, or to relegate to secondary importance, the vast discrimination against disabled persons. We cannot claim to reached anywhere near to where a society should be in terms of practical equality of the disabled. We continue to try. We realise that legislation and regulations are not sufficient or the end of the long walk to equality and non-discrimination. Education, raising of awareness, conscientisation, eradication of stigmatisation: these are key elements in achieving non-discrimination against the disabled in practice and in their everyday lives. A democracy is an order of social equality and non-discrimination. Our compatriots who are disabled challenge us in a very special way to manifest in real life those values of democracy. It is not a question of patronising philanthropy towards disabled people. They do not need the patronage of the non-disabled. It is not for them to adapt to the dominant and dominating world of the so-called non-disabled. It is for us to adapt our understanding of a common humanity; to learn of the richness of how human life is diverse; to recognise the presence of disability in our human midst as an enrichment of our diversity. Organisations like Scope help us to that greater understanding and I ask you to support Scope in its fight to end discrimination and to sign the equality pledge.",
		"It is a source of great pride to be present at this event and observe how we South Africans are striving in various fields to attain excellence and to perform in ways that are comparable to best practices and standards across the world. We are currently working on our memoirs dealing with the years leading up to our democratic elections and with the years of our first democratic government. This gives us occasion to revisit those years of transition and to be vividly reminded of how we as a nation were enthused with the excitement of that achievement and a sense of national excellence in the manner of our transition. We were confidently looking forward to build our new nation as a winning nation, proudly taking its place amongst the nations of the world, competing and excelling to the fullest of our national potential. The realities of the world in which we live have taught us the difficulties of always or immediately realising all those goals and objectives. Yet, eight years into our new democracy we can confidently say that South Africa retains the commitment to be a winning nation, to be recognised as globally competitive, to strive for excellence. We were amused and impressed to read in a recent newspaper article on South Africa's foreign policy achievements the comment that as a country we punch above our weight in the international arena. And that is what we would wish for every aspect of our national life. The realisation of those national objectives starts with each and every one of us as citizens and individuals. A nation's excellence resides in and is created by individuals and organisations and communities in that nation striving for excellence in whatever they do or are involved in. We often make the point that leadership is crucially important in achieving goals. Once more, we can refer to that so-called miracle of our political transition. If it was not for the courage and wisdom of political leaders from all parties and sectors of our society we would not have had the peaceful and orderly transition at the time it occurred. Amongst all communities there were those who for quite understandable reasons would have been opposed to such a negotiated settlement; it required the example set by leadership to persuade the various communities and formations and eventually the entire nation to choose that rational and winning route. Today as we set about the task of transforming, reconstructing and developing our society, leadership of excellence remains as important, becoming even more important. This emphasis on leadership's role does, however, not in any way mean that individuals and individual members of organisations can sit back and delegate the commitment to excellence to leaders. Another point we often make is that we are all leaders. In every single activity we are engaged in, we lead. The excellence with which we perform our task, no matter how small or even menial, sets an example and inspires others around us or in our team. The public service is a particular case in point. The South African government under the leadership of President Thabo Mbeki has consistently emphasised its commitment to excellence in public service and the President has been insisting upon such excellence from public servants, failing which he would act decisively and firmly. The same commitment is of course required from leaders in the private sector. Once more we should be seen to conform to the best practices of governance and business performance globally. We have much to be proud of and on which we can build. The management of our economy is universally recognised as being sound and exemplary. Amongst the emerging markets and in the developing world our economy is of the most sophisticated and our policies match that sophistication. Corporate governance compares with and even outstrips that of developed countries. Our constitutional order and our polity are advanced, progressive and stable. As already mentioned, we are a respected and significant presence on the stage of international affairs. On our continent we are prominent part of the leadership for the regeneration of Africa, its economies and political order. The challenge is to build on those foundations and to make sure that the excellence demonstrated in those large areas permeates every organisation and every activity in our national life. This will require from leaders in all of those sectors to set concrete and specific standards and criteria of excellence. It should be clear to every individual and member how that excellence can be achieved and how it is measured. And it will require of leaders themselves to be inspiring and visible demonstrations of excellence. We speak frequently about the fact that we live in a globalised world. The relevance of that for our quest for excellence is that we must be able to measure ourselves against global standards and benchmarks. There are many historical disadvantages suffered by people from the developing world; acknowledging that does not mean, however, that we should set lower standards for ourselves. The first value emphasised in the preamble to our Constitution is that of dignity. We establish and build our own dignity by insisting on only the best from ourselves. We congratulate you on this initiative and we have confidence that there are enough men and women of excellence in all sectors of our society to build ourselves into a truly winning nation. We congratulate the finalists and trust that they will go forward to even greater heights, in the process serving as role models and inspiration to others to follow them."

	"hitler": ["At a time when only deeds count and words are of little importance, it is not my intention to appear before you, the elected representatives of the German people, more often than absolutely necessary. The first time I spoke to you was at the outbreak of the war when, thanks to the Anglo-French conspiracy against peace, every attempt at an understanding with Poland, which otherwise would have been possible, had been frustrated. The most unscrupulous men of the present time had, as they admit today, decided as early as 1936 to involve the Reich, which in its peaceful work of reconstruction was becoming too powerful for them, in a new and bloody war and, if possible, to destroy it. They had finally succeeded in finding a State that was prepared for their interests and aims, and that State was Poland. All my endeavors to come to an understanding with Britain were wrecked by the determination of a small clique which, whether from motives of hate or for the sake of material gain, rejected every German proposal for an understanding due to their resolve, which they never concealed, to resort to war, whatever happened. The man behind this fanatical and diabolical plan to bring about war at whatever cost was Mr. Churchill. His associates were the men who now form the British Govern-ment. These endeavors received most powerful support, both openly and secretly, from the so-called great democracies on both sides of the Atlantic. At a time when the people were more and more dissatisfied with their deficient statesmanship, the responsible men over there believed that a successful war would be the most likely means of solving problems that otherwise would be beyond their power to solve. Behind these men there stood the great international Jewish financial interests that control the banks and the Stock Exchange as well as the armament industry. And now, just as before, they scented the opportunity of doing their unsavory business. And so, just as before, there was no scruple about sacrificing the blood of the peoples. That was the beginning of this war. A few weeks later the State that was the third country in Europe, Poland, but had been reckless enough to allow herself to be used for the financial interests of these warmongers, was annihilated and destroyed. In these circumstances I considered that I owed it to our German people and countless men and women in the opposite camps, who as individuals were as decent as they were innocent of blame, to make yet another appeal to the common sense and the conscience of these statesmen. On October 6, 1939, I therefore once more publicly stated that Germany had neither demanded nor intended to demand anything either from Britain or from France, that it was madness to continue the war and, above all, that the scourge of modern weapons of warfare, once they were brought into action, would inevitably ravage vast territories. But just as the appeal I made on September 1, 1939, proved to be in vain, this renewed appeal met with indignant rejection. The British and their Jewish capitalist backers could find no other explanation for this appeal, which I had made on humanitarian grounds, than the assumption of weakness on the part of Germany. They assured the people of Britain and France that Germany dreaded the clash to be expected in the spring of 1940 and was eager to make peace for fear of the annihilation that would then inevitably result. Already at that time the Norwegian Government, misled by the stubborn insistence of Mr. Churchill's false prophecies, began to toy with the idea of a British landing on their soil, thereby contributing to the destruction of Germany by permitting their harbors and Swedish iron ore fields to be seized. So sure were Mr. Churchill and Paul Reynaud of the success of their new scheme that finally, whether from sheer recklessness or perhaps under the influence of drink, they deemed it no longer necessary to make a secret of their intentions. It was thanks to these two gentlemen's tendency to gossip that the German Government at that time gained cognizance of the plans being made against the Reich. A few weeks later this danger to Germany was eliminated. One of the boldest deeds of arms in the whole history of warfare frustrated the attack of the British and French armies against the right flank of our line of defense. Immediately after the failure of these plans, increased pressure was exerted by the British warmongers upon Belgium and Holland. Now that the attack upon our sources for the supply of iron ore had proved unsuccessful, they aimed to advance the front to the Rhine by involving the Belgian and Dutch States and thus to threaten and paralyze our production centers for iron and steel. On May 10 of last year perhaps the most memorable struggle in all German history commenced. The enemy front was broken up in a few days and the stage was then set for the operation that culminated in the greatest battle of annihilation in the history of the world. Thus France collapsed, Belgium and Holland were already occupied, and the battered remnants of the British expeditionary force were driven from the European continent, leaving their arms behind. On July 19, 1940, I then convened the German Reichstag for the third time in order to render that great account which you all still remember. The meeting provided me with the opportunity of expressing the thanks of the nation to its soldiers in a form suited to the uniqueness of the event. Once again I seized the opportunity of urging the world to make peace. And what I foresaw and prophesied at that time happened. My offer of peace was misconstrued as a symptom of fear and cowardice. The European and American warmongers succeeded once again in befogging the sound common sense of the masses, who can never hope to profit from this war, by conjuring up false pictures of new hope. Thus, finally, under pressure of public opinion, as formed by their press, they once more managed to induce the nation to continue this struggle. Even my warnings against night bombings of the civilian population, as advocated by Mr. Churchill, were interpreted as a sign of German impotence. He, the most bloodthirsty or amateurish strategist that history has ever known, actually saw fit to believe that the reserve displayed for months by the German Air Force could be looked upon only as proof of their incapacity to fly by night. So this man for months ordered his paid scribblers to deceive the British people into believing that the Royal Air Force alone - and no others - was in a position to wage war in this way, and that thus ways and means had been found to force the Reich to its knees by the ruthless onslaught of the British Air Force on the German civilian population in conjunction with the starvation blockade. Again and again I uttered these warnings against this specific type of aerial warfare, and I did so for over three and a half months. That these warnings failed to impress Mr. Churchill does not surprise me in the least. For what does this man care for the lives of others? What does he care for culture or for architecture? When war broke out he stated clearly that he wanted to have his war, even though the cities of England might be reduced to ruins. So now he has got his war. My assurances that from a given moment every one of his bombs would be returned if necessary a hundredfold failed to induce this man to consider even for an instant the criminal nature of his action. He professes not to be in the least depressed and he even assures us that the British people, too, after such bombing raids, greeted him with a joyous serenity, causing him to return to London refreshed by his visits to the stricken areas. It is possible that this sight strengthened Mr. Churchill in his firm determination to continue the war in this way, and we are no less determined to continue to retaliate, if necessary, a hundred bombs for every one of his and to go on doing so until the British nation at last gets rid of this criminal and his methods. The appeal to forsake me, made to the German nation by this fool and his satellites on May Day, of all days, are only to be explained either as symptomatic of a paralytic disease or of a drunkard's ravings. His abnormal state of mind also gave birth to a decision to transform the Balkans into a theater of war. For over five years this man has been chasing around Europe like a madman in search of something that he could set on fire. Unfortunately, he again and again finds hirelings who open the gates of their country to this international incendiary. After he had succeeded in the course of the past winter in persuading the British people by a wave of false assertions and pretensions that the German Reich, exhausted by the campaign in the preceding months, was completely spent, he saw himself obliged, in order to prevent an awakening of the truth, to create a fresh conflagration in Europe. In so doing he returned to the project that had been in his mind as early as the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940. It was thought possible at the time to mobilize about 100 divisions in Britain's interest. The sudden collapse which we witnessed in May and June of the past year forced these plans to be abandoned for the moment. But by the autumn of last year Mr. Churchill began to tackle this problem once again. In the meantime, however, certain difficulties had arisen. As a result, Rumania, owing to internal changes, dropped out of England's political scheme. In dealing with these conditions, I shall begin by giving you a brief outline of the aims of Germany's policy in the Balkans. As in the past, the Reich never pursued any territorial or any other selfish political interest in the Balkans. In other words, the Reich has never taken the slightest interest in territorial problems and internal conditions in these States for any selfish reason whatsoever. On the other hand, the Reich has always endeavored to build up and to strengthen close economic ties with these States in particular. This, however, not only served the interests of the Reich but equally the interests of these countries themselves. If any two national economic systems ever effectively complemented one another, that is especially the case regarding the Balkan States and Germany. Germany is an industrial country and requires foodstuffs and raw materials. The Balkan States are agrarian countries and are short of these raw materials. At the same time, they require industrial products. It was therefore hardly surprising when Germany thus became the main business partner of the Balkan States. Nor was this in Germany's interest alone, but also in that of the Balkan peoples themselves. AND NONE BUT OUR JEW-RIDDEN DEMOCRACIES, WHICH CAN THINK ONLY IN TERMS OF CAPITALISM, CAN MAINTAIN THAT IF ONE STATE DELIVERS MACHINERY TO ANOTHER STATE IT THEREBY DOMINATES THAT OTHER STATE. IN ACTUAL FACT SUCH DOMINATION, IF IT OCCURS, CAN BE ONLY A RECIPROCAL DOMINATION. It is presumably easier to be without machinery than without food and raw materials. Consequently, the partner in need of raw material and foodstuffs would appear to be more tied down than the recipient of industrial products. IN THIS TRANSACTION THERE WAS NEITHER CONQUEROR NOR CONQUERED. THERE WERE ONLY PARTNERS. The German Reich of the National Socialist revolution has prided itself on being a fair and decent partner, offering in exchange high-quality products instead of worthless democratic paper money. For these reasons the Reich was interested in only one thing if, indeed, there was any question of political interest, namely, in seeing that internally the business partner was firmly established on a sound and healthy basis. THE APPLICATION OF THIS IDEA LED IN FACT NOT ONLY TO INCREASING PROSPERITY IN THESE COUNTRIES BUT ALSO TO THE BEGINNING OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE. All the greater, however, became the endeavor of that world incendiary, Churchill, to put an end to this peaceful development and by shamelessly imposing upon these States utterly worthless British guarantees and promises of assistance to introduce into this peaceable European territory elements of unrest, uncertainty, distrust and, finally, conflict. Originally, Rumania was first won over by these guarantees and later, of course, Greece. It has, meanwhile, probably been sufficiently demonstrated that he had absolutely no power of any kind to provide real help and that these guarantees were merely intended to rope these States in to follow the dangerous trend of filthy British politics. RUMANIA HAS HAD TO PAY BITTERLY FOR THE GUARANTEES, WHICH WERE CALCULATED TO ESTRANGE HER FROM THE AXIS POWERS. Greece, which least of all required such a guarantee, was offered her share to link her destiny to that of the country that provided her King with cash and orders. EVEN TODAY I FEEL THAT I MUST, AS I BELIEVE IN THE INTEREST OF HISTORICAL ACCURACY, DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE GREEK PEOPLE AND THAT THIN TOP LAYER OF CORRUPT LEADERS WHO, INSPIRED BY A KING WHO HAD NO EYES FOR THE DUTY OF TRUE LEADERSHIP, PREFERRED INSTEAD TO FURTHER THE AIMS OF BRITISH WAR POLITICS. To me this is a subject of profound regret. Germany, with the faint hope of still being able to contribute in some way to a solution of the problem, had not severed relations with Greece. But even then I was bound in duty to point out before the whole world that we would not tacitly allow a revival of the old Salonika scheme of the Great War. Unfortunately, my warning was not taken seriously enough. That we were determined, if the British tried to gain another foothold in Europe, to drive them back into the sea was not taken seriously enough. The result was that the British began in an increasing degree to establish bases for the formation of a new Salonika army. They began by laying out airdromes and by establishing the necessary ground organization in the firm conviction that the occupation of the airdromes themselves could afterward be carried out very speedily. Finally a continuous stream of transports brought equipment for an army which, according to Mr. Churchill's idea and plans, was to be landed in Greece. As I have said, already we were aware of this. For months we watched this entire strange procedure with attention, if with restraint. The reverses suffered by the Italian Army in North Africa, owing to a certain material inferiority of their tanks and anti-tank guns, finally led Mr. Churchill to believe that the time was ripe to transfer the theater of war from Libya to Greece. He ordered the transport of the remaining tanks and of the infantry division, composed mainly of Anzacs, and was convinced that he could now complete his scheme, which was to set the Balkans aflame. THUS DID MR. CHURCHILL COMMIT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRATEGIC BLUNDERS OF THIS WAR. As soon as there could be no further doubt regarding Britain's intentions of gaining a foothold in the Balkans, I took the necessary steps. Germany, by keeping pace with these moves, assembled the necessary forces for the purpose of counteracting any possible tricks of that gentleman. In this connection I must state categorically that this action was not directed against Greece. The Duce did not even request me to place one single German division at his disposal for this purpose. He was convinced that with the advent of good weather his stand against Greece would have been brought to a successful conclusion. I was of the same opinion. The concentration of German forces was therefore not made for the purpose of assisting the Italians against Greece. It was a precautionary measure against the British attempt under cover of the clamor caused by the Italo-Greek war to intrench themselves secretly in the Balkans in order to force the issue from that quarter on the model of the Salonika army during the World War, and, above all, to draw other elements into the whirlpool. This hope was founded principally on two States, namely, Turkey and Yugoslavia. But with these very States I have striven during the years since I came into power to establish close co-operation. The World War actually started from Belgrade. Nevertheless, the German people, who are by nature so ready to forgive and forget, felt no animosity toward that country. Turkey was our ally in the World War. The unfortunate outcome of that struggle weighed upon that country just as heavily as it did upon us. The great genius who created the new Turkey was the first to set a wonderful example of recovery to our allies whom fortune had at that time deserted and whom fate had dealt so terrible a blow. Whereas Turkey, thanks to the practical attitude of her leaders, preserved her independence in carrying out her own resolutions, Yugolsavia fell a victim to British intrigue. Most of you, especially my old Party comrades among you, know what efforts I have made to establish a straightforward understanding and indeed friendly relations between Germany and Yugoslavia. In pursuance of this aim Herr von Ribbentrop, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, submitted to the Yugoslav Government proposals that were so outstanding and so fair that at least even the Yugoslav State of that time seemed to become increasingly eager for such close co-operation. Germany had no intention of starting a war in the Balkans. On the contrary, it was our honest intention as far as possible to contribute to a settlement of the conflict with Greece by means that would be tolerable to the legitimate wishes of Italy. The Duce not only consented to but lent his full support to our efforts to bring Yugoslavia into a close community of interests with our peace aims. Thus it finally became possible to induce the Yugoslav Government to join the Threepower Pact, which made no demands whatever on Yugoslavia but only offered that country advantages. Thus on March 26 of this year a pact was signed in Vienna that offered the Yugoslav State the greatest future conceivable and could have assured peace for the Balkans. Believe me, gentlemen, on that day I left the beautiful city of the Danube truly happy not only because it seemed as though almost eight years of foreign policies had received their reward but also because I believed that perhaps at the last moment German intervention in the Balkans might not be necessary. We were all stunned by the news of that coup, carried through by a handful of bribed conspirators who had brought about the event that caused the British Prime Minister to declare in joyous words that at last he had something good to report. YOU WILL SURELY UNDERSTAND, GENTLEMEN, THAT WHEN I HEARD THIS I AT ONCE GAVE ORDERS TO ATTACK YUGOSLAVIA. To treat the, German Reich in this way is impossible. One cannot spent years in concluding a treaty that is in the interest of the other party merely to discover that this treaty has not only been broken overnight but also that it has been answered by the insulting of the representative of the German Reich, by the threatening of his military attache, by the injuring of the aide de camp of this attache, by the maltreating of numerous other Germans, by demolishing property, by laying waste the homes of German citizens and by terrorizing. GOD KNOWS THAT I WANTED PEACE. But I can do nothing but protect the interests of the Reich with those means which, thank God, are at our disposal. I made my decision at that moment all the more calmly because I knew that I was in accord with Bulgaria, who had always remained unshaken in her loyalty to the German Reich, and with the equally justified indignation of Hungary. Both of our old allies in the World War were bound to regard this action as a provocation emanating from the State that once before had set the whole of Europe on fire and had been guilty of the indescribable sufferings that befell Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria in consequence. The general directions of operations issued by me through the Supreme Command of the German forces on March 27 confronted the Army and the Air Force with a formidable task. By a mere turn of the hand an additional campaign had to be prepared. Units that had already arrived had to be moved about. Supplies of armaments had to be assured and the air force had to take over numerous improvised airports part of which were still under water. WITHOUT THE SYMPATHETIC ASSISTANCE OF HUNGARY AND THE EXTREMELY LOYAL ATTITUDE OF RUMANIA IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT MY ORDERS IN THE SHORT TIME ENVISAGED. I fixed April 6 as the day on which the attack was to begin. The main plan of operation was: First, to proceed with an army coming from Bulgaria against Thrace in Greece in the direction of the Aegean Sea. The main striking strength of this army lay in its right wing, which was to force a passage through to Salonika by using mountain divisions and a division of tanks; second, to thrust forward with a second army with the object of establishing connection as speedily as possible with the Italian forces advancing from Albania. These two operations were to begin on April 6. Third, a further operation, beginning on the eighth, provided for the break-through of an army from Bulgaria with the object of reaching the neighborhood of Belgrade. In conjunction with this, a German army corps was to occupy the Banat on the tenth. In connection with these operations general agreement had been made with our allies, Italy and Hungary. Agreements as to co-operation had also been reached between the two air forces. The command of the German Armies operating against Macedonia and Greece was placed in the hands of Field Marshal von List, who had already particularly distinguished himself in the previous campaigns. Once more and under the most exacting conditions he carried out the task confronting him in truly superior fashion. The forces advancing against Yugoslavia from the southwest and from Hungary were commanded by Col. Gen. von Weick. He, too, in a very short time with the forces under his command reached his objective. The Army and SS detachments operating under Field Marshal von Brauchitsch, as Commander in Chief, and the Chief of the General Staff, Col. Gen. Halder, forced the Greek Army in Thrace to capitulate after only five days, established contact with the Italian forces advancing from Albania, occupied Salonika, and thus generally prepared the way for the difficult and glorious break-through via Larissa to Athens. These operations were crowned by the occupation of the Peloponnesus and numerous Greek islands. A detailed appreciation of the achievements will be given by the German High Command. The Air Force under the personal command of Reich Marshal Goering was divided into two main groups, commanded by Col. Gen. Loehr and General von Richthofen. It was their task, first, to shatter the enemy air force and to smash its ground organization; second, to attack every important military objective in the conspirators' headquarters at Belgrade, thus eliminating it from the very outset; third, by every manner of active co-operation everywhere with the fighting German troops to break the enemy's resistance, to impede the enemy's flight, to prevent as far as possible his embarkation. The German armed forces have truly surpassed themselves in this campaign. There is only one way of characterizing that campaign: Nothing is impossible for the German soldier. Historical justice, however, obliges me to say that of the opponents that have taken up arms against us, MOST PARTICULARLY THE GREEK SOLDIERS, HAVE FOUGHT WITH THE GREATEST BRAVERY AND CONTEMPT OF DEATH. They only capitulated when further resistance became impossible and therefore useless. But I am now compelled to speak of the enemy who is the main cause of this conflict. As a German and as a soldier I consider it unworthy ever to revile a fallen enemy. But it seems to me to be necessary to defend the truth from the wild exaggerations of a man who as a soldier is a bad politician and as a politician is an equally bad soldier. Mr. Churchill, who started this struggle, is endeavoring, as with regard to Norway or Dunkerque, to say something that sooner or later might perhaps he twisted around to resemble success. I do not consider that honorable but in his case it is understandable. The gift Mr. Churchill possesses is the gift to lie with a pious expression on his face and to distort the truth until finally glorious victories are made out of the most terrible defeats. A British Army of 60,000 to 70,000 men landed in Greece. Before the catastrophe the same man maintained, moreover, that it consisted of 240,000 men. The object of this army was to attack Germany from the south, inflict a defeat upon her, and from this point as in 1918 turn the tide of the war. I prophesied more correctly than Mr. Churchill in my last speech, in which I announced that wherever the British might set foot on the Continent they would be attacked by us and driven into the sea. Now, with his brazen effrontery, he asserts that this war has cost us 75,000 lives. He causes his presumably not overintelligent fellow-countrymen to be informed by one of his paid creatures that the British, after having slain enormous masses of Germans, finally turned away from sheer abhorrence of the slaughter and, strictly speaking, withdrew for this reason alone. I will now present to you the results of this campaign in a few short figures. In the course of the operations against Yugoslavia there were the following numbers of purely Serbian prisoners, leaving out soldiers of German origin and some other groups, 6,198 officers, 313,864 men. The number of Greek prisoners, 8,000 officers and 210,000 men, has not the same significance. The number of Englishmen, New Zealanders and Australians taken prisoner exceeds 9,000 officers and men. The German share of the booty alone, according to the estimates at present available, amounts to more than half a million rifles, far more than 1,000 guns, many thousand machine-guns and anti-aircraft machine-guns, vehicles, and large amounts of ammunition. The losses of the German Army and the German Air Force as well as those of the SS troops in this campaign are the smallest that we have ever suffered so far. The German armed forces have in fighting against Yugoslavia and Greece as well as against the British in Greece lost: Army and SS Troops - Fifty-seven officers and 1,042 noncommissioned officers and men killed, 181 officers and 3,571 noncommissioned officers and men wounded, and 13 officers and 372 noncommissioned officers and men missing. Air Force - Ten officers and 42 noncommissioned officers and men killed and 36 officers and 104 noncommissioned officers and men missing. Once more I can only repeat that we feel the hardship of the sacrifice borne by the families concerned. The entire German nation expresses to them its heartfelt gratitude. Taking the measures as a whole, however, the losses suffered are so small that they constitute supreme justification, first, for the planning and timing of this campaign; second for the conduct of operations; third, for the manner in which they were carried through. The training of our officers is excellent beyond comparison The high standard of efficiency of our soldiers, the superiority of our equipment, the quality of our munitions and the indomitable courage of all ranks have combined to lead at such small sacrifice to a success of truly decisive historical importance. Churchill, one of the most hopeless dabblers in.strategy, thus managed to lose two theaters of war at one single blow. The fact that this man, who in any other country would be court-martialed, gained fresh admiration as Prime Minister cannot be construed as an expression of magnanimity such as was accorded by Roman senators to generals honorably defeated in battle. It is merely proof of that perpetual blindness with which the gods afflict those whom they are about to destroy. The consequences of this campaign are extraordinary. In view of the fact that a small set of conspirators in Belgrade again were able to foment trouble in the service of extracontinental interests, the radical elimination of this danger means the removal of an element of tension for the whole of Europe. The Danube as an important waterway is thus safeguarded against any further act of sabotage. Traffic has been resumed in full. Apart from the modest correction of its frontiers, which were infringed as a result of the outcome of the World War, the Reich has no special territorial interests in these parts. As far as politics are concerned we are merely interested in safeguarding peace in this region, while in the realm of economics we wish to see an order that will allow the production of goods to be developed and the exchange of products to be resumed in the interests of all. It is, however, only in accordance with supreme justice if those interests are also taken into account that are founded upon ethnographical, historical, or economic conditions. I can assure you that I look into the future with perfect tranquillity and great confidence. The German Reich and its allies represent power, military, economic and, above all, in moral respects, which is superior to any possible coalition in the world. The German armed forces will always do their part whenever it may be necessary. The confidence of the German people will always accompany their soldiers.At a time when only deeds count and words are of little importance, it is not my intention to appear before you, the elected representatives of the German people, more often than absolutely necessary. The first time I spoke to you was at the outbreak of the war when, thanks to the Anglo-French conspiracy against peace, every attempt at an understanding with Poland, which otherwise would have been possible, had been frustrated.

It is possible that this sight strengthened Mr. Churchill in his firm determination to continue the war in this way, and we are no less determined to continue to retaliate, if necessary, a hundred bombs for every one of his and to go on doing so until the British nation at last gets rid of this criminal and his methods. The appeal to forsake me, made to the German nation by this fool and his satellites on May Day, of all days, are only to be explained either as symptomatic of a paralytic disease or of a drunkard's ravings. His abnormal state of mind also gave birth to a decision to transform the Balkans into a theater of war. For over five years this man has been chasing around Europe like a madman in search of something that he could set on fire. Unfortunately, he again and again finds hirelings who open the gates of their country to this international incendiary. After he had succeeded in the course of the past winter in persuading the British people by a wave of false assertions and pretensions that the German Reich, exhausted by the campaign in the preceding months, was completely spent, he saw himself obliged, in order to prevent an awakening of the truth, to create a fresh conflagration in Europe. In so doing he returned to the project that had been in his mind as early as the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940. It was thought possible at the time to mobilize about 100 divisions in Britain's interest. The sudden collapse which we witnessed in May and June of the past year forced these plans to be abandoned for the moment. But by the autumn of last year Mr. Churchill began to tackle this problem once again. In the meantime, however, certain difficulties had arisen. As a result, Rumania, owing to internal changes, dropped out of England's political scheme. In dealing with these conditions, I shall begin by giving you a brief outline of the aims of Germany's policy in the Balkans. As in the past, the Reich never pursued any territorial or any other selfish political interest in the Balkans. In other words, the Reich has never taken the slightest interest in territorial problems and internal conditions in these States for any selfish reason whatsoever. On the other hand, the Reich has always endeavored to build up and to strengthen close economic ties with these States in particular. This, however, not only served the interests of the Reich but equally the interests of these countries themselves. If any two national economic systems ever effectively complemented one another, that is especially the case regarding the Balkan States and Germany. Germany is an industrial country and requires foodstuffs and raw materials. The Balkan States are agrarian countries and are short of these raw materials. At the same time, they require industrial products. It was therefore hardly surprising when Germany thus became the main business partner of the Balkan States. Nor was this in Germany's interest alone, but also in that of the Balkan peoples themselves. AND NONE BUT OUR JEW-RIDDEN DEMOCRACIES, WHICH CAN THINK ONLY IN TERMS OF CAPITALISM, CAN MAINTAIN THAT IF ONE STATE DELIVERS MACHINERY TO ANOTHER STATE IT THEREBY DOMINATES THAT OTHER STATE. IN ACTUAL FACT SUCH DOMINATION, IF IT OCCURS, CAN BE ONLY A RECIPROCAL DOMINATION. It is presumably easier to be without machinery than without food and raw materials. Consequently, the partner in need of raw material and foodstuffs would appear to be more tied down than the recipient of industrial products. IN THIS TRANSACTION THERE WAS NEITHER CONQUEROR NOR CONQUERED. THERE WERE ONLY PARTNERS. The German Reich of the National Socialist revolution has prided itself on being a fair and decent partner, offering in exchange high-quality products instead of worthless democratic paper money. For these reasons the Reich was interested in only one thing if, indeed, there was any question of political interest, namely, in seeing that internally the business partner was firmly established on a sound and healthy basis. THE APPLICATION OF THIS IDEA LED IN FACT NOT ONLY TO INCREASING PROSPERITY IN THESE COUNTRIES BUT ALSO TO THE BEGINNING OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE. All the greater, however, became the endeavor of that world incendiary, Churchill, to put an end to this peaceful development and by shamelessly imposing upon these States utterly worthless British guarantees and promises of assistance to introduce into this peaceable European territory elements of unrest, uncertainty, distrust and, finally, conflict. Originally, Rumania was first won over by these guarantees and later, of course, Greece. It has, meanwhile, probably been sufficiently demonstrated that he had absolutely no power of any kind to provide real help and that these guarantees were merely intended to rope these States in to follow the dangerous trend of filthy British politics. RUMANIA HAS HAD TO PAY BITTERLY FOR THE GUARANTEES, WHICH WERE CALCULATED TO ESTRANGE HER FROM THE AXIS POWERS. Greece, which least of all required such a guarantee, was offered her share to link her destiny to that of the country that provided her King with cash and orders. EVEN TODAY I FEEL THAT I MUST, AS I BELIEVE IN THE INTEREST OF HISTORICAL ACCURACY, DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE GREEK PEOPLE AND THAT THIN TOP LAYER OF CORRUPT LEADERS WHO, INSPIRED BY A KING WHO HAD NO EYES FOR THE DUTY OF TRUE LEADERSHIP, PREFERRED INSTEAD TO FURTHER THE AIMS OF BRITISH WAR POLITICS. To me this is a subject of profound regret. Germany, with the faint hope of still being able to contribute in some way to a solution of the problem, had not severed relations with Greece. But even then I was bound in duty to point out before the whole world that we would not tacitly allow a revival of the old Salonika scheme of the Great War. Unfortunately, my warning was not taken seriously enough. That we were determined, if the British tried to gain another foothold in Europe, to drive them back into the sea was not taken seriously enough. The result was that the British began in an increasing degree to establish bases for the formation of a new Salonika army. They began by laying out airdromes and by establishing the necessary ground organization in the firm conviction that the occupation of the airdromes themselves could afterward be carried out very speedily. Finally a continuous stream of transports brought equipment for an army which, according to Mr. Churchill's idea and plans, was to be landed in Greece. As I have said, already we were aware of this. For months we watched this entire strange procedure with attention, if with restraint. The reverses suffered by the Italian Army in North Africa, owing to a certain material inferiority of their tanks and anti-tank guns, finally led Mr. Churchill to believe that the time was ripe to transfer the theater of war from Libya to Greece. He ordered the transport of the remaining tanks and of the infantry division, composed mainly of Anzacs, and was convinced that he could now complete his scheme, which was to set the Balkans aflame. THUS DID MR. CHURCHILL COMMIT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRATEGIC BLUNDERS OF THIS WAR. As soon as there could be no further doubt regarding Britain's intentions of gaining a foothold in the Balkans, I took the necessary steps. Germany, by keeping pace with these moves, assembled the necessary forces for the purpose of counteracting any possible tricks of that gentleman. In this connection I must state categorically that this action was not directed against Greece. The Duce did not even request me to place one single German division at his disposal for this purpose. He was convinced that with the advent of good weather his stand against Greece would have been brought to a successful conclusion. I was of the same opinion. The concentration of German forces was therefore not made for the purpose of assisting the Italians against Greece. It was a precautionary measure against the British attempt under cover of the clamor caused by the Italo-Greek war to intrench themselves secretly in the Balkans in order to force the issue from that quarter on the model of the Salonika army during the World War, and, above all, to draw other elements into the whirlpool. This hope was founded principally on two States, namely, Turkey and Yugoslavia. But with these very States I have striven during the years since I came into power to establish close co-operation. The World War actually started from Belgrade. Nevertheless, the German people, who are by nature so ready to forgive and forget, felt no animosity toward that country. Turkey was our ally in the World War. The unfortunate outcome of that struggle weighed upon that country just as heavily as it did upon us. The great genius who created the new Turkey was the first to set a wonderful example of recovery to our allies whom fortune had at that time deserted and whom fate had dealt so terrible a blow. Whereas Turkey, thanks to the practical attitude of her leaders, preserved her independence in carrying out her own resolutions, Yugolsavia fell a victim to British intrigue. Most of you, especially my old Party comrades among you, know what efforts I have made to establish a straightforward understanding and indeed friendly relations between Germany and Yugoslavia. In pursuance of this aim Herr von Ribbentrop, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, submitted to the Yugoslav Government proposals that were so outstanding and so fair that at least even the Yugoslav State of that time seemed to become increasingly eager for such close co-operation. Germany had no intention of starting a war in the Balkans. On the contrary, it was our honest intention as far as possible to contribute to a settlement of the conflict with Greece by means that would be tolerable to the legitimate wishes of Italy. The Duce not only consented to but lent his full support to our efforts to bring Yugoslavia into a close community of interests with our peace aims. Thus it finally became possible to induce the Yugoslav Government to join the Threepower Pact, which made no demands whatever on Yugoslavia but only offered that country advantages. Thus on March 26 of this year a pact was signed in Vienna that offered the Yugoslav State the greatest future conceivable and could have assured peace for the Balkans. Believe me, gentlemen, on that day I left the beautiful city of the Danube truly happy not only because it seemed as though almost eight years of foreign policies had received their reward but also because I believed that perhaps at the last moment German intervention in the Balkans might not be necessary. We were all stunned by the news of that coup, carried through by a handful of bribed conspirators who had brought about the event that caused the British Prime Minister to declare in joyous words that at last he had something good to report. Army and SS Troops - Fifty-seven officers and 1,042 noncommissioned officers and men killed, 181 officers and 3,571 noncommissioned officers and men wounded, and 13 officers and 372 noncommissioned officers and men missing. Air Force - Ten officers and 42 noncommissioned officers and men killed and 36 officers and 104 noncommissioned officers and men missing. Once more I can only repeat that we feel the hardship of the sacrifice borne by the families concerned. The entire German nation expresses to them its heartfelt gratitude. Taking the measures as a whole, however, the losses suffered are so small that they constitute supreme justification, first, for the planning and timing of this campaign; second for the conduct of operations; third, for the manner in which they were carried through. The training of our officers is excellent beyond comparison The high standard of efficiency of our soldiers, the superiority of our equipment, the quality of our munitions and the indomitable courage of all ranks have combined to lead at such small sacrifice to a success of truly decisive historical importance. Churchill, one of the most hopeless dabblers in.strategy, thus managed to lose two theaters of war at one single blow. The fact that this man, who in any other country would be court-martialed, gained fresh admiration as Prime Minister cannot be construed as an expression of magnanimity such as was accorded by Roman senators to generals honorably defeated in battle. It is merely proof of that perpetual blindness with which the gods afflict those whom they are about to destroy. The consequences of this campaign are extraordinary. In view of the fact that a small set of conspirators in Belgrade again were able to foment trouble in the service of extracontinental interests, the radical elimination of this danger means the removal of an element of tension for the whole of Europe. The Danube as an important waterway is thus safeguarded against any further act of sabotage. Traffic has been resumed in full. Apart from the modest correction of its frontiers, which were infringed as a result of the outcome of the World War, the Reich has no special territorial interests in these parts. As far as politics are concerned we are merely interested in safeguarding peace in this region, while in the realm of economics we wish to see an order that will allow the production of goods to be developed and the exchange of products to be resumed in the interests of all. It is, however, only in accordance with supreme justice if those interests are also taken into account that are founded upon ethnographical, historical, or economic conditions. I can assure you that I look into the future with perfect tranquillity and great confidence. The German Reich and its allies represent power, military, economic and, above all, in moral respects, which is superior to any possible coalition in the world. The German armed forces will always do their part whenever it may be necessary. The confidence of the German people will always accompany their soldiers."
