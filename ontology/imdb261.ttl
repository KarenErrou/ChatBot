	schema:reviewBody "This is a very humanistic film. It shows the bravery suffering humor and strength of both men and women who were defending an island in the Phillipines called Corregidor in the first five months of World War II. I think it was meant to be a tribute to those men and women and I think it works as a tribute. Unfortunately the DVD copy as most reviewers have mentioned is not very good. I am not sure if the problem is in the print used or the transfer. It is possible that the print had faded so there was little that could have been done. It would be nice to see a good print if one exists with a good transfer.The movie is a little bit of everything some light romantic scenes some comradely kidding scenes some strong gutsy speeches and a lot of battle action. Hanging over these elements and keeping them from being enjoyable is the notion that this was ultimately a hard military defeat. Surprisingly an almost equal number of Americans and Japanese are seen dying in the battles.When this film was made in 1943 the war still going on. Corregidor was only recaptured in 1945. 800 Americans were killed and some 11000 American and Philipinos were still prisoners of war when the film was made. The Japanese lost 900 men. A simple operation that was supposed to take only a few weeks ended up taking them five months. The time and manpower they lost was crucial and hoped set up the defeats the Japanese suffered in the next few months of the war. This is actually a much grittier more heartfelt and less romantic view of this battle than the popular John FordJohn Wayne movie made about it two years later They Were Expendable. That was a satisfying Hollywood movie that was more of a celebration than a tribute. There is little in that film of the gloomy atmosphere that appears in this film.The script by Doris Malloy and great lowbudget filmmaker Edgar Ulmer is fine. Direction by veteran director William Nigh this was number 106 out 120 films is crisp. The battles in the second half of the film do seem to dominate the human characters. None of the battles are spectacular and they become a bit monotonous and even boring. Perhaps that is better than the glamorous and exciting battles that one so often finds in Hollywood war movies. It gives the film a somber rather than a GungHo tone and message. This is not a great movie but it is a good one worth watching even on a DVD copy of a bad print.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers A bit more accurate then the usual war movie that was cranked out of the Hollowwood studios during the Second World War. Corregidor honestly portrays the heroic US and Phillipino siege of the island fortress known as The Rock. Corregidor held off massive Japanese attacks from land sea and air from the time that Battan fell on April 9 1942 to it's eventually surrender to the Japanese imperial forces on May 6 1942 a total of 28 days. The movie starts on December 6 1941 at Manoi in the Phillippines with Dr. Royce lee coming to the islands with her livein maid Hyacinth Ruby Dandridge from New York City. Royce meets her long and forgotten on his part love Dr. Jan Stockman Otto Kruger and in less then 24 hours the two lovebirds get married. After The Wedding December 71941the Japanese air force strikes the wedding party as well as all the US bases in the Pacific West of Hawaii notably Perl Harbor getting the USA into WWII. The surprise Japanese attack Kills the presiding priest Frank Jaquet as well as Hyacinth among other guests at the ceremony. Going north away from the advancing Japanese army the two Jan  Joyce link up with a group of US soldiers and travel through the jungle and over the waters of Minila Bay to the island of Corregidor for the US army's last stand against the Japanese. We then have a really schmaltzy love triangle between Jan Joyce and an old flame of her's back from her medical school days in New York US Army Dr. Michael Donald Woods. Dr. Michael dumped Joyce back then when she being a blue blood and having lots of the green stuff rented an office for Dr. Michael's medical practice on the fancy and prestigious New York's Park Ave. The guy could have evened things out by not charging fees to his clients for his services if he had such a violent dislike for making money. While on the island we also have another war love story between US Army nurse HeyDutch Van Doren Wanda McKay and her US Army boyfriend Cpl. Pinky he's called Pinky that's because he'll so large Mason Rick Villin. Both Pinky  HeyDutch end up getting killed in the fighting. HeyDutch from a Japanese aerial bombardment and Pinky from being machine gunned by a Japanese Zero fighter plane that he also shot down from his tailgunner position on the last plane out of Corregidor.On the island Jan changes his mind about getting married to Joyce this after three short months and dumps her like Dr. Michael did back into Dr. Michael's lap. Jan also solves the problem of Joyce being torn and divided between him and Dr. Michael by having himself get killed by a Japanese bombardment. Leaving Joyce free to marry Dr. Michael but even that didn't go too well with Joyce being forced to leave the island as Dr. Michael stayed behind to be either killed or captured by the invading Japaneses troops. I found the love triangle and love storybetween Jan  Joyce  Dr. Michael as well as Pinky and HeyDutch far more interesting the the battle action scenes themselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently distributed in DVD this movie was a disappointment. It takes a unique tact to bring noncombatants into a war film an idea that should have been a basis for a great story. The missionary doctor and the brave bride hardly get any character development throughout the film. The story is one of a dedicated missionary doctor in the Philippines who is surprised by the arrival of a former lover. On 6 December 1941 she has followed the missionary doctor to marry him. He is surprised as he had disregarded the letter being busy in his research.  But her real love is an Army doctor currently stationed at Corrigidor. The Japanese attack happens at the close of the wedding ceremony. That begins a 600 miles journey through the jungle with terribly directed combat scenes and with poorly dramatized suffering. Although we expect some period gloss over suffering and combat the scenes are very poorly presented. At Corrigidor the battle progresses the three friendslovers are reunited and the devastating losses mount. I'll leave the ending to the viewer but it is convincing neither in tone nor emotion. In 1943 there were probably not many technical advisers on the last scenes at Corrigidor but suffice it to say the last departees were not leaving on C47s. I appreciate period pieces and allow for the oversights glamorization of the 1940's scripts and productions. And the patriotic message was both expected and deserved by the men and women who struggled on Corrigidor and throughout the Philippines. But this is just poorly done and loses all its punch. Too bad for a potentially great story line in an honestly heroic setting. Having visited Corrigidor I was hopeful for a powerful though period based piece. The film was disappointing on all counts.".

This movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to do.An attempt is made to show the fall of Corregidor but somebody wanted to add an element of a love triangle. It didn't work then and it didn't work for Pearl Harbor. At least Pearl took a lot of time to try to make both sides work. Corregidor didn't even bother to make one side work. I cared more about Hey Dutch and Pinky than I cared about any of the three main characters.Add in really lousy stock footage of various US planes being passed off as Japanese planes and this thing screams mass production. It also whispers silent movie like the one part where the Doc goes in to do some surgery and there's no more gloves. It's all pantomimed like a silent. Except this is 1943! If this had been made in the 30s I could forgive a lot of the flaws but this pig was made well into the 40s and there's just no excuse other than being a cheap knock off. Frankly I find it insulting to the men and women of Corregidor. It should have a real remake except most everybody that was there is probably dead by now so all you'd get is more Hollyworld hogwash.210".

Instead of hundreds of thousands of troops you might see a dozen or so. And instead of modern equipment they use a lot of stock footagethough at least many of the planes are actually Japanese unlike many other US films which used Dauntless or Texan aircraft and tried to pass them off as Japanese Mitsubishi fighters. I say many because sometimes the clips are all wrong...but at least they're more right than wrong! As for the backgrounds they are VERY cheap and the jungle set is almost laughably bad.The story involves a couple of doctors who one minute are going to break up and the next they get married. Soon their honeymoon turns crap when the Japanese attack...and they spend the rest of the film trying to survive. She's really in love with another guyso you can guess where it goes next. Otto Kruger Donald Woods and Elissa Landi are fine in the movie though the trio aren't exactly leading stars especially Landi...which isn't surprising with an Atlantis film. They simply couldn't afford a Clark Gable Jimmy Cagney or Pat O'Brien. So is it any good? Not especially. Mostly the Japanese just line up waiting to be easily shot...and if Corregidor was really that easy the United StatesFilipino forces would have won that battle!! But at least the Japanese aren't drooling animals like they were in many other American films of the day entertaining...yes...but not exactly realistic. Everyone tries their best but with the film's many limitations it manages only to be slightly entertaining and not much more. I've seen some Japanese and German wartime films and the Americans are every bit as subhuman or onedimensional in them as well.".

CORREGIDOR is rather episodic in nature featuring some frenetic battle action followed by a lull filled by some light humour and romance and then going back to a battle around ten minutes later. It's basic stuff lacking any decent actors to do their roles justice and even Otto Kruger feels hammy. Some parts of the film do tell rather than show and it all gets a bit preachy at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best Shahrukh Khan movies I must say. I am not a Shahrukh fan but this has to be one of his best performances. I am not a Hindi movie buff and I prefer watching English rather than the soapy Hindi movies but this 3 hour plus epic has to be an exception. One of the prime reasons why I loved this movie is because the fictitious Gurukul is almost identical to my old school Calcutta Boys'. When Big B says those words that Gurukul students hold top positions in all fields in the outside world due to the strict discipline I am forced to think back of Clifford Hicks our principal in the late 60's. He became nominated to the Parliament because of his fame as a stupendous disciplinarian. Back to the movie Shahrukh plays a music teacher whose appointment is much to the displeasure of the principal of the school. Little does he know that he is the former lover of his daughter who committed suicide since she couldn't be with him. Her death drove her father to sheer rage that he drove her young lover a student of his own school and stopped his education altogether by refusing him admission in all of the contemporary schools. Years later driven by his own passion and fuel the young man returns to his old school determined to undo the wrongs that caused him so much misery and suffering. He learns of 3 such youngsters who had fallen in love to 3 different girls. He encourages them and gives them ideas of winning the girls' favours. This infuriates the principal and he stops all of them and even threatens to throw them out much like the fate of their music teacher. In the end this teacher reveals his true identity in front of the man who could have been his father in law. Suffering from grief and sorrow the principal breaks down and in the end love rules over discipline. One of the best family movies for a long time with plenty of comedy and emotion. Arguably the best performances of King Khan and one of the best of Big B. Overall its a must see for everyone. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you getting a DVD and watch it right now.....".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the best Shahrukh Khan movies I must say. I am not a Shahrukh fan but this has to be one of his best performances. I am not a Hindi movie buff and I prefer watching English rather than the soapy Hindi movies but this 3 hour plus epic has to be an exception. One of the prime reasons why I loved this movie is because the fictitious Gurukul is almost identical to my old school Calcutta Boys'. When Big B says those words that Gurukul students hold top positions in all fields in the outside world due to the strict discipline I am forced to think back of Clifford Hicks our principal in the late 60's. He became nominated to the Parliament because of his fame as a stupendous disciplinarian. Back to the movie Shahrukh plays a music teacher whose appointment is much to the displeasure of the principal of the school. Little does he know that he is the former lover of his daughter who committed suicide since she couldn't be with him. Her death drove her father to sheer rage that he drove her young lover a student of his own school and stopped his education altogether by refusing him admission in all of the contemporary schools. Years later driven by his own passion and fuel the young man returns to his old school determined to undo the wrongs that caused him so much misery and suffering. He learns of 3 such youngsters who had fallen in love to 3 different girls. He encourages them and gives them ideas of winning the girls' favours. This infuriates the principal and he stops all of them and even threatens to throw them out much like the fate of their music teacher. In the end this teacher reveals his true identity in front of the man who could have been his father in law. Suffering from grief and sorrow the principal breaks down and in the end love rules over discipline. One of the best family movies for a long time with plenty of comedy and emotion. Arguably the best performances of King Khan and one of the best of Big B. Overall its a must see for everyone. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you getting a DVD and watch it right now.....";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie was one of the biggest hit in Bollywood and won some awards too. After all it was a perfect entertainer paisa wasool movie. The length come out as as positive part. In India the more length is the movie the more paisa wasool it is. Especially movie like this which is full of romance drama music and female body shows.I love the music of the movie. It was great. Also the acting by the legends Amitabh and SRK. And as usual of Yashraj films the filmography and camera work was great too.The problem I have is with what exactly message the movie wants to spread? I feel that the movie is trying to say love first other things later. Other things including discipline your studies and your career. The Gurukool is an ideal school for the college students. The principle expects from them that they should only concentrate on their studies their career personal development and their future at least for the time which they will be spending in this college. Thats another problem. What kind of school is it? Is it after 10th or after 12th school? And if it is after 12th why are they wearing uniform? And to accomplish this he has some strict set of rules. They are too strict Agreed. Now from nowhere a new music teacher comes to college when the principle does not allow any cultural program in college why at first place he appointed this music teacher?. Now the music teacher is a real romantic guy who has done romance with the daughter of the principle when he himself was in the same college. As this is against the rules of college principal throws the boy out and his lover suicides as her father rejected her love. This is far too stretched. What? No it isn't. OK. Not far stretched and can happen in reality. And this teacher has now swore that he will fill the entire college with the love. Means he will teach the student the cheap acts of how to write love letter in more effective ways like using 'Piple ka Panna' as letter or bung the lecture to meet the girlfriends and also by bringing neighboring girls to the hostel in absence of principal.In reality one of those girls will get pregnant in such situation.By doing this he think he is doing a great thing for the boys and for the society.By now you must have understood what my problem is. They say at the end that a balance of discipline and love is required but actually more weight in given to love and the man with the discipline has negative shades in character. The next part of the movie is clear. These three students fail in their exam or pass with the low score and after college has problem in finding job and very low knowledge for opening their own business. But the movie ends way before this happens.It is good to give entertainment to the people but then one should also pay the attention to what actually you are teaching. The movie which was released at the same time Mission Kashmir was having exactly opposite characteristics. The movie was having very less entertainment but gives out gives out good moral to the people. And again it is fact that Mission Kashmir flops and Mohobbatein was a great hit. Sometimes things like these upset me for Bollywood. But fortunately now the Bollywood audience is also giving attention to the spirits of the movie. And hence KANK is superflop and Munnabhais are doing great in all parts.".

Everyone who loves this film loves it for different reasons because each story appeals to different people.  For me I felt some of Raj Aryan's dialogue so moving that I've begun thinking about the love in my own life differently.

It was sent to me by a friend who is crazy for Shahrukh Khan.My first impressions were WOW this Shahrukh guy has a tremendous screen presence but yikes what a profile!' and I love the old guy with the black hair and the white beard. He's too cool.' As for the movie itself I wondered how in god's name anybody could enjoy that horrid catinheat screeching which issued forth whenever that gorgeous young woman Aishwarya Rai opened her mouth to sing. And I found the interminable love stories of the three young couples to be boring boring boring. I spent all my time waiting for Mr. Aryan and Mr. Shankar to come back onscreen.As for the story I was completely out of sympathy for the silly idea that it's more important to spend your college years running around trees and going to dance parties with scantily clad girls than to be studying or going to prayer. As a westerner who has watched my own treasured Catholic traditions thrown overboard one by one for every goofy modern idea that comes down the pike clown Masses anyone? I was firmly on the side of Mr. Shankar I don't like change Mr. Aryan!'I've since learned that Amitabh Bachchan is like the Sean Connery of Indian cinema and that Shahrukh Khan is known better for his manic overthetop performances than the quiet mature act I saw in Mohabattein. I cringe whenever he is referred to as The Tom Cruise of India'Tom Cruise can only wish he had Shahrukh's talent and screen presence. Sharhukh definitely would win that contest by a nose.But to be honest I didn't like this movie much and after seeing about 50 Hindi films since then I still don't like it much. It has some great songs that are almost completely destroyed by the ancient crackling voice of Lata Mangreshkar sorry if I spelled it wrong and I still can't sit through the endless love stories of the three young couples. ONE couple would have been plenty to get the point across and it would have cut the movie by 45 minutes or so which it badly needs.As a person who grew up on the MGM musicals of the 40s and 50s I have eagerly embraced Bollywood but no kissing. And although I get bored pretty easily with the dancing around trees it all starts to look the same I just can't get enough of those Holi celebrations! Bring em on.".

Sure the story is the oftrepeated tale of forbidden love unappreciated lovers and the traditions that gag and bind us but the allstar cast the skilled direction and lively musical numbers all contribute to make this a movie worth noting.The setting of Mohabbatein is the Gurukul School an elite school housed in a cold uninviting castlelike edifice. Narayan Shankar Amitabh Bachchan is the stern disciplinarian and somewhat tyrannical headmaster of Gurukul who rules the school with an iron fist.The story begins on a dark and quiet night at the local train stations where three young men prospective students at the school meet on the platform and set out on a journey that brings them closer together than they ever could have imagined. Vicky Uday Chopra is an athletic energetic playboy type seemingly unshaken by the harsh reality of the school. Sameer Jugal Hansraj is the timid and shy one with boyish charm and innocent looks. And Karan Jimmy Shergill completes the trio as the more mature intense member of the pack.The three lads are struck by cupid's arrow when they meet the three heroines Vicky loses his heart to a rich and spoiled girl named Ishika Shamita Shetty while Sameer is reunited with his childhood buddy the bubbly Sanjana Kim Sharma and Karan falls hard for the bashful widow Kiran Preeti Jhangiani. As with every truetoform Bollywood movie their love stories are met with several obstacles such as differences in class nogood boyfriends and familial obligations but the most important hurdle in their path is none other than Narayan Shankar who is convinced that love is a pure waste of time. A glimmer of hope comes their way when a maverick music teacher Raj Aryan Shah Rukh Khan sweeps into the picture and helps nurture their young loves. What follows is a battle of good and evil love and hate and sheer determination and conviction on both sides at the end of which  well let's not get carried away! Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy!.".

And Karan Jimmy Shergill completes the trio as the more mature intense member of the pack.The three lads are struck by cupid's arrow when they meet the three heroines Vicky loses his heart to a rich and spoiled girl named Ishika Shamita Shetty while Sameer is reunited with his childhood buddy the bubbly Sanjana Kim Sharma and Karan falls hard for the bashful widow Kiran Preeti Jhangiani. As with every truetoform Bollywood movie their love stories are met with several obstacles such as differences in class nogood boyfriends and familial obligations but the most important hurdle in their path is none other than Narayan Shankar who is convinced that love is a pure waste of time. A glimmer of hope comes their way when a maverick music teacher Raj Aryan Shah Rukh Khan sweeps into the picture and helps nurture their young loves. What follows is a battle of good and evil love and hate and sheer determination and conviction on both sides at the end of which  well let's not get carried away! Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy!.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie revolves around two main characters Amitabh Bhachan and Shah Rukh Khan. Both are stubborn strong willed. One doesn't believe in love but another believes that love conquer all. In this movie Shah Rukh become a music teacher at Gurukul one of the most pretigious college in India while Amitabh acts as the college principal. This movie is too lengthy because it focus on three young couples but Shah Rukh and Amitabh is the saving grace for this movie. Both of them act superbly and was able to express their feelings which make the acting seem believable. The six newcomers Shamita Sheety Uday Chopra Kim Sharma Jugal Hansraj Preeti Jhangiani and Jimmy Shergill seem to need more coaching considering this is their first venture in Hindi movies. Preeti Jhangiani and Jimmy Shergill seems like the only couple who has a storyline to develop their 'relationship'. The others? Well  let just say that they tried hard but there seems no depth in their acting. There are also some scenes that are illogicalfor example the way Aishwarya Rai died I believe Aish should only have bruises falling from 2 floors house! and the leaf that Shah Rukh keeps even it had dated a few years before The leaf should  be  crumpled not as fresh as it still looks! This movie is only for those who believe in reel life  not real life".

	schema:reviewBody "Before i reveal 13 Facts and Problems about the film Id like to say Mohabbatein does have nice Music and it was the first time that paired Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan together. Two Great Actors in a movie directed by Aditya Chopra who has directed the Great DDLJ.1.STORYLINE  In short This film is about these 3 guys who cant love because their head teacher says No to Love. Huh? 2.INTRODUCTION  The start of the movie shows these 3 strangers meeting together Why were they waiting for each other Doesnt Explain and how comes Jugul who is suppose to be poor was driving a Jeep. It was night and it turns to day suddenly? 3.SHAH RUKH KHAN'S INTRO  SRK comes in giving everybody flowers In reality if a Man gives another man a Flower it means there's a problem. A Gay Problem which can offend many people.4.SHAMITA'S INTRO  It First shows Shamita stealing some clothes from Uday. I Still don't understand why she was doing that if She's rich.5.PREETY JANGHIANI  She is suppose to be a widow But for Father in Law's happiness she pretend to be married. Why does she Wait for her husband in the Night. Is she mental or is she impressing her father in law in a unrealistic way.6.JOB INTERVIEW  Amitabh has his own rules in the film but yet he gives the job of a teacher to stranger Shah Rukh Khan. It is suppose to be a Posh school in Reality Amitabh should of asked for references but No SRK was suppose to get this Job magically i guess. Damn script 7.CHALTE CHALTE SONG  SRK asks the 3 boys to imagine Love and run to the gate. Uday and Jimmy have seen the girl for 5 Seconds and already they are crazily in Love and running. During the song it shows Jimmy going Hospital all the time as an excuse to see Preety. But Its a children's Ward? And Pretty isn't a nurse? 8.JUGUL'S PHOTO  Jugul shows his friends his photo of him and Kim. He says earlier he hasn't seen her for 6 Years The Photo looks recent? 9.KIM'S SAHELI  Kim tells Jugul about this saheli Meaning Female Friend. But she introduces him to her BOY Friend? 10.HOLI PERMISSION  SRK asks Amitabh for Holi permissions and Amitabh agrees they can play outside if they like. But they go outside all the time as it is why the 5 minute scene of asking for permission? 11.LIGHTS  After the song Humko Humise It shows Uday coming late in the Uni and caught by Amitabh. You see the lights turning on one by one automatically. Who is controlling the switch...a ghost? 12.RULES AND LEAVES  Amitabh makes Rules about no one leaving the Gurukul. SRK gives them a solution with leaves. But they still break the rules by going outside and still use the Leaf Solutuon? 13.FINALLY ASH'S DEATH  I understand she was tormented between her father and lover but she chose to kill herself. Was she trying to prove a point or was her character plain stupid and weak.Anyway The film was still enjoyable in some scenes Mainly the scenes with Amitabh and Shah Rukh. It wasn't a complete Letdown Just the actual storyline was too fairy tale and unrealistic which doesn't suit Yash Chopra Movies.THE MOHABBATEIN STORIES. Srk and Ash story is like Romeo Juliet which suited 400 years ago not now. Uday and Shamita was a childish love story with no twist to look forward to. Jugul and Kim's was a bore that annoyed big time cos of Kim's unusual character She says Be yourself in Love Then why doesn't She?. Jimmy and Preety was the worst and most pathetic. He loves a widow It Looked Great in Sholay when Amitabh fancied jaya Not here.Amitabh was Brilliant as usual. Shah Rukh was terrific in a complex role. Aishwarya has no scope but looks sexy and pretty as usual. Uday is a show off who tries too hard to copy SRK. Jimmy was dreadful in a SRK romeo style attempt. Jugul was alright I guess. Shamita was irritating and doesn't look nice. Preety looked cute but a letdown. Kim was annoying and childish. Direction had class but nothing fantastic.".

Shahrukh Khan whom I admire and absolutely love his acting he was a real disappointment in this movie I think any other mediocre actor could have took up Shah Rukh's roleAishwariya once again another talented actress gone to waste! There love story was...well crap i really wanted more from these two and the whole idea of Sharukh being a violin player...please. As for Amitabh he was OK nothing memorable and to be honest I do not even know who the others werethat is how much impact this movie had on meand dragged on way to long however some songs were nice...that's it.";

I would have liked more time spent on the main love story instead involving Sharookh and the guest star. The tension between The Sharookh and Amitabh should have been more so they were acting like friends instead of people who hate each others guts.

Shankar then hires a new music teacher Raj Aryan Malhotra a man of music who vows to bring love and happiness into the University and so the two men collide with their values soon it is revealed that Malhotra was once a former student who was in love with Shankar's daughter.The film is a romanticcomedydrama.I viewed this on the big screen and it sends shivers down your back when the instrumental theme hits the screen. The characters that stand out are Shankar played by Bachan who sends a strict almost military touch to the role while SRK plays the role of Raj Malhotra with a difference more mature and day dreaming type. The six supporting actors were very good and held their own. Its very sweet to see the guys run around love struck. However I would have liked to see more of Uday and Jimmy their careers have seem to disappear...nonetheless this film captures their greatest performances...And its also nice to see Aishwariya Rai make an appearance.The soundtrack is amazing songs like 'Chalte Chalte' is very catchy and will have you singing.

	schema:reviewBody "A captivating drama  comedy that casts Ray Liotta as 'Manny Singer' a man who recently lost his wife and has his daughter Molly Tina Majorino to take care of who was too sad and heartbroken to talk to anyone after her mother's death. As Manny tries to find a suitable 'nurse maid' for Molly so he can go back to work Corrina Washington in the form of Whoopi Goldberg comes into the picture and eventually gets hired by Manny to take care of the little girl. The funny thing is what the Singers weren't expecting was for Corrina to bring magic back into their lives. An endearing little treasure 'Corrina Corrina' is a motion picture filled with heart and laughter that's sure to send your spirits soaring. Wendy Crewson is great in her supporting role as the notsonice and aggressive 'Jenny Davis'. Goldberg is absolutely terrific in the title role. A highlyrecommended motion picture. Rating Three 12 out of Five Stars Very Good.".

Manny Singer's Ray wife has just died leaving him and his 7 year old daughter Tina behind. Molly is a little lost after this and she doesn't speak a word to her father or anyone else. After employing a plethora of disastrous nannys Manny finally comes to Corrina who is perfect. One problem She's black he's white and this is 1959 segregated America.After a little while Molly begins to talk again and is generally uplifted by Corrina who seems to have this miraculous way of bringing people back to their feet including Manny. Corrina and Manny fall in love against all odds and what you get is a beautiful interracial romance that at that time is classed as wrong even abnormal. No one approves apart from Molly and her Grandfather Don Ameche.One down side to this film and I will add that it is the only down side is the ending  you don't really know what happens. If I hadn't done a little research then I wouldn't have known that director Jessie Nelson had based this film on her true life story. She's black and her now husband of 40 odd years was white. This story is her story. They got married and lived happily ever after  but we have to guess. So the ending could have used a little bit more work. But that's it!! The movie is just wonderful. It's uplifting heartbreaking humorous and romantic.My score 1010".

It IS a movie about love across social boundaries it can also speak to the seeming obsession of society about the differences of not only race but also religion. What is wonderful about this movie is that it shows that this obsession goes both ways.  And it has come to a point where understandablymembers of the most persecuted groups in out society end up in situations like in Corrina Corrina where they themselves are pressured by their own family and community to sever the relationship that they want to be in.  This movie shows the pressure that both sides go through when deciding to enter an interracial or even an interfaith relationship and it shows that sometimes the pressure put on the member of a certain group in society goes through more because their community feels although often for good reasons that the person of the dominant community whatever it may be in whatever society is not to be trusted.

His little girl however loses the will to speak feeling her Mother's loss so greatly. He needs a maidnanny and luckily manages to after much funny trials to find and retain Ms. Washington Goldberg whom the daugher played brilliantly by the marvelous Tina Majorino think Shirley Temple with an attitutude falls in love with. Goldberg has her usual attractive 'spark' and then some...I fell in love with her too in this family fare.

I ended up watching the entire film and noticed that my mom was distracted from her work as well.Whoopi Goldberg is at her best as Corrina an intelligent black woman in the 1950's who has a college degree but because of her skin colour she has to work as a maid. She enters the life of Molly and Manny Singer who have lost their mom and wife respectively and Molly up to this point traumatised warms to Corrina as I'm sure most of the audience did.The film teaches morals of religion blackwhite relations and antismoking though this last moral is sort of lost but it does not stick them down your throat. It is funny and Jessie Nelson does some quite experimental and beautiful shots especially the colours.It fulfills the requirement of overdone touchy scenes but somehow the performances make it much better and tina marjorino plays a large role in this. Good for the family but also quite good for a film lover.".

Manny and Corrina develop a relationship and many people aren't happy about it.I do have a problem with Liotta and Goldberg pairing. Goldberg has never been the romantic type and I don't see her with any sexual chemistry. That makes the relationship problematic for a mainstream movie. There seems to be a few other general problems in this movie. Writerdirector Jessie Nelson sets up a lot of stuff but they all seem to be left unresolved. She sets up the religious angle and nothing really happens. There is the racial angle but it never heats up to a point of danger. That doesn't accentuate the drama. It's almost as if the movie is more scared of the material than the audience. Tina Majorino is adorable. She keeps the heart in this story. This could have been a much better movie.".

Whoop once again uses her charm this time as a housekeepercaretaker to a little sweetheart named Molly Singer played to heartstealing perfection by 9yearold Tina Majorino a motherless child with a loveable daddy Ray Liotta living in 50s suburbia. The aesthetic kids always steal the show is very much evident here. Majorino is the sweetest and most talented child actor today she puts Hayley Joel Osment to total shame. Her laugh smile and tears are so infectious you'd wish she were your own. Ray Liotta and Whoop are both memorable as Molly's two favorite people and the classy 50s soundtrack is a musthave.

At this point you have to wonder if it's just going to be one of those gems that never finds an audiance to enjoy it.It's really too bad because the film is actually an exceptionally good one that features a very good and tender story as well as some great performances. The film is set in the 1950's so you've got the added drama of the racial tensions which comes into play but the film never preaches but instead lets the drama play out in a realistic way. What's so great about the movie is that it's simply trying to tell a simple story about three people who need one another.There are a lot of hilarious moments throughout the film as both Liotta and Goldberg are perfect in their roles. Having such capable actors means they are able to make you believe in the characters and make the characters feel real. You've also got great support from Majorino Don Ameche and Joan Cusack. The film works the laughs perfectly but there are also some touching moments that will leave many grabbing for the tissues.One would hope that CORRINA CORRINA would eventually find more fans.".

Despite this picture's lack of popular appeal and box office performance it would seem intolerant to suggest that this picture is not a moving or deeply thoughtprovoking.The picture set during the late 1950s is a wonderful depiction of how two people so different can come together at a time when it wasn't politically or socially acceptable. The true stars of this movie Goldberg and Liotta portray the taboo of an interracial relationship at the time and convey this difficulty with such serenity and authenticity.The infrequent injections of Goldberg's comedy enable the film to be not just a sadistic and morbid tale of the hardships of America's shame but an attempt to remind audiences that we have finally reached a place of equality where interracial love is acceptable. Goldberg's character is utilized as a tool to encourage mediation between the lost Manny and his daughter Overall Corrina Corrina is a truly beautiful film that raises the question of AfricanAmericans being accepted into white society and serves a message to illustrate the history of America's black peoples and how really we're all the same.".

He's good at this type of stuff.Just like 'The Replacement Killers' this film was also a flop at the box office and it is probably through its gritty and uncompromising tone. Yeah there's action and intense shootouts but it is not like 'Die Hard' or anything. Innocent people die the ending isn't happy but what matters is that the film isn't cheesy  it pulls no sucker punches or cheap thrills. It sticks to the characters while keeping the action secondary but no less intense. The plot too is also pretty interesting and is a little more intricate than 'The Replacement Killers' or Chow YunFat's cult hits from Hong Kong like 'Hard Boiled.' It is not quite a masterpiece of genre but remains a solid crime thriller nonetheless. 810Rated R strong violence and profanity".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a Hong Kong action flick with a distinct taste of the west.  The movie starts off with a bombing and small store shootout that is right out of John Woo's stylebook but then it under goes a change.  The story starts taking over and it is one of intrigue within intrigue.  There are great moments of action with two guns blazing and an unbelievable amount of bullets but the story becomes the main thing.  This works as glue that a lot of Hong Kong movies don't have.  There are long pauses of plot developments between double crossing bad guys that are a real change to what is a typical Hong Kong action flick.The director John Foley likes to place people in positions where they have to make critical decisions under pressure At Close Range and Fear and this is no exception.  A caring cop caught up in a situation of corruption is under constant pressure to decide what is right.  You are kept guessing as to his ultimate decision but the pressure is there under a dozen different situations.  The subplots add to the texture of this movie and add to its richness.  These side stories of the bad cop father in trouble the interaction of rival Chinese gangs and his love of Asian culture are all parts of the puzzle that is Danny Wallace played by Mark Wahlberg.  Foley knows Wahlberg from the direction of his acting breakthrough in Fear and uses him at what he does best the confused tough guy with the sensitive agenda. His latest movie The Yards' is an example of what I mean. Nick Chen the experienced street cop played by Chow YunFat is the perfect slightly crazy hardhitting loner who has embedded himself in the struggle of rival gangs in New York's Chinatown.  There is no black and white here only shades of gray in a world of who is doing what to whom but like the cultural differences between East and West the relationships between individuals overcomes the hard facts of doing business on the street.A very good blend of the Hong Kong actions movie that was brought in by Chow YunFat if you hear the commentary that Foley never saw a Woo movie and what Foley's image is for street life in New York.  Coming from New York and living and working in Asia gives me insight into the homework that went into the making of this movie and I will say they did a very good job.".

The action scenes were well directed and quite spectacular in some cases eg. the car chase and several shootouts without going too over the top. The plot was a little hard to follow at first but I blame this on myself not the storyline. It's commendable that so much thought was given to the script and plot so it didn't always seem we were just waiting for an action scene. The drama added intensity and suspense well too. For example the tension between Chen and Wallace. The thread with Wallace and his father added good depth to his character and the story as did the fact that he and Chen retained their partnership in fighting even when the suspected worst was revealed about Chen. It was also notable the role music played in the film. For example you always knew when the Asian punks were about to show up due to the rap music. The subtle music in dramatic dialogue scenes gave the scenes a good atmosphere.".

Mark Wahlberg is Danny Wallace a white cop who is transferred to Chinatown and becomes Chens partner.  Danny soon discovers that not everything is quite how it should be with Chen who has a lot of money  and overlooks many crimes in Chinatown.  The Corruptor is a movie about the releationship between Chen and Wallace. I must say that I didnt like Mark Wahlberg at all because his performance is poor. Chow YunFat carries this movie by himself and he has a lot more dialogue now than in The Replacement Killers. If you like Chow YunFat or actionflicks you should consider watching this one night.  It has not got as much action as The Replacement Killers but it has a far better story and better acting. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "They say everyone has a secret. The Corruptor is a prime example of this saying because everyone in Chinatown is hiding something in this movie. Detective Nick Chen played by international star Chow YunFat heads the Asian Crime Unit in his precinct. Chen is a decorated hero with many years on the force. He is also in the back pocket of Uncle Benny the leader of the oldline gang in the city. Because of this he is fighting even harder to take down the Fukienese Dragons a gang of young Chinese recently arrived to America.

The Corruptor is fun! Any movie that starts off with an entire storefront exploding and the one survivor' being gunned down as he comes out the door is bound to grab your attention.

Chow YunFat is the main reason to see this movie. He was a star in China for many years before we were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him. His English has improved immensely from his first American movie The Replacement Killers and his charisma is at the level that it always has been. When Chow is on the screen it is hard to watch others and it will definitely be interesting to see him in the remake of The King and I with Jodie Foster. James Foley directed this movie. It's not for everyone but if movies like HardBoiled and The Killer entertained you then check out The Corruptor. It's worth it!".

	schema:reviewBody "While not perfect The Corrupter is far from lacking when it comes to delivering the action goods we've come to expect from a Chow Yun Fat movie. People who say it needs more action or character development must have watched the wrong movie. To add more of either would have had to resulted in a longer movie. From start to finish no time is wasted in conveying the story or showing Hong Kong style gunplay that is above and beyond what American audiences are used to. Extremely violent and full of imaginative ways to kill people with a gun I don't see how anyone who would even consider watching this would give it a low rating. Unlike today's action flicks who strive for their precious PG13 rating this movie takes it over the top and is full of gratuitous nudity immoral activity and pointblank headexploding gunfire. If you're into any of the aforementioned goodness then you more than likely won't be disappointed by this flick. The famous car chase scene is perhaps the most violent ever put to celluloid. Mark Wahlberg isn't the greatest actor but is believable nonetheless. Chow Yun Fat plays the role of desensitized Asian gang taskforce detective Nick Chen perfectly. This isn't a movie to watch with the kids as Chen's antics can sometimes leave one questioning his sanity. With a touching ending and adrenaline pumping action The Corrupter delivers on all promises  so much so that I must wonder if some of the other reviewers here were even watching the same movie. 910".

The story is a tired one but Mark Wahlberg and especially Chow are charismatic and make their characters sympathetic. Chow also develops an onscreen chemistry w Wahlberg that was completely absent in his partnership w Mira Sorvino.Because of it's uninspiring storyline however The Corruptor will probably still not make Chow a household name in America. But it will win him lots of new fans. Let's hope this upward trend in Chow's career continues w Anna and the King.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a fan of films that are as explicit or as violent as The Corruptor is as a general rule but I bought The Corruptor because of Chow YunFat's splendid performance as Nick Chen. I really like Nick Chen despite or perhaps because of his flaws. Beneath his cynical attitude toward the inevitability of corruption in ANY police department and in particular the Asian Crime Unit of New York is an honest man.The way he tries to protect the prostitute he loves is touching and beautiful especially the scene where he feeds her while she is in bed. Nick's motivations and his own entanglement in the shadowworld of human exploitation is always colored by a desire to correct the wrong and make things right. He takes pride in his being a policeman like his father was before him and wants to be thought of as a good cop which he really is.The famous plum scene is a gem.  YunFat and his partner Walberg who is MUCH better in this role than I expected him to be are strolling through the open market district of China Town and YunFat  stops to purchase a plum and offers one to Walberg.  Walberg rejects the plum in favor of a peach. The way YunFat talks about Frank Sinatra and his reference to his godfather who made me look good and I LIKE it! is sad and joyful at the same time.  Beautiful scene.Others have covered the action in this film so I won't go over the same ground.  The Londonbased Chinese actor who plays the role of the kingpin of the operation is outstanding.  He brings to the screen true deceit without apology.For me the BEST part of the DVD is the director's commentary.  He explains the scenes and how they were accomplished.  There is also a documentary on How the film was made with Chow YunFat and Mark Walberg talking about their roles.  This is fascinating.Because I like Nick Chen so much the end of the film is tough for me to watch but it contains some of the best scenes in the film for example Nick in the men's room doing a Chinese breathing exercise to prepare himself for what he must do next.Not for the faintofheart or those who cannot look at evil without flinching.  If you can force yourself to look The Corruptor is well worth the effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chow YunFat's second English language actioneer The Corrupter boasts a plot with greater narrative depth and stronger characterization than The Replacement Killers Chow's topgrossing U.S. feature film debut. Nevertheless Glengarry Glen Ross director James Foley's cops  robbers saga lacks the visceral musicvideo bravura of Anton Fuqua's mythical gangster mow down epic. While Fuqua blew out all stops with his ballistic homage to John Woo in The Replacement Killer Foley adopts a 'realitywhataconcept' focus a la Sidney Serpico  Prince of the City Lumet in his treatment of a dirty cops crime chronicle. Good acting by Chow and a firstrate cast make this bloodstained cultural murder mystery with its share of surprises and shootouts worth a second look.The Corrupter concerns an uneasy alliance between veteran NYPD Detective Lieutenant Nick Chen Chow YunFat and his new partner rookie cop Danny Wallace Mark Wahlberg of Renaissance Man. Wallace finds himself assigned to the Chinese dominated Asian Gang Unit after a turf war erupts between the Triads and the Fukienese Dragons in the Big Apple. Wallace and Chen investigate the Chinatown mob headed by slippery Janusfaced Oriental businessman Henry Lee Ric Young of Nixon who skillfully plays both cops against each other as well as against the mob. Meanwhile the Fukienese Dragons run by vicious Bobby Vu Byron Mann of Catwoman are the culprits behind the latest bombings and shootings. Lee uses the Dragons to ice his immediate superior Uncle Bennie Kim Chan of Lethal Weapon IV so that Lee can take over the rackets without upsetting the Hong Kong mob.Initially Lt. Chen and Danny cannot tolerate each other. Chen doesn't want the idealistic white cop on his team but they come to respect each other after a series of neardeath confrontations with triggerhappy goons. The complications stack up when Wallace busts a drugdealer who is an undercover FBI agent. FBI Chief Schabacker Paul BenVictor of True Romance stomps into their precinct with a takenoprisoners attitude. He has always suspected that Lt. Chen was in deep with Uncle Benny and he wants Wallace to expose Chen. Meanwhile Danny's seedy excop father Sean Wallace Brian Cox of Rushmore shows up and asks Danny for some dough to help pay off his Mafia gambling debts. Danny has nothing but contempt for his dad but Sean becomes Danny's conscience before the gunsmoke clears.Freshman scenarist Robert Pucci exploits Chinatown in The Corrupter for both its territorial as well as metaphorical iconography. As the title implies subtly but unmistakably the crime lords who pay off the cops don't qualify as The Corrupter but rather the setting that mires them in the corruption of life. Not even the villains can avoid their fate in Chinatown as Pucci points out with moody bits of dialogue like You don't change Chinatown Chinatown changes you. Pucci's screenplay covers familiar territory but he enlivens it with several twists and turns punctuated by hairraising shootouts.Director James Foley tries his hand at a Tarantino throughthegunbarrel darkly plot and shows himself equal to the task. Audiences may have a tough time with The Corrupter. First even if wordofmouth propels this energetic buddy cop thriller beyond its meager opening day box office receipts the tragic ending rules out any sequel. The Corrupter shares more in common with 1970s' cop movies like Hustle with Burt Reynolds. Second while Pucci's screenplay stockpiles all the clichs and conventions of the police genre Foley never lets action overshadow character. Forget the familiar bulletproof vest escape hatch or the miraculous recovery from multiple gunshot wounds a la Lethal Weapon 1 thru 4. Foley furnishes some sizzling action sequences but he never lets us forget that today's hero can quickly degenerate into tomorrow's crook. Nobody escapes The Corrupter without paying his dues. The guns may make the killers look cool but these dastards cannot escape their comeuppance.One of the assets of The Corrupter is its solid acting. Undeniably Chow YunFat delivers his best performance to date. Chow displays greater range of expression and character here than even in his legendary Hong Kong epics. John Woo never got as spirited and animated a performance as Foley draws from Chow in The Corrupter. As dapper Lt. Nick Chen Chow reveals as much character with his body language as he does with his dialogue. Foley deliberately downplays Chow's signature gunwielding antics when the superstar whirls while firing away with a pistol in each fist.Mark Wahlberg last seen in The Big Hit gives a tightlipped performance that quietly but effectively contrasts with Chow's gregarious chops. Softspoken and bespectacled Danny Wallace grows as a character from the moment that he teams up with Chen. Wahlberg avoids any flashy Mel Gibson heroics.The support cast excels too. With his silkyvoiced speech patterns Ric Young is believably wicked as a doublecrossing crime lord who tires to burn the candle at both ends without getting singed. Paul BenVictor is appropriately abrasive as an FBI honcho who wants Chen's head on a platter. Oddly enough Kim Chan stars as elderly crime lord named Uncle Benny. Check out his death scene in The Corrupter. Last summer Chan played a similar Chinatown as in Los Angeles crime king in Lethal Weapon 4. Foley's longtime lenser Juan RuizAnchia's flashy sharplensed photography thrusts audiences into the thick of the action. Foley and RuizAnchia repeatedly provide awesome aerial nighttime shots of the Big Apple.Altogether The Corrupter rates as an aboveaverage but violent cops and crime lords shoot'em up. No the violence does not match John Woo's gory but stylist Hong Kong thrillers The Killer or Hard Boiled that both starred Chow but The Corrupter contains an adequate amount of gunplay to satisfy genre fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "Chow YunFat's second English language actioneer The Corrupter boasts a plot with greater narrative depth and stronger characterization than The Replacement Killers Chow's topgrossing U.S. feature film debut. Nevertheless Glengarry Glen Ross director James Foley's cops  robbers saga lacks the visceral musicvideo bravura of Anton Fuqua's mythical gangster mow down epic.

	schema:reviewBody "The Corruptor is a movie that can't quite decide what it wants to be. For a long time I couldn't figure out why I didn't like this movie as much as some of Chow YunFat's earlier work. Unlike many I enjoyed The Replacement Killers and I was looking forward to this one his second American effort. Upon seeing it for a second time I think I have it figured out.The classic ChowWoo collaborations that came out of Hong Kong in the late '80s and early '90s worked so well because the storylines were fairly simple and the emphasis was on mindblowing action. Themes such as brotherhood loyalty and redemption were strongly emphasized. In short they were myths. And they worked exceptionally well.Then when all the Asian stars came to Hollywood starting with Jackie Chan and followed by Chow Woo Jet Li etc. this classic formula was imitated but American film makers just haven't got it right yet. The Replacement Killers tried and I think succeeded in a limited sense. The action was good but Chow's acting ability was not fully used. Still it stayed successfully away from the American phenomenon. Too often American film makers take successful film concepts then throw a bunch of sex and profanity in seemingly at random to make it grittier or more realistic. Unfortunately this just makes a good concept confused and reduces its impact. The Replacement Killers remained focused on action at all times and thus succeeded to a point.Other times one genre is unsuccessfully grafted on to another. Thus we have The Corruptor. It takes the Hong Kong heroic bloodshed format and for some reason tries to make it into L.A. Confidential. The excessive violence so popular in the HK films seems out of place and gratuitous here because it is presented in the same context and the same world as where illegal immigrants are tortured and killed and corruption works its way throughout the NYPD. Somehow both legitimate genres are denigrated as a result. The action seems anemic if you take the movie as heroic bloodshed and if it's taken as film noir the violence seems unrealistic and stupid. So it fails on both accounts.Still its great to see Chow acting in an American movie and he has an undeniable screen presence here as always while Wahlberg is competent enough and the supporting cast is pretty good.So to summarize The story is a little too convoluted and remains somewhat unconvincing the action such as it is is good especially the chase scene but doesn't work in context because it is presented in a framework of gritty realism. Finally at the end of the movie there seems to be no clear point to the film unlike with the HK films the viewer is left with no understanding of what the whole thing was really about. Add to that the rather unsympathetic main characters who more often than not come across as pathetic losers than antiheroes and the movie really doesn't work.Rating 6.810 but it would be less if it didn't have Chow YunFat my favourite actor who does his best to try and save the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am really annoyed as the Advertiser our local newspaper didn't give a review of the Corrupter this week it was released. They usually review all of the films released during the week and it seems that the Corrupter missed out which is really annoying. Anyway knowing that my tastes generally diverge greatly from those of reviewers they would probably have given it a one star and labelled it as a pointless movie with lots of violence. This I would object to because Chow Yun Fat is an absolutely brilliant actor and most of the movies that I have seen that he has been in I really enjoy. Okay Hard Boiled was little more than a huge gunfight through a hospital but it was still a great movie.Chow Yun Fat is a highly decorated cop in New York's Chinatown. One day a white cop joins up much to the annoyance of the other cops in the Asian vice squad as they are Asian and a white man does not know how Chinatown runs. It seems that this new cop is an eager and nave boy who wants to change Chinatown but as Fat says you don't change Chinatown Chinatown changes you. The new cop is portrayed through the movie as being the epitome of innocence caught in the middle of a dangerous a violent world that is Chinatown. The movie opens with a shop exploding and then the members of the Fookanese Dragons a gang trying to take over from the ruling Tong gang kill the owner of the store. This violence is contrasted with the almost innocent life of the white cop who we then learn has a father who is in a lot of trouble with the mafia due to gambling debts.There are two themes that run through this movie that of shattered hope and that of corruption even the most honoured and respected people have a corrupt side while even the most corrupt can be capable of huge amounts of good. This is in contrast with Divorcing Jack where the corrupt are trying to create peace only to have their corruption exposed and the peace being shattered. In the Corrupter the corrupted are sought after but even with the evidence to expose the corrupted it is put aside for they are very much capable of performing great deeds.I thought that this movie was going to be predictable. It is not. As soon as you learn that the white cop is in internal affairs working to expose Fat's corruption we expect then to turn on each other and begin to fight. The movie is not that shallow. As we remember from the quote made you don't change Chinatown Chinatown changes you. The internal affairs officer has a purpose but the corruption then seeps into even his most resolute honour. The FBI are portrayed as rather nasty individuals though they are simply obsessed with their job and they hide themselves away behind desks coming out only to claim fame for somebody else's bust.Internal affairs isn't much liked here but we do sympathise for the white cop because he has experienced what it is like on the street and he is as affected by it as everybody else. He is there to collect evidence against Fat but in reality he finds himself becoming more closer and loyal to him when in the end Fat chooses not to shoot but to move to save his life. One cannot expect to move into Chinatown and change everything  rather they need to become a part of it accepted by it so that the evil may be rooted out and destroyed.The main crime here is slavery. This is where the shattered hope theme comes in. Asians are illegally imported into New York for a price and then the price is jacked up forcing them to work as prostitutes. Those who refuse are simply killed and dumped into trash cans. It makes one think about the whole idea of America being a better place. They come out to America and Australia expecting a better life but find themselves trapped on the streets with no money and having to degrade themselves by selling their bodies to people who simply want to abuse them. This is not the better life that they hoped for.We may all snarl and growl at criminals but what many of us forget is that this is a harsh and uncaring world and some people are thrown into situations which they do not know what they are doing and once they are there they can never get out again. Drug use is the most common example for they can find themselves without money and jobs and desperate for the drug and thus they must resort to violence to get it. In a way we should not be hating them and calling for them to be locked up in gaol. The true villains are really very few. Many of the criminals are foolish or simply caught up in something that they never expected to land up in. As such we should be helping them not causing them to be cast out.I have digressed from the movie but we do see are very dark and miserable world here. A world where idealistic youths can't change. This is a real world with real problems that simply cannot be solved by locking people up or even by shooting them.".

I liked how he went to extreme measures on his cases including one part where there was a rival officer on his case from the FBI.  In this with him is Mark Wahlberg as a rookie cop interested in the well being of the Chinese immigrants but also has a secret of his own.  The buddy role between Chow YunFat and Mark Wahlberg is pretty cool and the action in this film was welldone including one car chase that really stood out like a black sheep in a flock of white.

	schema:reviewBody "In a world of no rules as the log line says films like this are bound to happen.  Without a foundation from which to tell a story corruption isn't just something that happens to be part of the title of this film it's at the very core of why this film even exists.Very briefly this film is about two cops who work in the middle of gangland Chinatown in New York.  One cop Nick Chen played by Chow YunFat knows that he has to break some rules to get to the bad guys.  The other cop Don Wallace Mark Wahlberg is a rookie cop who seems to be as straightlaced as Jimmy Stewart.  So with this cliche all set the film moves into a storyline of two gangs at war with each other and detectives Nick and Don dive in head first.After all of the setup then the rest of the film is a very bad attempt at being clever  The double and triplecrosses aren't nearly as surprising as finding the morning paper on your doorstep every morning.  The action is gratuitous and lends nothing to the film let alone the imagination.  The violence is unbearable and most alarmingly goes towards glorifying gang warfare and not discouraging it.  The sex is... well it's what it is in all movies these days unnecessary uninvolving brutal irresponsible and stupid.  The highkey lighting style of the cinematographer is completely out of place in this film since there's nothing to really be suspenseful about.  And this film  absolutely does not merit any comparison to the filmnoir genre even though you get the sense if being pounded over your head with something means sense that the director tries for it.  For all of the black and white spaces created by using highkey lighting the underpinning absence of a clear morality actually undermines this story instead of enhancing it.Usually audiences assume that when you're a cop you stand for all that is good.  Well at least that's what people used to assume.  In any case even in an absence of a clear line of good and bad a strong story with good strong characters will arise and tell a tale that makes people think about what is good and bad.  This film just makes you wonder if there are any good cops out there at all I don't mean boy scouts.Why does everyone have to be so corrupted in movies these days?  Why does it have to be so dark?  I don't believe the line that says It's dark because that's reality.  It's only a portion of reality and even then it's only because certain people in this society think it's cool to have a smoking gun and a smoking piece of garbage in your mouth.  How dumb is that?Bottom line is this film lacks a moral underpinning that makes all movies great.  Whether this morality is challenged questioned or turned upsidedown makes no difference.  At least a morality exists.  In THE CORRUPTOR there is no morality to do anything with.  That's why in this film the violence is gratuitous the sex uninteresting the double and triplecrosses obvious.  It's just a stupid movie.".

It's a huge surprise considering the film is directed by James Foley who makes films I LIKE he's best still being in my opinion the very underrated At Close Range. A second inning onto the American market Chow Yun Fat lives this film up. I agree he is the coolest Asian actor who can act. Speaking of actors their all terrific. Wahlberg's solid as the young rookie undercover cop partnered with the shady head of the Asian task force Fat who thinks he can play on both sides of the law and still come out clean and cool like his parading self. Ric Young who's the godfather of Chinatown controlling the whole corrupt show while buying a few cops is so slick and slimy in his role he's lovable a big paunchy China doll. Most impressive though as rising hood climbing up the ladder very quick before his time is Byron Mann as Bobby Vu while too I also liked Brian Cox always solid as Wahlberg's bum of a gambling ex cop and weathered father who always implores his son to get him out of his indebted messes. Too The Corrupter has an darn interesting story if sometimes confusing and this I think could be it's fault where to un confuse it you might have to wrack your brain a bit. But it has more meat to it than Chow's last simple storied show and cool action piece The short sharp and sweet actioner The Replacement Killers. Also I liked Paul Ben Victor as the Head FBI chief butting heads with Fat a mutual and silent hate exchanged. Fat shows great emotion especially in parts where he finds out he's bitten off more than he can chew. Too you will notice some faults in some action parts of The Corrupter but Foley has crafted a very slick action pic the early scene with Fat shooting up a light store had me underestimating the action side of it when I saw it at the cinema in 99. From here it was confirmed I was in for one hell of a ride. The movies cool from the word go and I mean from the word Go the cool deviously and shady fitting music score by Carter Burwell as the opening credits fade in and out of The larger font movie Title was an impressive start where an explosion in the first scene is a great invitation which you'll get here among a little bit of T and A too that doesn't go astray where Fat always looks after his partner. The action finale on that big ship even though played out a bit is climactic involving and again cool if shockingly affecting not just for one thing. Foley too plays around with some beautifully overhead shots of the big Apple. Here's a film he should be proud of despite a lot of negativity from a few real movie critics towards it. I almost love this as much as ACR. One of the coolest films you'll ever see.".

	schema:headline " The CG effects are impressive but in all other respects this is a wholly unnecessary remake that is inferior to Tsui Hark's original";
	schema:reviewBody "The Tsui Hark production A Chinese Ghost Story is without a doubt a seminal classic of Hong Kong cinema successfully blending some of its signature elements like overthetop action overwrought emotions and a dizzying mix of various genres in this instance romance comedy and horror. It is a tall task then to attempt a reinterpretation of it but Ip Man director Wilson Yip has boldly attempted to go where no Hong Kong director has dared to tread.It seems however that this reluctance has been for good reason despite Yip's efforts at mimicking the hallmarks of the earlier film his 2011 remake is a slapdash product with little actual merit. The ineptness of Yip's version is indeed appalling especially considering his solid if not outstanding work on the two Ip Man movies and in almost every respect proves to be inferior to Ching SiuTung's original. That is except for its end credits and only because it rehases the late Leslie Cheung's classic theme song.Right from the beginning one can sense that there is something amiss with the movie. A hastilytold prologue tries to establish but fails to do so with any resonance the doomed romance between demon slayer Yan Chi Xia Louis Koo and Nip SiuSin or Xiao Qian Liu Yifei as she is more popularly known. Apparently Cia Xia didn't have the heart to kill SiuSin when the time came for him to do so instead he erased her memory of their relationship and set her free thereby also falling out with another demon slayer Thunder played by Ip Man regular Fan SiuWong.Fans of the original would already suspect the difference between the two and true enough the focus of Yip's movie seems to have shifted to the character of Chi Xia in the process setting up Leslie Cheung's Ning Cai Chen played here by the terrible Chinese actor Yu Shaoqun as a romantic rival instead to Chi Xia for SiuSin's affections. Cheung's classic character turns out to be the scholar a waterimpoverished town turns to for assistance and it is to solve their water woes that Cai Chen ventures into the mountains meets SiuSin and lands up at Lan Tze Temple.As with the original the trio's common enemy is the Tree Demon to whom SiuSin's spirit is enslaved to and with whom Chi Xia and Cai Chen will eventually battle against in a CGheavy actionpacked finale. The latter has Yip demonstrating the sure hand he had with the action sequences in Ip Man and is easily the best thing the movie has going for it. Complementing the fluid martial arts choreography among the choreographers veteran Ma YukShing is the impressive visual effects done postproduction in Korea which only goes to show that the China film industry can very well handle CG as competently as its Hollywood counterparts.Unfortunately the hour before this climactic battle is one tedious slog no thanks to a dreadful script by Cheung Tan also equally guilty for the Chen Kaige dud 'The Promise'. Not only is the dialogue godawful and filled with moments of unintentional humour there is close to little characterisation be it Chi Xia Cai Chen or SuiSin. Yip compensates for Cheung's bad scripting with a somewhat frenetic pace but that's not enough to distract his audience from its flaws and repetitive scenes. Most importantly the romantic triangle also fails to take off and remains stuck in cutesy scenes what's up with the feeding of sweets that belong in a teenage fantasy. And because one never quite comes to believe in the starcrossed romance between human and demon the finale also lacks the poignancy of the original.Equally uninspired is the acting or rather the lack of it on display. Louis Koo attempts to emote as one half in an illfated romance but doesn't quite succeed. Yifei has the beguiling looks to go with her part but lacks conviction. But the worst of the lot is Mainland actor Yu Shaoqun who proves time and time again that he simply cannot act if you've seen last year's Kung Fu Wing Chun you'll agree too. His portrayal of the shy softspoken and goodhearted romantic lover is simply ingratiating and an utter insult to Leslie Cheung's nuanced performance. Ditto for Louis and Yifei whose acting can't hold a candle to Wu Ma and Joey Wong's in the original.There are however exceptions Kara Hui is gleefully campy as the Tree Demon while Elvis Tsui who also starred in the original offers some welcome comic relief as the chief of the village Cai Chen visits. Yet these are little consolation for a movie that never justifies its existence paling in every respect to Ching SiuTong's classic. And the horror of it all? The filmmakers had the audacity to think that their efforts were worthy enough for them to dedicate this film to the late Leslie Cheung!".

	schema:reviewBody "A line at the closing credits of this film reads 'In Memory Forever of Leslie Cheung'  acknowledging Cheung's role in the similarlytitled 1987 film as well as its 1990 sequel. Indeed the 1987 A Chinese Ghost Story directed by Ching SiuTung in collaboration with producer Tsui Hark was a landmark movie because its 'crazy' kungfu and wirefu effects gimmicks turned it into a cult hit with western read international audiences. Its two sequels 1990 and 1991 were not as popular.Here director Wilson Yip claims that it is not a remake but a 'new' love story  and yet many elements of the 1987 film remain.THE PLOT Government official Ling Choi Sin Yu Shao Qun taking over Leslie Cheung's role journeys to the parched Black Mountain Village to help its inhabitants find water. As he leads a group of 'volunteers' up the haunted mountain he encounters a bevy of sexy demons and well as a lovely 'girl' named Siu Sin Liu YiFei. After wooing her with some candy he falls for her  and then realizes that he is caught in a deadly triangle another guy a demonhunter named Yan Chek Ha Louis Koo is also in love with Siu Sin.However before the two men can settle their differences they have to contend with the evil Tree Demon Wai YingHung as well as a onearmed demon hunter Louis Fan who is determined to kill all the supernatural beings.MY REVIEW The 1987 film has a confusing storyline and even more befuddled action sequences that have become the trademarks of Tsui Hark. Wilson Yip who gave us the two Ip Man films does not attempt to make the love story especially the one between Chek Ha and Siu Sin more plausible  or try to 'rationalise' the action sequences. Indeed some of the fighting scenes are more comical than magical and the acting appear overthetop. Liu YiFei left fits the bill as the Enchantress of the forest but I wish she can evoke more emotions besides pouting and winking her eyes.It is a good thing that Pu Song Ling's story has been adapted on the screen many times before since The Enchanting Shadow directed by Li Han Hsiang in the early 1960s. That way the plot is familiar to many in the audience and they need not rely on the flimsy narrative.".

	schema:headline " A milestone of Hongkong cinema goes Twilight";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the original three movies as a child and I have kept very positive memories about it. These movies were atmospheric artistic mysterious mythological and romantic. From the imaginative fighting scenes over the profound emotional parts up to one of the best movie soundtracks ever done in the history of cinema these movies introduced me to Chinese culture and until today I have remained fascinated by this diversified and colourful country.I am aware of the fact that remakes often fail to be on pair with the originals and I think that a remake of one of these untouchable movies shouldn't have been made. They had already done a comic adaption of the story in 1997 and now they have released some sort of remake of the original film even though both films have a slightly different story line. This movie may be dedicated to the brilliant late Leslie Cheung but in reality it's a question of business to revamp these series in times of Twilight and similar movies that are popular around the world. This movie is definitely for younger audiences and not for those who have grown up or liked the first three films. If this movie had a different title it would maybe be worth seven points but as it's directly related to the original by its title it wouldn't be worth more than five points. In the end I think that my six points are a quite fair rating for both points of view.This revamp of the series focuses a whole lot on special effects. There are too many of them they look very artificial and they are miles away from the innovating techniques of the original movies. These CGI effects don't fit at all to the beautiful landscapes the traditional clothes the old fashioned countryside villages and the mythological elements of the movie. It's as if you put aliens in a western and I always thought only Hollywood would do this kind of things.The actors in this movie do a good job but they really can't mess with the original cast. Yu Shaoqun isn't on the same level as Leslie Chung because he fails to add his own note. Louis Koo comes quite close to the original performer Wu Ma and has some strong charisma that pleases me very well. Liu Yifei gives her very best to portray a charming and innocent ghost but I really liked the supernatural grace of Joey Wong better. The supporting actors could have been more developed in this film but at least the guide and villages fool was quite addicting. I thought he was rather funny because he reminded me of a person I had met in real life.The story is close but on the same level as the original feature. I would even say that the last third of the movie and the final battle scenes were maybe even better than the original. The problem for me was the ending that I didn't like at all. It felt a little bit random and rushed. I was expecting an epic ending or a happy end but any development got suddenly aborted. I think that this ending wasted a lot of potential.In the end modern movie fans will like the special effects and fighting scenes of this movie and the popular love story. Personally I think that the new version lacks depth development magic and uniqueness and doesn't come close to the original feature that had been a true milestone for Hongkong cinema. Fans of the original shouldn't waste their time with this movie even though it's rather entertaining. They will be disappointed comparing this to the original. Those who liked this film should immediately try out the three original movies and get a lesson in truly well crafted cinema. Fans of popular movies that mix monsters and romance in the key of Twilight might though really enjoy this film.".

	schema:headline " A Chinese Ghost Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Apparently this movie is a remake of another film by the same name which was distributed sometime in the 80's. Since I haven't seen the initial film I cannot compare it with this particular movie. Adding to my difficulties is the fact that the characters listed on IMDb are not the same characters that were in the movie. For example the beautiful ghost played by Yifei Liu went by the name of Siu Sin and not Nie Xiaoquin. No doubt the translation from Chinese to English has much to do with this. Additionally the English subtitles on this film weren't of the highest caliber which helped only to a limited degree towards resolving what was clearly a strange and confusing movie to begin with. Be that as it may from what I have figured out Siu Sin is a ghost who has been enslaved by a Tree Demon similar to a succubus named Lou Lou Kara Hui. As a result Siu Sin is forced to seduce people who enter Lou Lou's temple on Black Mountain and then sucks the energy out of themwhich in turn allows Lou Lou to gain strength. One day a demon hunter named Yan Chek Ha Louis Koo appears and falls in love with Siu Sin. But in doing so he destroys his reputation with his master which causes him to go into isolation. A while later a minor government official named Ning Caichen Shaoqun Yu journeys to Black Mountain in search of water and finds Siu Sin in the temple. She initially attempts to seduce him but fails because of his innocence. This makes Lou Lou quite angry but before she can do anything about it Yan Chek Ha returns to Black Mountain with a vengeance of his own. Now while it's quite possible that I may have missed something in translation I still enjoyed the movie for the most part. It had plenty of action and the CGI complemented the movie in a major way. There was also some good humor here and there as well. Likewise it didn't hurt to have such a beautiful actress like Yifei Liu in a prominent role either. Again it's a bit confusing but those who enjoy a decent Fantasy film might want to give this one a look. Over all I rate it as slightly above average.".

Since I haven't seen the initial film I cannot compare it with this particular movie. Adding to my difficulties is the fact that the characters listed on IMDb are not the same characters that were in the movie. For example the beautiful ghost played by Yifei Liu went by the name of Siu Sin and not Nie Xiaoquin. No doubt the translation from Chinese to English has much to do with this. Additionally the English subtitles on this film weren't of the highest caliber which helped only to a limited degree towards resolving what was clearly a strange and confusing movie to begin with. Be that as it may from what I have figured out Siu Sin is a ghost who has been enslaved by a Tree Demon similar to a succubus named Lou Lou Kara Hui. As a result Siu Sin is forced to seduce people who enter Lou Lou's temple on Black Mountain and then sucks the energy out of themwhich in turn allows Lou Lou to gain strength. One day a demon hunter named Yan Chek Ha Louis Koo appears and falls in love with Siu Sin. But in doing so he destroys his reputation with his master which causes him to go into isolation. A while later a minor government official named Ning Caichen Shaoqun Yu journeys to Black Mountain in search of water and finds Siu Sin in the temple. She initially attempts to seduce him but fails because of his innocence. This makes Lou Lou quite angry but before she can do anything about it Yan Chek Ha returns to Black Mountain with a vengeance of his own. Now while it's quite possible that I may have missed something in translation I still enjoyed the movie for the most part. It had plenty of action and the CGI complemented the movie in a major way. There was also some good humor here and there as well. Likewise it didn't hurt to have such a beautiful actress like Yifei Liu in a prominent role either. Again it's a bit confusing but those who enjoy a decent Fantasy film might want to give this one a look. Over all I rate it as slightly above average.";

Unfortunately instead of exploring this new take of the story the writers decided to also include the scholar character to create some kind of love triangle.This is pointless because unlike Leslie Cheung in the original the actor who plays Ning Caichen in this film is completely devoid of any charisma. On top of this he's also a VERY AWFUL actor. As a result the audience's sympathy immediately defaults back to Louis Koo's character which admittedly is pretty cool.And here's the problem Koo's character doesn't get shown that often until the later half of the story. Instead the story decides to retell the whole encounter of Ning Caichen and Nie Xiaoqian from the original film. So you are now forced to watch some cringeworthy scenes of the chemistryless couple until the end reveals the real pairing of the story.One would also think that since the original is pretty outdated in terms of FX this one will at least have some good one. Unfortunately that's not the case either. Sure it's slightly better but it's nothing extraordinary. In fact most scenes look bland and lack the mysteryenchantment of the original.In summary disappointing remake of a classic. The only redeeming factor is the introduction of the new character played by Koo. But since he's not even featured that often in the story the whole point of a retelling ended up being moot.".

The new plot inventions are interesting and could have made this version stand a tiny little bit apart from the original so audience won't negatively compare it with the excellent original however the 2 bad leads chosen sink any slim hope it has to achieve that.

Seriously the character's face does not match their voice. I watch the Cantonese version.And the acting done by the guy who play Ning Choi San is really bad. Didn't they held an audition to find suitable actoractress? Because of the bad voice acting and unsuitable actor the only character you really care about in the whole movie is really Louis Koo alone.Also Wai Ying Hong's character as the tree monster is a bit exaggerating and ridiculous the next thing we know the villain ends up becoming the second funniest character in the movie.Finally what is wrong with Hong Kong's film industry lately? Why are there a myriad of actoractress from mainland China in Hong Kong movie lately? Most of the character in this movie are played by mainland Chinese actoractress. It's not like I'm a racist against mainland Chinese or anything but if you can't speak Cantonese don't audition for a role that needs you to speak Cantonese.

	schema:reviewBody "The main reason I wanted to watch this movie is because of the fact that it's directed by the guy that directed the first two Ip Man movies. Plus this also has the pretty Chinese actress Crystal Liu Yi Fei. Now I heard this is a remake but I don't know how closely it ties in with the original. But for this movie itself it bombarded by a lot of low budget CGI. And a lot of these Chinese fantasy movies that has a lot of cheap CGI in it tends to be bad or even awful. Watching this flick is like watching a Chinese version of Van Helsing. Except this has a demon huntertaoist hunting down succubuses with a naive young tax collectormost annoying character in this flick something about his presence is just flat out irritating. Maybe because he is a whiny and dumb character although kinda pivotal to the plot caught in a awkward relationship with a succubus. And the plot revolves around the 3 characters past and relationships. And a conflict ensues because of the 3 characters awkward relationships in a place called Black Mountain. With few other opposing threats along the way. With succubus hunting action thrown in. Actually I guessed this about 20 minutes in and was mostly on target. It's simply a very cheesy and predictable and forgettable movie. Despite the fantasy and supernatural stuff going on the plot and characters actions just doesn't make any sense. It felt like I basically just sat through this movie just so I could finish it. It's a easily forgettable flick that can be forgotten in a day. I would say few hours if the plot wasn't so narrow and simple. The romance aspect of this movie I thought should be the strong point in this Chinese fairy tale. But even that is poorly developed and clich. The direction and everything was just bland not terrible or awful but bland. This movie as a whole is just unintentionally downright silly. And far from being emotionally absorbing or even moving. The best part about this movie is Crystal Liu Yi she is really good at playing the pure and innocent characters even when she is playing the role of a succubus. And the flying sword tricks was cool.510".

I won't give away anything not even the suprise finally.  Anyway this according to me is a prime example of a classic Italian Pulpthrash 70's movie. It's complete of old ladies and children being shot in the face for no reason rapes angry people shooting each other in broad daylight.  I give 2 thumbs up. You might remember Richard Conte in the movie the Boss here he plays a character that seems to have a heartnot a big heart but at least he has one.

	schema:headline " Maurizio Merli  Unorthodox Cop in UltraViolent Rome";
	schema:reviewBody "Marino Girolami's Roma Violenta aka. Violent Rome of 1975 is a good though not exceptional Poliziottesco that is very memorable for several reasons. This was the first of three films in which Maurizio Merli played the rough and ready copper Commisarrio Betti the other two being Girolami's own Italia A Mano Armata aka A Special Cop In Action 1976 and the great Napoli Violenta Violent Naples also of 1976. This is not the best of the films in which Maurizio Merli played unorthodox cops of different names but basically the same character but it was the first one. The sequel Napoli Violenta is superior and Merli's alltime highlight is Roma A Mano Armata directed by Umberto Lenzi but Roma Violenta is the film that made him one of the greatest stars in Italian CrimeCop cinema. Furthermore this is the last film ever to star the great Richard Conte known for many films including The Godfather and Fernando Di Leo's Italian crime masterpiece Il Boss 1973.As the title promises the film takes place in Rome and a violent city it is indeed. Comissario Betti Maurizio Merli is a tough mustached copper whose unorthodox methods make Dirty Harry look quite clean. Betti is fed up with criminals getting away with their crimes and he expresses his opinion both verbally and by his tough methods of crimefighting... As most good Poliziotteschi at the time Roma Violenta is very gritty violent and delightfully politically incorrect. It seems as if Maurizio Merli was born to play supertough unorthodox cops and the role of Comissario Betti fits him like a glove. Good supporting performances come from Richard Conte Ray Lovelock and especially John Steiner who plays a ruthless criminal. Regular Genre bitpart actor Luciano Rossi is also typecast as a sadistic smalltime crook. The film is full of actionpacked car chases violent shootouts and scenes of genretypical brutality all stylishly shot and accompanied by a nice score by the De Angelis brothers. As mentioned above Violent Rome is no particular highlight of Poliziottocinema. It is not quite as stylish as some other specimen of the genre and it lacks the charismatic and diabolical main villain of films like Milano Odia  La Polizia Non Pu Sparare aka. Almost Human 1974 or Roma A Mano Armata. It is a good example for the genre however and a highly influential one too as it basically made Maurizio Merli THE unorthodox copper in Italian cinema. All things considered Violent Rome is a film that I highly recommend to any of my fellow fans of Italian genrecinema. My rating 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Violent Rome doesn't do anything that a whole load of other Italian crime flicks didn't do before it but in true genre style  it's highly entertaining and the fact that director Marino Girolami is merely rethreading old ground doesn't matter too much since its old ground worth treading again! There are a number of things that I watch these films for and violent Rome has most of them  those being car chases gun fights fist fights and good old' fashioned grit and the fact that this film delivers all those things in a robust and unflinching manner means that it pretty much hit the spot. The plot as the title suggests focuses on various criminal and violent acts in the city of Rome all the Italian cities seem to have been pretty violent in the seventies.... Commissario Betti is sick of the way that criminals can literally get away with murder because of the rules and regulations that govern the police force. It's inevitable that he would be kicked out and pretty soon he is after shooting a criminal. However there's a bunch of citizens who aren't too happy about crime either and they gladly take him in.The film takes obvious influence from Dirty Harry like most Italian cop flicks as the idea of a fed up high ranking police officer figures heavily and here it works well because the film stars the excellent Maurizio Merli who goes round beating up criminals in style and really does himself proud with his role here. The style of the film is gritty and dirty and this reflects well considering the subject material. Naturally the plot is nothing to write home about and it's clear that the director was more interested in entertaining the audience than putting on a show with any meaning  but that is fine with me! This does mean that we never really have any reason to care even when the emotion surrounding one of the leading characters comes up. Violent Rome like the later Violent Naples also starring Maurizio Marli in the same role! has more than it's fair share of cheese too...but somehow that sort of stuff goes well with the rest of the film. On the whole Violent Rome may not be one of the best Italian crimes films of all time  but it's a good one and I doubt that fans of these films will regret seeing it!".

It's the sensation of one and a half hour adrenalin rushing all your body's blood getting pumped to the heart at high speed and a delirium in your brains! When I watch a Poliziotteschi flick and if it's a good one I always feel revitalized and ablaze afterwards. Roma Violenta certainly isn't the greatest movie of its kind and nearly not even the best Maurizio Merli movie but even the slightlylessthanstellar Poliziotteschi efforts are absolute mustsees for cult fanatics and so is this one! Roma Violenta is the first entry in a trilogy revolving on protagonist Commissioner Betti. But don't pay too much attention to the chronological order and details of these three separate movies. Personally I watched the first film last it didn't matter one bit. Betti is the only recurring character in the series but furthermore there is no continuity whatsoever and some actors like John Saxon and Luciano Rossi even depict different characters in two different movies. Commissioner Betti is a tough and unorthodox cop in Rome. His heart bleeds as he witnesses how the city streets are infested with criminals and particularly how they always become more violent and relentless due to weak legislations and cunning lawyers. There are pointless assassinations on public buses bloody bank robberies supermarket heists vicious rapes unhappily ending hostage takings and even police officer annihilation. Betti's pursuing methods are efficient but very borderline and he regularly comes into conflict with his superiors. When Betti shoots a bank robber in cold blood after a bloody wild car chase with several casualties including his young partner he finally loses his cop badge. He isn't unemployed for long though as he joins an elite vigilante squad where he can carelessly beat nasty villains' faces to pulp! Hooray! Admittedly the plots of nearly all Poliziotteschi movies are always the same and you always know they'll feature mandatory car chases gratuitous nudity and shocking images of innocent people like nice old ladies or teenagers getting slaughtered. But the vile truth is that you simply cannot wait to see it happen! Once again the highlight here is a virulent chase with plenty of awesome Fiat and Simca cars going in severe overdrive and a few deaths that are almost too brutal to describe that poor hostage!. Roma Violenta doesn't feature such a good soundtrack as usually the case but acting performances are truly topnotch this time. Maurizio moustache Merli is terrific of course but there are also great supportive performances from Ricard Conte Ray Lovelock and John Steiner.".

There are probably a few too many fist fights and beatings but some are most effective and the central car chase was magnificent and I'm not a real fan of them. Gritty ruthless and unstoppable like the main film itself. There is even time for a sleazy episode when a daughter enters the scene at the wrong time.

Notwithstanding but for the neat direction by Girolami it would not have been so effective since the script itself is not anything specific invariably appears disjointed and towards the end the ensemble is not even concerned about clarifying why another outburst of violence embarks on. Likewise the material lacks a strong antagonist who could emerge out of the shady streets of Rome and eventually face Betti. Another element which might not be utterly engaging is a sociopolitical commentary on the situation in the Italy which feels a sort of out of place and somehow contrasts with the mindlessly actionpacked remainder of the flick. Instead of pushing the boundaries of pastime into the same directions as unabashedly entertaining Live Like a Cop Die Like a Man 1975 by Ruggero Deodato it aspires higher but it's impossible to render something serious if it's basically this kind of actionier. Thus making allowances for those aspects Girolami allows it all to flow and generally focuses on shootouts and fistfights on account of which obtains an imposingly electrifying atmosphere reminiscent of a collage consisting of gliding bullets enormous squibs and outstanding Merli ceaselessly ready to utilize his gun in the midst. The simplicity of rendition is one of the biggest benefits of this motion picture that makes it all so compelling. The best moment of Violent Rome might be the car chase when commissioner Betti pursues one of the villains played by John Steiner. The climax is so stimulating that one is capable of smelling exhaust fumes as well as the reek of burnt tyres. The execution is superb  the editing is sharp but it never distracts and one is likely to agree that it's an extraordinarily riveting scene which stays in one's mind.Maurizio Merli is very strong as commissioner Betti. He conveys a lot of charisma to his character as well as succeeds in creating a respectable and tough cop the one who a delinquent wouldn't like to deal with. Ray Lovelock plays an undercover policeman who invariably comes in handy and provides Betti with multiple indispensable pieces of information. He is quite likable and believable in his role as a young smug blonde. There are also numerous faces which all film buffs keen on Eurocult cinema are familiar with. The soundtrack by Guido  Maurizio de Angelis is absolutely terrific and it's difficult to conceive another composer who could be able to replace this duo. Brothers de Angelis grasping the point of the movie and their task as musicians compose a fast aggressive and catchy soundtrack which contextualises with this action flick phenomenally.While certainly imperfect Violent Rome is wellpaced ruggedly crafted and stunningly scored. It serves its purpose perfectly and it's genuinely hard to remain indifferent to its charm. Though it structurally isn't the most impressive work of all time it's a great portion of delicious and nutritious grindhouse salad with loads of bloodilyred tomato sauce which is bound to leave its viewers satisfied.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Conte signed out on a relatively high note on this nottoo bad Italian cop film quickly put together as a spiritual sequel to 1973's LA POLIIZIA INCRIMINA LA LEGGE ASSOLVE. The producers couldn't get Franco Nero or Enzo G. Castellari to come back so instead what they did was hire Nero's lookalike Maurizio Merli and Castellari's father Marino Girolami to direct. On top of that they brought back genre regulars Silvano Tranquilli Massimo Vanni etc. as well as Guido and Maurizio De Angelis to score often relying on music tracks taken right out of LA POLIZIA. This would not be the only Eurocrime movie to do this.As relatively cheap and rough as this movie feels with plenty of awkward scenes and barely a plot to speak of this movie is notable for 3 big points1 Maurizio Merli. Merli could have just been a cookiecutter fill in for Franco Nero but very much makes it his own with a new definition for physicality. Merli's first act upon entering frame is to clench his jaw and grind his teeth standing over a poor homicide victim. From then on out it's hell to pay as Merli shoots beats footchases and carchases his way through the criminal underground with dogged determination. It's a formula that worked so well that he repeated it about a dozen times in the following 5 years... usually with Attilio Duse as his clueless loyal sidekick.2 The car chase! While there were a lot of great ones in the genre the chase in this film I find the most deliciously entertaining. It takes us through the streets parks and highways of Rome gloriously destroying several cars a flower stand a random pile of freeway debris and several innocent bystanders before it ends. The first crash of the chase is a particular delight spinning in circles with glass and metal flying in all directions.3 John Steiner. This film also gave the fledgling British character actor a whole new career by casting him in a small but extremely memorable part as a particularly violent and snarky bankrobber. While Steiner had already had a few memorable villain roles he said that this film changed the game for him like no other and secured him nonstop work for the following 15 years. He's hilarious mischievous and ultimately frightening in the second of the film's two careerdefining roles.Even if you're a casual fan of the genre I'd recommend you give this film a try. It represented a paradigmshift unlike any other film in the genre and set the table nicely for Umberto Lenzi's several subsequent contributions.".

Director Marino Girolami invests the film with plenty of style cool exciting music some of the finest genre actors around and places hardedged action at the centre of the film.Never has a movie lived up to its title so well as this film contains some of the most brutal violence you will ever see. Innocent bystanders are bloodily gunned down by criminals men slug it out with killer blows and sharp slaps to the faces which look like they really hurt ferocious men shoot each other with guns and machine guns in broad daylight and turn each other into Swiss cheese as a result. The film goes really overthetop as it tries to shock the viewer as much as possible in some moments. Highlights include a crippled man in a wheelchair being beaten to within an inch of his life an innocent lady being stripped and raped and a thug opening fire on a park full of happy people and mowing them down from a passing car.Meanwhile Maurizio Merli  who after the international success of this movie found himself typecast in such productions for years to come always playing exactly the same part his name would sometimes change but never his character  goes gunning for the criminals engaging them in handtohand combat shootouts and exciting car chases which really show off the excellent Rome location photography. Sometimes he just shoots them in the back to be sure. The strong supporting cast includes veteran Richard Conte as the leader of a vigilante group which Merli joins Ray Lovelock as an undercover friend of Merli's who gets machine gunned during an exciting bank raid and John Steiner as a suave English villain who is coincidentally dubbed by the same guy who did Lovelock's voice in THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE.The photography is crisp and fluid at all moments and the film has superb pacing which never lets up until the bizarre ending which you have to admit is pretty offbeat as is the case in a number of Italian productions. Girolami's excellent direction is what makes this movie so good and although the plot twists and turns and many characters come and go VIOLENT ROME retains a relative simplicity which makes it so watchable. Fans looking for a traditional game of copsandrobbers played out in some authentic Italian locations should check out this movie as one of the highlights of the Italian polizia genre.".

This movie is set in present day which at the time was 1988in a small town of the U.S.  These two high school sweethearts get pregnant and decide that although both sets of parents are against it they are going to get married.  It's the story of their successes and trials that they face throughout their pregnancy and once the baby is born while they are married.  Molly Ringwald is wonderful in the movie but then I think she's one of the most talented actresses who unfortunately was typecasted so much really wasn't able to overcome it after the '80s.  Her leading man is also very good.  I found him to be a great pick for that role and he made you believe he really was his character. This movie is sweet sincere and really true to what the message is trying to say. I love this movie and hope that all of you will take the time to watch it. It's not only educational but romantic and heartwarming. I give it a 10 out of 10.That's my review.".

It seemed to me that someone from some parents league had cornered the director and said something like If you make a lighthearted comedy about pregnant teens then teens all over America are going to think it's fun to have a baby... Why not show some of the problems young couples with children have to face? The second part of the movie piles on so much trouble misfortune and drama that it seems like some kind of Lifetime docudrama. So much in their young lives goes wrong that in order to have an acceptable ending too much has to go right all at once. The ending just doesn't seem believable because it is such a sudden jump from the end of the second act.I liked the characters who remained believable throughout the various situations.

'For Keeps' is quite a decent and likable film and it brings that nostalgic 80's feel. I found the ending to be a little rushed but otherwise its exploration of a teenage couple trying to make it on their own was interestingly executed. Randall Batinkoff and Molly Ringwald are superb and a fit cast. Both actors have great chemistry. Their expression of Stan and Darcy's naivety devotion towards and love for one another and struggle to make it is well depicted on screen. The supporting cast is good too. Director Avildsen adds humour in the most unexpected scenes preventing the film from going over the top with melodrama and instead bringing a smile to the viewer. The movie has received a lot of undue criticism but I believe 'For Keeps' is among the underrated films of the 80s.".

The story might not be set into the breathtaking New Zealand landscapes but instead to a place we all might relate to. Same goes with the situation the two youngsters end up in. They are intelligent and ambitious and they have a solid plan how they intend to waltz through life. However plans are just plans when life takes an interesting turn for you and this movie portrays such a situation with skill. Yes it's a bit predictable but romantic movies tend to be so eh? The plot moves at a brisk pace and I felt there were no unnecessary scenes or characters. Even the minor characters there's a comedic relief guy too stayed very minor as the story concentrated on the two youngsters.The most interesting thing in this movie for me was how the two youngsters try to cope with their new situation responsibilities and emotions. They love each other but it is not easy all the time. Are there any couples who could say that statement is untrue? Their responsible families are not perfect as it is in real life and cause problems by loving too much.

Then both sets of grandparents save from Stan's mother are against them keeping the baby. One real scenario being that MOST parents always try to control their child's future... in this case the kids made their own decisions and showed maturity in taking full responsibility for their actions.

	schema:headline " Doesn't work as a comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "For Keeps is a film that makes plenty of good points regarding teen pregnancy. Trouble is none of them are very funny. The film is a misguided vehicle for Molly Ringwald whose career plummeted afterwords. Ringwald plays a high school senior named Darcy who is impregnated by her high school boyfriend Stan. Both kids seemed to have bright futures ahead of them until they decide to keep their baby and end up having to abandon their respective dreams. The film was marketed as a comedy and that is just irresponsible. The only laughs in the film come from Stan's father and his incredibly chauvinistic comments he makes about things like stretch marks and the need for handles on mattresses. Honestly this guy could make a caveman seem civilized.Credit must be given to the writers and director John G. Avildsen however. They don't really pull any punches when they detail just how difficult it can be for two teenagers to get married and try to raise a child. Many issues are discussed thoughtfully including abortion lack of money lack of facilities at colleges for studentparents and the loss of innocence. Darcy originally plans to abort the child but cannot go through with it. The film wisely avoids dumping on the practice of abortion and just simply makes it Darcy's choice. She does not want to get one. Simple as that. The two try to rent a filthy apartment but end up having to move back in with Darcy's mother. Stan does not adjust well to the thought of staying home with his wife and new daughter and he begins to go out and drink quite often. Darcy's mother is portrayed as a jaded single mom who wants Stan out of her daughter's life. As you can see the film chronicles one hardship after another for these two from the minute Darcy decides to have the baby. Much of it is very poignant. Just not very funny.You get the sense that Advildsen just gives up trying to make the audience laugh after about the first half hour. He could obviously sense that there just weren't many laughs to be had in this script. Still he tries to go for the picture perfect type of ending his more successful films Rocky The Karate Kid were known for. Writer Tim Kazurinsky who is at times brilliant cannot come up with any true comedic wisdom here. Contrast this film with the wonderful ...About Last Night and you can clearly see the difference. That film was a terrific blend of comedy and drama. For Keeps is pretty much all drama with a few chuckles. It must be said that Ringwald is exceptional as Darcy. Too bad this film kind of killed things for her. Randall Batinkoff has been solid in other films but not here. Once the baby is born he becomes a crying whining jerk who is impossible to sympathize with. Overall the film is a misfire. It never should have been marketed as a comedy. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	onyx:emotionText "For Keeps is a film that makes plenty of good points regarding teen pregnancy. Trouble is none of them are very funny. The film is a misguided vehicle for Molly Ringwald whose career plummeted afterwords. Ringwald plays a high school senior named Darcy who is impregnated by her high school boyfriend Stan. Both kids seemed to have bright futures ahead of them until they decide to keep their baby and end up having to abandon their respective dreams. The film was marketed as a comedy and that is just irresponsible. The only laughs in the film come from Stan's father and his incredibly chauvinistic comments he makes about things like stretch marks and the need for handles on mattresses. Honestly this guy could make a caveman seem civilized.Credit must be given to the writers and director John G. Avildsen however. They don't really pull any punches when they detail just how difficult it can be for two teenagers to get married and try to raise a child. Many issues are discussed thoughtfully including abortion lack of money lack of facilities at colleges for studentparents and the loss of innocence. Darcy originally plans to abort the child but cannot go through with it. The film wisely avoids dumping on the practice of abortion and just simply makes it Darcy's choice. She does not want to get one. Simple as that. The two try to rent a filthy apartment but end up having to move back in with Darcy's mother. Stan does not adjust well to the thought of staying home with his wife and new daughter and he begins to go out and drink quite often. Darcy's mother is portrayed as a jaded single mom who wants Stan out of her daughter's life. As you can see the film chronicles one hardship after another for these two from the minute Darcy decides to have the baby. Much of it is very poignant. Just not very funny.You get the sense that Advildsen just gives up trying to make the audience laugh after about the first half hour. He could obviously sense that there just weren't many laughs to be had in this script. Still he tries to go for the picture perfect type of ending his more successful films Rocky The Karate Kid were known for. Writer Tim Kazurinsky who is at times brilliant cannot come up with any true comedic wisdom here. Contrast this film with the wonderful ...About Last Night and you can clearly see the difference. That film was a terrific blend of comedy and drama. For Keeps is pretty much all drama with a few chuckles. It must be said that Ringwald is exceptional as Darcy. Too bad this film kind of killed things for her. Randall Batinkoff has been solid in other films but not here. Once the baby is born he becomes a crying whining jerk who is impossible to sympathize with. Overall the film is a misfire. It never should have been marketed as a comedy. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.";

This was for many reasons.. partly because it's director was the executive producer of 'Troll 2' and the movie was made at around the same time and party because it was rumoured to have used one of the goblin costumes from 'Troll 2'. This I had to see.The Quest for the mighty sword is a very interesting movie. Starring a barbarian called Ator it is a 'Sword and Sorcery' movie with so many reasons that it should never have happened at all. TQFTMS is a culmination of almost a decade of bad movies. It is in fact the fourth movie in the 'Ator' quadrilogy. This series of movies is one that is amazing to have survived so long. The first one promotes incest and Ator fights a giant spider. In the second he fights a giant sock puppet snake and has a mute ninja partner called 'Thong'. By the time we get to the third Ator has dyed his hair grown a ponytail and gotten all arty with scantly clad women dancing about and very little spoken in the entire film. That'll be a new director for you. But the fourth movie this is where the bad movie magic lives. Back with the original director so soon? He'd only just left but with a whole new actor for Ator TQFTMS pulls out all the stops despite being the third lower budget sequel of an already low budget movie.TQFTMS is the sort of movie that should win awards. It should win every kind of movie award you have never heard of. If I had a say in the Oscars TQFTMS would be winning the following Best misleading title in a movie It's called 'The Quest for the mighty sword'. But Ator Jr. finds the mighty sword within the first half hour of the movie under a rock IN THE CAVE THAT HE LIVES IN! Some 'Quest' that was. As for the rest of the plot he wanders about randomly until he bumps into an exgoddess that once tried to save his dad. After shacking up with the demigod he wanders about randomly until he bumps into his long lost cursed mum. After fixing her he wanders about randomly until he bumps into a godking that kidnapped his demigod lover at some random point in the movie. After that he wanders about randomly until he is declared complete winner of the movie. Then he just wanders about randomly but happily ever after.Best 'Hotpants on a Hero' Not entirely sure what Ator was thinking with that one. But I know what I think. He must work out Best use of the same actor to play both father and son So what he's playing his seventeen year old son now? That's some acting range. It actually takes a bit of effort to work out that he is now a different character. Perhaps too much effort for a movie of this calibre.Best use of costume borrowed from directors other movies For the actual use of a goblin costume from troll 2.Best use of the same costume for every goblin in a movie For use of a goblin costume  er from troll 2.Best use of girlie laugh for a monster And the Goblin from troll two scores a hatrick! Best incestuous use of costume ideas from movies with the same character. Isn't that the iron warrior costume from the 3rd movie? did that director let you do that after what you said about his movie? Best use of the 'Hero dies in the first five minutes' plot twist I never thought I'd see that twist in a movie. Brave story choices like that kind of makes you feel alienated towards Hollywood though.Best use of atmosphere destroying light hearted music to represent an evil character Oh he can't believe it four out of four the goblin is Ecstatic! Best use of XXL Tshirt to create a Siamese two headed robot This is the stupidest robot ever. For something that was described to Ator as practically invincible he outsmarts it pretty easily the old 'duck below it's field of view and sneak up from behind' trick I bet it had never seen that one before.Best use of monster costumes from entirely different movies For the use of the Japanese Godzilla costume. They did change it significantly though by covering it in snot.But TQFTMS gets an honourable mention for the following This is a sword and sorcery flick. I'm thinking barbarians kings queens castles and perhaps the odd legendary monster. But to have the bar scene full of aliens neon lighting and pubbrawls  the only thing that was missing was the blaster guns. Well done that movie! Best use of the 'sleeping beauty' clich in a movie. Well it had ripped off every other type of movie. I suppose the cartoon genre was the next obvious choice.As you know however I unfortunately have no control over the Oscars yet and so TQFTMS will have to remain a little heard of underdog to the big budget giants.In Conclusion This is a movie that seems to be scraping the barrel for plot ideas. Our hero bumbles about discovering one coincidental yet random event after another... and then it ends. With an absolute zero budget Joe D'Amato thought far bigger than any sane man would and used every corner cutting device to try and create and all action blockbuster. He failed miserably.".

Witness such side splitting sights as an hideous goblindwarf type thing cut clean in two down the middle after repeatedly taunting our hero a conjoined robot! a rubbery fire breathing dragon that more closely resembles a walking turd just check out the hero's expression when he first lays eyes upon it! a mad warty prince who wants to make a statue out of the films heroine and a wacky and completely unresolved ending! Add it all together and you've got a great piece of trash entertainment! Highly recommended for fans of bad movies although still far from on par with Ator The Invincible aka The Blade Master aka The Cave Dwellers which still stands as truly one of the highest pinnacles ever of trash cinema.".

Another movie titled Iron Warrior directed by Alfonso Brescia also starred O'Keeffe as Ator however he wasn't quite the same character in this movie. Massaccesi wasn't very pleased with Iron Warrior he wasn't the only one so he retook his series and made this official sequel with Eric Allan Kramer as Ator. No surprise that O'Keeffe didn't return as Massaccesi has stated that he can't act! Kramer makes a decent Ator and I'm disappointed that he didn't make another Ator movie. Quest For The Mighty Sword has never been released on DVD and the VHS tape is out of print. The budget is low the effects aren't so special and the directing and acting are fairtomiddling. Still I love these types of movies despite their low ambitions as they show that films don't need to have a huge budget or big name stars for me to have a lot of fun watching them!".

Unfortunately I placed this film above the original film in the series on my Netflix queue! Yes that means I haven't yet seen the first film but fortunately the second one gives a recap of events leading up to the next film. And I promise to see the first one ASAP! This film finds the priest being punished by the church for being so pugnacious. He's sent to a horrible parishthe top of a mountain where there are almost no people and those who do live there mostly just stay home. He has little to do and is bored. At the same time his old town is NOT happy now that he's gone. Despite several townspeople hating him especially the mayor the rest of the folks are miserable and stop participating in church activities and the church falls into a state of disrepair. The bottom line is that the town despite pushing him to be replaced really wants him back.Eventually he is returned to the town and there are several crises that need his help. The one that persists throughout the episode is the problem about building a dam. The city needs it to stop flooding but the guy with the land is being stubborn and won't agree to let them use it. The communist mayor hates to admit it but he needs Don Camillo's helpnot just with this but with his oldest son. Unfortunately for Don Camillo he can't just punch people and make things right and must rely on God's guidance through some tough times. And not surprisingly by the end change takes place in the most unusual and unexpected waysand with the most unexpected people.This is a nice gentle comedy and it reminded me a bit of the Catanflas film The Little Priest from Mexico. Both films feature very unconventional priests who sometimes resort to worldly solutions to problems. In the case of Catanflas he might gamblebut all for God's glory. And with Fernandel he uses his fistsbut again to God's glory. What makes this unusual though is that Jesus talks to himtelling him that this is NOT the way to solve problems! While this might seem a bit sacrilegious it seemed pretty benign to meand Jesus did not come off badly as a result.By the way I was surprised that this was an Italian film. I naturally assumed that with Fernandel it would be a French language film and him speaking Italian surprised me as I'd only seen him speaking French in the other films in which I'd seen him.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another excellent film in Duvivier's Don Camillo series. A sequel to the first film it resumes at the exact moment its predecessor left off with the obstinate priest heading into exile on the train.There are a few less humorous moments in this sequel and the pacing is a little problematic at times with several slow periods but the film overcomes this as its builds towards its conclusion.There is much more symbolism in this entry. As Don Camillo enters his exile he is also faced with a spiritual drought as Jesus seemingly falls silent. Camillo's exile is on a mountain a traditional place for seeking communion with God yet here God seems to be silent. The scene in which Don struggles up the mountain track in the rain with the crucifix is possibly the most powerful in series.The battle of wits with the mayor is a little laboured this time but there are still many many wonderful comic moments most notably those involving the elderly villager who repeatedly refuses to die.Despite a few mild criticisms this film again comes extremely highly recommended for the whole family.

	onyx:emotionText "This is another excellent film in Duvivier's Don Camillo series. A sequel to the first film it resumes at the exact moment its predecessor left off with the obstinate priest heading into exile on the train.There are a few less humorous moments in this sequel and the pacing is a little problematic at times with several slow periods but the film overcomes this as its builds towards its conclusion.There is much more symbolism in this entry. As Don Camillo enters his exile he is also faced with a spiritual drought as Jesus seemingly falls silent. Camillo's exile is on a mountain a traditional place for seeking communion with God yet here God seems to be silent. The scene in which Don struggles up the mountain track in the rain with the crucifix is possibly the most powerful in series.The battle of wits with the mayor is a little laboured this time but there are still many many wonderful comic moments most notably those involving the elderly villager who repeatedly refuses to die.Despite a few mild criticisms this film again comes extremely highly recommended for the whole family. The warmth and humour negate any potential for didacticism. Instead we have one of the classic characters from world literature brought perfectly to life by Fernandel in a wonderful comedy classic that will be loved by Christians of all denominations.";

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen or even the worse 'Maciste' movie I've ever seen...believe it or not this movie is an order of magnitude better than Maciste Against Hercules In the Valley Of Woe. It is a clunker of a swordandsandals movie but it still has a kind of innocence about it as if the actors and the film crew knew they were just churning out product but still had some pride in their work.For some reason the folks who brought it over to the English speaking world didn't want to admit this was another in the series of terrible 'Maciste' movies and so it went by the title of 'Colossus and the Headhunters'.The plot is a drunken walk which makes even the later Hercules movies look coherent and well thought out. The whole thing is really just an excuse to show off the physique of the actor playing MacisteColossus as he strains to open doors pick stuff up throw stuff topple a tower onto some fighting villagers etc. There's also some decent sword fighting and a nice thing where he beats up bad guys with chains and other props. But there isn't really all that much of him in the movie which see below. It's mostly just minor character actors and extras running around in loincloths and armor and hitting each other with swords and clubs.This guy named 'Kirk Morris' who plays Maciste is built pretty well. He resembles a latter day Strongfort or Maxim. But aside from a really tiny waist and some decent pecs he isn't really all that impressive as a centerpiece for a film about a Body. It also seems to me that most of the time he's sucking in his gut so hard that he has very little energy left to 'act' with and this also results in his tending to move as if someone stuck a poker up his backside. This could be why Maciste hardly DOES anything in this film at least compared to a typical Hercules film where half the film is Herc front and center in the action beating the stuffing out of the bad guys...Steve Reeves and Reg Park and even Alan Steele could move quite convincingly on short noticebut poor Kirk Morris might have been somewhat out of his league in meeting action hero demands.Yet another terrible dubbing job makes it hard to tell how good the writing and the acting actually is but you can bet that this film started out as throwaway hackwork and was dragged down several more notches by the dub. I'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt and say that the writing and acting in its original language would be slightly better than a Republic chapter serial.There is a hilarious moment in the MST3K version of the movie where three of the good guys set out from the ravaged village where a major fight has taken place in pursuit of the kidnapped princess and they just skip right over some of the fallen corpses of their fellow villagers on their way out of the square. Mike and the Bots moan in disbelief Ohhhh DON'T hop over the bodies...! That's just wrong!You'd be better off counting crossstitch than wasting time with this movie but it's harmless enough.".

	schema:headline " One for the fans";
	schema:reviewBody "A hilariously cheesy and shoddy peplum epic hampered by a low budget which actually makes the cheaplyproduced events and perils all the more funny. It starts off brilliantly with an incredible volcano explosion which sees a number of extras crushed by polystyrene masonry. Sure enough our Italian hero Maciste dressed in a mere loincloth for the entire movie arrives just in the nick of time on his raft to save the lives of the remaining passengers a bunch of shiftylooking Italian nobodies who of course are eternally grateful.Soon the raft people land on another island which looks nice on the outside. You just know it'll hold lurking dangers don't you? Sure enough while looking for food Maciste is shot and left for dead by a pair of hunters. Strangely enough the wound moves from his chest to his shoulder when he revives  I wish I had that ability. Maciste befriends Queen Amoa and a relationship predictably blossoms between the pair. Before long however the majority of the Queen's tribe are slaughtered and the Queen herself is kidnapped by those hilariously ineffective headhunters who jump around and have a town decorated with heads on sticks! It's around this point that a sequence worthy of an Italian Gothic appears probably the bestmade part of the film. Maciste and his friends explore the ruins of an ancient castle wandering through forgotten stone passageways by torchlight and finding various skeletons and mummies mouldering about. Sure the scene only lasts for about five minutes but its good stuff nonetheless and atmospheric too. Why is it that most pepla must have at least one horrorinspired scene in them?After rescuing an old duffer who has apparently been lurking in the dungeons for decades strangely his legs still work though Maciste must battle dozens of vicious headhunters in a wellchoreographed fight scene which gets the adrenaline going. Shortly afterwards he amusingly cuts a rope bridge over which the headhunters are crossing sending them to their doom. Meanwhile the headhunters are beheading their captives left right and centre whilst the traitorous leader gears up to marry Amoa. Luckily the worst screen dancer in history pops up to prolong things just long enough for Maciste and his friends to attack in a ferocious battle scene which contains lots of arrow impalements. It's actually rather good. The traitor kidnaps the Queen and briefly flees to the muchfabled Golden City before being attacked and murdered by Maciste who sails away with the Queen into the sunset.Well with a plot like that how could this film fail to entertain?

	onyx:emotionText "A hilariously cheesy and shoddy peplum epic hampered by a low budget which actually makes the cheaplyproduced events and perils all the more funny. It starts off brilliantly with an incredible volcano explosion which sees a number of extras crushed by polystyrene masonry. Sure enough our Italian hero Maciste dressed in a mere loincloth for the entire movie arrives just in the nick of time on his raft to save the lives of the remaining passengers a bunch of shiftylooking Italian nobodies who of course are eternally grateful.Soon the raft people land on another island which looks nice on the outside. You just know it'll hold lurking dangers don't you? Sure enough while looking for food Maciste is shot and left for dead by a pair of hunters. Strangely enough the wound moves from his chest to his shoulder when he revives  I wish I had that ability. Maciste befriends Queen Amoa and a relationship predictably blossoms between the pair. Before long however the majority of the Queen's tribe are slaughtered and the Queen herself is kidnapped by those hilariously ineffective headhunters who jump around and have a town decorated with heads on sticks! It's around this point that a sequence worthy of an Italian Gothic appears probably the bestmade part of the film. Maciste and his friends explore the ruins of an ancient castle wandering through forgotten stone passageways by torchlight and finding various skeletons and mummies mouldering about. Sure the scene only lasts for about five minutes but its good stuff nonetheless and atmospheric too. Why is it that most pepla must have at least one horrorinspired scene in them?After rescuing an old duffer who has apparently been lurking in the dungeons for decades strangely his legs still work though Maciste must battle dozens of vicious headhunters in a wellchoreographed fight scene which gets the adrenaline going. Shortly afterwards he amusingly cuts a rope bridge over which the headhunters are crossing sending them to their doom. Meanwhile the headhunters are beheading their captives left right and centre whilst the traitorous leader gears up to marry Amoa. Luckily the worst screen dancer in history pops up to prolong things just long enough for Maciste and his friends to attack in a ferocious battle scene which contains lots of arrow impalements. It's actually rather good. The traitor kidnaps the Queen and briefly flees to the muchfabled Golden City before being attacked and murdered by Maciste who sails away with the Queen into the sunset.Well with a plot like that how could this film fail to entertain? Sure it's cheesy but that's the way we like it. Kirk Morris once again essays the role of the famous Italian strongman flexing his muscles all over and remaining one of my favourite peplum actors. The supporting cast are instantly forgettable but who notices them when Maciste's around?

	schema:reviewBody "This film features the Italian hero Maciste who is an adventurer super strong type a bit like the Greek Hercules. So much so that a few of Maciste's adventures there were a lot of them back in the 60's were repackaged as Hercules films here in the United States. This was the case with the 1964 Maciste film that is more well known as Hercules Against the Moon Men. This one was given the title Colossus and the Headhunters which was a bit strange seeing as how during the duration of the film the hero was never referred to as Colossus but rather the Italian name Maciste. My guess they did not go with giving the name Hercules to the film due to the hero not sporting a beard like would be the case with the Moon Men film. Heck in that one the actor playing Maciste would be the man who was Steve Reeves' stuntman in the first two Hercules films. So these two characters kind of cross together in many ways. This film was one of two Maciste films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 along with Moon Men while Hercules would be riffed a total of three times though they did tend to make it out like the Moon Men one was a Hercules film too. This film is not as good as the Moon Men film as that one may have featured an overly long sandstorm sequence but at least it had some good traps and a few monsters within it. This one for the most part is a bit of a yawn after what was kind of an explosive way to start a movie! The story has an island having a volcanic eruption. When I was watching this I thought the people were cavemen or something but then a guy who seemed more Spartan showed up and then a big muscle dude comes along and gets as many people as he can on his raft so that the people can escape this explosive onslaught as the volcano claims the island. At this point I suspected it was another Maciste film and when I checked online I would learn my instincts were correct. After the eruption which seems almost as if there needed some sort of backstory but there is none the people float around until they reach land where they are promptly captured and Maciste wounded. Turns out their captors are not the bad guys and we learn of this tribe of headhunters who helped this one man overthrow this queen and her people and they soon capture her and the king may be alive and a lot of stuff is thrown in before a rather boring mob scene climax that is not as cool as the opening volcanic eruption.This made for a rather funny episode of MST3K. Joel did the previous films featuring Hercules and Maciste but Mike is the one that was burdened with it this time. This one is the worst of the films as the Hercules films were actually well done and even the Moon one had its moments. This one was just watching Maciste walking through brush through much of the film. They kept referring to him as Macheesesteak as that is what it sounded like his name was. There are also funny moments during the end as the 'wedding' ceremony breaks down into an all out fight.So this film was not all that good after the volcano scene which basically started the film off with a bang! Granted it was a bang that really needed a bit of story behind it and I am wondering if the previous Maciste film ended with him discovering the island and the volcano about to erupt or something. I do know there were a lot of Maciste films back in the 60's however I am not as sure if they followed each other as closely as the Hercules films as those films picked up after each other. If the Moon one is the next film then the answer to whether the Maciste films pick up after each other is a resounding 'no'.".

Inducing drowsiness or sleep is an understatement  leaving the viewer comatose is more like it. Colossus and the Headhunters is the very definition of a dull movie. Every single moment is a complete and utter bore. Erupting volcanoes and battles between armies have all the excitement of taking a bottle of sleeping pills. The actors certainly don't help matters any. The present all the life and vitality of a tree stump. Kirk Morris as Colossus actually he's called Maciste pronounced macheesesteak in the movie is the worst offender. You would have to search far and wide to find a more unappealing donothing hero. He's even late for the film's climatic battle scene.If you must watch Colossus and the Headhunters make sure you've just had a good nap loadup on the caffeine and grab some toothpicks to help hold your eyes open. You're gonna need it.".

Inducing drowsiness or sleep is an understatement  leaving the viewer comatose is more like it. Colossus and the Headhunters is the very definition of a dull movie. Every single moment is a complete and utter bore. Erupting volcanoes and battles between armies have all the excitement of taking a bottle of sleeping pills. The actors certainly don't help matters any. The present all the life and vitality of a tree stump. Kirk Morris as Colossus actually he's called Maciste pronounced macheesesteak in the movie is the worst offender. You would have to search far and wide to find a more unappealing donothing hero. He's even late for the film's climatic battle scene.If you must watch Colossus and the Headhunters make sure you've just had a good nap loadup on the caffeine and grab some toothpicks to help hold your eyes open. You're gonna need it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Endgame is set in a hollowed out metropolis of the year 2025. People are entertained by the ultimate reality show called Endgame. It's really what Survivor should be. Ron Shannon is Endgame's greatest champ. Kurt Karnak is his bitter rival. During the game a mutant helps Shannon to defeat Karnak but Shannon spares his life. Bad move? Shannon is then enlisted by a band of mutants attempting to escape the city. Of course a suitcase full of gold sweetens the deal for Shannon who then rounds up a band of cutthroats to help him including Ninja the coolest guy in the film. He bites it too quick. There are many great fight scenes in this movie one involving blind monks and another with a gang led by a man who is half fish. The fish guy is involved in a very disturbing rape scene with Laura Gemsler. Eventually the number of the group is whittled down to Shannon but the mission gets accomplished anyway. Shannon is asked by LilithGemsler to join the mutants which he doesn't. Not too smart because Lilith is pretty hot. Wouldn't you know it as the chopper flies off out comes Karnak to battle Shannon for the gold. The movie ends just as the battle starts which actually is a cool way to go.I love this movie a lot. The first third is a bit slow but once they leave the city the action is nonstop. The battle with the blind monks is amazing and exciting. Motorcycles and gunplay highlight the scene. The next battle with a group of mutants is just as cool except Ninja dies here and I must say that just blows big time. But oh well.Endgame also has a very depressing feel to it. It really is very bleak. Man seems to be digressing by way of mutations and while Lilith's group seem to be advanced they are hunted down out of fear. To be honest the bleakness is what appeals to me.Ron Shannon is played by Al Cliver and his performance is understated at best but it works here. The real show stealer is George Eastman as Kurt Karnak. He dives into his role with flair. He's ruthless and amoral just what the postnuke world needs.This movie is worth seeing and if you're a fan of the genre then it's a must see.910".

Naturally these blind types aren't the best at aim or tactics and are summarily mown town in waves much like ZULU or THE ALAMO. However this scene alone is quite funny and stands out as a reason to see this movie above most of the rest of Postapocalyptic dirge the Italians flooded out in the early 80's to capitalize off of MAD MAX 2.Lots of cool shootouts lots of cheesy gore and makeup and a lot of silly dialog make this movie a winner for fans of Italian Cmovies. On top of that the cast is hard to beat with an odd assortment of Spaghetti Western Polizioteschi and Sexploitation movie veterans not seeming too out of their element wearing goofy costumes and fighting each other in the same abandoned rock quarry. Massacessi who began and ended his career making smut had a brief period in the 80's where he really tried hard to make nonlowestcommondenominatortype movies largely on his own under his Filmirage company of which this film is one of the first and best examples. Eventually though the law of diminishing returns took hold and one of the company's final productions would be the legendarily noxious TROLL 2.This film is pretty hard to find though which is a bit of a shame as with a cleaned up transfer may play a little better than the gritty old VHS tape.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the reputation of director Joe D'Amato who's primarily known for an endless number of pornography movies and perverted exploitation flicks and a shallow first look at the VHS cover and stills I was expecting Endgame to be an extremely lowkeyed and virtually worthless piece of Italian 80's trash but I'm glad to announce that it actually is a pleasantly engaging PostApocalyptically themed SciFi experience. It's a piece of 80's trash nevertheless of course but one of the most enjoyable kinds. Endgame belongs in the extended category of Italian produced Escape from NY knockoffs and it can easily compete with the most successful and notorious accomplishments in there like Sergio Martino's After the Fall of New York Ruggero Deodato's The Atlantis Interceptors Lucio Fulci's The Fighting Centurions and Enzo G. Castellari's The New Barbarians. These titles probably don't mean anything to 'normal' film lovers but to true fans of Italian exploitation cinema they form an excellent source of comparison. The main story lines are very familiar and D'Amato isn't too ashamed to add in one clichd plot twist after the other but the film is extremely fastpaced spectacular and indescribably violent so who really cares about originality? Al Cliver plays a terrific Snake Plissken clone but the show is obviously stolen by the almighty George Eastman as the arch enemy. It's the years 2025 and everybody eagerly awaits the new edition of a popular TV show called Endgame in which a couple of bloodthirsty hunters go after a human prey. Ron Shannon wins the game but only thanks to the help of the telepathically gifted mutant Lilith D'Amato muse Laura Gemser. The government systematically exterminates all the mutants and thus Shannon swears to help Lilith and her other mutant friends flee out of the city. Along with a troop of recruited mercenaries Shannon guides them out of town but the group successively encounters hugely challenging ordeals like a community of blind cannibalistic monks a splendid homage to The Omega Man perhaps? an army of bewildered mutants and Nazilike government soldiers. Endgame is glorious and priceless 80's entertainment like they just don't make it anymore. The battling sequences are extended and body count is enormous with literally hundreds of bad guys and the occasional good guy dying left and right and in highly imaginative ways. In spite of the obviously lowbudgeted production values D'Amato managed to gather together some excellently apt set pieces and flamboyant vehicles and even the makeup effects are far above average. Director Joe D'Amato stated that this is his own personal favorite of all the movies he directed and he's probably right although I personally have even bigger soft spots for Anthropophagus and Beyond the Darkness. This is somewhat also a very atypical D'Amato film and that's a positive comment. For once he could keep his viewers alert and fascinated with actually content instead of through showing nudity and sleaze. I mean Laura Gemser stars in this film and she barely takes her clothes off! George Eastman also stars and he doesn't even attempt to rape a woman! This is just a perfectly entertaining Italian postapocalyptic SciFi movie with all the necessary ingredients action bloodshed gimmicks costumes silliness and a terrific freezeframe end shot.".

I mean who couldn't love George Eastman as Karnak? He has to be one of the coolest arch nemesis' that I have seen in a while! Half of the time I was rooting for him! And what about the mutants? I know that it was made in 1983 but I thought that they did a pretty damn good job with what they had to work with. I was somewhat torn by the ending because while I did like the clashing freezeframe it left you hanging with quite a cliffhanger.As a final word it was corny as hell but strangely entertaining. I only hope that I can still find it on VHS or god forbid DVD...".

	schema:reviewBody "Kick arse! Big Al Cliver and even bigger George Eastman go head to head sometimes or join up to go head to head with others sometimes in a film that's like the film Running Man for the first half hour before they get a squad together and take on the visually impaired! Both George and Al are contestants in Endgame a TV s how where Hunters hunt the prey usually a Hunter that's volunteered to be the Prey. This time champion Shannon Cliver is the prey and he's got three hunters on his tail. One seems to be a member of Kiss one is Bobby Rhodes from Demons and the other is twelve foot tall childhood friend George Eastman. Shannon runs around kicking everyone's head in while it's filmed for TV but things get complicated when on the set which is the postnuclear wasteland of New York  forgot to mention that Shannon meets Laura Gesmer a psychic mutant who needs a guide to help her and her son and some other mutants escape the city and the Nazistyle army led by the aged but still pretty ugly George Mitchell.After sparing Eastman's life and bolting from the gameshow which seems to involve him 'dissapearing' back to his caravan where everyone should know where he is Shannon gets together a crew to help out including an eyepatch guy Al Yamanouchi who kills a guy with his bare hands for no real reason a guy who looks like a Viking and the guy whose name I can never remember even though he's in about 50 of the Italian films I own like Mad Dog and Arizona Colt. They set off into the wilderness and almost immediately get into a massive battle with loads of blinds monks whom you might have guessed can see via a poor telepath they have tied up somewhere.That's what I loved about this film. Gameshow aside whenever there's a battle there's always about eight billion give or take extras willing to be shot blown up speared or knocked off of motorcycles. I also loved how Shannon and co would wait until the enemy had surrounded them before launching an attack. Every battle seems to turn into all out war. That's what post apocalyptic films need more of the good old fashioned Pagga.As this is an Italian film you've got mutant fish men drooling on Laura Gesmer Michelle Soavi turning up in a cameo and a freaky scene at the end with flying rocks fire and one character being forced to blow his own brains out. The soundtrack to this also at time sounds really similar to the soundtrack of Blade Runner while being no where near as depressing as Blade Runner.Some say this is the best of the Italian postapocalypse films and I wouldn't argue with those who say that but I think that Raiders of Atlantis New Barbarians Bronx Warriors 1  2 2019 After the Fall of New York are all just as good and mostly have George Eastman in them. These films are so much fun from start to finish. I can't wait till these films become reality because I'll be there on my talking motorbike with my hermaphrodite ape man sidekick and a Mohican ready to wander the wastelands.".

Along the way they have various encounters with perverted mutants and blind warriors along with a army general and his platoon who is determined to find out just what the hell is going on. Can anyone save these poor bedraggled creatures from a life in a laboratory? Their saviour may yet turn out to be surprise surprise a five year old boy with an extraordinary talent.You can either take 'Endgame' one of two ways as a reasonably effective postnuke thriller with passable action scenes and a halfdecent plot or as a laugh a minute Bmovie filled to the brim with laughable dialogue and bad special effects. Either way it works. Me? I sit somewhere in the middle there were some moments where I got quite involved in the action and others where I could have almost slapped my forehead at the cheesiness of the whole affair. Best moment Our hero says goodbye to his sortof girlfriend at the end with a true howler of a line Lillith look inside me. You are the future I am the past! YUCK! Suddenly he doesn't seem to tough.. It certainly isn't a masterpiece but if you take the film for what it is I'll bet you'll find it quite enjoyable.

You'd think being the boss of these mutants he would have his pick out of a million pretty ladies and he chooses those two trollops. Unbelievable.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's best that I watch some movies by myself. Like this one. That's because the minute George Eastman showed up on screen I let out an audible cheer of pure bliss. No one needs to hear me screaming like that.2025. A nuclear war has left New York City in ruins populated by scavengers and telepathic mutants who are hunted and killed by the elite. To keep the people of this world from revolting the reality game show Endgame has been created where hunters and gladiators battle to the death in the place of warfare.Lilith Black Emanuelle herself Laura Gemser credited as Moira Chen! is a psychic who wants protection for her band of mutants. She hires the best Endgame player ever  Ron Shannon Al Cliver from Zombi and The Beyond!  to help. Shannon has his own problems as he's in the middle of Endgame and facing off against professional killers like Kurt Karnak the much loved Eastman who also cowrote this film who was Shannon's childhood friend and has now become his greatest rival. The last time Shannon and Karnak battled in an Endgame time ran out before they could determine which man was the best player.Lilith helps Shannon defeat Karnak at which point his sponsor and the cameramen show up and ask him to drink Lifeplus on screen. Lilith reaches out to him and he rushes to save her. That's when he agrees to help her and the mutants she protects.Karnak has lost his mind due to losing shooting targets obsessively. Colonel Morgan and his men try to recruit him to their cause while Shannon tries to recruit his own team including Ninja Hal Yamanouchi who in addition to playing Silver Samurai in 2013's The Wolverine also appears in Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals 2020 Texas Gladiators and 2019 After the Fall of New York as the Rat Eater King! and Bull Gabriele Tinti who was married to Gemser and appeared in nearly every Black Emanuelle movie .You're too famous to disappear in a city that grows smaller every day says Colonel Morgan when he catches up to Shannon asking him to give up Lilith. This leads to a firefight where he's saved by Karnak! George Eastman as a good guy? YES!If you haven't guessed by all the shouting and exclamation points this movie is the perfect combination of everything I look for in film  it's a ripoff it's postapocalyptic it shares Italian genre favorites and it's in a ridiculous world where everyone either dresses like a viking or Dump Matsumoto 1980's Japanese women's wrestling bad girl supreme.Meanwhile in the wasteland our heroes come upon mutants which Professor Levin oh yeah he takes care of the telepaths explains have combined man's primordial caveman past with feral instincts. Which means in layman's terms that they look like human fish or apes.Think that's crazy? They then come upon holy monks who have blinded themselves so that they can be guided by psychics and kill anyone who offends their conception of God. What follows is a scene of blackrobed maniacs fighting with machine guns and grenades and knives and motorcycles and man...a cast of hundreds gets killed until Shannon finds the captured psychic and instead of saving him tosses an axe at his head. All the monks have no idea where they are wandering around yelling that they are blind as our heroes make their escape. If you think they aren't going to drive over the head of one of the monks well you haven't been watching Italian genre cinema!Meanwhile Lilith explains to Shannon that she keeps one of the young psychic kids basically autistic because if he starts to experience emotions he's liable to wipe out everyone around him.Then the professor gets killed in a trap but asks Shannon to save all of them. But that means Bull discovers that she's psychic which means that the entire team learns that everyone is a mutant. Everyone starts arguing before Karnak shows up to let them know that more enemies are on the way. Monkeyfaced enemies! And a fishfaced leader who has two women with roped up bare breasts on his modified golf cart! What is going on with this movie?Ninja and Kovack get killed and Lilith is captured. Karnak offers to help Shannon save her. Lilith reaches out to Shannon telling him that Karnak only wants gold and then to kill him. Then the fishman leader tears off Lilith's clothes yelling Look at me while I rape you dammit! Shannon asks if she's OK because he's seeing flashes and she's all like Yeah I'm fine while a fish mutant slobbers all over her. Umm...When the guys get there Lilith is fully clothed and the mutant is passed out on the bed. So are we to believe that she enjoyed it? Or that she just went with it? I guess if you're looking for woke feminism a Joe D'Amoto movie is probably the last place one should root around.Then they find Kovack who the mutants have left inside a wall. They can't help him escape and he wants to die so Karnak breaks his neck. He faces off against an entire room of mutants while Shannon and Lilith escape. She can tell that Karnak is in trouble but not dead to which Shannon replies Fate decides the winner of Endgame not me.Lilith reunites with the children and everyone celebrates that they are only ten kilometers from the rendezvous. Of course the government is waiting to take everyone out. SS logo adorned stormtroopers show up and just start shooting but Shannon talks Tommy one of the mutant children into creating wind storms and telekinetically using a machine gun and an avalanche to kill all of the soldiers. He even levitates a car that crushes several of them and sets a fire that wipes out even more. Then he forces Colonel Morgan to kill himself.Lilith asks Shannon to come with them but he says She is the future and he is the past. She leaves while he stays behind in the wasteland with the gold. As he goes to pick up his gold Karnak comes back and tells him they haven't played the final round yet. He throws away his gun as we get an awesome long shot of both men like something out of a western. They rush at one another with knives and the credits roll.The poster for this film promises For An Endgame Champion In The Year 2025 There's Only One Way To Live. Dangerously. And this film more than lives up that. If you only know D'Amoto from his adult work or gorefests like Beyond the Darkness and Antropophagus you should totally check this one out. Movies like this are why I went from worrying about the end of the world to wishing that it would happen!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fifty years after the Nuclear holocaust of World War Three New York is one of the few cities still intact. It survives in isolation catering to the craving of it's population for violence. There is live T.V. coverage of the 'Endgame Championship' that is based on the gladiator duels of ancient times. 'Endgame' began in 2012 and is now the most popular show on T.V. The show's host David Brown recaps the rules for the listening millions. Three 'hunters' are set loose to track down and kill the 'prey'. All the contestants receive one firearm and two additional weapons of their choice if they are found with anymore the contestants are automatically disqualified. The 'prey' is given a 30 minute head start and is allowed to surrender but will lose points if he does so.. The 'zone' chosen to hold the contest lies between 22nd and 33rd Street. The hunters this time are Woody Smith Bobby Rhodes Kid Hitchkoc Al Waterman and Karnak cowriter George Eastman. The prey is Shannon Al Cliver. Shannon manages to kill both Woody and Kid. During a fight with Karnak a telepathic mutant named Lilith Laura Gemser as Moira Chen helps him to win. The films bad guy Colonel Morgan Gordon Mitchell is a high ranking official in the SS which stands for security service. They see Shannon on T.V. with Lilith who he recognises as a telepathic mutant and wants them both for some reason I really don't know as it's never explained properly. Lilith introduces Shannon to Professor Levin Jack Davis who asks Shannon to lead him Lilith and a group of telepathic mutants out of New York City and to a rendezvous with a helicopter that will fly them to safety in exchange for lots of gold. Shannon agrees and assembles a team of men to help. A guy with an eyepatch named Bull Gabriele Tinti as Gus Stone a ninja called well Ninja Al Yamanouchi a big fat man named Kovack Mario Pedone a guy with really fast reflexes and is quite useful with a knife named Kijawa Nello Pazzafini as Nat Williams and lastly a driver called Stark Franco Ukmar as Frank Ukmar these guys wouldn't exactly fill me with confidence but there you go. The men and mutants set off. During their travels they come across blind telepathic monks various general lowlife's deformed mutants Shannon's old friend Karnak returns for seconds plus Colonel Morgan and his team of heavily armed SS troops! Will Shannon be able to lead the unfairly persecuted telepathic mutants and Professor Levin to safety? Will Shannon be able to stay alive long enough to collect his gold? You'll have to watch it if you want to find out. This Italian production was cowritten and directed by Joe D'Amato under the rather unimaginative pseudonym of Steve Benson and it's easy to see why he wanted his name off the credits as this film is consistently awful. The script by Amato and Eastman as Luigi Montefiori brings nothing new to the genre. It's tediously slow and dull as well as being very unambitious. The film as a whole left me with the impression no one associated with it was the least bit interested in creating a good film. The New York settings look like they were filmed under seedy railway bridges and in abandoned factory's. No effort is made to include any props or even make the locations look like a futuristic Manhattan I'd be very surprised if this was actually filmed there. Once they leave Manhattan it's just fields and more industrial factory's that look very contemporary! The weapons cars and costumes are bland and forgettable once again I just felt very little effort or money was put into the look of this film. There isn't much gore or violence in it a brief shot of an axe in someones head is about it. There is a sequence where a blue half manhalf fish mutant Pietro Ceccarelli as Peter Brighton rapes Lilith while doing so he says look at me while I rape you damn it! need I say more about how tacky and cheap this film is. The action scenes are poor to say the least. They basically consist of people shooting guns and then the camera cuts to stunt people falling off motorbikes or just falling over. There is little variety in them and they become extremely boring very quickly. There are a couple of fight scenes but they aren't that well choreographed or particularly exciting. Acting and dubbing is poor all round Al Cliver makes for a very bland and uninteresting hero and Laura Gemser isn't much better as the leading lady. Big George Eastman is fun to watch though as usual. And check the ending out one helicopter lands and about 10 people get inside and take off after the two pilot's it's a two seater at most and it's tiny! There's no way on Earth that all those people got into it and it took off absolutely no way. Please do yourself a favour and avoid this watch Sergio Martino's 2019After the Fall of New York 1983 instead believe me you'll be glad you did as it's far superior to this in every department possible. Total rubbish.".

Who knows how many of these films were made but this one here comes from cult director Joe D'Amato and for the most part it's mindless entertainment and you should find it somewhat entertaining as long as you don't take it too serious.In all honesty the plot it somewhat of a mess and it's probably more complicated than it should have been. The biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the dialogue scenes are so deadly boring that you can't help but wish they had been edited out all together. After all how many people come to a movie like this to hear any sort of talk? The film's entertainment comes from the nonstop action and this is where people can have some fun. There are all sorts of action scenes with shootouts fights with blind people and more nonsense. The action is pretty fast and furious and makes for a much better time.Genre fans will certainly enjoy the cast that they have lined up even though the dubbing as you'd expect was pretty bad. Cliver might always be remembered for his role in Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE but he's always fun to watch. Gemser had already made several film with D'Amato but she really isn't given too much to do here and yes boys she keeps her clothes on throughout the film. George Eastman also appears in a small role and when you add in Mitchell you've got four likable actors.D'Amato does a pretty good job in the director's chair and in fact I was surprised to see how well he handled the action scenes. These scenes are what makes the film so ENDGAME  BRONX LOTTA FINALE will appeal to fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "ENDGAME is a highly entertaining slice of Italian cheese served at least ten weeks past its sell by date. Just one of a rash of postapocalyptic films which emerged from Italy usually amid nuclear blasts in the early '80s it's a funfilled action adventure film all the way. The Italians certainly had a sense of style  and fun  that their American counterparts lacked. Take the film's American version for instance Schwarzenegger's much betterknown THE RUNNING MAN. Does it have innocent blind men being gunned down? The heck it does. America is too restricted to make really good films any more but you can't say that about the Italians. They sure know how to make a film and who cares who they offend? It comes as no surprise that the film was directed by Joe D'Amato. Joe God rest his soul was never really renowned for making brilliant films. But whether his films were enjoyable well it depends on the viewer. I for one am impressed. What makes ENDGAME such a masterpiece  however odd that may seem  is the absurdity of it. It could have just been a typical gladiator film but no. There are 'regressive mutants' who are supposed to have become halffish hmm sounds like something Lovecraft might have thought of. To show this they have those little shiny discs stuck all over their faces. And when they die they bleed water. Or blue paint in this case. The other 'regressive mutants' look very much like rejects from PLANET OF THE APES.To add to the fun mix in a cast of European 'stars' such as Laura Gemser famed for her role in the BLACK EMANUELLE films of the 1970s as the love interest who inevitably loses her top halfway through George Eastman ANTHROPOPHAGUS THE BEAST as a psycho shotgunarmed warrior very good role here folks and even Bobby Rhodes the star of DEMONS and its sequel wearing a robe and carrying a big spiked club thing! Rhodes is really the icing on the cake. Italian peplum fans will be delighted to spot former muscleman Gordon Mitchell in a small role as a baddie.What else is there? An almost constant stream of action from the single punchups in the first half to the fullscale wars in the second. People kick either other when they're down punch and there's even a warrior called Ninja who breaks the neck of a poor guy asked to attack him in class who jumps around and kicks people in the face I thought that was just something Jean Claude Van Damme did. The action is very second rate but this makes it all the more entertaining. There's lots of gore around as well as plenty of nudity for enthusiasts of that variety. Cliver is excellent in his Mad Max type role. ENDGAME is not a well made film by any means but it's a heck of a lot of fun and highly entertaining. So much so that I'm giving it a high rating for effort. A highly underrated cheesy classic.".

That may sound like a cute idea but I assure you it's miserable to suffer through.Now I've seen yet another Laura Gemser performance but I am not kidding when I say that you'd see more of her in a 30 commercial for dish soap. My girlfriend is less covered up when she's walking around in a belowzero blizzard and at least I get to see her all day instead of simply several seconds now  then.I realize that part of this supposedly features a TV battle game but any such TV show would be canceled after one episode. This whole film appears as though they were attempting to make all characters move as if in a videogame. That may sound like an interesting concept but it is not. If you wish to make things more exciting you speed things up you don't slow everything down.Futuristic action No it is not. Futuristic means as if in the future. It does not mean claimed to be set in the future but written  produced by such uncreative slags that it more resembles the distant past as predicting the future would require imagination intelligence and a decent budget. Hey Zimbo they didn't have machine guns or motorcycles in the distant past. But if they had they wouldn't have gotten off their zippy transportation dropped their automatic weapons and fought handtohand with swords. Those moronic nonmutants deserved to die! This was action in the sense that jumping off your scooter and engaging in a battle dance is i.e. it was not.fun romp  No character in this film had any fun and I don't grasp how viewers can. I guess some people enjoy watching hospital soap operas but not me. Romp implies fun  humor but I saw none whatsoever. There's a difference between a train wreck and a panel van which slowly gets mired in a puddle of muck. Oh but we were taught an important lesson about how we should be kinder to the mutants we meet as they likely have hidden good features to make up for their mutantism? How could Laura Gemser have sunk this low?".

	schema:reviewBody "Endgame is a film directed by the notorious Joe D'amato Anthropophagus Emmanuelle in America and written by Joe D'amato and George Eastman. It is a postapocalyptic movie in a similar vein to Madmax. The setting is post World War 3 and a game being aired on TV is the new thing. The game is called Endgame and it is very similar to that of an idea Stephen King came up with. Contestants are set loose in a grubby city and must kill each other until one remains. Two of the contestants are stars George Eastman and Al Cliver. The first half of the movie is the Endgame battle. The second half is when Al Cliver runs into a telepath played by Laura Gemser. She asks him if he could help her and a group of other telepaths to escape from the city. Apparently escaping from the city isn't easy do to a dictator like government. So Al Cliver gets together a band of hardcore warriors to set out and get these telepaths out of the city.I must say that Endgame was quite a fun movie. Packed with enough action to keep any Schwartzenneger fan at bay Endgame truly delivers. We have action about every 5 to 10 minutes and they are long drawn out action sequences. We have a few moments of gore but only a few. Laura Gemser even shows off her breast in one scene what a surprise. Al Cliver is no leading man but is definitely enjoyable in this movie is you like the things he has been in Zombie 2 Demonia. George Eastman is always an awesome presence and is a good foe for Al Cliver. All in all Endgame is a fun movie and if you like action check it out. 710".

Despite the production's troubled history between two studios Fox and Warner's and endless rewrites by an army of scribes it still finds everyone involved at the top of their game and early into most of their careers!Rutger Hauer's bad guys were always more interesting and charismatic than his good ones but his role as Captain Etienne Navarre was the noteable exception. In the best shape of his career both physically and artistically with the exception of BLADE RUNNER'S Roy Batty he painted the perfect portrait of noble hubris tinged with the ache of unfulfilled love for his fair maiden and the sorrow of an eternal curse that could never  be lifted. Even Errol Flynn would've been envious.Michelle Pfeiffer has been many things in her career earthy sensual campy courageous but she would never achieve the combination of radiant strength and vulnerability that she did as Isabeau D'Anjou. There have been other actresses who have looked better and given deeper more nuanced performances since hers...but it's a REAL short list.When I saw the previews I was pretty sure that the main thing I would like the least about this movie was Matthew Broderick whose Philippe The Mouse Gaston was a character I was pretty sure would grate on my nerves. And for the first part of the film he definitely does. Credit it to Matthew's likeability and talent that before the film's end though you're rooting for him as much as for the two leads.And let's not forget an extremely impressive supporting cast John Wood WAR GAMES and JUMPING JACK FLASH Leo McKern the OMEN films and PBS' Rumpole of the Bailey Alfred Molina PRICK UP YOUR EARS RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and the TV series THE LADIES' MAN and a wicked turn by Ken Hutchison as Navarre's nemesis. For the couple the friends or the family who want action AND romance too you can't do better and can always do worse. And as far as the music controversy is concerned I am a longtime fan of Andrew Powell's work back from his early days with Alan Parsons and later with The Project and I thought that the juxtaposition of the contemporary music with the medieval setting worked perfectly. This is after all a fantasy not a historical record of true events! Enjoy it for what it is!".

It works because of the great mixture of action beautiful photography likable lead characters humor touching romance suspense and no offensive language. Yes here is an adult film that everyone can watch and that' no clich.Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer are handsome leads but Matthew Broderick as Phillipe Gaston is the star of the show. He provides the humor and is involved in almost every scene. There is a lot of religion in here both shown positively and negatively. Broderick's character acknowledges God and constantly talks to Him. Hauer refers to Him too but Broderick is the talker. However here is yet another case of a French Catholic clergyman being the evil bad guy. Is one ever shown in a positive light? John Wood effectively plays the nasty  Bishop of Aqulia.This is a curse story about two humans who turn into hawk Pfeiffer and wolf Hauer by daynight never seeming to be human at the same time so they can be lovers and live happily ever after.It's interesting all the way with my only suggestion that it could have been a 10 had it been chopped about 1520 minutes in length.Overall though a solid film and one that has been enjoyed by everyone I know who has seen it.".

Anyway it's a very stirring timeless except for the music story of love heartache hope and redemption. Wonderful.Rutger Hauer is amazing. Strong even frightening at times but still tender and vulnerable. Of course Michelle Pfeiffer is at her absolute most beautiful. She really does seem to possess the face of love as Phillipe says. But Matthew Broderick really makes the movie. He's more than just comic relief although he is hilarious he keeps the story grounded. Without the character of Philippe the movie would be too ethereal untethered. Philippe is the everymanour connection to the magical beauty of Navarre and Isabeau.I've heard that the story is based on a medieval legend but I haven't been able to find it. If anyone has a link please post it as a review on this site I'd love to read more about it. Thanks!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Donner's 'Ladyhawke' tells a fascinating tale of cursed love that separates two lovers like day and night quite literally. What I loved about this film is that even though it's a wonderful mixture of action adventure romance and comedy it is a simple film. The execution is solid and it shows that Donner and his cast and crew have put a lot of heart in the making of the film.The score is kind of funny. At times there's a beautiful symphony that expresses the beauty of the settings and then during the action scenes there's the typical 80's hip track which brings a smile as it nostalgically reminds me of that wild decade. 'Ladyhawke' is indeed very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is superb as it gives a very spacious view and the composition of the shots are very well arranged.No CGI has been used and that marvelously stands out as it gives the film a purer look and only reminds one of the days before CGI was overused when cinema looked pure and authentic. 'Ladyhawke' is a fine example of movies that can look great and sometimes even better and more effective without CGI other examples being the Star Wars trilogy 80's version Indiana Jones etc.The performances are topnotch. A radiant Michelle Pfeiffer completely owns the title role. Her understated performance and quiet yet strong presence like a hawk brilliantly contrasts Rutger Hauer's wolfish character. Hauer too does a fine job. An evil Alfred Molino is barely recognizable and Leo McKern wears the menacing look very well. John Wood provides some great comic relief. However it is Matthew Broderick who stands out. He performs naturally as the vivacious energetic deceitful thief who loses his heart to Ladyhawke and at the same time he is determined to reunite the lovers and rescue them from the wrath of the curse.Overall 'Ladyhawke' is a beautiful movie that satisfied my filmviewing experience. It gives that nostalgic feel it amuses it fascinates and it feels enchanting. No wonder it still feels fresh after more than two decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I was a kid I loved fantasy movies. As a matter of fact anything with sword fights was great in my book. And since I grew up in the days before Lord of the Rings came along my favourites were always midtolateeighties fantasy epics like The Princess Bride Willow and Ladyhawke.It's all about an outcast knight and his lover who have been cursed by an evil bishop to become animals during night and day so they're never together in human form. He becomes a wolf and she becomes a hawk hence the title. The knight enlists the help of a young thief to break into the cathedral and take his revenge on the bishop. Aside from the basic premise it's more of a historical movie than a fantasy movie. There's no magic other than the curse and no trolls or giants or anything which was partly the reason I enjoyed it so much.I've also always loved this movie for it's great storyline and interesting characters. Philipe's conversations with God still amuse me as does the drunken monk played by Leo McKern ... It comes from director Richard Donner who of course brought us Superman I  II the Lethal Weapon movies and so on. This is essentially a welldirected movie although a lot of people have issues with the choice of soundtrack. It's kind of a technopoppy thing which I blame NeverEnding Story for. A lot of eighties fantasy movies went with the same idea but it works with Ladyhawke better than it works with most others although I would of course prefer a more conventional and less intrusive score. On the whole the sets and the props are pretty convincing although some of the fight sequences aren't particularly great.Here we have an early Matthew Broderick performance which shows how little his acting skills have developed since. Not that he's a bad actor just an early bloomer I guess. Cult icon Rutger Hauer of whom I have always been a huge fan Blade Runner The Hitcher The 10th Kingdom gives a fantastic performance as the outcast knight and as we all know it's never a bad idea to have Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie.You should definitely see this movie if you're a fan of the genre or of any of the actors involved. It's a wonderful fantasy adventure for all ages.".

This was made back in the days before Matthew Broderick became famous as Ferris Bueller and before Michelle Pfeiffer was a wellknown and respected actress. I believe this was her third or fourth film role in the early days of her career. She is simply stunning as Isabeau the title character. Rutger Hauer was at the top of his career and was perfectly cast as Navarre the cursed knightwolf to Pfeiffer's ladyhawke. Matthew Broderick plays Phillip Gaston a pickpocket who becomes first an unwilling accomplice then a loyal ally to the lovers. Others in the cast include the late Leo Mckern as Father Imperius and John Wood as the Bishop of Aquila. It's a beautifully told story about love triumphing over evil. Highly recommended.".

Matthew Broderick plays Phillip Gaston a pickpocket who becomes first an unwilling accomplice then a loyal ally to the lovers. Others in the cast include the late Leo Mckern as Father Imperius and John Wood as the Bishop of Aquila. It's a beautifully told story about love triumphing over evil. Highly recommended.";

Definitely a unique type of love story.We begin with Phillipe Gaston played by Matthew Broderick I think one of his better acting jobs an escapee from the Prison of Aquila something that has never happened before. However in his zealous celebration Phillipe finds himself facing Aquilan guards in the name of the Bishop. He is saved by Captain Etienne Navarre a former Capt. of the guard for Aquila.His rescue doesn't come without a price though Phillipe is told that he will get Navarre back into Aquila in order to kill the Bishop in revenge. Phillipe has little choice but to agree to the task. In his traveling with Navarre Phillipe discovers an entrancing young woman who always shows up after the sun sets and Navarre disappears.Phillipe eventually discovers that her name is Isabeau d'Anjou Navarre's love and that because of the curse she is Navarre's hawk companion by day and that Navarre turns into a black wolf by night a punishment put upon them by the Bishop of Aquila because Isabeau did not return his affections.With the help of Imperius the monk who betrayed the lovers secret to the Bishop in a fit of drunkenness Phillipe discovers that a solar eclipse will allow the lovers to confront the Bishop together as man and woman and break the spell forever. They encounter Navarre's stubbornness to the plan and must think of a clever way to help the two lovers.The story is beautiful Rutger Hauer  Michelle Pfeiffer put in terrific acting jobs. A terrific story of love conquers all with a twist. The bits of humor thrown in make the characters endearing. Would recommend it any day but perhaps I'm bias by now. 1010.".

This is an imaginative  glamorous  strange fantasy based on the wonderful adventures by a group of heroes against an evil bishop . Fantastic film contains sense of adventure  thrills  and lots of imagination . From start to finish fantasy  action  duels and delightful adventures are interminable . Exciting and interesting screenplay by Michael Thomas  Tom Mankiewicz and David Webb based on a story by Edward Khmara .

At dawn she transforms into a hawk and at dusk he transforms into a wolf they can never meet.

It's also nicely oldfashioned a bit like an Errol Flynn romantic swashbuckler from the thirties Captain Blood say  the goodies are noble and heroic and the baddies are evil through and through there are thrills and spills aplenty comic interludes a touching love story and they all live happily ever after. It may be an old formula but it works rather well and Edward Khmara's intriguing story sweeps along energetically. There is one potential liability  Broderick  who looks like a Jewish kid from Manhattan transplanted into Europe in the twelfth century. He contrasts sharply with Hauer who could have stepped right out of the pages of Ivanhoe but he makes his character work by gaining our sympathy and via all his neat comic asides to his Maker. Hauer is outstanding and McKern and Hutchison offer strong support as do the many talented animal actors there is a particularly tricky scene with a wolf on an ice floe. Equally authentic is the fantastic location photography by the great Vittorio Storaro and production design by Wolf Kroeger First Blood Enemy At The Gates. It was all filmed on location in northern Italy  notably at the preserved medieval town of Castell' Arquato in Piacenza province  and looks sensational with fluid tracking shots of horses thundering across cobblestones and beautifully lit smoky stainedglass interiors. This is one of those enjoyable cosmopolitan movies AmericanItalianBritish where the varied backgrounds of the filmmakers contribute to a highly original experience. Last but not least there's a pounding symphonic rock score by Andrew Powell which complements the action and sweetens the romance. All in all this a cracking flick extremely well directed by the talented Donner and well worth a matine screening. Trivia  the director and acclaimed producer Lauren Shuler married after making this movie together.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two lovers betrayed and cursed by a sadistic Bishop travel together through the remote countryside of Europe. They're together but always apart....she a lady by night and hawk by day he man by day and wolf at night. This is a beautiful film wonderfully written hauntingly filmed and great performances all around by the cast. I know the score is a popular debate you either love it or hate it. I loved it it's a blend unlike any other i've ever heard and stands out rather than blend in like so many others.Rutger Hauer gives a powerful and convincing performance as the handsome brooding captain of the guards who is cursed outlawed and hunted his only crime falling in love with a beautiful woman.And she is beautiful too the luminous Michelle Pfeiffer absolutely lights up the screen every scene she appears in. Not only is she beautiful but also smart kind and compassionate. Thankfully she's not the typical damsel in distress who stands by and does nothing. I was completely sold as to why Hauer would give his very life to protect her. This was the movie that made me a lifelong fan of Pfeiffer.Matthew Broderick was perfect in the part of Phillipe it was nice to be able to see him stretch himself in range and play a different kind of role than i'd become accustomed to watching him in. John Wood was excellent as the sadistic Bishop who cursed the couple in his desire for Pfeiffer. I was really convinced of his downright evilness. And last but not least I really enjoyed Leo McKern the drunken priest who betrayed the couple to the Bishop. He finds redemption in helping to break the curse and defeat the Bishop. For those who haven't seen it I don't dare think of giving it away.Also an evil little cameo by Alfred Molina years before most people knew who he was. As mystical as this movie is it doesn't rely on a whole lot of special effects overwhelming it. Of course this was before CGI was around. But still it wisely decides to rely on the emotions and ability of the actors director and scenery to convey the story.A really beautiful soulful mystical film.".

Not only is she beautiful but also smart kind and compassionate. Thankfully she's not the typical damsel in distress who stands by and does nothing. I was completely sold as to why Hauer would give his very life to protect her. This was the movie that made me a lifelong fan of Pfeiffer.Matthew Broderick was perfect in the part of Phillipe it was nice to be able to see him stretch himself in range and play a different kind of role than i'd become accustomed to watching him in. John Wood was excellent as the sadistic Bishop who cursed the couple in his desire for Pfeiffer. I was really convinced of his downright evilness. And last but not least I really enjoyed Leo McKern the drunken priest who betrayed the couple to the Bishop. He finds redemption in helping to break the curse and defeat the Bishop. For those who haven't seen it I don't dare think of giving it away.Also an evil little cameo by Alfred Molina years before most people knew who he was. As mystical as this movie is it doesn't rely on a whole lot of special effects overwhelming it. Of course this was before CGI was around. But still it wisely decides to rely on the emotions and ability of the actors director and scenery to convey the story.A really beautiful soulful mystical film.";

I've owned Ladyhawk on beta VHS and now on DVD. I never tire of watching this fabulous love story. Matthew Broderick's little monologues have me smiling all of the way through. This was the first movie that I ever saw Michelle Pfiefer in or Rutger Hauer and I thought that she was one of the most beautiful women that I'd ever seen. Rutger Hauer's rugged good looks definitely complimented Pfiefer's ethereal presence. It was also the first time that I'd ever seen a Friesian horse and thus began my love for this breed. The movie was beautifully filmed and will always be one of my all time favourites. There is not one bad thing that I have to say about this movie or it's soundtrack.".

I remembered Matthew Broderick being deeply annoying as it turns out he's just mildly irritating. And I remembered the soundtrack being bad but good God it's appalling. Whoever decided that a tragic touching supernatural romance would be best accompanied by funky 70s synthesisers I don't think they're fitting enough to even be classed as 80s should be forced to eat their own afro. Yes all of it. I can honestly say I have never heard a less appropriate musical score in my entire life. It's not that it's bad exactly  it'd probably work pretty well if the lead character was say Shaft.Still when the crazy disco beats aren't violating the atmosphere there's some good stuff going on. Richard Donner already had serious directing experience under his belt in 1985 and Ladyhawke is beautifully shot and paced with some gorgeous scenery to take in. There's just enough action they give it some proper welly in those swordfights John Wood provides a proper boohiss malicious villain the dialogue never quite slips into melodrama despite teetering on the edge occasionally and it's always a pleasure to watch Rutger Hauer in one of his few good roles before he degenerated into selfparody. Well if we're being honest it's a pleasure to watch him in his godawful recent stuff as well but for different reasons. Above all the film's got heart which is more than you can say for 95 of the cack that Hollywood churns out and it deserves some small credit for that at least.".

The story has plenty of action and much pathos between Navarre and Isabeau when they are transforming and have that brief moment when they are both human.

It's not a perfect movie and I think the ending is a bit rough after all the magic that takes place before. But it's a beautiful story with stunning cinematography and good acting. I love Matthew Broderick's turn as Phillipe he's cute and hilarious. Leo McKern breaks our heart when he tells us Navarre and Isabeau's story of doomed love as does the pain etched into every line of Rutger Hauer's face. The thing I really like about this movie is despite Phillipe's conversations with God it's really grounded unlike other 80's fantasy movies there's an element of reality to it it really feels like it's medieval setting shot on location in Italy with the dirty peasants and even the rich and corrupt Bishop's trappings of wealth are still medieval. The cathedral the ruined abbey the peasant's cottage the dungeons all feel real not like movie sets. And the emotion between Isabeau and Navarre and the sad old drunk the desperate lovesick young pickpocket make us feel is human and real.The funny thing about the music is that it never bothered me when I watched the movie when I was younger now it's so cheesy it's almost unbearable. I guess that's the way fads are they work at the time but then later on you're like What were we thinking? It's very much music of the time which unfortunately dates this otherwise timeless period piece.".

They essentially never see one another. It's always just out of reach for these star crossed lovers. Navarre enlist the help of the thief Gaston played by Mathew Broderick.Sounds great right? But the sound track stinks. This movie is 1985 and the music sounds 1985. What I mean by that is that it sounds like the same type you would hear in any Molly Ringwald movie from the 80s. I mean this is a medieval fantasy. Totally unsuitable music. It ruins the mood. Very distracting. Could have used some Joe LoDuca or the late great James Horner.Then we have the cinematography. Nothing special. In fact it looks like the director phoned it in. Superbright sunny scenes. No shadowing or filters to set the tone. Nothing. Finally the accents. Broderick sounds English at first but then drops completely into American. Michelle Pfeiffer didn't even bother it was American all the way. Rutger Hauer I'm not sure what the hell he was doing. He's from the Netherlands but was doing some American thing that wasn't quite working. It's medieval France. These accents are distracting and sounded stupid. Broderick's character bordered on funny to downright annoying. It was the babbling. Very awful. Michell Pfeiffer was beautiful and serene but really nothing special. Rutger was the most handsome I'd ever seen and he was dashing and likable.The story was there but it seems everything else failed. I'd like to see it remade someday. Even an animated version might be great. If they had just fixed these things it could really have been something. Not a recommended fantasy movie.".

His incessant chatter weighs the other characters' taciturnity well and he grounds the film in a way no other character could.The special effects are perfecta more recent film might try to show off what cool things it can do with pixels but in this film they are glossed over and used to great effect only when they are really needed. Action scenes are likewise shot with economy and and grace and the whole productiondialogue costumes sets fights and effectsis very lowkey exposing a very simple very effective and very touching story.It is in fact a pretty much perfect movie.".

Rutger Hauer turns in a wonderfully nuanced performance as the knight mysterious and menacing or kind and nobleyet not quite sane obsessing about his lost love and becoming irrationally jealous of Mouse's friendship with her.Michelle Pfeiffer is breathtakingly beautiful here as the face of love vivacious and merry and queenly just as she should beneither anachronistically feminist nor totally lacking in gumption but a very authenticfeeling heroine in the vein of Galadriel or Luthien from Tolkien's tales.Matthew Broderick is likewise excellent in his role as the story's grubby cheerful protagonistagain a very authenticfeeling character the kind of guy you just know could be found scrounging his way through life in the Middle Ages somewhere. His incessant chatter weighs the other characters' taciturnity well and he grounds the film in a way no other character could.The special effects are perfecta more recent film might try to show off what cool things it can do with pixels but in this film they are glossed over and used to great effect only when they are really needed. Action scenes are likewise shot with economy and and grace and the whole productiondialogue costumes sets fights and effectsis very lowkey exposing a very simple very effective and very touching story.It is in fact a pretty much perfect movie.";

So I strongly urge you to watch this movie first for maximum impact.

The question is why would somebody who had the opportunity to create a perfect life turn it into a nightmare?The solution lies in the shallowness of Cesar's character.  He is a totally selfcentered individual a man who depends on his money and looks to get him whatever he wants.  Metaphorically he is the man in his dream in the opening scene  alone in an empty city of his own creation.  His friendship with Pelayo is in name only.  His claims of love for Sophia are at least at first just as shallow  inspired by pictures on a wall and easily tossed aside when Nuria offers him a freebie.Why then does the dream go bad?  Because once Cesar's face is disfigured he sees that Sophia only loved his outer beauty.  He sees that money can't buy him happiness  it can't even buy him a new face.  He sees how easily his best friend turns away from him when the going gets rough.  And Cesar is never able to resolve these issues while alive  indeed he chooses suicide to rid himself of the pain.  But just as our dreams show us truths we'd rather not face Cesar's dream brings back these questions in the form of contradictions.  What if he like Sophia fell in love only have his lover reappear as somebody he didn't recognize?  In his case Sophia switched for Nuria.  What if only he could see how ugly he really was? Cesar's dream goes bad because he wants it to go bad  as he is trying to figure out the reality of his physical life he is also probing the reality of his soul.I found this to be a fascinating movie not despite the ending but because of it.

There is so much subtlety so many interesting ideas in this that have been butchered or simply lost in translation in the Hollywood version. The ending of Vanilla Sky pretty much explains everything... Abre Los Ojos leaves most of it up to interpretation and the viewers' imagination. Upon my recent second viewing I realized how many hints there are towards the twist in the film and how many ideas and subjects for good discussion that are in the film. The direction in Vanilla Sky seemed fine before but in comparison it's really daft and unimaginative. The majority of the good stuff in VS is stolen directly from ALO. A lot of it is changed to fit Hollywood's standardsand we all know how... high... they are and the authenticity of the great idea is almost lost through this. This is the third Alejandro Amenabar movie I've seenthe other two are Thesis and The Others and definitely my favorite so far. Not many films can catch and keep your interest even when you've already seen a bastardized and cheaper version of it already. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Like Amenbar's other films this is slow and deliberatewhereas Crowe's version in comparison seems somewhat rushed trying to get to the end as fast as possible despite being a full half hour longer and it really works to the films benefit. The music is wonderful and it fits perfectly in every scene. The mood and atmosphere of the film is great. The effects are excellent... by comparison those of Vanilla Sky are overly flashy and obvious. Here they're beautiful and very subtle like the rest of the film. The cinematography is very good and far superior to that of VS. I realize that this seems more like a comparison between the two films than a review but I can't seem to find the words to express just how great this is. See it for yourself. And in the name of all that is good and just see it before you even consider watching Vanilla Sky. I recommend this to fans of intelligent films andor Alejandro Amenbar. This is quite probably the best film he has made so farthough I haven't seen Mar Adentro yet. 910".

	schema:headline " Very impressive if you can PLEASE see this before Vanilla Sky!";
	schema:reviewBody "Vanilla Sky turned out to be a moderate success and scored great reviews by most critics and I liked it myself.  But if you compare it to this film there's almost nothing different!  But of course it's all Cameron Crowe's fault and not the fault of the director of this movie.  Luckily I haven't seen VS in a while so certain surprises in the plot still intrigued me. And I was intrigued throughout the film I think even moreso than with VS. Tom Cruise is a fine actor and I have nothing against him.  But I always appreciate seeing unknown actors at least they're unknown to me I don't live in Spain so they might be superstars there give fine performances. The actor who plays the main character in this film as just as effective as Cruise.  He is an extremely attractive man and knows how to express a plethora of emotions.  I've never been a big fan of Penelope Cruz's work in the states because her English still isn't great and that clearly shows in the mangled expression of her dialogue.  But in her native language she shows great talent.  And since I find her much more attractive than I used to I'm more appealed by her in the looks department.  Plus as a man I must reveal she has a great nude scene in the film.  One element of the plot that I don't think Crowe's VS expressed as well was the jealousy between the handsome main character and his best friend.  I was able to connect with that portion of the story since I have a best friend like the main character who's charming girls left and right while I the average guy have virtually no appeal to the ladies.  I know what it's like to possess that sort of envy and so do the average guys all around who see handsome guys doing the same things we do but get more favorable results just on account of their good looks.  The film also expresses the theme that no matter how many times most attractive men claim their looks are of no importance to them if their looks were one day to be stolen from them they'd lose the will to live.    I'm sure if I saw Vanilla Sky after this movie I'd enjoy it a lot less. This is sheer proof that the general American public is too lazy to read subtitles.  Because if you were watching the DVD of VS and switched the language channels from English to Spanish it's the same damn movie!  And now I feel sorry for the director of this movie since he's the genius behind this genuinely original story but Cameron Crowe comes along and takes all the credit.  I am not one of those grouches who hates remakes but if you're going to remake a film put your own spin on it!  Don't take all the original ideas and conduct it with different actors!  And wait a couple decades for God's sake!  Open Your Eyes was released in 1997 and VS only four years later.  So unless you're illiterate please see Open Your Eyes before you even consider Vanilla Sky!My score  8 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Vanilla Sky turned out to be a moderate success and scored great reviews by most critics and I liked it myself.  But if you compare it to this film there's almost nothing different!  But of course it's all Cameron Crowe's fault and not the fault of the director of this movie.  Luckily I haven't seen VS in a while so certain surprises in the plot still intrigued me. And I was intrigued throughout the film I think even moreso than with VS. Tom Cruise is a fine actor and I have nothing against him.  But I always appreciate seeing unknown actors at least they're unknown to me I don't live in Spain so they might be superstars there give fine performances. The actor who plays the main character in this film as just as effective as Cruise.  He is an extremely attractive man and knows how to express a plethora of emotions.  I've never been a big fan of Penelope Cruz's work in the states because her English still isn't great and that clearly shows in the mangled expression of her dialogue.  But in her native language she shows great talent.  And since I find her much more attractive than I used to I'm more appealed by her in the looks department.  Plus as a man I must reveal she has a great nude scene in the film.  One element of the plot that I don't think Crowe's VS expressed as well was the jealousy between the handsome main character and his best friend.  I was able to connect with that portion of the story since I have a best friend like the main character who's charming girls left and right while I the average guy have virtually no appeal to the ladies.  I know what it's like to possess that sort of envy and so do the average guys all around who see handsome guys doing the same things we do but get more favorable results just on account of their good looks.  The film also expresses the theme that no matter how many times most attractive men claim their looks are of no importance to them if their looks were one day to be stolen from them they'd lose the will to live.

	schema:headline " Abre Los Ojos is much better than Vanilla Sky";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched Abre Los Ojos. That prompted me to then rent Vanilla Sky. I relate that only because the order in which you see these movies is important. Specifically by the time I saw VS I knew everything about the story and there was no longer any sense of unraveling a mystery that is an important part of these movies. But that is not all. On almost every score Abre Los Ojos is the better movie. First the acting. In ALO Penelope Cruz is sweet loving and heartbreakingly beautiful. Reprising the same role in VS she struggles with her Spanish accent and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Tom Cruise. Also her character in VS repeatedly engages in a strange kind of smartalecky banter that is not funny and is just plain misplaced in this movie. And yes I hate to say it but Ms. Cruz is nowhere near as attractive in VS as she was in ALO. Watch the movies backtoback and the difference is startling. As for the other characters I thought the spurned female role was better done in ALO. The actress who played Nuria in ALO conveyed a palpable sense of desperation and sadness but also vulnerability. When she kills herself and tries to take Cesar with her it's believable. Not so with Cameron Diaz's portrayal of that same character in VS who comes off as a spoiled tramp whose decision to kill herself seems like a hissy fit. That may not be all her fault. For instance during the critical scene where she kills herself and tries to kill Cruise Diaz is forced to utter dialog that is dopey and distractingly vulgar. Nuria has more grace and more depth. Tom Cruise is not a terrible male lead but the Spanish actor who played Cesar in ALO is much better suited for the role. He is younger and portrays youthful arrogance and insouciance perfectly. There is also an innocence about him that Cruise can no longer do. Especially physically. At times in VS I was thinking more about Tom Cruise's weightlifting regimen more than the mental anguish of his character. Unlike the crippling sadness of Cesar Cruise's character is a turbocharged superstar. In fact it's not until the final scene when the truth unravels itself that Cruise finally brings his performance down to a human level. Last the music. ALO has an unobtrusive Hitchcockian score see Vertigo to get my drift that is haunting and is very effective in creating a brooding dreamlike atmosphere. Cameron Crowe's blaring soundtrack in VS conversely is a slick pop clich that detracts instead of enhances the experience. The musical differences really do speak volumes here. ALO is dark ethereal and moving. VS is loud brash and coarse.".

This suspenseful movie starts when the protagonist appears moving by an empty Madrid's Gran Va without cars or people . It concerns about a very handsome young named Cesar Eduardo Noriega  as he meets the beautiful and sexy Sofia Penelope Cruz currently dating Pelayo Fele Martinez  but they are immediately attracted to each other finds the love of his life  but a girl Najwa Nimri is completely obsessed with him . He then suffers an accident and needs to have his face rebuilt by surgery after it is severely disfigured .The motion picture displays genuine chills  suspense mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension  thriller  emotions and brief violence . The film's title translates to open your eyes which is a repeated motif . It's an exciting  bizarre film  skillfully proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling . Plenty of twists and turns  the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling score by the same Alejandro Amenabar  including some wonderful songs such as the song playing at the nightclub when Csar first arrives is Rising Son by Massive Attack in which the phrase dream on is frequently repeated . Furthermore  Alejandro also wrote  along with Mateo Gil the interesting plot  embarking into the phantasmagorical psychological or even quasisurrealist story . In fact  Alejandro Amenbar imagined the script after having horrible nightmares while ill with the flu. It includes director Cameo  as Alejandro Amenbar appears with other two people in the bathroom of the disco when Csar goes there . Intelligent edition special use of luxurious sets by Wofgang Burmann and slick utilization of shock images make this one a magnificent film . Abre Los Ojos 1997 is his remake of Vrtigo 1958 by Hitchcock. In fact when the character of Sofia appears after hitting Cesar with a jar it's the same shot of Kim Novak in Vertigo when she appears from the bathroom in the hotel  with green lights . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Hans Burmann which heightens the suspense . It was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky 2001 starring Tom Cruise  Cameron Diaz  Kurt Russell and Penlope Cruz also stars in Vanilla Sky Cameron Crowe's remake of this film playing the same character Sofia. The picture was well directed by Amenabar in his second movie after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps bestknown early shortfilm Himenptero in 1992 in which he directed  produced acted and wrote the script and the music Amenbar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with Thesis Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut  a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . Later Los Otros The Others confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenbar's first English language film . In all his films he also writes the script and the music as well as composing the music for other films  most notably Butterflies tongue 1999. He subsequently directed Mar Adentro with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epichistorical Agora with Rachel Weisz . Rating  Better than average.".

You know the one I'm talking about  the one with Tom Cruise OMG this review is impossible without mentioning VANILLA SKY  I mean not only is it a remake of ABRE LOS OJO but it's almost scene for scene the exact same movie  in fact since it's got Penelope Cruz in the exact same role as the original you can't even say VANILLA SKY is the same movie with an entirely different cast ! That's the problem with having seen the remake first because it's very difficult to comment on ABRE LOS OJOS because I knew exactly where the movie was heading when Cesar stepped out of his car and surveyed the empty city scape at the start of the movie . This familiarity of the story ruined the movie for me . If only I'd seen this before Hollywood remade it ! Strangely enough Channel 4 broadcast this the night before they broadcast VANILLA SKY and it's obvious that the strengths of the Alejandro Amenaber original have become weaknesses in Crowe's remake . Eduardo Noriega might not be a film star but he is an actor  when watching him play Cesar he is Cesar . When watching Cruise play David you're aware of a movie star playing a disfigured character  his casting against type makes the audience aware that despite the shock revelation at the end it's only a movie . Amenaber thankfully doesn't drown the audience with pop culture references every five seconds unlike Crowe and because of this the audience can concentrate on the mind bending but totally rewarding plot a lot more Incidentally I awarded this movie seven out of ten the same mark as I gave the remake . If I saw the prior film first I would have almost certainly have given it a higher mark while possibly giving VANILLA SKY a lower one".

With surgery limited as to what it can achieve Csar despairs at his loss his looks not Nuria and tries to pick up with Sofia.

The story is magnificently set out  it builds slowly and you never know the full story  even the ending requires you to catch up really quickly. Not knowing what's going on at some points may frustrate some audiences but it just drives this film on.  It is a little far fetched at points but it's handled so well that you don't mind.  The story is laced with emotion and passion  the ending is moving for so many reasons that I won't spoil.Director Amendar delivers a visually great film  he uses the dream sequences well and regularly contrasts the beauty and the twisted face of Csar.  He delivers a story that is stylish and clever using his cast to spin out a human drama before launching into the realm of science fiction.Noriega is great as the conceited Csar  his character and his fate can both be taken as comments on vanity and the importance of image  and he is more than able to handle all the sides to his character.  Cruz is good here too  she is quite attractive and plays well in a smallish role.  The most underrated performance is given by the physiatrist  his role becomes bigger at the end and he handles the complexities thrust upon his character well.Overall this is a superb film that mixes a clever plot good acting a great script and stylish direction.  It may lose some of it's impact once you know the full story and it should be enjoyed as freshly as possible  but it will stand repeat viewings to get the full picture.".

Nuria is also on his birthday party and sees him leaving the apartment with Sofia after Pelayo his best friend left.The next morning Csar left Sofia's apartment and wants to drive home when he sees Nuria waiting in front of the apartment. She asks him if she should bring him home. He says yes and that's how he comes into her car. What he didn't know is that she thinks about committing suicide. So they drive along the street and in one moment Nuria drives against a wall. She's dead Csar survives but he lost his face. After that event Csar wears a mask to cover his real face. He comes into a psychiatry because he killed somebody but Csar doesn't know what happened. Together with his psychiatrist he tries to remember what happened. And he remembered. One night he slept with Sofia but he hadn't seen Sofia he saw Nuria so he was that confused that he pulled a cushion on her face so she couldn't breath. But there was something else that he remembered. He remembered that he signed a contract. And this contract is from a company for Life Extension. So he and his psychiatrist drive to this company and talk with the boss and find out that everything that Csar did was a dream. His body had been frozen 150 years ago and he lived a dream with all the people he loved. To wake up he had to jump from a building. He did and that's how the movie ends.This is a great movie. My second Spanish movie and I like both very much. Alejandro Amenbar is great director. Now the actors. Eduardo Noriega was great. He played fantastic. He had to be funny and in the next moment he had to be terrific and confused. He did a great job. Perfect cast for this role. And then there is Penelope Cruz. I knew that she is a great actress...but now I know that she is brilliant. She is so beautiful in this movie you want to die lol And she did a excellent job too. She played fantastic. So I would say that this movie should get 9 stars because it is that good. Absolutely worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "There once was a movie called Vanilla Sky. It made very little sense. It really was a thoroughly confusing mess. That movie was an Englishlanguage remake of this Spanishlanguage one. If nothing else Open Your Eyes at least makes more sense than Vanilla Sky did. Oh there's still plenty of confusing stuff here but director Alejandro Amenbar manages to pull it together much better than Cameron Crowe ever did in the remake. The fact that I think the story makes much more sense when presented in a language I don't even understand is about as damning a statement as can be made about Crowe's film. Open Your Eyes is clearly the better film of the two. But it comes with its own frustrations. Maybe this story was just a little too convoluted to ever make a thoroughly enjoyable movie out of.Open Your Eyes is a movie which delights in messing with your mind. This is a movie which demands that you be fully engaged when watching it. Turn off your brain and start daydreaming and you'll be lost. The movie's main character Csar has plenty of disorienting experiences which can leave the viewer feeling more than a little disoriented himself. It's a hard movie to pin down. It flashes back and forth in time it raises questions about what is real and what is imagined. It takes you right inside Csar's head. Unfortunately Csar's darned near lost his mind so going inside his head isn't going to give us much clarity.It's best to not say much about the plot because whatever joy you get from this movie will likely come from your attempts to unravel the plot for yourself. If you've already seen Vanilla Sky you unfortunately pretty much know everything. The ending of Vanilla Sky was such a letdown and made so little sense whatsoever that as you watch Open Your Eyes you can't help but have very low expectations. You're waiting to be let down and to be thoroughly baffled. Happily Amenbar's ending is a little more focused than Crowe's was. Where Vanilla Sky went completely off the rails Open Your Eyes takes some strange twists and turns but you can follow along if you try. The movie asks you for some serious suspension of disbelief but at least it doesn't throw so much stuff at you that it becomes utter nonsense like Vanilla Sky did. Give some credit to Eduardo Noriega whose performance in the lead role of Csar is much stronger than Tom Cruise's corresponding star turn in the remake. And this movie's Penlope Cruz also comes across much better than that movie's Penlope Cruz. Strange how the same actress playing the same role can be so much better in one movie than in the other. Maybe it's her comfort level with the language maybe it's just that she's surrounded by a better movie than she was in Vanilla Sky. Open Your Eyes is not a great movie a little too convoluted for its own good. Somewhat slow not always as dramatic and engaging as you would hope. But all in all the movie does have an intriguing story which if you can wrap your head around it makes the movie worth seeing. For whatever flaws the movie may have you can understand what Crowe saw in it. Too bad he made such a mess of it when he got his hands on it.".

Here's a plot summary.  The protagonist's irresponsible and misogynist playboy lifestyle gets him mutilated  a result worse than death for this shallow vain exploiter.  He can't handle it because he is so very mentally weak and tops himself promised a cryogenic paradise.

His emptiness will haunt him by undermining his dream from the inside and through the collapse of his dream paradise he will experience something greater than he ever experienced in life as he grows to love a woman entirely his own conjectural creation based only on tidbits he picked up about an unusual stranger in the real world?Well actually no.

Well I'm so pleased for the weak shallow murderous misogynist monster.END OF SPOILERSTo conclude this is a movie entirely without message and for that reason is an abhorrence.  It is considerably worsened by its laughably feeble attempt to give itself a full explanation at the end.  We have long become accustomed to cod science in science fiction but this movie's complete lack of irony or concession to its own scientific inanity is really very insulting especially given that the scientific hollowness is not an expedient for a significant message as it is in the PKD short story.About half way through the movie there is a very skilful little homage to Jacob's Ladder with a shot of the sun shining through some treetops moving gently from bottom of the screen to the top.  Believe me Jacob's Ladder has everything Abre Los Ojos lacks and for that reason is a very good film indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I didn't get to see 'Vanilla Sky' in 2001 when I got the chance to see it was still a relatively recent movie. Back then I didn't know yet that many of the recent movies I saw were in reality remakes. In other words I didn't know there were original versions.At the time I had good expectations about Vanilla Sky partially because of its delicious title and partially because it appeared to be good. I was frankly disappointed with it.This one the original and true version is superior easily eclipsing the remake. Even what seemed good in Vanilla Sky before seems mediocre next to the original. If you want 'Vanilla Sky' done right don't look any further  this is it.Admittedly it's still not an easy movie but it's marginally easier to understand than the flawed American version. But even the original requires extra attention otherwise it will be even more confusing. It's also more intriguing more suspenseful more tragic more touching more original more artistic deeper and more intense not to mention it has a very nice soundtrack.Overall a movie of higher quality. And ahead of its time. In 1997 movies this brave and complex were something from another world or even another planet. Nowadays we easily find movies like this but in 1997 that was another music.On paper Abre los ojos is the predictable story of a young man Csar who has everything in life he is rich goodlooking popular among his friends and lucky with women. That's the easy part. Behind this simple idea lies an extraordinary and exceptionally complex story. Unexpectedly Csar meets the charming Sofia and instantly falls in love with her. She corresponds but soon Csar's life changes completely when his insanely jealous lover Nuria tricks him into a trap by offering him a ride covering her true intentions. She intentionally commits suicide by crashing the car. Csar survives but his face gets seriously deformed.Csar is willing to pay anything for a cosmetic surgery so that he can have his normal face again return to his life and reconquer Sofia. Much for Csar's sorrow nobody can or doesn't want to operate his face. After that traumatizing experience Csar becomes emotionally unstable aggressive confused deeply depressed and his mental health changes dangerously he suffers from flashbacks disturbing visions is unable to distinguish dreams from reality and even confounds Sofia with Nuria  and by seeing Nuria instead of Sofia he reacts with violence to that and the innocent Sofia is the one who pays. To tell the truth the film comes to a point which is almost impossible to tell what's real and what's not  but all this complicated mess only makes it more interesting and remarkable. An amazing yet strong movie with also a surprising ending...But the movie isn't all about tragedy. There is also a romance between Csar and Sofia and there is some sexuality. The lovely Penlope Cruz is seen naked. Penlope is beautiful with clothes but naked she is simply divine. And she's got very lovely boobs.Eduardo Noriega is superb so much better than Tom Cruise. The actress who plays Nuria despite her minor role is clearly superior to Cameron Diaz. Penlope Cruz is in both versions and plays the same role in both but she is better in this one. Maybe it was the pressure and boredom of doing the same thing twice which affects the performance? Maybe because in the original she speaks her native language? Must be that. Not that I blame her. I love Chete Lera's fantastic acting as Antonio and Grard Barray's terrific acting as Serge Duvernois and he speaks Spanish so well that you don't even notice any french accent on him. Fele Martnez is good as Csar's friend Pelayo.Title in Portugal 'De Olhos Abertos'.".

It seems that the bad prediction of Fatima in this movie seen in the cup of tea was really concerning you. You passed few months after acting in this movie in a so strange motorcycle accident. I saw this movie. This is not the best movie you could have done but somehow it is so much you. A racist defending the rights of every man and woman. A new rich defending all the old poor. A pacifist defending all activists. A fat man attempting to give food to most of hungry men Restos du Coeur. I have never been able to understand exactly who you were Coluche. One thing is sure you died too early and every one of your warnings has been verified to be correct. The politicians from all sides in most countries are as you described them when you were alive.

It seems that the bad prediction of Fatima in this movie seen in the cup of tea was really concerning you. You passed few months after acting in this movie in a so strange motorcycle accident. I saw this movie. This is not the best movie you could have done but somehow it is so much you. A racist defending the rights of every man and woman. A new rich defending all the old poor. A pacifist defending all activists. A fat man attempting to give food to most of hungry men Restos du Coeur. I have never been able to understand exactly who you were Coluche. One thing is sure you died too early and every one of your warnings has been verified to be correct. The politicians from all sides in most countries are as you described them when you were alive. You were so right to make fun of all of them. As I am writing this note TV5 International in its show Envoye special is reporting about Darfour and its horrors...

This in no way deterred audiences who couldn't care less about the supposed health benefits of au naturel sunbathing but merely came to ogle what was yet to become known as TA.Nobody's fool when it came to spotting a moneymaking venture ahead of everyone else Meyer simply went one step further taking the nudity out of the familyfriendly communal context and brazenly relocating it within everyday situations though still dissociated from eroticism giving birth to the shortlived nudie cutie subgenre which begot THE ADVENTURES OF LUCKY PIERRE by Herschell Gordon Lewis and David Friedman another eagleeyed trend watcher and band wagon hopper and NOT TONIGHT HENRY from Ted Paramore the man who eventually became hardcore mogul Harold Lime. For the sake of historical accuracy however giving credit where it's due Russ got there first kickstarting an unparalleled carnal cinematic career in as much as being the recipient of considerable critical praise long before its author's passing.The simple setup for THE IMMORAL MR.

Relaxing on a secluded strip of beach after a hard day's work he spies on a glamor photographer convincing bikiniclad model Dawn Danielle to pop her top. A dose of laughing gas as part of root canal treatment which must surely be considered some sort of fringe benefit given his line of employment equips Mr. Teas with the uncanny ability to see through ladies' clothes as they obliviously go about their business ! Hence the previous teasing finally pays off and although or precisely because the girls' actions while naked are casual and devoid of any overt eroticism the impact on audiences of the day must have been substantial.Meyer counterbalances these ignorant skin displays with situations where nudity would more naturally occur such as a stripper strutting her stuff at a house of burlesque watch out for the director's cameo as an audience member and even the odd jokey juxtaposition like cutting from a fruit stand overflowing with ripe melons to a headless shot of the ample wares  probably the sole set up to Meyer's subsequently welldocumented taste in size  of popular British nude model June Wilkinson who went on to star in saucy '60s favorites as Doug Fowley's delirious MACUMBA LOVE and Harold David's CAREER GIRL along with major studio risqu fare like Albert Zugsmith's THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ADAM AND EVE and the Francis Ford Coppolalensed inserts for the German THE BELLBOY AND THE PLAYGIRLS. While the character of Mr. Teas was conceived as a kind of naughty version of Jacques Tati's revered Mr. Hulot personage most of the intended comedy falls flat due to poor timing a rare exception provided by the scene in which an apparent prostitute literally tries to talk our beleaguered antihero out of his rumpled overalls only to have her turn out as a housewife with too much time on her hands who just wants to do the Good Samaritan thing by ironing his clothes much to his obvious disappointment !Correctly if unceremoniously photographed by Meyer who would flex his artistic muscles far more conspicuously on subsequent outings the movie was shot without live sound. Instead it has hilariously overblown narration  soon to become a directorial trademark  by prolific TV writer Edward J. Lakso who rather astonishingly also supplied an insanely catchy theme tune which should grate on your last nerve well before fadeout. Aside from never being particularly funny the surprisingly extensive nude scenes in flick's second half make it hold up remarkably well half a century down the line. True the rating on this one's a bit tricky quite generous in light of the film's intrinsic qualities. The tremendous historical importance of Meyer's pioneering effort should not be underestimated however. Nudies gave way to roughies and ghoulies as the '60s progressed mutating and evolving into the suddenly socially acceptable theatrically screened soft and hardcore adult movies of the following decades.".

There is no sex here Teas never gets to touch any of these girls undoubtedly due to the limitations of what could be shown in a releasable film of the time.

Meyer fans used to the highly pneumatic girls in his later films might find the rather more conventionallyshaped women here disappointing but they are generally reasonably good looking.The direction sometimes exhibits Meyer's trademarks rapid cuts cleavage closeups and tilted angles but is far more conventional than his later work. There is no dialogue here just a voiceover that pops up from time to time to explain a few extraneous details.Overall this is a sweet meandering movie a bit like a Jacques Tati film but with less jokes and frequent nudity. The humour comes in patches sometimes it is intentional sometimes not. Seeing Teas spying on an undressing lady virtually right in front of her eyes provides some daft laughs.Watch out for Meyer himself as a patron in a burlesque club and June Wilkinson in a role which requires nothing more of her to be seen than her naked breasts at a window.610.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie contains some nude scenes but there is no frontal nudity because of the time it was made 1959 Although the film has no dialogue  only narration it's nice to see the way early adult films had to adhere to the strict codes of the 50's. The movie is about a dental parts salesman who can't help but notice the sexy women in the dentist's office at the bar and at the beach.

But mind you this is PG 13 material in this film and harmless and quaint. No sexual situations or any interaction physically. The reason this movie stands out is the photography Eastman Color...wow...these locations are awesome. Now if you have the chance to watch this movie on Ultra HD calibrated it gives you a personal and real feeling of LA and Brentwood before the glut. Many films of the day featured downtown LA or the wonderful exotic parks. Rarely do we get a chance to see the rest of Cali the places where people lived caught the bus and did their everyday living. The nice thing is as Mr. Teas rides around on his bike we get a very exact time capsule of Cali 1959. And for that I say sit back and enjoy this afternoon break where the beautiful women are the icing but not the cake..the location is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Russ Meyer's debut feature film caused a sensation on original release. It was incredibly risqu for its time and pushed the boundaries of what was permissible. What Meyer basically did with this film was to introduce breasts to the big screen. And for this at the very least many of us should be eternally grateful. Up until this point nudity was very scarce at the cinema and when it did show up it usually consisted of people playing volleyball in nudist colonies. This movie brought in a much more overt eroticism to the mix. Needless to say it made an absolute mint at the box office. Clearly these were more innocent times and The Immoral Mr. Teas isn't at all shocking now. Its nudity is really in fact somewhat charming. But historical context is everything in understanding the importance of this movie. And the fact is that this film was groundbreaking.Unfortunately it isn't an awful lot of fun to watch now. Its plot is simple  a man discovers that he can see women naked as the side effect of some medication he is given at the dentists. It's basically an excuse to see boobs. But the movie in actual fact is a drag as a result primarily of the lack of synchronized sound and awful endlessly repeated music. There is a narrator who just talks drivel quite frankly. He sounded strangely like Criswell the TV astrologist and star of a couple of Ed Wood flicks. Even Meyer's photography  normally a guaranteed strong point  is below average.For me Meyer only became a good filmmaker from Lorna onwards. Although it's a term I virtually never use the early nudiecuties are just a bit dated to really carry much impact. This one has historical importance for sure but it didn't do much for me otherwise unfortunately.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria. However three things complement the story making this an extremely good movie.First the actors use the actual languages of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian the Hungarians only Hungarian the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English. As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when heshe cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them. Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film. No subtitles are necessary.Second. I was in Hungary in 1995 and I'm telling you this movie has it right on. From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double. I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. Actually the film was shot in Austria.Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner after The King and I and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film. Don't miss this one.".

If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double. I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. Actually the film was shot in Austria.Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner after The King and I and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film. Don't miss this one.";

	schema:headline " Yul and Deborah Try Again for Love";
	schema:reviewBody "The Journey is a romantic version of the cold war.  It's about an English woman Deborah Kerr  trying to smuggle her former love a Hungarian scientist Jason Robards Jr. out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956.  She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.Of course the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check.  The Russian  officerincharge Yul Brynner becomes attracted to the English woman Deborah Kerrand delays the trip.  Of course the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him.  Of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch.  Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Ms. Kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting.  The good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue.  Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian Revolt would not appreciate this movie they would consider it a piece of fluff.  This is my favorite Yul Brynner role.  He speaks with his own masculine voice and is very attractive especially when he becomes vulnerable.  This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner since they made The King and I in 1956.  They make a very attractive couple.  Too bad they never worked again.  This was the second sexy role Ms. Kerr took since From Here to Eternity.  Despite the fact that Ms. Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual.  The fine supporting cast was headed by Jason Robards Jr. in his first film role. Some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance Robert Morley from England.  However the rest of the actors I have never seen before or since were just great in the movie.  In the background it was fun to see Senta Berger as one of the maids speak a few lines of Hungarian.  A few years later in 1966 she was in a movie Cast a Giant Shadow with Yul Brynner as his leading lady.  She is still working today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen several Yul Brynner filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments Taras Bulba The Magnificent Seven The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story. Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character.Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress. She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey Quo Vadis and The Night of Iguana memorable.Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good peopleDr Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the postMcCarthy era.The film is also unusual in its castinggreat French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimeerub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international than American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment.Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored? version has a dignified charm of its ownprovided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales e.g. the last bus ride and the final kissBut I do have one grousewhy do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently e.g. Insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.".

Though the film has yet to be released on video or DVD it remains one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Because of the political unrest a group of travelers cannot fly out of Budapest but are put on a bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border however their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surov.The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country. Indeed Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger Paul Fleming Jason Robards Jr. who pretends to be an American but fools no one. She is helping Fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him. Among the other passengers are a British journalist played by Robert Morley an American family played by E.G. Marshall his wife Anne Jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little Ron Howard.Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore Deborah Kerr and a romance of sorts develops between them. She offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats. The Cold War intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing. It remains however one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance.".

When given an intelligent script to work with he suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri. But that's because writer Tabori actually gave Yul as the Conflicted Russian Officer the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them. For example a propos of folk music he says musingly You hear a man crying in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough you know what he cries for. You look surprised Lady Ashmore. Despite what you may have heard tractors and Marxism aren't the only things the Russian cares for. There is always time for music.Brilliant!!".

This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. As they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances. For example I have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came facetoface with a Russian soldier. Even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after WWII and was most likely gangraped by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hungarian Rebellion of 1956 fostered partly by bellicose rhetoric from the USA about 'rolling back the red tide' started and was left to wither without any support at all from the west other than taking in refugees. I remember my third grade class taking in one such during the mid year. The satellite countries of Eastern Europe would have to wait until the Soviet Union collapsed for liberation. Then we always did not get what we'd like for reference look at the former Yugoslavia.The Journey is a film about a group of foreigners trapped within Hungary and seeking a way out. After being stuck in the Budapest Airport for a few days the group is informed the Russians will provide transport to the Austrian border by bus. But one of the foreigners a titled Englishwoman played by Deborah Kerr is traveling with Jason Robards Jr. who is under an assumed name. Robards is Hungarian a scientist and a supporter of the revolution.They are stopped again near the border and detained in Kurt Kaszner's hotel while the Russians check on the passengers. Robards arouses Russian Major Yul Brynner's suspicions but his hormones are aroused by Deborah Kerr.Anatole Litvak who was Hungarian when he was handling the politics was on firm ground in The Journey. When he got into the romantic sad to say he was hearkening back to his days in Hollywood when he directed a lot of romantic schmaltz. Try as I might I could not believe that Yul would be deterred in his duty his character is a lot like Bounine the man he played in Anastasia also directed by Litvak. The characters of the passengers of the travelers is also interesting. Robert Morley was not playing for laughs as he does not do a John Bull type Englishman but he's caring confidante for Kerr. I did like Anne Jackson pregnant with two children traveling with her and her husband E.G. Marshall. Anne's character has a practical turn of mind and everyone should have been listening to her. Anouk Aimee is also good as a humorless and resolute Hungarian rebel.And this review is dedicated to Veronica Laszlo wherever she is the little girl who joined my third grade class way back in the day when she fled Hungary. I hope she had a good life in America.".

The Frenchmen implore the girl to sacrifice her honour for the greater good.

Blixen's girl is a proud young beauty Heloise and she manages to convince her fellow travelers that they would rather die than ask her to take off so much as a glove. She wins the battle but Blixen then hands us one of her greatest ironical twists Heloise later turns out to be  and to have been at the time of the war  a celebrated nude dancer in Paris and she is very proud of her beauty.

	schema:headline " Reduces the Hungarian Revolution to another flirtation between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner";
	schema:reviewBody "Even at the height of the Cold War there were relatively few Hollywood films about the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe The Journey set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 is one of the few exceptions. A multinational group of foreign tourists find themselves trapped in Budapest by the outbreak of the revolution. There are no flights out of the country but the Soviet authorities organise a bus to transport them across the Austrian border. They are detained however in a small border town by the local Soviet commander Major Surov and forced to stay in a local hotel. Among the group are an aristocratic Englishwoman Lady Diana Ashmore and her friend and travelling companion Henry Fleming. Although Fleming also claims to be English and is travelling on a British passport it soon becomes clear that he is an impostor. His real name is Paul Kedes and he is a Hungarian citizen who was imprisoned and tortured by the Communist regime. He was released from jail by the revolutionaries and is attempting to flee the country with the help of Lady Diana his former lover. Surov is well aware that Fleming is not what he seems but he hesitates to arrest him. A number of reviewers have commented on the links between this film and Guy de Maupassant's story Boule de Suif although the emphasis is rather different. In de Maupassant's story the main character was a prostitute and the moral dilemma confronting her was whether she should obtain the freedom of herself and her fellow passengers by sleeping with a German officer. That story was set during the FrancoPrussian War. In The Journey the main moral dilemma explored is whether Diana should obtain the freedom of herself and her fellow passengers by betraying Kedes to the authorities as some of them urge her when they discover the truth about his identity.Contrary to one reviewer's description of him Surov is not mean and nasty. The German officer in Boule de Suif is certainly a nasty piece of work like many Frenchmen post 1871 de Maupassant clearly believed that Germanophobia was an essential element of French patriotism. Surov however is a more complex character basically a decent man despite the nature of the regime he serves. During the Cold War it was unusual for a Red Army officer to be portrayed sympathetically by Hollywood the West occasionally made films which portrayed Russian characters in a good light but these were normally set either in prerevolutionary Russia War and Peace or based on works by antiCommunist writers such as Pasternak Dr Zhivago or Solzhenitsyn One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. The film reunited Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner who had previously starred together in The King and I. Both are good here especially Brynner who brings out the various sides of Surov's character. He can be domineering and frightening but also cultured and capable of decency. He has always been a dedicated Communist and a loyal supporter of the Soviet system seeing the Russian forces in Hungary not as occupiers but as liberators who have freed the country from Fascism. He reacts to the Hungarian Revolution with the same baffled incomprehension with which a dedicated and conscientious British colonial official might have reacted to say the Mau Mau insurgency in Kenya or the EOKA uprising in Cyprus. For the first time he begins to question his loyalties as he realises that for many Hungarians the events of 1945 represented not liberation but merely the exchange of one form of oppression for another. Kerr's Diana is gracious and feminine as well as strongminded and determined. The film also features a number of other wellknown names E.G. Marshall Ann Jackson Jason Robards Anouk Aimee some of them in only minor roles. One contribution which stood out was from Robert Morley as the pompous officious Englishman who appoints himself the leader of and spokesman for the group of travellers. My main problem with the film is that it perhaps tried to follow de Maupassant too closely by having Surov fall in love with Diana thus giving him another reason to detain the travellers for as long as possible. For me the SurovDianaKedes love triangle was an unnecessary diversion from the film's more interesting political themes. I felt that the film might have been more interesting had it tried to explore the causes of the Hungarian Revolution in more detail. I have no problem with a film which portrays an individual Soviet officer in a good light but I felt that the character of Surov needed to be placed in context. Had all Soviet officials in the country and their counterparts in the Hungarian Communist Party been as liberal and decent as he then the Revolution would never have broken out. Hungarian viewers may well feel annoyed that one of the most tragic and heroic episodes in their country's history their fight against an oppressive Stalinist regime is here reduced to little more than the background to another flirtation between the stars of The King and I. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer. Finally as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice. So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate. A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him  and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stage.To me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr Jason Robards Jr. Robert Morley E. G. Marshall Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in pretty modern times  the powderkeg that was Hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers. The West stood by and let this happen England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis and the U.S. had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close allies of the U.S. the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it.In the film Brynner is Major Surov a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt one of whom is Paul Kedes Jason Robards. Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary led by Robert Morley including Marshall Jackson and Howard and Kerr. The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and Brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards. But Brynner is human  he tries to be ingratiating with these people all of whom see him as a monster and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 How is it even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards Kerr who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major. And as the film reaches it's tragic climax we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on Kerr Robards and the other westerners who want to leave. It becomes a true struggle for him  and one that he may win far too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed.".

Finally as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice. So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate. A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him  and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stage.To me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr Jason Robards Jr. Robert Morley E. G. Marshall Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in pretty modern times  the powderkeg that was Hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers. The West stood by and let this happen England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis and the U.S. had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close allies of the U.S. the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it.In the film Brynner is Major Surov a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt one of whom is Paul Kedes Jason Robards. Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary led by Robert Morley including Marshall Jackson and Howard and Kerr. The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and Brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards. But Brynner is human  he tries to be ingratiating with these people all of whom see him as a monster and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 How is it even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports and his growing fondness towards Kerr who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major. And as the film reaches it's tragic climax we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on Kerr Robards and the other westerners who want to leave. It becomes a true struggle for him  and one that he may win far too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Journey is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems which influenced the movie's success because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War The Journey is a very good film but not wellknown. I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters Major Surov and Diana Ashmore. Another quality is the script which is very well written. It was even published as a novel by the screen player George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end. At first we didn't know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist Major discovers that Diana's friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go. But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmedthe Major and Diana say Goodbye! she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including Paul while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians so he dies. Yul Brynner is very very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an English Lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should watch this film. The Journey has everything that a good film should havea great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction Anatole Litvak is in my opinion at his best. Finally I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic films Please release The Journey on DVD as soon as possible.".

Robert Morely was very entertaining somewhere between the amoral crook in Beat the Devil and the spoof on Mr. Goldfinger he did in The Road to Hong Kong.

Of course the best work in acting was done by Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner. They were attracted to one another even though Lady Ashford was dedicated to helping her former lover who is just a pain in the neck even though he was a hero and a freedom fighter. I guess Deborah Kerr signifies The West and Brynner The East in the days of the Cold War. Brynner's Soviet Major can't understand why the Hungarians hate the Russians meddling in their internal affairs since the Soviets were the ones who freed them from the Fascist yoke only 11 years before and he gives vent to his hurt feelings under the influence of lots of vodka. You almost feel sorry for the Major  he's so tied up in defending the USSR that he's begun to believe it's twisted propaganda. Another reviewer here asks why after defeating Nazism together relations between The West and The East broke down so quickly and we had the Cold War...there was just no natural affinity there that's the mostlikely reason. Americans saw oppression  taxation without representation  and just refused to live that way and fought an 8 year war to rid themselves of their unwanted Mother Country. But with Marxists they see most everyone as victims. Victims of bosses victims of landlords etc. and tell all their little people that they can't overcome their perpetual victimhood without a strong and oppressive state to protect them.".

Yes it's undeniable  yul brynner's character of the warweary russian major with the heart of gold is treated like a necessity and despite how strongly acted and overacted it weakens the tone of menacing discomfort of cold war life for foreigners accused of violations against the state. Hence all the suspected prisoners are treated with kid gloves even the proven revolutionary played by newcomer jason robards is treated like a gentleman from another mythical era where foreign spies are not abused. Visually it's beautiful and bright with no shortage of gray weather common to the Hungaryish locales of Vienna and nearby Austria. This movie isn't a classic nor mustsee. But it's better than most might suspect and a fun yet thoughtful spy adventure romp on a cold gray afternoon on the couch. Have a shot of vodka while you watch it since almost everyone in the movie do. And please try to remember that much of the smirkworthy dialogue about political events was no laughing matter in 1959.".

	schema:headline " A Cold War drama that reunites Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr";
	schema:reviewBody "Produced and directed by Anatole Litvak and written by George Tabori this unique Cold War drama is difficult to describe. There is a romance element to it which doesn't quite work though the motivations for Yul Brynner's interest in Deborah Kerr's character are clear he's been away from home too long. That plotline notwithstanding there is a very real feel given for the time and place Russian occupied Hungary in 1956 that gives the film a certain truth which makes it hard to quit watching once one has become engaged in it. Unfortunately the story drags on for at least 20 minutes too long. The film marks the only other pairing of these actors besides The King and I 1956.A group of foreigners have found themselves unable to fly out of Budapest because of the political situation hence they are trapped and given no choice besides the promised passage by the occupying Russian forces. They are put on a bus ostensibly headed for Vienna but they are detained just short of their destination by a Major Surov Brynner who wants to make sure no natives are escaping amidst the group.Robert Morley playing a British television journalist serves as the defacto spokesman for the tourists which include an old acquaintance of his Lady Diana Ashmore Kerr. Ashmore is in fact smuggling an Hungarian friend of hers traveling as American Paul Fleming Jason Robards Jr. in his film debut but fooling no one for long out of the country. She feels she owes a debt to him because through a complicated series of events he was held prisoner and tortured by the Russians in part due to his association with her years previously. An American family which includes E.G. Marshall Anne Jackson and their two sons one of which is played by a four year old Ron Howard in his first credited role is among the twelve others being detained by the Major.The drama begins when for reasons that are not explained right away Major Surov decides not to send the foreigners' passports to headquarters.

	onyx:emotionText "Produced and directed by Anatole Litvak and written by George Tabori this unique Cold War drama is difficult to describe. There is a romance element to it which doesn't quite work though the motivations for Yul Brynner's interest in Deborah Kerr's character are clear he's been away from home too long. That plotline notwithstanding there is a very real feel given for the time and place Russian occupied Hungary in 1956 that gives the film a certain truth which makes it hard to quit watching once one has become engaged in it. Unfortunately the story drags on for at least 20 minutes too long. The film marks the only other pairing of these actors besides The King and I 1956.A group of foreigners have found themselves unable to fly out of Budapest because of the political situation hence they are trapped and given no choice besides the promised passage by the occupying Russian forces. They are put on a bus ostensibly headed for Vienna but they are detained just short of their destination by a Major Surov Brynner who wants to make sure no natives are escaping amidst the group.Robert Morley playing a British television journalist serves as the defacto spokesman for the tourists which include an old acquaintance of his Lady Diana Ashmore Kerr. Ashmore is in fact smuggling an Hungarian friend of hers traveling as American Paul Fleming Jason Robards Jr. in his film debut but fooling no one for long out of the country. She feels she owes a debt to him because through a complicated series of events he was held prisoner and tortured by the Russians in part due to his association with her years previously. An American family which includes E.G. Marshall Anne Jackson and their two sons one of which is played by a four year old Ron Howard in his first credited role is among the twelve others being detained by the Major.The drama begins when for reasons that are not explained right away Major Surov decides not to send the foreigners' passports to headquarters. That would be the usual procedure which would have allowed these travelers the most expeditious way out of Hungary. But Surov having been in charge of this border town for 2 years is lonely for human conversation perhaps even more. He is quickly frustrated when his guests led by a judicious Morley are unwilling to engage him in adult discourse and instead act like apolitical humble prisoners.The fact that Fleming can't present himself for meals  he'd been injured in his escape  and that it's Lady Ashmore that seems to care for him also intrigues the Major.

The last crop of films from that country seem to be critical to the situation there as in the case with Fernando Perez's Suite Habana and even in previous films by Mr. Tabio notably Plaff Guantanamera and Fresa y chocolate.This picture tackles in a subtle way some of the problems most Cubans face. In this case it's the chaotic public transportation system in Cuba. Like anything coming from this type of cinema what one is watching has a deeply different meaning for the locals who can identify with a situation that appears to have no solution.Thus we are taken to a remote small bus station where several people in need of transportation to all parts of the island have come to try to find means of getting to their destinations. Unfortunately the local bus based at the station is being repaired and is soon evident that it's not going anywhere. In the meantime the one bus that comes by could only take one passenger but as people try to storm the bus it pulls out leaving everyone stranded.Among the passengers one gets to know what motivates them to travel as confidences are exchanged. The film makes one thing clear and it is the Cuban character in accepting what comes their way and making the best out of the situation with humor. This society seems to make good of that saying about when God gives one lemons one makes lemonade! Among the performers in the film Vladimir Cruz and Thaimi Alvarino stand out. They play Emilio an engineer returning home to work in his father's plot of land as an agricultural laborer. Jacqueline the pretty woman is trying to get to Havana where her fianc a Spaniard is arriving to marry her and is taking her back to Spain with him. We also get to see Rolando a man that pretends to be blind in order to get a preferential treatment and go ahead of everyone else because of his condition. This situation is closely disputed by all the people that have been waiting for days without any hope of going anywhere. Jore Perugorria a frequent collaborator of Mr. Taibo does good work as Rolando the blind man.Talk about stoicism! This is a tribute to the Cuban character! Juan Carlos Tabio has directed with his usual flair making this a winning film that will please anyone.".

These films are Death by Hanging 1968 Diary of a Shinjuku Thief 1968 Boy 1969 The Man Who Left His Will on Film 1970 and Ceremonies 1971. Both Death by Hanging and Diary of a Shinjuku Thief originate from the same event the Komatsugawa High School Murders.In 1958 a young resident Korean named Ri Chin'u raped and killed two Japanese high school girls and as a result was executed in 1962. Ri drew the attention of a number of Japanese leftist intellectuals because of his vast intelligence and his correspondence with North Korean affiliated female journalist Bok Junan. Eventually a book of Ri and Bok's letters was published under the name Crime Death and Love. Because of his crimes Ri became the figurehead of a movement denouncing the Japanese Government's treatment of resident Koreans. In Death by Hanging entire sections of Ri and Bok's letters are included in the film and in Diary of a Shinjuku thief the protagonist Birdy Hilltop shares a common trait with Ri they both steal books.Much of the film's action takes place within the environs of the massive Kinokuniya bookstore in Shinjuku a recent construct at the time this film was made. After seeing a bizarre display outside the bookstore Birdy selects a few books to steal and makes his way out of the bookstore without paying. It seems that at first he is going to be able to make a clean break but he is stopped by Suzuki Umeko a young clerk at the bookstore who then takes him to the manager of the bookstore in both the film and in reality Tanabe Michio. However instead of turning Birdy over to the police Tanabe releases him and Birdy tells Umeko that he will return the nest day.When the next day comes Birdy returns to the bookstore and is once again caught by Umeko. This time around instead of picking up books by French Writers Birdy stole books of a much more sexual nature. Again Umeko takes Birdy to the manager who gives Birdy a copy of his book it does not sell anyway and gives the young couple money so that they can go out on a date.As Birdy and Umeko leave the building the viewer learns that Birdy gets his jollies from theft and that he almost climaxed when Umeko caught him. They then go to a fashion boutique in which Umeko steals an article of clothing of clothing so that she can experience the same feeling that Birdy had. It is after this point that the film gets truly odd.One of Oshima's goals when he became a film director was to create films that could not be lumped into a genre and that would truly make the film viewer think about what he or she was watching. Whereas Death by Hanging dealt with discrimination and the death sentence Diary of a Shinjuku Thief deals with sex and femalemale interaction. One of the most interesting scenes in the film consists of a roundtable discussion filled with alcohol and cigarette smoke involving Watanabe Fumio Toura Rokko both playing themselves but also playing other roles in the film Sato Kei and Oshima himself on the topic of sex and whether or now each member of the group had a fulfilling sex life and if the word sex meant the same to men and women.Intermingling within the film are the Juro Karo Situation players an acting troupe who add an even more theatrical aspect to an already highly theatrical film. Juro Karo who acts as a type of minstrel throughout the film was determined to revive kabuki to its older form when it used to be performed by ruffians on a dry riverbed instead of the highly sanitized aesthetic smorgasbord that it would later become.While it might not be one of Oshima's most accessible films Diary of a Shinjuku Thief is definitely an interesting ride and a must for those interested in Japanese New Wave films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Except for Boy the work of Nagiso Osima born 1932 is scarcely known around the West  though the film histories place him among the most important younger Japanese directors regularly comparing him to JeanLuc Godard his near contemporary and an obvious influence on his style. I should say that Oshima is certainly influenced by Godardespecially in mediumdistance shots. In long shots he is more often influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni. But in closeups and in almost everything else he seems firmly and not too appealingly himself. The burglar Tadanori Yokoo who under duress admits that his name is Birdey Hilltop steals books  good booksfrom a Tokyo bookstore. A girl Rie Yokoyama who says she's a clerk catches him and turns him in to the boss. The boss doesn't care about the thefts and doesn't really believe the girl works for him but he takes an interest in the young people anyway and attempts to straighten out their sex lives.That is what the movie is all aboutstraightening out their sex livesthough incidentally it touches on a great many other things as well. For example just as Birdey and his girl finally do straighten out their sex lives she simulates hara kari using a little of her own blood which happens to be the key to Birdey's heart all hell breaks loose with a student riot in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo. That's how the movie ends. But before it ends Birdey and his girl have been through a variety of bizarre experiences that range from visits to an analyst who analyzes transference of sexual roles and wants them to undress to imitation rape which turns out to be real when some onlookers get their signals crossed to participation in a dramatic happening produced in a style that seems to combine traditional noh with guerrilla theater. Some of the experiences are funny as when the wouldbe lovers go to a pleasure house where attendants on the roof manufacture a rain shower timed just to the moment of passionate surrender. More often the experiences are very dull with an air of having been produced only for purposes of demonstration. Like the more recent Godard Oshima's is a highly didactic cinema. But unlike any Godard it seems impreciseand possibly less concerned with the quality of its thoughts than the momentary effectiveness of its images. The result is a highpowered sterility in the midst of much energetic busyness. Diary of a Shinjuku Burglar has been photographed mostly in black and white occasionally in color and always with the sort of modish disjointedness that makes of the shock cut what the terrible zoom lens is to a different and less intellectual practice in movie making. I shouldn't want to dismiss Oshima on so little evidence but I don't see that he has brought very much to this film beyond a skillful eye a close familiarity with his betters and a lot of not very interesting ambitions.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Diary of a Shinjuku Thief";
	schema:reviewBody "I was wondering which of the films will prove to be the one big alternative experimental experience and to my surprise it had to be Nagisa Oshima's Diary of a Shinjuku Thief. As the festival director Gavin Liu had explained in the prescreening introduction this is a rare screening of the film and the owner of Kinokuniya bookstores is actually the man playing the Kinokuniya store manager in the film as are many of the performers playing themselves being nonactors going their own real thing as captured on celluloid.It's a treat all right but I suppose it's an acquired taste that I still haven't cultivated. One of the draws to this film is because I'm curious to see how Shinjuku the hotbed area in Tokyo where ail things youth and underground take place looked like in the swinging 60s having been there in two consecutive years already. The film opens with a crazy introduction of a man forced by a group to strip down to his underwear a rather flimsy one that barely protects his modesty being accused of stealing some pipes before the group start to cower when they see his tattoo. Then we're thrust into the narrative proper that deals with the titular bookstore thief Torio cheekily nicknamed Birdtop Tadanori Yokoo as the camera follows behind him through the extremely packed Kino bookstore  where you can't help that people around just happen to gaze into the camera  until he gets nabbed by the eagle eyed salesgirl Umeko Rie Yokoyama for taking a book out without paying for it.In fact he does so twice and besides to experience the high from pinching things a challenge he throws to Umeko later on in the story I suspect he does so because he's got quite the hots for Umeko an attractive though complicated lady that even the store manager probably sensed something brewing between them and offering not to report Birdtop to the cops but to gift him some books as well as cash for both Birdtop and Umeko to spend. That essentially launches them into having some time off if you will to visit everything else that Oshima's intended to put into his film with 4 different writers that will inevitably lead to a kaleidoscope of ideas bringing forth the massive melting pot of different folks with different strokes.Presented in sections split by intertitles that tell the time worldwide to local and other nuggets of trivia such as the weather condition at the time the film is almost documentary in nature come this point and interchanges between black and white and colour which I still have to figure out why other than to not miss out in capturing the vibrant colours present in particular performances and scenes. There's a visit to a sexologist whose area of research may challenge Kinsey's and a talking heads styled interview with a group that's focused predominantly on sex where it gets expressed verbally and later on having numerous sex scenes which had to justify its R21 rating in Singapore.Like the earlier films this one is also rich in music such as Juro Kara coming on at every opportunity with a guitar though the tunes were not quite up my alley. It's like a musical of sorts at times when characters inexplicably appears and break out into music. And while the story becomes more perplexing I gave up trying to piece the narrative together since it was clearly abandoned to showcase various performances available at that era in Shinjuku. In that respect this film will work relatively well in capturing things that will inevitably be lost as time goes by and for the modern audience to experience what it was like then especially those vaudeville theatre styled acts. The other scene I thought I enjoyed until it proved to be outstaying its welcome involved Umeko walking by shelves of books and quotes from the literary masters call out to her through voiceovers.The film ends with a montage of scenes involving some protests with the police out in force. I suppose this would have echoed the feelings of those who did not agree with the film some having to walk out before they get to the scene. A rare treat but one that calls for an acquired taste to thoroughly enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was wondering which of the films will prove to be the one big alternative experimental experience and to my surprise it had to be Nagisa Oshima's Diary of a Shinjuku Thief. As the festival director Gavin Liu had explained in the prescreening introduction this is a rare screening of the film and the owner of Kinokuniya bookstores is actually the man playing the Kinokuniya store manager in the film as are many of the performers playing themselves being nonactors going their own real thing as captured on celluloid.It's a treat all right but I suppose it's an acquired taste that I still haven't cultivated. One of the draws to this film is because I'm curious to see how Shinjuku the hotbed area in Tokyo where ail things youth and underground take place looked like in the swinging 60s having been there in two consecutive years already. The film opens with a crazy introduction of a man forced by a group to strip down to his underwear a rather flimsy one that barely protects his modesty being accused of stealing some pipes before the group start to cower when they see his tattoo. Then we're thrust into the narrative proper that deals with the titular bookstore thief Torio cheekily nicknamed Birdtop Tadanori Yokoo as the camera follows behind him through the extremely packed Kino bookstore  where you can't help that people around just happen to gaze into the camera  until he gets nabbed by the eagle eyed salesgirl Umeko Rie Yokoyama for taking a book out without paying for it.In fact he does so twice and besides to experience the high from pinching things a challenge he throws to Umeko later on in the story I suspect he does so because he's got quite the hots for Umeko an attractive though complicated lady that even the store manager probably sensed something brewing between them and offering not to report Birdtop to the cops but to gift him some books as well as cash for both Birdtop and Umeko to spend. That essentially launches them into having some time off if you will to visit everything else that Oshima's intended to put into his film with 4 different writers that will inevitably lead to a kaleidoscope of ideas bringing forth the massive melting pot of different folks with different strokes.Presented in sections split by intertitles that tell the time worldwide to local and other nuggets of trivia such as the weather condition at the time the film is almost documentary in nature come this point and interchanges between black and white and colour which I still have to figure out why other than to not miss out in capturing the vibrant colours present in particular performances and scenes. There's a visit to a sexologist whose area of research may challenge Kinsey's and a talking heads styled interview with a group that's focused predominantly on sex where it gets expressed verbally and later on having numerous sex scenes which had to justify its R21 rating in Singapore.Like the earlier films this one is also rich in music such as Juro Kara coming on at every opportunity with a guitar though the tunes were not quite up my alley. It's like a musical of sorts at times when characters inexplicably appears and break out into music. And while the story becomes more perplexing I gave up trying to piece the narrative together since it was clearly abandoned to showcase various performances available at that era in Shinjuku. In that respect this film will work relatively well in capturing things that will inevitably be lost as time goes by and for the modern audience to experience what it was like then especially those vaudeville theatre styled acts. The other scene I thought I enjoyed until it proved to be outstaying its welcome involved Umeko walking by shelves of books and quotes from the literary masters call out to her through voiceovers.The film ends with a montage of scenes involving some protests with the police out in force. I suppose this would have echoed the feelings of those who did not agree with the film some having to walk out before they get to the scene. A rare treat but one that calls for an acquired taste to thoroughly enjoy.";

The pulpy plot might be heavily contrived unpleasant and fairly ridiculous as it goes beyond and pushes reality many times. However this oneman riot machine provides ongoing gritty seedy and unapologetic excitement. No one is safe from this one man's devotion. I've got to find my little girl. A chiselled Brolin is fitting in the central role looking and acting the part. Cliff Gorman is particularly edgy as the scummy kidnapper. Then you have Richard S. Castellano bringing some solidity and Dan Hedaya is memorable as a psychotic cop. Director Robert Butler provides great location staging for its action and keeps a frenetic pace keeping things rough and ready.

What we did catch was the INCREDIBLE chase scene that takes the characters from cars to buses to trains to on foot as they crisscross Manhattan. Yeah Bullitt and The French Connection are good and all but the Night of the Juggler chase scene makes the action in those films seem average if not unambitious.This movie is sort of like the pinnacle of 70s80s streetstyle film making. It has the intense raw camera work of Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris flicks paired with a vision of New York City akin to Wild Style and maybe even just a hint of the Warriors. The characters here are a bizarre amalgam of clichs that still excite despite being retreads in many ways.The bottom line  score this movie if you can! Far as I know VHS was the final destination for this film in terms of home video. I bought my copy off of the Internet years ago and the tape was so old that it was broken.

Put this one in there along with Fort Apache The Bronx Taxi Driver the Death Wish series Escape From New York Roberta Findlay's Tenement and The Warriors. Recognizing that from the perspective of 2010 our collective image of New York City is no longer like this after over two decades of sprucing the place up you young'uns who don't have any memory of that period can get a good snapshot of the rampant fear and paranoia of those days in this film. It gives that same added emotional frisson you would get watching a fictional World War II movie that was made during the War itself realizing how seriously both the filmmakers and the audiences at that time would have looked upon this fictional presentation as a representation of reality knowing that lives were still on the line and the whole crappy situation was very much in full effect.The film's intentions are made clear as within five minutes into the movie we get terrorism a woman trying to kill maurading rats with a broom handle and a hot dog vendor telling the hero Jim Brolin Did you know that 10000 people left New York last month? The Psycho of the Hour the Juggler of the title a racist and a scumbag kidnaps a little girl and holds her for ransom. Her father is a rich realestate developer who Psycho Pants blames for destroying his South Bronx neighborhood by letting the Ns and the Ss move in and destroy all the buildings. Or so he thinks.But dummy has kidnapped the wrong girl she's really the daughter of James Brolin an excop with an anger management problem and a total lack of fear. Now in order to track down the Psycho Brolin is unleashed on an apocalyptic Manhattan landscape where he careens around like a pinball in a pinball machine contemporary reference there crashing trucks stealing police cars getting in fights with peep show booth bouncers and Puerto Rican gang members and beating the tar out of all of them. Brolin also gets hold of a psycho cop on his tail played with eyebulging glee by Dan Noon O Clock Shadow Hedaya and pushes Hedaya into a pen of vicious snarling attack dogs who then proceed to bite him a new one! Yowch! Meanwhile character actor great Richard S. Castellano is the lead cop on the cases who doesn't have contact with Brolin's character but is sort of watching him from afar. It's all building up to the final conflict between Brolin and the psychotic kidnapper in an underground bunker full of steam pipes. Yeah just like every other movie ever made Terminator 2 Commando Robocop...I could go on but I won't.This is REALLY sleazy and actionpacked for a major studio release and I loved it! Plus you get to see some great footage of Manhattan in its grimy prime and the devastated South Bronx landscape.Sure the plot is overthetop and ridiculous Brolin attacks almost everyone he comes into contact with including his exwife and he's supposed to be the Good Guy his daughter is not the most appealing character and the Police are all portrayed as barely competent idiots. I didn't care. I still enjoyed this movie immensely.That title does bite the big one though.".

Brolin also gets hold of a psycho cop on his tail played with eyebulging glee by Dan Noon O Clock Shadow Hedaya and pushes Hedaya into a pen of vicious snarling attack dogs who then proceed to bite him a new one! Yowch! Meanwhile character actor great Richard S. Castellano is the lead cop on the cases who doesn't have contact with Brolin's character but is sort of watching him from afar. It's all building up to the final conflict between Brolin and the psychotic kidnapper in an underground bunker full of steam pipes. Yeah just like every other movie ever made Terminator 2 Commando Robocop...I could go on but I won't.This is REALLY sleazy and actionpacked for a major studio release and I loved it! Plus you get to see some great footage of Manhattan in its grimy prime and the devastated South Bronx landscape.Sure the plot is overthetop and ridiculous Brolin attacks almost everyone he comes into contact with including his exwife and he's supposed to be the Good Guy his daughter is not the most appealing character and the Police are all portrayed as barely competent idiots. I didn't care. I still enjoyed this movie immensely.That title does bite the big one though.";

I was truly shocked!!

James Brolin gives a fine performance as a truck driver who's daughter is mistaken for  a politician's daughter and kidnapped by a crosseyed psycho who takes her to his underground lair based in the ruins of a empty tower block. After seeing his daughter abducted then giving chase but later losing them both in the New York crowds Brolin's character despairs at the incompetence of the police at trying to track the kidnapper and sets about finding his daughter himself.  This enables us all to see the delights now no more of New York's Time Square The Peep Shows The Hookers The LowLifes. There's also plenty of swearing and over the top Gang action just like another movie produced at about the same time The Warriors Walter Hill directorI quite like this movie and have a copy on tape which I occasionally slip into the VCR once in a while.

It's not only a tense thriller with good performances but it's also one of those movies that give a great impression of New York City before the Disneyfication. Not only that the deterioration of the city is a major theme in the movie.You see Gus Cliff Gorman is a psychopath who blames City Hall for the squalor he lives in and the real estate magnates for the destruction of the old neighborhoods. He lives in a derelict building in The Bronx which was once owned by his family. Now it's a pile of rubbish. 'This used to be real nice up here' he says while he walks past mountains of rubble with his young kidnap victim. He's not thinking of moving. 'I'll always live here. No matter how many racial slur they send in to burn the place down'.Gus has come up with a plan kidnap the daughter of a real estate magnate take his money and teach him a lesson. But there's a mixup and he ends up kidnapping the kid of an excop James Brolin who starts a frantic manhunt through NYC's underbelly to track down the kidnapper and get his daughter back. Highlights include a brawl in a peep show a confrontation with some genuine 'Bronx warriors' and Brolin's constant fights with his former colleagues.It's a good movie. Not a classic by any means but I liked the fact that the depressing state of the city was not merely a visual backdrop but also a theme in the picture. For this reason Night of the Juggler could make for an excellent double bill with the fascinating Wolfen Michael Wadleigh which was made the same year and has a similar theme running though its horror story.".

Barnes is without question the worst of the worst he not only wanted to get Boyd for testifying against him but wanted to let Soltic get away with his daughter. Spoilers I liked it when this guy got torn apart in the zoo. Maria Julie Carmen really works well as the love interest. He meets her on the 6 train and she helps him navigate around through the South Bronx and at the zoo she also stands up to gang bangers who complain about Boyd being with Our Women. The best character is Lt. Torelli Richard Castellano who starts out very suspicious of Boyd then starts to take his side and along with Maria become the only allies that Boyd has. I liked the film a lot but the dating requires a deduction of 2 stars. 810.".

Meanwhile the bitter  psychopathic sewer worker Gus Soltic Cliff Gorman has been watching a girl named Virginia Clayton Robyn Finn the daughter of rich property developer Hampton Richmond Clayton III Marco St. John who has used gangs of thugs to drive people of of his neighbourhood in order to buy the land cheaply Gus plans to kidnap Virginia  hold her to ransom for one million dollars but his plan goes wrong  he ends up kidnapping Kathy Boyd by mistake. Having seen his daughter taken Sean sets out on a mission to find  rescue her he has to deal with bent cops pimps gangs his exwife  Gus himself in a final showdown to the death...This oddly titled late 70's New York set action thriller is apparently also known as New York Killer here in the UK Countdown in Manhattan in Germany New York Connection in France  Pursued in Canada  was directed by Robert Butler under any name Night of the Juggler was based on the novel by William P. McGivern  is a pretty decent film that probably doesn't deserve to be as obscure as it currently is. The plot is pretty good the script doesn't waste much time in getting going  once Kathy is kidnapped the pace is pretty relentless as we get car chases fights a brawl at a peep show hostile gangs pimps dirty cops  a variety of oddball character's from stripper's to homeless drunks  surprisingly helpful taxi cab driver's. I wouldn't say any of Night of the Juggler is breathtaking  I wouldn't describe it as a lost masterpiece it's neither lost nor a masterpiece so why would I?! but for what it is I liked it enough. The New York setting really helps in fact the city  it's inhabitants  locations are as much the star as any of the character's I suppose it's a touch predictable  maybe a little bit too long at 100 minutes but I had a decent time watching it. The character's are alright  serve their purpose  the script has a reasonable go at tackling some themes like racism poverty corruption  the basic concept of community or the lack of it.From the skyscrapers of the city to Central park to the graffiti covered trains  tube stations to the porno district with pimps hookers  peep shows to the dark underground sewer system to housing estates that look like someone dropped a nuclear bomb on it Night of the Juggler spans just about most of New York  it's gritty sleazy late 70's early 80's cesspool feel  look. If nothing else Night of the Juggler is a bit of a nostalgia trip as the New York seen here is very different to the New York of today. The action scenes are pretty good from an impressive car chase to a shootout in the middle of New York to fights  the final somewhat forgettable climax inside the sewer system. There's some nudity  a fair bit of violence but nothing gory or sadistic.Filmed on location in New York you could not make Night of the Juggler now apart from the landscape of New York looking completely different just think how much it would cost to stage the car chases  shootouts in filming permits alone. There's very little information about Night of the Juggler out there as far as I am aware at this point it has never even been released on DVD. The acting is pretty good as various actor's bring the odd assortment of New York character's to life. Richard S. Castellano from The Godfather 1972 looks like he is one fryup away from a heart attack.Night of the Juggler is a decent action thriller with some seriously sleazy overtones it has a decent story  good action scenes while the Big Rotten Apple as it was back then provides some stark settings. I liked it  despite the awful title I would recommend it I didn't love it but I liked it.".

It would make much more sense than Night of the Juggler which has to be one of the most uninteresting titles ever assigned to a movie.  Not only are there tons of joggers everywhere but all the characters jog everywhere they go. Every time they need to go somewhere they jog. There is no real reason for this.Brolin and his daughter start out for her school jogging of course. But then she decides she can jog there by herself and Brolin turns around for the jog home. About twenty seconds later Brolin's daughter is kidnapped from the park when she is mistaken for a rich businessman's daughter.Here we come to one of the most implausible parts of the movie. The kidnapper throws her in the car and she just sits there calmly. She never tries to get out of the car. At several times they are stuck in traffic jams. Her window is down her door is unlocked for gods sake the car can't move and yet she does not even try to get out of the car.We head into a long chase scene with Brolin getting a cab to chase the kidnapper. After the kidnapper crashes his car he grabs the daughter by the hand and they run into the subway and catch a ride. Yes that's right the kidnapped daughter willingly runs with the kidnapper. They are on a crowded street and yet she never plants her feet and refuses to move or even screams for help. She just runs along with him.When they get off the subway the kidnapper steals a phone company van. He helps the daughter up into the front seat has her slide over to the passenger side....and she sits there. She doesn't even attempt to go open the door or get out. This girl should be charged as an accessory in her kidnapping!The other really annoying part of the movie is that as Brolin tries to find his daughter he is arrested or stopped by the police. But instead of saying my daughters been kidnapped. He keeps saying they have to let him go and either being really vague or trying to explain the whole story. Same thing happens when he tries to find what the kidnapper dropped outside a live girls porno place. He goes into the little viewing booths and does he say his daughter has been kidnapped and that he needs help. Of course not the big dope says I'm looking for a girl... Oh yeah that's really going to help in a peep show setting. Sigh....The movie is fairly frustrating as the characters sabotage themselves over and over again. It is only through this contrived sabotage that the kidnapper gets the daughter and Brolin doesn't get her back right away. And the kidnapper is really wacko but not in a scary way. We find out his motives when he explains the entire reason to the daughter as they are walking to his house  yeah that's right the daughter is still walking along with the kidnapper. Hell he isn't even holding her hand now. So if you can stand the frustration or if you are with friends and want to laugh at the sheer contrivances that keep this movie going be my guest and watch this movie  and remember the movie is about joggers not jugglers.".

Along the way Brolin meets up with a young Mandy Patinkin here miscast as an Hispanic cabbie replete with Speedy Gonzalez accent porn starhealth activist Sharon Lawrence as an exotic dancer in a an adult bookstore  back when NYC still had them!

I particularly enjoy a moment during the gang chase where Brolin and Carmen seem to merely be jogging away from them. Things degenerate when the film tries to become lurid and sensational with the twist that Gorman has just kidnapped this ungainly kid not only for ransom but for 'romantic' purposes to boot. The scene where he tries to force her to wear a dress is a hoot instead of being tense thanks to two rotten performers bouncing off one another Gorman all tics and actor's tricks emoting for all the world to see and Bluestone whiny and generally unsympathetic other than the fact that she's a kid one doesn't really care about her. What makes it all that much worse is that despite numerous opportunities to escape this girl does nothing for the most part and when she finally DOES attempt a getaway you'll be biting your lip as this pudgy pubescent waddles her way over assorted rubble. If it sounds like I'm being cruel or fattist let me add here I too am not foodshy and have plenty of extra baggage of my own. So quite frankly if the makers of this film nor its actress nor anyone else involved cared enough to present her in a flattering light why should the viewer make apologies? Finally the showdown between Brolin and Gorman comes and it takes place underground pathetically underlit in the old video transfer I own.

Those same suppressed giggles will automatically be unleashed at the moment when sensing he's lost Gorman attempts one last attack on Brolin and lunges for him emitting this highpitched utterly girlish squeal that'll have you rolling on the floor. A few moments later all and sundry walk off into the sunrise and an illfitting disco tune rears from nowhere over the end credits. While it may appeal to the actionflick crowd or a lessdemanding audience its REAL appeal lies at the feet of those of us who truly treasure lousy moviemaking. If that's you go ahead and indulge.

	schema:reviewBody "It's quite funny really I live in Brussels the city recently referred to as a hellhole by the newly elected at the time I'm writing this US President Donald Trump. Judging by this grim  gritty early eighties movie however the only genuine hellhole in the world is New York  and that's where Trump lives! No seriously apart from being a fastpaced and darkly entertaining actionthriller Night of the Juggler is primarily an antitourist campaign for the city of New York! Nothing you see here will ever make you want to go citytripping in the Big Apple! We're talking pauperized ghettos Puerto Rican gangwars filthy rancid sex clubs and maniacal shotgunwielding and corrupt policemen. Add to this a cast full of unlikable characters brutal violence raw editing  camerawork perverted undertones and genuine adult actresses and you seemingly have the perfect recipe of a typical '70s exploitation cocktail. But the odd thing is that Night of the Juggler isn't just some sleazy and Zgrade drivein flick but an actually well budgeted production from the distinguished Columbia Pictures studios! The teen daughter of excop turned truck driver Sean Boyd gets kidnapped in broad daylight and in the middle of a crowded Central Park but nobody reacts or even seems to care. Yes THAT is the New York City as illustrated in Night of the Juggler. The kidnapper is a racist pervert named Gus Soltic but he mistook Boyd's daughter for the daughter of a wealthy real estate contractor that he wants to extort and blame for the downfall of his childhood neighborhood. Whilst Soltic never properly realizes that he took the wrong girl her father literally races  on foot and by car  through the city. He searches for clues and witnesses but he also flees for the police because many of his former colleagues hate his guts. Night of the Juggler is a film full of flaws imbecilities and shortcomings. For example and like several other reviewers already righteously pointed out the relationship between the teenage girl and her kidnapper is bizarre and implausible. She doesn't fight back or scream hysterically! She doesn't grab one of the numerous opportunities to escape or call for help! In fact she doesn't resist at all. Her father doesn't make his own life any easier neither since he never properly makes the effort of explaining to the police or potential witnesses what has happened to his daughter. The dialogues are often underdeveloped and the film is overall too long. Particularly the whole climax is too tedious and fairly useless because it takes place in the sewers and half of the footage is too dark to follow. And yet I really liked the hefty atmosphere as well as many other things like the wild taxi ride at the beginning and the gloriously insane character played by Dan Hedaya. He plays a cop who used to be very corrupt and got degraded due to Boyd's testimony when he sees Boyd popping up in his precinct again he literally goes bonkers! Lead actors James Brolin Cliff Gorman and Richard Castellano give away more than adequate performances but they honestly can't match the psychopathic facial expressions linked to Hedaya's acting! Steady direction also by Robert Butler who's mainly known for his Disney liveaction classics The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and The Barefoot Executive. Rather than Disney guff Night of the Juggler more fits into the category with other vile NYC thrillers like Maniac Ms. 45 and The Exterminator.".

Car chases fist fights sleazy porno joints gangland violence and a maniac cop are all thrown into the mix but to little avail. Director Robert Butler expends all his energy on the seedy elements but forgets to create sympathetic characters and situations resulting in one long wallow in cinematic filth. At least the pacing is fairly relentless though that alone is hardly reason enough to watch.Excop Sean Boyd James Brolin witnesses his daughter's abduction by unhinged weirdo Gus Soltic Cliff Gorman. After giving chase but losing them in the busy streets of New York Boyd has to reluctantly seek the aid of the NYPD in tracking down his little girl. Finding that the cops are pretty unhelpful Boyd goes on a destructive rampage through the impoverished streets in search of his daughter. Along the way he upsets mad cop Sgt Otis Barnes Dan Hedaya who pursues him with a shotgun and causes more mayhem than the average criminal might consider pertinent in a day's work. Eventually Boyd discovers that his kid was not the intended target of the kidnapper  it was actually a millionaire businessman's daughter that the deranged villain meant to snatch. Still with his daughter in the hands of the maniac he relentlessly hunts for clues as to her whereabouts and eventually tracks down the abductor and his victim to an underground lair beneath a ruined tower block where a bloody final confrontation takes place.Brolin goes through the film wearing a fixed snarl and solving all his problems and frustrations by beating the hell out of everyone who stands in his way. Amazingly he's the good guy in all this but if you were to wander into the film late you might not realise that such is the nature of his destructive and volatile character. Gorman is hopeless as the kidnapper in a role that provokes more unintentional laughter than fear. Hedaya creates the most memorable character playing the maniac cop  who becomes a hindrance rather than a help to our hero  with overthetop glee. The lensing by Victor J. Kemper makes New York appear squalid and unappealing in the extreme  now that might be fine in a film like Taxi Driver where the squalor and filth was dwelled upon very deliberately and added to the disintegration of the De Niro character but in Night Of The Juggler the setting isn't supported by the bubblegum plot and succeeds only in making the film look ugly. There's plenty of foul language and car wrecking going on here if that's your kind of thing but on the whole Night Of The Juggler is an unconvincing urban thriller that will have most viewers reaching for the off button.".

In a nutshell a cop's young daughter is killed and a suspect arrested tried and imprisoned and this as they say is where the story really starts with the prisoner  Monty Clift lookalike Laurent Lucas  initiating a correspondence from his cell with the father of the murdered girl a correspondence he chooses to keep secret from his wife.

It wont take long for the viewer to be captured and then immersed into the storyline all the while not knowing what to expect. It has a sense of something is coming but what to it and finally that what appears giving one of the best closures to the human psyche one could have. I am in support of how well the story was acted out to the point where you accept and even support it come what may. I also like the hearing the French language with the subtitles too. Somehow the fact that it is in a different tongue causes me to pay more attention upping the emotional quota considerably. Definite must watch for a good evenings entertainment. Snacking a must with a tasty drink too. No interruptions or you lose the bonding aspect. Stay still and it paysoff nicely...enjoy".

Because of being so accommodating he has to leave his young daughter waiting as he is called by one of those people in need. The girl Emilie decides to go out on her bicycle. As the father returns to go out with her he finds she has been viciously killed in an isolated part of a park.The police investigation which Richard is part of finds a man Daniel Eckman that fits the description of the killer. Although the evidence is circumstantial the jury that tries him decides to send him to jail. Eckman like many prisoners serving time attract a following of admirers. Daniel begins corresponding with Christine Carlier who will be willing to get him free.At the same time Daniel Eckman starts writing to Malinowsky. In his letters he tries to redeem himself to the point that the detective himself grieving for his dead daughter appears to have doubts of having sent an innocent man to pay for a crime he did not commit. When his physician's wife Claire discovers what Richard has been doing behind her back it proves too much for her to endure. She walks out on him.As a new trial is ordered based on Malinowsky's and Christine's good faith Daniel Eckman is able to walk out of prison after only serving three years of his long sentence. What is more he will received money for having been wrongly accused. Daniel plans to go away with Christine but there is something when they finally meet that makes her a bit uncomfortable. During his own private investigation Richard Malinowsky gets some key information that will help him solve the puzzle and he is able to avenge Emilie's death.A fine film directed by Franck Mancuso who adapted a short story by Lawrence Block. The result is a credible 'policier' that never cease to get the viewer's attention. Add to that the excellent appearance by Jean Dujardin an actor that is getting praise for his role in The Artist and you get a winning combination. The story moves at a good pace as Mr. Mancuso moves from one incident to the next. There are some heavy hitters in the large supporting cast. JeanPierre Cassel Laurent Lucas who makes an impression with his Eckman Aurelie Recoing Agnes Blanchot and Caroline Santini contribute to the enjoyment of the film.".

It's perhaps because I live in the U.S. and have seen too many true crime shows but I was surprised when he did it.Laurent Lucas is handsome and underplayed his role as the imprisoned man. He does a wonderful job. He and Dujardin had the largest roles but everyone was convincing. Agnes Blanchot Jacques Frantz Jean Franois Garreaud and JeanPierre Cassel rounded out a forceful cast.What was so righton about the main characters is that one never knew what either one was thinking or was going to do next.Recommended.".

The movie itself is so campy so funny that even the most porn weary souls can watch this movie again and again just because Holmes and Cousteau were Porn Stars not porn actors put it this way without doing any spoilers when a movie has a plot involving a giant chicken and escorts with pizza and you actually enjoy it.

Then there is the efforts of the train dispatching office to try and safely stop the outofcontrol train. And also there's the hunt by the sadistic prison warden who is hellbent on recapturing the fleeing convicts.Relentless and engrossing action film from start to finish Runaway Train boasts two Oscar nominated performances from John Voight Manny and Eric Roberts Buck and no little intelligence with its well scripted characters. The opening quarter is pretty stock routine prison fare these guys are tough the warden is a bastard and we just know they are going to escape. But once the guys board the train the whole film shifts in gear and tone. The dynamic that exists between Manny  Buck partners but very different in life approach is riveting stuff courtesy of the nifty dialogue exchanges. Things are further enhanced by the appearance of Rebecca DeMornay's also stranded railway worker Sara who far from being a shoehorned token female character is the crucial piece of the emotional jigsaw. He presence gives the guys room to exorcise their demons and pour out their feelings of anger bravado and mistrust.The action scenes are very well handled by director Andrei Konchalovsky and his crew. As the train hurtles thru the snowy Alaskan wilderness we are treated to a number of crash bang wallops involving the train itself derringdo from our boys on the icy outside of the locomotive and a helicopter pursuit chartered by the obsessed John P. Ryan as Warden Ranken particularly stand out. Bona fide action sequences that are executed skilfully. Then we get to the finale a finale pumped up for emotional impact both visually and orally it closes the film justly. We even get time for a bit of Will Shakespeare as we go about reflecting on what we have just witnessed. A fine movie it be. 7.510".

The two main characters played by Jon Voight as Manny and Eric Roberts as Buck are escaped prisoners but they are humanized.  Not that we would really like to meet them but we can see how they work and we can identify with them.  I found it fascinating that the character I really hated was John P. Ryan as Renkin the warden.  This official of society has turned his efforts to recapture the prisoners particularly Manny into a personal mission of hatred. The cinematography and imagery in the film are excellent.  Whether exterior shots of the train hurtling across the desolate Canadian wilderness or claustrophobic shots of the characters in the train we are there and cannot help but be involved. There's not a bad performance in it.  John Voight Eric Roberts Rebecca De Mornay and John P. Ryan are all tremendous with an intensity that matches the demands of the film.

Action train crashes!! blood fingers!! surprises satisfying revenge  and an ending that I'm sorry but I've got to go on about it a bit is just simply breathtaking.How I wanted the movie to end on that final shot and how wonderful that it did with the choir and everything.  Superb  a gem.  Just a gem.  And what a surprise  from the marketing the hype even the video and DVD sleeve you couldn't pick this out from 1000 other bottom shelf dwellers in the video shop.  Just give yourself a treat and watch it.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Runaway Train' is a rare thing an intelligent action movie full of both exciting sequences and strong character development. This combination makes it all that much more suspenseful and powerful. For me it could well be the best action movie of all time. Interestingly enough it's based on a screenplay by Kurosawa but criminal turned novelist Edward Bunker who plays Jonah here but is best known to most people as Mr. Blue in 'Reservoir Dogs' gets the main writing credit. Jon Voight gives one of his very best performances as Manny but Eric Roberts is also just great. Roberts is overlooked these days making too many bgrade and straighttovideo movies to be taken seriously but boy back in the day this guy was GOOD! Check him out here and in 'Star 80' and especially 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' with Mickey Rourke. Roberts actually scored an Oscar nomination for 'Runaway Train'. Just why his career subsequently went in the direction it did is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood. Voight and Roberts are supported by Rebecca De Mornay super tough guy John P. Ryan 'It's Alive' and well loved character actor Kenneth McMillan. Also keep an eye out for Danny Trejo in the boxing sequence towards the very beginning of the film. 'Runaway Train' is a movie I never tire of watching. The interplay between Voight and Roberts is wonderful to watch the action sequences are breathtaking and the ending is one of the all time greats!".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember being wowed by Runaway Train back in 1985 when it first came out. Seeing it again on DVD in 1999 reminded me of just how excellent a movie this really was. I recommend Runaway Train to anyone who wants a large portion of philosophical meat and meaning mixed in with gripping action and a solid story. In the 15 years since Runaway Train was first released  I can't think of a movie other than The Matrix that has combined so much action tension and a strong  philosophy so successfully.Chances are you've never heard of Runaway Train. Amazing too. The movie was even based on a Akira Kurosawa screenplay and it shows. Jon Voight and Eric Roberts were at the top of their craft. In fact both received well deserved Oscar nominations for very powerful performances.It makes me sad to think that so few have had a chance to actually see this movie due to the sloppy studio backing and licensing turmoil born out of the collapse of the former GolonGlobus production studio. Surprise! GolonGlobus actually made at least one excellent movie outside of the their usual roster of shlock. But their poor reputation might have become so tarnished by that time that audiences didn't get a chance to know what they were missing. As a result the movie rarely if ever gets airplay or any notice. Since the DVD was one of the very first DVD's to be released when the universe of DVD owners was measured in thousands not millions it has once again fallen below the radar. Does a tree make a noise if it falls in a forest when there is no one around to hear it happen?Maybe that was how Runaway Train became all but forgotten. If the title were to be reissued today in an SE package I believe that a whole new generation of DVD viewers would be delighted to have this title in their collection. In the meantime it is worth seeking out for rental or purchase you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad original title there. It sounds as if Ben Johnson should be at the controls and Charles Bronson should be the expert who figures out how to save all the passengers except the nutcase villain maybe Dennis Hopper who expires along with all the machinery in an exploding fireball as the locomotive plummets from an open bridge into a ravine. But nope. Kurasawa was having his problems at the time he supervised the writing of this story and it was given over to Konchalavsky to direct. There aren't very many characters in the film. Mainly John Voight Eric Roberts and Rebecca DeMornay looking fresh faced freckled and quite attractive with John Ryan thrown in mainly to provide a real fleshandblood living villain in addition to the impalpable philosophical ones that are everyone's chief concern. Existentialism is one of those now practicallydead passing French intellectual fads become a word now loosely thrown around that can mean pretty much anything you want. But in its original postwar form it had a rather specific definition if you could distill it from Sartre and Camus. The main point was that existence precedes essence meaning that you weren't born for any particular purpose  good or bad  and that you defined yourself through voluntary actions. The second point was that social rules meant very little and could be disregarded at will as long as you were ready to accept the consequences of breaking those rules. This whole movie illustrates exactly those points in a symbolic yet realistic and exciting way. Voight and Roberts are introduced in a rather lengthy suspenseful introduction set in a Northwestern prison run by Ryan. They escape by slipping naked through a long and filthy sewer pipe and are shot out through the air into a clear cold fastrunning river. Getting an anatomical allusion here? They manage to steal some clothes and board the empty second locomotive of a train whose sole engineer drops dead and falls off. The engineer stands for Somebody too with a capital S. I hope you're getting all this. Another passenger is discovered. Always nice to have a young woman around. But with nobody at the controls of the unreachable lead locomotive and with its brakes burned out the train begins to pick up speed. The three of them wind up stuck on a train rocketing in the general direction of nowhere and try as they may they have no influence over its course or speed. Worst of all it's rapidly approaching a dead end get that one?. By means of ingenuity sacrifice and simple human doggedness the lead locomotive is uncoupled from the rest of the train. While the remaining cars slowly roll to a halt the lone locomotive roars towards its finish. We don't see the expectable slowmotion drop and explosion for the simple reason that we don't need to. We already know the end is upon us  I mean upon the train. And the final image of Voight standing alone atop this hurtling monster of speed weight and power holding his arms upward in defiance the air filled with huge flakes of wet snow is finish enough. You don't need a fireball after that climactic shot.I'm afraid I've made this movie out to be some sort of dumb talky toolong allegory  but believe me it's not. The simple narrative itself is riveting. I can hardly remember another movie in which the performers seemed so terribly cold and uncomfortable wrapped in rags caps pulled in an unsightly way around their ears their faces flushed by the whistling wind their fear and desperation so visible in everything they do their failures and minor triumphs looming so pathetically large in the story. This train  or the compartment of the locomotive which is about all of the interior we see  has no oysters on the half shell nor a nice warm Franklin stove or any other source of heat. It's nothing more than cold dull iron and we are all aboard bound for the end of the line. The musical score couldn't be more apt  sustained low rumbling elephantine  a massive and powerful and inexorable chord. What a gripping picture. How did Goldang Globus Hystericus ever manage to produce such a great film?".

The pacing and the rhythm of the dialogue is somewhat odd but rather than irritating or alienating us it seems to ground the film in its own unique textural world.

	schema:headline " Rule 1 for breaking out Make sure you have a ride";
	schema:reviewBody "Manny and Buck have just broken out of prison and have stowed away on a fourcar locomotive in Alaska. Problem is the engineer died of a heart attack as the train was departing the station and fell off  so now they're all alone on this train careening through the wilderness over 80 miles per hour with no way to stop it. Sound like fun to you? It's a rare action movie one that basically takes place on one location the train. But it's amazingly suspenseful too as railroad officials who don't know of their stowaways try to find ways to stop the unstoppable vehicle shades of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. Jon Voight plays Manny the experienced jailbreaker grizzled ornery obnoxious but revered by his fellow prisoners. Eric Roberts plays Buck the young cocky dimwitted tough guy who respects Manny and looks to him as the voice of reason. Also thrown into the mix is Sara Rebecca De Mornay a railroad worker who was taking a catnap when the runaway train started its journey. How will these three people stop the train? How indeed! You know for a movie taking place on a train there are plenty of harrowing scenes and there's hardly a dull or listless moment. Problem is you don't really know who to root for and there are spots late in the movie where characters change drastically a sure casualty of a choppy script. But hey why quibble? If you're looking for an unusual action movie here it is!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Unstoppable I had to see this.It is hard to know what influence Kurosawa had on this but one can guess. He had been through his rejection in Japan suicide attempt and film made and financed by the Soviets. He subsequently arranged scant funding for this started and was foiled. What we have now is supposedly completely reworked. But what we see is Soviet iconography in the trains and snow and Shakespearean motion toward tragedy. Kurosawa would do the Shakespearean Ran instead of this and we are lucky for that.So this comment will not be on the acting though Voight is not only superb but inhabits the character as we fear we would. It is about the icons and the camera. I think we have inherited this from Akira.The trains have been painted to be big flat black hulks reshaped with plywood to resemble Soviet machines. We have a Soviet director. Early in the film we have that train four locomotives hit the end of another demolishing it. In the process the front of our beast is turned into a ragged tear of heavy metal racing madly through heavy snow angry at the weather.Unstoppable takes a few scenes from this the hitting of the end of another train the bridge that has the fatal speed limit the soldier lowered from a chopper then pummeled. But it is an altogether different film. Scott is all about energy in the camera. Every scene moves in a dance that is composed. The rhythm and energy is in our eye. He works to give is narrative stances for that eye TeeVee cameras characters that are observers and others that comment on observation. The train is only a prop the characters only something to carry the narrative thrust. The art is in the eye on our side of the wall.This film has three animals Voight's character a convict driven to heroic madness the opposing warden who is every bit as demented and colorful. Both of these are runaway trains bested by the train itself which has agency of its own. It seems to have killed and ejected the engineer enticed two convicts aboard then gone mad attracting the warden as well. It is imprisoned in a braid of rails designed here to relate to the train as the remarkable prison building is to the humans.All the cameras are static except the ones following the train some of which race through the woods the same way we saw in Rashoman.It seems that like with Star Wars Kurosawa can bless a film by merely breathing on it.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Runaway train starts as a prison escape movie it then becomes a high speed action thriller. In between and throughout it is also a philosophical character study and all these elements work together perfectly. I keep trying to think of reasons to give this a less than perfect score and can't think of one. This is film as art for as entertaining and suspenseful as Runaway train is it is metaphorically and visually a beautiful film and Jon Voight gives the performance of his career was nominated for lead Oscar as a brutal savage multiple felon.Runaway train is directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky based on a screenplay by Kurasawa Seven Samurai and takes place in Alaska first in a high security prison and later on the title train. Manny Voight is a long time con and multiple escapee who seems to like to play cat and mouse with the vindictive warden Rankin John P. Ryan. As the film opens Manny is being released from a long stint in solitary after his latest escape attempt. Buck Eric Roberts nominated for supporting Oscar is a young slowwitted convict who idolizes Manny. Buck also is a boxer and works the laundry cart and Manny eventually is going to use Buck to assist in his latest escape.Buck talks Manny into taking him along and the two break out into the icy Alaskan wilderness. The two escapees nearly freeze to death before finally reaching a rail hub where they find some dry clothes and whiskey. They find something else too they find a train that Manny picks that is about to pull out. The train is their ticket to freedom or so thinks Manny but shortly after pulling out the trains conductor is seen having a heart attack and falling off the train. Luke and Manny are initially unaware of this and are surprised as the train hurdles faster and faster across the frozen landscape.A stowaway is on the train an almost unrecognizable Rebecca Demornay and she has figured out what has happened and explains the situation to Luke and Manny. The two cons will attempt the dangerous climb to the front engine to shut the train down. Meanwhile the local rail authorities also become aware of the dilemma and contemplate action...should they derail the train before it takes out an old bridge or an approaching factory? Also Rankin has a helicopter in the air and is salivating at the thought of catching Manny again.The stage is set for some amazing stunt work as well as some captivating dialog between the three people on the train. I've read some reviews that view Demornays character as nothing but a plot device but I see it differently. Sara is an outsider to Manny and Buck initially however as the tension builds she becomes the moral centerpiece of the film while Manny is slowly deteriorating mentally and physically and Buck is suddenly in the middle. Its almost heartbreaking to watch the scene where Bucks illusions about Manny melt away as he gradually becomes aware of Manny's true nature. Again the stunt work here is really something to behold and climaxes as Rankin is lowered by rope latter onto the catapulting locomotive for his final showdown with Manny. Now the two are face to face but this time Rankin has no guards and no bars to protect him. The tables have turned on Rankin and now he's in Manny's prison.Its an incredible climax and the silent mesmerizing final shot shows the power of someone who has nothing to lose. To me its one of the most unforgettable film images ever.As Manny himself had said earlier after a frenzied and distraught Sara had screamed what are you an animal?  no worse...HUMAN".

I'll refer them to Runaway Train a breathless thoroughly exciting action movie that manages to portray two fully threedimensional characters amidst underlying sociological messages about imprisonment and reform. Developed from an unfilmed Akira Kurosawa script by Djordje Milicevic Paul Zindel and former hardened inmate Eddie Bunker Runaway Train proves that action movies can do a hell of a lot more than blow st up and offer amusing oneliners.Notorious convict Manny Jon Voight is released from three years in confinement by hateful warden Ranken John P. Ryan not just because of media pressure but in the hope that he will try and escape so Barstow may kill him. After he is attacked and wounded Manny makes the quick decision to escape his Alaskan confines and does so with the help of the young and rather dumb Buck Eric Roberts. They board a train but unbeknown to them the engineer on board has died from a heart attack and the train is heading at high speed towards various obstacles. Groundstaff are alerted to the situation and quickly set about clearing the tracks but Ranken has soon joined them with revenge in mind.Many Hollywood movies offer moments of spectacular visual effects and sound design that should be applauded but normally these scenes don't tend to generate any excitement in me. Runaway Train offers similar scenes but there's two key aspects that make the film work so well. The first is emotional investment. As despicable as these characters often are Manny and Buck are real helped considerably by the careerbest performances of Voight and Roberts. The former in an empowering speech that may just be the best work he's ever done informs Buck of the futility of their situation. They may just rule the world if they could hold down a job but they can't they're criminals and cannot escape their societal role.The appearance of Rebecca De Mornay's character Sara a young engineer still aboard and who is unable to stop the train highlights this. Manny and Buck squabble and fight for the first time in front of her showing that when put into a situation where the laws of society come into play they reject it and turn into animals. These exchanges occur between some nailbiting scenes which brings me onto the next aspect that makes the film work so well  real action. There's no wideshots of gigantic explosions just two battered men clawing and slipping their way along the snowdrenched train. In one scene after a daring attempt to jump carriages Manny's wind and coldbattered face craws towards the camera ragged bandages hang off his bloodied hand and his crooked brown teeth are bared. The camera is so intrusive that you really feel every move he makes to the point where I felt exhausted.Though it does occasionally slip in prison movie clich this is perhaps one of the most underrated films ever made. It was recognised at the Oscars with nominations for Voight Roberts and for Best Editing but it doesn't seem to have left the legacy it certainly deserves. I wouldn't exactly call the film obscure but your average filmgoer probably won't have heard of it especially when compared to say Die Hard 1988. This is riveting stuff tightly directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky who went on to make the crappy Tango  Cash 1989 and the film leaves you with an beautiful and slightly eerie final image that could say more than words could have.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Firstrate cinematic story telling a gem!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a gritty totally dramatic suspenseful unhappy sometimes foulmouthed drama in which several story elements converge and play out on a runaway string of four locomotive units.  The acting of both Jon Voight and Eric Roberts especially and Rebecca De Mornay is intense and superb. Every camera shot heightens the drama.  Photographed in Alaska on the Alaska Railway it's winter the skies are leaden the ground snow covered the locomotives ice encrusted and real snow falls on the train as it traverses the isolated countryside.  Action scenes of the train both distant and close up are truly remarkable.  Train enthusiasts will not be disappointed!    The only thing phony is the suggestion that the Alaska Railway is a more complex system than it likely is.  That quibble noted everything else rings essentially true and the filmmakers thankfully find no need to throw in a plethora of gratuitous complications as occurs in so many lesser impendingdisaster movies.  The story begins with two vicious antagonists in an Alaska prison. One John Voight's character convicted of violent crimes and prior escapes has just won a court order for release from three years of being welded in his dark cell.  The thwarted warden played by John P. Ryan is equally vicious with even less of a heart than Voight who loses no time before escaping again. Reluctantly Voight takes along Roberts as a younger lowIQ petty criminal with grandiose plans for his freedom.  Voight is advised to not let himself be brought back alive.Voight and Roberts make it to a railroad yard and into the last of the four locomotives.  In the first the engineer starts the train has a heart attack and stumbles off the train.  Voight realizes that the train is out of control when no horn sounds and after it hits a caboose that didn't clear the main track in time. Then DeMornay having been napping forward assesses the situation and stumbles into the last unit for greater safety.  In this confined setting there are dramatic scenes between the two men and among all three.DeMornay as a locomotive mechanic advises that control resides only in the front unit and that because the number two unit is different a streamliner there is no passage to the front.  She has a way to curb the train's excessive speed which narrowly averts one crash opportunity but it is still out of control.  The control center can only shunt the runaway and other trains onto different tracks so as to postpone the inevitable crash and pick a location for least collateral destruction.Meanwhile the warden after demonstrating his viciousness at the railroad control center boards a helicopter and effects a transfer onto the moving train reuniting the two antagonists in a facetoface final confrontation as the train races to its impending demise.The conclusion can't be happy but it is nonetheless satisfying.  Outstanding!!!".

Then DeMornay having been napping forward assesses the situation and stumbles into the last unit for greater safety.  In this confined setting there are dramatic scenes between the two men and among all three.DeMornay as a locomotive mechanic advises that control resides only in the front unit and that because the number two unit is different a streamliner there is no passage to the front.  She has a way to curb the train's excessive speed which narrowly averts one crash opportunity but it is still out of control.  The control center can only shunt the runaway and other trains onto different tracks so as to postpone the inevitable crash and pick a location for least collateral destruction.Meanwhile the warden after demonstrating his viciousness at the railroad control center boards a helicopter and effects a transfer onto the moving train reuniting the two antagonists in a facetoface final confrontation as the train races to its impending demise.The conclusion can't be happy but it is nonetheless satisfying.  Outstanding!!!";

	schema:headline " One of the few genuinely excellent GolanGlobus productions  a tense violent and exciting thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "To see the words 'A GolanGlobus Production' on a movie poster in the '80s was not usually a sign of good quality cinema. Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were a pair of Israeli cousins who had financed various films in their homeland throughout the '60s and '70s before deciding to have a crack at the American market by purchasing a distribution and production outfit called the Cannon Group Inc. Around 85 of Golan Globus's Canon output was lowgrade trashy rubbish more often than not badly made and badly acted. Every now and then however a GolanGlobus film would turn up that was a little better than the usual fare. Something slightly more artistically motivated and more highbrow in conception. Into this bracket would fall films like the Julie Andrews vehicle Duet For One Jean Luc Godard's adaptation of King Lear or the exciting existential thriller Runaway Train  directed by celebrated Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky during his 'breakintothe Americanmainstream' phase. Runaway Train is notable for two remarkable leading performances from Jon Voight and Eric Roberts. Voight plays Manny Manheim a notoriously violent bank robber serving a life sentence in a remote Alaskan maximum security prison. Manny is a legend amongst the other inmates an almost animalistic criminal considered so dangerous that at one point the warden Ranken John P. Ryan had his cell door welded for a period of three years. Once allowed back into general population Manny plans an audacious escape aided by nonetoobright inmate Buck Eric Roberts whose position as a laundry room worker gives him access to a potential escape route. Against Manny's wishes Buck decides to join in him in daring break for freedom. Unfortunately for them they seek refuge aboard a train during their getaway only for the elderly engineer to suffer a heart attack at the controls. Through an accumulation of unforeseeable coincidences the emergency break system on the train fails and the two escaped convicts find themselves aboard a runaway train gathering momentum as it surges unmanned and outofcontrol across the Alaskan wilderness. An inexperienced hostler Sara Rebecca De Mornay is the only other person on board. Together the three of them fight against the power of technology the train and the power of nature the harsh Alaskan conditions as they try to regain control of the train.Violent bloody sharply characterised and frequently very exciting Runaway Train may well be the jewel in the GolanGlobus crown. It's a tough film for sure  peopled mainly by ugly characters who do little more than snarl and threaten each other in abrasive foulmouthed exchanges  but it's never anything less than enthralling. The strength of characterisation is impressive. Voight's terrifying convict Roberts' dumb but loyal opportunist escapee De Mornay's vulnerable unwilling participant Ryan's sadistically overzealous warden  all fabulously written characters played to the hilt by actors in top form. In one unforgettable scene Voight attempts to uncouple the cars to stop the back section of the train  the couplings close over his hand literally tearing off almost all his fingers in a shocking spray of pulpy gore. Still grinning maniacally his hand a bloodied stump Manny struggles back aboard and continues to terrorise his travelling companions. He's every bit as chillingly convincing as say Robert De Niro in the Cape Fear remake a role that has striking similarities. The location is unusual and effective  the vast freezing wilds of Alaska provide a perfect backdrop for the drama onscreen enhanced further still by Trevor Jones's atmospheric score. The film's unrelentingly ugly tone and a strangely pretentious ending are minor quibbles but overall Runaway Train is a thunderingly good film.".

There is no good reason for any of this insanity either in the plot script by Edward Bunker nor graphic direction by Andrei Konchalovsky. You have to rely upon their imagination and the wonderful cinematography  it is highly implausible that anyone has every livedthrough this kind of brutality to tell about it. I hope. It is imminently important for the viewer to know that Manny Jon Voight has been welded in his cell for three years that everyone looks up to him for his physical strength and wildness that he only has nine months to go a maniacal warden John Ryan wants him to screwup so he can shoot him that the entire prison is constantly in a riotous upheaval and anyone who even THINKS they could successfully do any of this in 35belowzero weather NEEDS to be welded into a cell if they were lucky.We all are aware that humans cannot survive in belowfreezing weather and water yet Manny and Buck Eric Roberts in a fabulous performance get naked in the bowels of the prison to smear themselves with some nasty stuff and wrap themselves in plastic sheeting the theory to keep their bodyheat in and the plastic from freezing to their skin. Guess what it works although they tromp through the prison's sewers and then jump into an icy stream Buck not even having shoes gloves a hat nor warm clothing then trudges through miles of snowstorms to the railroadterminal. So many improbabilities in these scenes it's mindboggling no frozen clothes nor frostbite? Anyway they get there find some things they need and choose a train to get on simply because Manny thinks it's looks like a monster. He's right. They become part of it because there's no way to get off it but to jump in the snow. Although Manny is godlike to Buck they become snarling animals. After a thorough beating by Manny Buck says you were my friend....my hero....hmmmmmm......Sara Rebecca deMornay does instill a trifle of humanity in them......but barely.If that isn't enough of the story to get you hooked nor scare you away watch the movie and then try to shake yourself out of the stupor you get into and analyze the whole thing. It won't be easy. This is not scifi  these are all incidences that COULD happen. Some think this vicious role is Voight's best  good acting but too crude. Robert's career should have vaulted from his performance deMornay was great. All the supporting roles are stellar. The psychologies premises in this movie are devastating and make you say this is only a movie like a bad dream. This is desperation and insanity at its highest intensity  I hope it stays lightyears away from me. Another film I have to put on then hide behind my computers to watch. Terrifying and pointless  but that's what good acting is all about.......to make it believable. Maybe I'll watch it again in a couple of years. Bravo! to all  a definite 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Indeed a fine piece from the era when action movies were taken over by the likes of Schwarzenegger or Stallone. But the production company seemed to completely ignore this fact and have chosen to base their movie on an old Akira Kurosawa screenplay. Risky choice but as we know it didn't paid off  it was the last Northbrook film and the CannonGolan companies didn't last much longer either. So Runawy Train might have been a financial failure but I'd call it an artistic success. The technical specs doesn't show that it was shot on some kind of special equipment but the way they captured the snowy landscape is still a masterpiece. If someone appreciates this kind of detail it's definitely a mustwatch movie in the digitally renewed version if possible. Otherwise the story is good too  not as much action craziness and twists as in other 80s productions but it has a tasty outcome between the good guy and the bad guy  probably Kurosawa would have done it better but I really can't blame the directors for every little mistake. The last strong point of this movie is probably the cast however  some might find Eric Roberts and a few supporting actors a bit irritating sometimes. Anyways Jon Voight is at his best here. Unfortunately other aspects of the movie seemed to be rather mediocre  very generic music choices dull stunts and decorations strange cuts. But those only play a minor part in the big picture so I can recommend Runaway Train to anybody who's just after a little entertainment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Indeed a fine piece from the era when action movies were taken over by the likes of Schwarzenegger or Stallone. But the production company seemed to completely ignore this fact and have chosen to base their movie on an old Akira Kurosawa screenplay. Risky choice but as we know it didn't paid off  it was the last Northbrook film and the CannonGolan companies didn't last much longer either. So Runawy Train might have been a financial failure but I'd call it an artistic success.

Early in his career Hoover fixated on Communists anarchists and any other revolutionary taking action against the U.S. government. He slowly builds the agency's reputation becoming the sole arbiter of who gets hired and fired. One of his hires is Clyde Tolson who is quickly promoted to Assistant Director and would be Hoover's confidant and companion for the rest of Hoover's life. Hoover's memories have him playing a greater role in the many high profile cases the FBI was involved in  the Lindbergh baby kidnapping the arrest of bank robbers like John Dillinger  and also show him to be quite adept at manipulating the various politicians he's worked with over his career thanks in large part to his secret files.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Clint Eastwood's latest biopic J. Edgar we delve into the personal life of one of the most powerful and enigmatic figures of the 20th century. We are shown pieces of a man who was scared confused and extremely intelligent. He knew how to cater to the media but his personal life was shrouded in secrecy. It could be argued that J. Edgar himself wasn't quite sure of who he was.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hoover. We see him evolve from a young upstart in the US Justice Department to the head of the FBI. DiCaprio portrays a man of man faults though not entirely through his own doing. He overcame a speech impediment grew up virtually without a father and had difficulty expressing himself socially and sexually. Through DiCaprio's performance we see just that a man with a head on his shoulders only confiding in those few people he trusted.In his inner circle was Helen Gandy Naoimi Watts his personal secretary and keeper of Hoover's private files. Her commitment to Hoover knew no bounds. His right hand man Clyde Tolson Armie Hammer was on paper not the right person to become Hoover's 2nd in command but Hoover saw something in Tolson that made him feel comfortable. From what we see on film Tolson was more than a friend more than a partner. He had no title for Hoover. He was invaluable.The center of Hoover's world however was his mother Annie Judi Dench. A stern yet loving woman she knew what Hoover needed to be successful. Her approval meant so much to him and the thought of letting her down was unfathomable. That would wreak havoc on his private life throughout his life.Hoover's appointment as head of the FBI would last for nearly half a decade. In that time he saw our country through several wars the red scare gangsters and a presidential assassination. To compile his ever major decision would make for a great documentary series but to compress it all into a movie under 2 12 hours Eastwood utilizes recent Oscar winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black Milk to pen the script. What Black does is paint a picture of Hoover not as the head of the FBI but as a man whose image was so out of whack that he himself had trouble distinguishing fact from fiction.The film constructed in a way that we are told the story of Hoover's life through Hoover's own words not from a general point of view. What makes this so effective is that we aren't sure of how certain events actually transpired making the story and in effect history somewhat clouded much like the image of Hoover himself.This image of Hoover has been dissected and speculated for years. Was he a homosexual? What secrets did he take to the grave? Was he involved in any conspiracies? These questions are touched upon but never fully answered. What we are left with is a portrait of a man left unfinished much like the painting of Washington we see several times throughout the film. Like the painting Hoover is a man incomplete. That painting is a reminder to him that even though he is incomplete he can still make a difference.Some of the strengths of the film are also its weaknesses. The story itself if fascinating but it tends to drag on. It reminded me of The Good Shepherd. A really good story with great characters based on true events just nothing extraordinary. The acting too is well done but for me at least I had a hard time not seeing Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover especially with the makeup. Part of it especially with DiCaprio is his voice. He has such a unique way of speaking and he has trouble disguising it. His character also reminded me of his performance in The Aviator.The acting on the whole especially Hammer and Dench I expect nods for both and DiCaprio as well is well above average. Eastwood always manages to extract prime performances from his actors including when he is acting. Eastwood also continues his work behind the scenes by composing the score his seventh feature length scoring composition. Like his other composition there's a heavy moody jazzy undertone. He doesn't overpower us with large orchestral compositions. Instead he utilizes strings piano and a few horns to accent the images.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any movie Clint Eastwood makes is certainly worth a look and Leonardo DiCaprio is entertaining in anything he does. But this version of J. Edgar Hoover's story seems superficial and lacking meat on its bones.That has more to do with its form  a theatrical film only two hours and 17 minutes long  relative to the length of the biography at its core. Hoover was such a complex man and his career was so long with so many chapters that his story is probably better suited to a 4to 6 hour HBO miniseries where more of the details of his life that this film with its short running time can only hint at can be more completely told.Dustin Lance Black who wrote this film's screenplay as well as that of Milk is walking a very fine line here regarding Hoover's complex personality it seems that he had a much more intricate story he wanted to tell were it not for the confines of the feature film format. Here broad brush strokes take the place of long chapters on Hoover's involvement with the Red Scares of the '20's and '50's political blackmail gambling organized crime and of course homosexuality.But if it had been made as a miniseries it probably wouldn't have attracted Eastwood and DiCaprio and consequently wouldn't have the high profile that this film does. That version of his story will have to wait for another time.Eastwood chose to shoot this story in a washedout color palette. The story jumps back in forth in time and the closer the events of the film are to the end of Hoover's life the more color Eastwood imbues into the scenes the earliest moments in the time line are shown in a color scheme barely above monochrome. It's a subtle effect but it helps the viewer keep track of where the scenes exist in Hoover's life.That long time line necessitates that DiCaprio must be seen in various makeup schemes to convey the age of his character at any point in the story. His makeup is uniformly good but the two other principal actors in the film Armie Hammer as Hoover's longtime companion Clyde Tolson and Naomi Watts as Hoover's secretary Helen Gandy don't fare so well as their characters age. Obviously the lion's share of the film's makeup budget was allotted to the star. Hammer it must be said gives a fine performance under all those oldage prosthetics. Christopher Shyer who plays Richard Nixon in a brief scene has the leasteffective verisimilitude of anyone who has played the man in a motion picture.But makeup alone does not a performance make. Di Caprio's ability to remain in character and age with him is remarkable and transcends the work of his makeup artist. As he did with his portrayal of Howard Hughes in The Aviator his skillful use of voice and body to stay true to his characterization of Hoover through the years is evident throughout.One gets the feeling that much of this film was shot in front of a green screen no surprise given the various eras of Washington that it depicts but to a longtime moviegoer there's a certain sadness that imparts to seeing that technique once the province of the largescale action film used in serious dramas. There was probably no other way to do it in this day and age but it just calls attention to itself in a way that gets in the way of one's immersion into the subject matter. Admittedly that's my problem not the film's.So is it worth a look? Sure. Best Picture nominee? In a field of ten probably. Will Leo finally win an Oscar this time out? Well look at it this way Paul Newman gave his best performance in The Verdict but the Academy finally honored him for The Color of Money. Leo probably should have won for playing Howard Hughes but maybe he'll win for playing J. Edgar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. The best place to start with this one is by saying what it isn't. It is not a documentary. It is not a very detailed history lesson. It is not the best biography of the man. It is not a behindthescenes of the FBI. What it is ... another piece of quality filmmaking from Clint Eastwood. It's an overview of J. Edgar Hoover and his nearly 50 years of civil service under 8 U.S. Presidents.The screenplay is from Dustin Lance Black who also wrote the script for Milk based on the story of Harvey Milk played by Sean Penn. Clearly Eastwood and Black had no interest in setting forth an historical drama that couldn't possibly be told within a two hour film structure. No this is more of a fatfree character study that hits only a few of the highlights from an enigmatic man's fascinating career. With so few available details about Hoover's personal life some speculation is required ... but Eastwood walks a tightrope so as to make neither a statement nor mockery.Therein lies the only problem with the film. While hypnotic to watch we are left with an empty feeling when it's over. How can that be? This man built the foundation of the FBI. He instigated the fingerprint system. He armed the secret police.

He supposedly kept secret files on most politicians and celebrities. He viewed the security of Americans as his responsibility. He was smack dab in the middle of almost 50 years of American history ... all while being a powerhungry paranoid mama's boy who may have been in her words a daffodil.An elderly Hoover's own words tell his story as he dictates his memoirs. We are told that his memories of these stories are blurred and he takes a few liberties to say the least. He longed to be the comic book hero like his own GMen. He longed to be recognized for his contributions even to the point of desiring a level of celebrity. In his mind he was the face of national security and the hero cuffing many outlaws. In reality he was also the blackmailing schemer who so frightened Presidents with his secret files that all 8 of them backed off firing him. He could be viewed as the ultimate survivor in a town where few careers last so long and cross party lines.The film picks up in 1919 when Hoover is a youngster making a name for himself as an allwork no play type. That reputation stuck with him until the end. When he was first promoted he hired Helen Gandy Naomi Wattsto be his secretary. In one of the most remarkable hires of all time she sticks with him until his death in 1972. Staunchly loyal to Hoover and totally dedicated to her job Ms. Gandy helped Hoover with decisions and processes throughout. The other member of his inner circle was Clyde Tolson Armie Hammer. Tolson was Hoover's righthand man at the bureau his trusted adviser his daily lunch partner and speculation never ceased on their personal ties.Judi Dench plays Annie Hoover J Edgar's controlling mother who he lived with until her death. She was also his adviser supporter and probably a factor in his stunted social skills. We also get glimpses of how he dealt with Robert Kennedy Jeffrey Donovan and his overall lack of respect for John Kennedy Martin Luther King Jr. and Richard Nixon. The Lindbergh case plays a key role because Hoover used it to gain more power for his bureau and increase funding for weapons forensic labs and resources.As for Leonardo DiCaprio it's difficult to explain just how outstanding his performance is. It could have been a caricature but instead he affords Hoover the respect his place in history demands. The 50 years of aging through makeup can be startling especially since the time lines are mixed up throughout. His speech pattern mimics Hoover's as does the growing waist line. There are some Citizen Kane elements at work in how the story is told and how it's filmed but Eastwood wouldn't shy away from such comparisons.If you want real details on Hoover there are some very indepth biographies out there. The number of documentaries and history books for this era are limitless. What Eastwood delivers here is an introduction to J Edgar Hoover. It is interesting enough to watch and Leonardo's performance is a mustsee but the film lacks the depth warranted by the full story.".

	onyx:emotionText "Greetings again from the darkness. The best place to start with this one is by saying what it isn't. It is not a documentary. It is not a very detailed history lesson. It is not the best biography of the man. It is not a behindthescenes of the FBI. What it is ... another piece of quality filmmaking from Clint Eastwood. It's an overview of J. Edgar Hoover and his nearly 50 years of civil service under 8 U.S. Presidents.The screenplay is from Dustin Lance Black who also wrote the script for Milk based on the story of Harvey Milk played by Sean Penn. Clearly Eastwood and Black had no interest in setting forth an historical drama that couldn't possibly be told within a two hour film structure. No this is more of a fatfree character study that hits only a few of the highlights from an enigmatic man's fascinating career. With so few available details about Hoover's personal life some speculation is required ... but Eastwood walks a tightrope so as to make neither a statement nor mockery.Therein lies the only problem with the film. While hypnotic to watch we are left with an empty feeling when it's over. How can that be? This man built the foundation of the FBI. He instigated the fingerprint system. He armed the secret police. His agency tracked down notorious gangsters. He led an anticommunist movement. He was in the middle of the investigation for the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. He supposedly kept secret files on most politicians and celebrities. He viewed the security of Americans as his responsibility. He was smack dab in the middle of almost 50 years of American history ... all while being a powerhungry paranoid mama's boy who may have been in her words a daffodil.An elderly Hoover's own words tell his story as he dictates his memoirs.

Not exceptional in anyway but still great. The tone reminds me a bit of Changeling. Makes sense since the stories are from the same period. I have to say with Eastwood Leonardo DiCaprio and Dustin Lance Black all on board I was kind of expecting something a bit more than this.I thought the weakest link was the script. It was interesting but flawed. Also the story was not very intriguing. Having watched Milk also written by Black and really liked how the story unfolded I was expecting a great story about how J. Edgar Hoover rose to power and how he gradually transformed into the monster he became in the end. But instead the story was told by shifting back and forth in time countless times which at some point made me feel emotionally detached from the story and the characters. The bad bad makeup I guess we can all agree on that was also very distracting. The elderly characters looked like wax figures to me.That said I really LOVED Eastwood's score. It was moving and really fit the mood of the film. His direction and camerawork were masterful as always. Leo was very convincing as J. Edgar although I keep on seeing bits and pieces of Howard Hughes in his performance. Judi Dench and Naomi Watts were both great however the same thing can not be said about Armie Hammer. I thought he was much better in The Social Network. There were a few good moments between him and Leo but his performance as the elderly Clyde Tolson was darn right awful. I blame the horrible makeup.As for the Oscars this film will get a few nominations but I doubt that it would become a strong contender. Though Leo's performance was not without its flaws I thought it was more than enough to secure his leading actor nomination. Nods for best art direction best cinematography and best score are also quite possible. This film had the potential to become a masterpiece but fell short of my expectations mainly due to the uneven script. While far from being one of his best it is nevertheless a welcome addition to Eastwood's portfolio.810".

	schema:reviewBody "American actor producer composer and director Clint Eastwood's thirtythird feature film is an American production which was written by screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. It tells the story about J. Edgar Hoover 18951972 who grew up with his two elder siblings in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington. In 1917 after receiving his Master of Laws degree at the George Washington University he was hired as a clerk by the Justice Departement where he meet Helen W. Gandy 18971988 who would become his personal secretary. J. Edgar Hoover was a very private secretive and ambitious man who was totally dedicated to his job. He lived with his mother Anne Marie and didn't have much of a social life but in 1924 J. Edgar Hoover became the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and during this period he meet a confidential secretary for the Secretary of War named Clyde Tolson 19001975 whom he hired as his vice director. This biographical period film depicts J. Edgar Hoover's participation in the extensive investigation of the kidnapping of the oneyearold son of aviators Charles Lindbergh 19021974 and Anne Morrow Lindbergh 19062001 which took place in 1932 his ongoing fight against crime and communism his private search for information which he could use to blackmail senator Robert F. Kennedy 19251968 and his unjustified attempts at undermining the reputation of American activist and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr 19291968. Precisely and engagingly directed and with a tightly structured narrative this detailed and descriptive portrayal of a multifaceted man with some very bright and some very dark attributes draws an intriguing study of character with poignant depictions of the main character's relationship with his encouraging mother Anne Marie Scheitlin Hoover 18601938 his relationship with his loyal secretary Helen W. Gandy and a poignant though ambiguous depiction of his relationship with his devoted friend Clyde Tolson.This fastpaced and dialogdriven drama is notable for its austere atmosphere which is reinforced by the prominent use of light and Clint Eastwood's tangible score and the reverent acting performances by English actress Naomi Watts English actress Judi Dench American actor Armie Hammer and especially Leonardo DiCaprio who delivers a variable and emphatic acting performance in an atypical role where he is transformed by the makeup. A dark and gripping mystery and crime story which is complimented by a lowkeyed love story.".

Sometimes it seems a director will find himself in a project without much of a passion for it and looking at the final product it's kind of hard to see his signature on the screen. That is the case with Mr. Eastwood's biopic on the life of J. Edgar Hoover. The movie J. Edgar is everything I did not expect from Mr. Eastwood considering the deep thoughtprovocative and artistic power of his last movie Hereafter as well as the many films that he made beforehand. Slow pretentious and middling.Many actors have played the infamous FBI founder over the years once by Hoover himself in the 1959 James Stewart movie The FBI Story. This time the role goes to Leonardo DiCaprio. Unfortunately it seems his feelings about the movie seemed to be identical to Mr. Eastwood's as he merely hamacts throughout the entirety of the movie. The only thing differentiating his performance from scenetoscene depends on how much phony makeup has been slapped on his face. It's sort of like a Citizen Kane portrait of a reallife figure starting around the time of the man's death and whisking back and forth between the past and the present. Except whereas that great Orson Welles film from seventy years ago did it with precision and aesthetic greatness the narrative of J. Edgar takes such vast leaps that it frequently falls flat on its face.The screenplay was written by Dustin Lance Black who won the Oscar for Best Screenplay for Milk. Once again he more or less writes this story more as a vessel for a homosexual romance and rights message. And it is here that he strikes his intended gold. Hoover's lover his righthand man Clyde Tolson is played with immense passion by Armie Hammer. And it is the scenes between Mr. Hammer and Mr. DiCaprio that work. A particularly great scene involves the two secret lovers sharing a dinner table with some flirtatious Hollywood starlets and nervously trying to shake off the ladies' sexual advances without giving themselves away. Also fascinating and frightful is a confrontation about homosexuality between Mr. DiCaprio and Judi Dench as Hoover's mother.So it is in this soulful subplot that Mr. Black's screenplay works but when he tries to form a narrative arc about the lifetime of J. Edgar Hoover and bounce across decades in a coherent manner it starts to struggle. Furthermore apart from the love subplot there is no chemistry between the characters. Naomi Watts as Hoover's secretary is given such insignificant things to do that she may as well have been an extra.Earlier I mentioned that a passionless project even by a great director will appear to lose its creators' signature and that is no more evident than in here. Mr. Eastwood's directing though hardly bad is rather dull with too many long shots and ponderous slow zooms. And while Leonardo DiCaprio was an inspired choice to play J. Edgar Hoover he does it almost playfully without much soul or conviction. Most embarrassing of all is the forced accent with which he enunciates the dialogue. Capped with some truly horrific makeup when playing the elderly Hoover the actor appears to be giving a comic standup performance at a nightclub. Reputedly Mr. DiCaprio spent five hours every morning having the prosthetics applied to his face when playing the older version of the character. All I can say is that they should have spent at least six for the makeup looks like exactly what it is. And the stuff put on Mr. Hammer for his oldguy moments makes him look like he belongs in a 30s Universal horror film.Just as frightful as the makeup is the hackjob cinematography by Tom Stern. Yes the same Tom Stern who has lit beautiful images for many of Clint Eastwood's earlier films including Changeling for which he deservedly earned an Academy Award nomination. Mr. Stern's specialty seems to be in lowkey lighting. Last year he did a fabulous job catching the mood of Hereafter with clever use of shadows and silhouetting lights. But here he goes overboard. The shadows in J. Edgar are so amateurish and monstrous that I kid you not the actors sometime disappear in them. If there is a symbolic purpose behind this I cannot think of it. And other times the lights are too soft. Closeups of characters make them appear to be covered with flour and worst of all is when the camera tracks into a dark room and autoadjusts to the new light...much like a homevideo camera.I never imagined I would see a Clint Eastwood film where I would look at my watch impatiently before the first hour was even up but alas the day has come. J. Edgar is a dimwitted passionless project that brings almost nothing to our previous knowledge about the formation of the FBI and the men who made it all possible. Only a couple of sharp provocative moments from Dustin Lance Black's screenplay really stand out. Now Clint Eastwood has made five or six masterpieces during his fortyyear career as a director and about twice as many great films so despite my disappointment I am prepared to allow this one to fade from my memory.Not that that would be very hard. If J. Edgar Hoover had a file cabinet labeled 'Instantly Forgettable' that is where this film would have gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood's boldness and creativity paid off in this excellent portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover's life. A project like that is not pulled off by just anyone and the fact that a film like that was even made shows the importance of Clint Eastwood. His direction was marvelous by the way showing without fear the dark side of the FBI director but also showing all the good aspects of this very interesting subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is another great reason to watch the film in one of the most moving performances in his career.

A project like that is not pulled off by just anyone and the fact that a film like that was even made shows the importance of Clint Eastwood. His direction was marvelous by the way showing without fear the dark side of the FBI director but also showing all the good aspects of this very interesting subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is another great reason to watch the film in one of the most moving performances in his career. His portrayal of a Hoover both ruthless and emotionally vulnerable was superb and he has excelled once again in studying the character.

Instead Eastwood chose to make a film about a tortured closet homosexual with a strange mommy fixation. I guess he figured the American public would respond more to a soap opera than an intelligent historical drama. The scene in which Hoover and Tolson have their hotelroom lovers' spat is completely laughable. The death of Hoover's mother is pathetic.

But there's no rise to be any fall or much of  anything else for that matter.  Leonardo DiCaprio playing J. Edgar Hoover bounces from boring one  scene andor time period to the next displaying no qualities of a  person who although flawed and now considered a joke did make an  impact. His innovations in fingerprinting and the climb from a snoopy  young agent to the head of the F.B.I. are treated as importantly as a  midnight snack.  And the only revelations are that he loved his mother and was a  closeted homosexual but even these stories play out like bad soaps.  While segments following taut historical situations like the Lindbergh  kidnapping build no suspense whatsoever  leading only to Hoover  screwing up the situation time and time again.  Most of the sidecharacters from biographers to politicians to fellow  agents to his closest friends are used merely as  counterpointmouthpieces questioning everything Hoover says just in  case the audience can't figure out each lie on their own.  DiCaprio is far better here than THE AVIATOR where he was completely  miscast playing a grownup. With his narrowed eyes fervently seeking  purpose he tries very hard even in the fake looking old man makeup  but with a script so lacking of any personal or historical  significance it feels like he's treading water.  But the worst crime exceeding the fact most of the dialog occurs  between two people who'd never later on revealed the conversations  is it's downright boring.  Director Clint Eastwood should either retire or go back to making  action movies because this clunker had no pulse whatsoever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leonardo DiCaprio has proved himself a masterful actor but his performance in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar is sure to put him on the same shelf as Sean Penn Meryl Streep Viggo Mortensen Johnny Depp and Christian Bale  actors who inhabit their roles so convincingly that the real person essentially disappears. As J. Edgar Hoover who became the head of the FBI in 1924 and remained so until his death in 1972 DiCaprio thoroughly captures the look the mannerisms the voice and the personality. We see a man who took his public image as seriously as his job as made abundantly clear by a scene late in the film in which key events in his life are disputed. It's actually rather cleverly handled. It's a matter of perception what others see in you may not be as interesting as how you see yourself.The film is structured as a meandering narrative freely shifting back and forth between Hoover's early days at the FBI and the final years of his life at which point various typists transcribe an autobiography he's dictating. He recounts the major cases he personally oversaw including the Palmer Raids the kidnapping and death of Charles Lindbergh's baby boy and the gangster wars of the early 1930s. To say he personally oversaw is not to suggest he acted alone or was even physically present. That didn't stop him from taking most of the credit. When Melvin Purvis one of the most effective and respected agents of his time became a media sensation after successfully tracking down criminals such as Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger Hoover's response was to demote him. He would in fact frequently fire or reassign agents he considered objectionable.I suspect most audiences will go into this movie with preconceived notions about Hoover's personal life most notably that he may have been a transvestite and a closeted homosexual. Both are unsubstantiated rumors although there is strong evidence supporting the latter not the least of which is his lifelong friendship with FBI associate director Clyde Tolson. Apart from their professional relationship they would often dine together attend social events and go vacationing. Tolson would go on to inherit Hoover's estate receive the American flag draped over his coffin and ultimately be buried in the same cemetery only a few yards away. It cannot be denied that Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black are making a case for this aspect of Hoover's life. But this is not a message film about forbidden love it's a portrait of a man who defined himself solely by his reputation.True enough it was built and maintained in large part by gathering secret files on the alleged sex lives of prominent public figures including Eleanor Roosevelt. It's widely speculated that he did this only for the purposes of blackmail which would explain how he was able to stay in power for nearly fifty years and why FBI directors have since been limited to tenyear terms. Publicly he was so militantly antigay that he went as far as to track down and threaten anyone who questioned his sexuality. There's no telling how he felt privately although the film makes some compelling arguments. Consider a scene in which he's alone in a hotel room with Tolson Armie Hammer and broaches the subject of proposing to actress Dorothy Lamour who in real life was reported to have had an affair with Hoover. How does this fit with the image of a lifelong bachelor who surrounded himself with goodlooking people had an eye for fashion and lived with his mother until the day she died?His mother Annie Judi Dench matronly and domineering says that she would rather her son be dead than a daffodil like one of Hoover's old schoolmates. We inevitably have this scene in mind after her death at which point Hoover tearfully tries on one of her dresses. By my understanding of this scene he was not trying to emulate the opposite sex rather it was an emotional lastditch effort to recapture his closeness with his mother. This isn't creepy so much as it is sad and desperate. In that moment we pity him.The other woman in his life was Helen Gandy Naomi Watts who after a few unconventional dates and an awkward marriage proposal would go on to become his permanent personal secretary. He entrusted her with his secret files the contents of which remain largely unknown. No real effort is made to speculate on all the information he gathered which is fine because this isn't really what J. Edgar is about. It's a wellresearched period drama complete with accurate costumes convincing sets and appropriately nostalgic lighting and color schemes. Above all else it's a superbly acted character study about a man once considered the second most powerful in America  although he could have easily been the first considering the control he had over elected officials.

	schema:reviewBody "Was GRAN TORINO the very last film with the legendary Clint Eastwood acting? Yes. Is GRAN TORINO going to be the very last Eastwood film that I get on BluRayDVD to watch it again? Well maybe. I have yet to see his HEREAFTER which doesn't have the best reviews out there by the way but INVICTUS and now J. EDGAR both biographical films left me disappointed and with no desires to add them as soon as possible to my personal collection. It's been almost two years since I watched the film about Nelson Mandela and I haven't felt any need to do it again. I'm sure it will happen the very same with this one the film about the first director of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover. However there is a huge difference here since I did find some truly great things in J. EDGAR. Hell I LOVED some of them. It is an interesting case and is almost sad to say that in the end as a whole it didn't work for me. First I will write quickly about Leonardo DiCaprio's performance since everybody has been talking a lot about it I think it's a surprise that he wasn't nominated for the Oscar. He is quite fantastic and even tough that he is doing great things should not be news anymore his interpretation of J. Edgar Hoover as both a young and elderly man is really something to write and talk about. And certainly is also kind of sad that a performance of this caliber is not part of a great picture. So why this isn't something I already want to watch again? There is some criticism towards the choice of showing the personal side of J. Edgar and not going a bit deeper with FBI issues. I understand that as indeed J. Edgar was the chief of the FBI for more than 30 years so there should be plenty of strong and kind of powerful stories. However I can't say the film went wrong because of this. For me is more like saying OK so you want to show J. Edgar's sentimental side and make of his apparent homosexuality a huge deal. That's great BUT you better do it right. Actually of all this was a surprise for me. I didn't know a damn thing about J. Edgar nor that the writer of the film was Dustin Lance Black of MILK fame. The narrative is fine we see the elderly J. Edgar reviving some of his old stories for the guys who are helping him to do a memoir or something like that so we move back and forward. So and again what went wrong? Simply the execution of some things as you can tell. Some scenes feel as the parody of the real thing if that makes sense. And you know what the makeup went also very f wrong! I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I saw that Armie Hammer was here since I'm a big fan of THE SOCIAL NETWORK. He plays Hoover's right hand Clyde Tolson. And he together with Naomi Watt's who goes pretty much without any glory nor bad critics character Helen Gandy a highly reliable secretary grows old together with Hoover. Musician John Mayer said it right when discussing autotune the only time you can ever talk about plastic surgery is akin to the only time you can ever talk about autotune which is during bad examples of it. Hammer's makeup unlike DiCaprio's which makes the case stranger is akin to a bad plastic surgery! We should not be talking about bad makeup in a Clint Eastwood film! But believe me this time there is some and frankly it makes some scenes even laughable like for instance seeing elderly Hoover and Tolson together. But like I said I did love some things about J. EDGAR. Actually some of it is simply a masterpiece of a damn good and entertaining crime picture. We have the classic story the classic rise of the genius and visionary man in this case a man who knew intelligence and science were key factors to deal with crime. Is all very noirish the crime of the century  the kidnap and murdered of Charles Lindbergh's son is shown and there's stuff about cinema how criminals were sort of glorified in movies with for instance James Cagney. And how Hoover wanted the same glorification for him  and you have to see what happens when someone say that Hoover didn't kill Dillinger!. So in a way and for a fan of crime pictures like myself with all of this there's nothing much to ask for there's even a really interesting turn of events by the end. It is really clever. Maybe all of this L.A. NOIREkind of thing makes me revisit at some point this strange case for Mr. Eastwood. Watched it on the big screen on January 17 2012".

	schema:headline " Hoover's mother's dress may be Eastwood's 'Rosebud'";
	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time Clint Eastwood was a rightwing Republican who churned out revenge fantasies about vigilantes who breathlessly enjoyed taking the law into their own hands. In these 'ancient' times J. Edgar Hoover may have been one of Eastwood's heroes. As Hollywood has changed quite a bit since then Eastwood instinctively realized that if he didn't change with the times he could barely survive in a new politically correct world. Given the new exigencies Eastwood could no longer ignore all of Hoover's bad behavior including the iconic FBI director's paranoia and abject pettiness. Fortunately for Mr. Eastwood he found the perfect politically correct screenwriter in Dustin Lance Black who could mitigate Hoover's bad points by not only focusing on his private life as a closeted repressed homosexual but also turning him into a tragic figure who was scarred by a manipulative and overbearing mother.Mr. Black does far worse in depicting Hoover's public persona than his private one. In Citizen Kanelike fashion narration and a series of flashbacks are utilized to tell Hoover's story. But unlike Kane which is told from multiple points of view Hoover's story comes from Hoover himself who is seen dictating his memoirs in his office to various FBI agents during the 60s and early 70s. The flashbacks for the early period begin in the early 20s when Hoover recounts his stint as a young lawyer in the Justice Department and how he became involved in that Department's crusade against socalled radicals and subversives initiated by Attorney General Palmer in 1919 whose home is shown dramatically firebombed in the beginning of the film.Black has great difficulty in dramatizing the Director's early career and we see one dubious scene of Hoover participating in a raid where radicals are eventually deported. More interesting is Hoover's obsession with details in the scene where he reveals his new card catalog system at the Library of Congress to his secretarytobe Helen Gandy. Black addresses Hoover's pettiness in taking all the credit for the Gmen's heroics including his most egregious conduct in that regard the demotion of Agent Purvis responsible for the take down of John Dillinger. Black alludes to all of this but we never see the conflict with Purvis successfully dramatized. So desperate for drama Black spends a good deal of time dissecting the Lindbergh kidnapping which Hoover was only tangentially involved in. But even the Lindbergh scene fails to flow as Black interrupts the action by cutting back to events from the 60s. Josh Lucas is totally wrong as Lindbergh as not only doesn't he look like him but has no dialogue that conveys the famed aviator's dynamism.Jeffrey Donovan looks a lot more like Robert Kennedy and manages to get the accent right but Hoover's whole conflict with the Kennedy's is reduced to Bobby telling J. Edgar in essence times have changed. Even more sketchy is Hoover's treatment of Martin Luther King. Because we see everything from Hoover's point of view and never meet any of the Civil Rights era characters he opposes his egregious conduct seems muted. Eastwood must resort to cheap shots such as having Hoover listen to a salacious tape presumably of a MLK tryst and receiving a phone call at the same time right after JFK is shot.Eastwood and Black are on more solid ground in attempting to humanize Hoover by providing insight into his private life. Since little is known of what went on behind 'closed doors' a screenwriter is obligated to take dramatic license and speculate as to the events that could have unfolded. Eastwood does well in not showing Hoover as sexually aggressive and actually not initiating a sexual encounter with his long term confidante Clyde Tolson who he appointed his associate director at the FBI. In Dustin Lance Black's view it was Tolson who was the sexual aggressor and fashions a scene where Hoover rebuffs Tolson after he kisses him following Hoover's revelation that he might have had a sexual encounter with the screen actress Dorothy Lamour. For a good part of the film Black depicts Tolson as a toady picking out his wardrobe at expensive clothing stores and indulging Hoover in his forays at the racetrack. Only after Tolson falls victim to a stroke does he seem to muster the courage to confront Hoover criticizing him for his selfish behavior and paranoid outlook Tolson's critique is illustrated in the 'correct' flashback where Hoover no longer receives credit for arresting all those criminals he claimed to have taken down personally. Tolson here is really Black's conscience speaking and whether Tolson would have turned on Hoover in that way I have no idea. What's missing is any sense of Tolson's intellectual life and ultimately he's little more than an entertaining stereotype of a closeted gay man.DiCaprio does a decent job depicting a control freak Hoover minus the Kanelike gyrations at the end. Armie Hammer's Tolson is entertaining sans the bad makeup job as the elderly Tolson but Naomi Watts has little to do as the secretary. Judi Dench is excellent as the demented mom.Like Orson Welles Eastwood falters in attempting to turn Hoover into a tragic figure who didn't really like himself. Welles unfairly criticized William Randolph Hearst by speciously linking 'Rosebud' Kane's childhood keepsake a sled to a miserable childhood. Hoover's mother's dress the one he puts on after she dies is perhaps Eastwood's 'Rosebud'the dress also symbolizes Hoover's inability to escape his attachment to his mother and her disparagement of his sexuality which he must suppress the mother's 'daffodil' comment is the last straw!.But perhaps Eastwood and Black's interpretation is all wrong. Perhaps Hoover actually did like himself and didn't have an inferiority complex due to his overbearing mother. If that's the case Hoover should be seen as far more maniacal than Eastwood lets on here. All the harm that Hoover was responsible for can no longer be chalked up to a bad childhood.".

The subject matter about the life of a dreadfully dull and stodgy old bureaucrat from a bygone era is not in line with Hollywood's usual massproduced action films aimed at brash young boys. I credit Director Eastwood and lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio with enough star power to convince the moneymen to fund this project. And it turned a profit.But there are plenty of problems with J. Edgar not the least of which is a script that flips back and forth too much between the 1960s and earlier decades in Hoover's life. A lot of time is wasted on the gangster era of the 1920 and 30s possibly because Di Caprio is so youthful looking he fits a younger image of Hoover in contrast to an aging old man in the 60s. Almost nothing is included about the JFK assassination and followup investigation despite the fact that Hoover played a central role in marketing the lonegunman theory.Throughout Hoover comes across as bureaucratic rigid moralistic selfrighteous incapable of changing with the times dishonest and a hypocrite. Absent from the film are any virtuous qualities he may have had.As Hoover Leonardo Di Caprio gives a better performance than I would have predicted. But the script does Di Caprio no favors. The dialogue for Hoover consists largely of platitudes and pronouncements. Hoover doesn't talk with people so much as make little speeches to them. And Di Caprio's monotone voice exaggerates this talking down to others effect.Hoover demanded loyalty from his staff. As his private secretary Helen Gandy Naomi Watts is an interesting study in forced loyalty. Ditto Clyde Tolson Armie Hammer as Hoover's sidekick.Cinematography is quite dark. Colors are heavily muted almost monochromatic. Costumes and prod design are convincing across five decades. But makeup for an older Clyde Tolson is horrid his face looks like a wax figure that's about to melt.J. Edgar could have been much better had the script focused more on the sixties and shown Hoover's working relationship to the Kennedy's and Lyndon Johnson. And though I appreciate Di Caprio's efforts to get the film made a different actor might have been more convincing in the role of Hoover. Still the film is a reasonably good effort. It's worth watching once if for no other reason than because it's a true story about a reallife historical figure.".

	schema:headline " The person behind the man";
	schema:reviewBody "A movie about one of the most renowned personalities of America's 20th century directed by one of its most respected directors made it one very highly on my 'to see' list.The film does not waste much time in giving us a sight of what a powerful even notorious personality the homonymous character is including his very strong anticommunist sentiments. As far as his character goes he appears as swift to respond highly intelligent but also highly paranoid a predator a hawk always switched on always on the edge without any peace who did not appreciate having any limitations to his authority or power. During a very poignant dialogue towards the end between Hoover and his assistant Tolson it becomes very clear how Hoover did not appreciate criticism and were unable to handle the truth expecting others to simply accept his version of the truth.As we are treated to a more intimate view in his life the closeness to his mother does not go undetected and neither it should as with all personality deficiencies in men at least the relationship with their mother is one to closely watch. It was because of her influence in Edgar that left him with a pervasive sense of threat as well as a hunger for power an influence that amongst other things caused him to be socially limited. Even towards the end of the film where our main character has grown much older frail physically but not emotionally his ways have not been altered in any way and one could even presume that his megalomania and paranoia are grown even more.Despite the aspects of Edgar's character the audience might not come to like Clint Eastwood does a superb job in making sure that Hoover's gifts are also highlighted which include impressive energy levels vigorous memory capacity to detect patterns and an ability to receiver process comprehend  communicate information extremely effectively.Though not a dark film this biopic has dark undertones suited perhaps to the personality it portrays. There are very few outdoor scenes little light in general and it would also seem that J Edgar was the workaholic type who did not have much of a social or private life. Regarding his social life he appears outgoing but not very sociable and in connection to his private life we are led to assume that he was a homosexual which was a cause for him to suffer perhaps loathe himself due to the religiously incited antigay sentiment preached by his over controlling mother. His inability to fully accept who he was must have beyond question caused him plenty of frustration. On this matter there's a poignant scene in the movie where his mother said paraphrased I'd rather have a dead son than a gay son.With the above in mind one question that must be therefore raised is whether his quest for power and authority was driven by his ideasvalues for a better society or because it provided him with a sense of self worth? Why wasn't' he ever satisfied or willing to give up power? There is also some resemblance albeit small of 'The Aviator' another biopic with DiCaprio in the leading role.DiCaprio gives a forceful performance and carries the film which is part biopic  part political drama compellingly. If there is a criticism about this movie it would have to be that it is rather slow and often made me wonder as to where it is heading with the constant interaction between Hoover's youth and later years.This is an accomplished biographical dramacharacter study that although it might not be to everyone's taste nonetheless to those with a keen interest in politics or US history in the 20th century or simply those interested in finding out more about the enigmatic J. Edgar Hoover this is the film to watch.".

As far as his character goes he appears as swift to respond highly intelligent but also highly paranoid a predator a hawk always switched on always on the edge without any peace who did not appreciate having any limitations to his authority or power.

Dame Dench supplies the best acting as Hoover's stiflingly overbearing mother. Armie Hammer's part as Hoover's love interest is underplayed and underused. The screenplay and direction deliberately try to portray Hoover as uncontroversially as possible giving him the benefit of the doubt and trying to make out his actions were merely dictated by his insecurities. Under it all he was just confused lonely man looking for love. Methinks and history shows the truth was a lot darker. His part in and impact on the political scene is skimmed over we never get a true sense of what he accomplished for good or ill. All we're left with is the fuzzy picture of a bland old man that doesn't do Hoover or the audience any justice.

	schema:reviewBody "Country Strong a surprisingly good film even if you live in  California and don't happen to like country music. Starring Gwyneth  Paltrow Iron Man Tim McGraw The Blind Side Garrett Hedlund TRON  Legacy and Leighton Meester Gossip Girl Country Strong succeeds  in doing exactly what it sets out to do that is make a dramatic film  about country music that is also entertaining. I know a lot of critics  will not agree with me but in the midst of the awards season this is  the one film not nominated for a big time award that is worth  spending your money on.  Side Note Oh and if you're only reading this review to find out if  Gwyneth Paltrow can sing the answer is yes she can. But if you had  seen Duets then you already knew that she could.  Synopsis A story that follows fallen country music superstar Kelly  Canter Paltrow as she is released from rehab and attempts a comeback  concert. There is also another and all around better storyline that  follows the rise of two up and coming country music artists Beau Hutton  and Chiles Stanton Hedlund and Meester as they try to find out what  path to take through the harsh and unforgiving world of the country  music industry.  Yes Country Strong may seem a bit to predictable for some and yes  it does lag a bit in the middle of the film mostly pertaining to  Paltrow's scenes but it does redeem itself with a vengeance in the  final 30 minutes of the film. The storyline is really well thought out  the character development here is potent and the acting including the  singing for the most part is excellent.  Unequivocally the one actor to take note of in this film is Hedlund  who steals the show with his performance of a country boycountry music  purist. His chemistry on screen with just about everyone including the  microphone is so authentic that whenever he is onscreen he literally  makes the movie better. Any and all issues I have with this film  surprisingly fall directly on the performance of Paltrow. She plays an  aging alcoholic Country superstar with as much heart as she can muster  but overall she is sadly uninteresting to watch for most of the film.  Final Thought Country Strong is currently getting raked through the  mud by critics for its simplistic storyline but let me tell you this  anyone and I mean anyone who is a fan of Country music will  undoubtedly love this film. And even if the Country twang is not your  bang this is a strong enough drama to keep you in your seat. This is  no Crazy Heart so no nominations to be found here but Country  Strong is still entertaining enough for me to strongly recommend.".

Big deal if it is similar to others. This movie seemed so very real to what it could actually be like. Gwyneth's acceptance to be the character she has to be was remarkable. She had humor...terrific talent and as a womanwife who's husband had forgotten how to be a husband and partner no offense Tim...you were great too...she was passionate and playful yet sad and lost. Once again she showed how wonderful and talented an actress she really is.Garrett and Leighton played their roles very professionally...very real and we need to see more of them.I love this movie. It had a profound affect on me being a musician and someone who had felt the loss of hope the exact same way Kelly did in this movie.If the critics hadn't beaten it up so much...this movie would have rocked at the box office!

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be honest. I am NOT a country music fan. Nor am I a fan of country music movies westerns or anything that has cowboy boots in it. That being said I just finished watching Country Strong and I have to readjust my views a bit. I still dislike westerns intensely but I now have a country music movie to add to my list of favorites. It could be the very pretty cast of actors or it could be the engrossing storyline or it just might be the music that had me swaying in my seat whatever it was I left the movie as a devoted fan.This gripping movie is about a country megastar named Kelly Canter played by the illustrious Gwyneth Paltrow and her rocky journey through the world of alcoholism. The movie boasts a well puttogether cast starring Tim McGraw as Kelly's husbandmanager James Garrett Hedlund as her sponsor and opener Beau Hutton and Leighton Meester as the up and coming country singer Chiles Stanton.The movie starts out in a rinkydink dance hall in Nashville Tennessee. You can hear the gravelly voice of Beau Hutton telling a story about wanting to sing like Merle Haggard for his mom's benefit. She tells him that he sounds good but he's no Merle. Beau then launches into a Merleesque song Chances Are and it was the first time that a country song actually made me swoon. Beau is a good ol' boy wearing his stained and weathered cowboy hat and driving a rustedout truck. It turns out he is also Kelly Canter's sponsor in rehab.Kelly's husband checks her out of rehab a month early against Beau's better judgment. James believes that getting her back on the horse and touring again will get her healthy faster than being in a rehab center. James come across as moneyhungry however throughout the movie we learn that he does love his wife and only wants the best for her. As Kelly's manager he is in charge of finding new talent to open for Kelly. He goes to see a former beauty queen with a surprisingly good voice named Chiles Stanton.Chiles is an extremely pretty young girl with an exaggerated Texan accent. She wears too much makeup and has her hair full and curly. I don't know what's bigger the hair or the dress is how the stage manager describes her. She seems very confident when you first meet her however as soon as she gets onstage she freezes up. She is rescued valiantly by Beau Hutton who was the performer before her. Chiles' freshfaced look appeals to the audience once her stage fright is past. With her glittering outfit high heels and makeup she truly looks like a country Barbie.After James hears both Beau and Chiles singing he decides to offer the opening acts to both of them. He also reluctantly wants Beau along to help him watch over Kelly. James recognizes that Kelly is going to need a lot of help while on the road. The scene where James asks Beau to tour with them demonstrates just how palpable the animosity is between the two men. The acrimony turns out to be precognizant of the situation because Beau and Kelly are indeed having an affair.During the tour we learn of the reason that Kelly is in rehab. Several months ago in Dallas Kelly was drunk onstage tripped over a cable and fell 10 feet off the stage. She was five months pregnant at the time and lost the baby as a result of the fall. The guilt she feels over the incident keeps her drinking until rehab. James tries to love her in spite of the miscarriage but you can feel the blame he places on her. There is a touching scene between James and Kelly where he says The first time I heard you sing I knew. I wasn't much of a church man but I thought that must be what angels sound like. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. You can sense just how much this couple has been through in their marriage.The tour starts and stutters along with Beau and Chiles carrying the responsibility while Kelly is drinking herself from town to town. The depression is dragging Kelly down and she makes numerous mistakes. Beau and Chiles start to have feelings for each other because they are thrown together in so many scenes. They have a charming scene where they sing a duet together and just watching them on the big screen you can feel the chemistry between them. The relationship between James and Kelly however is disintegrating bit by bit. You can see the strength and fortitude that Kelly has even as her marriage and career are crumbling around her. She gears up to go back to Dallas on a repeat tour even though that was where she lost her baby and embarrassed herself earlier that year.In Dallas Kelly seems a different person. She is driven and confident. The loyalty of her fans seems to boost her esteem and she does what she can to stay sober. There is a scene before the concert between Beau and Chiles where he informs her that he is leaving the show and heading to California. He asks Chiles to go with him and she is unable to give him the answer he wants. The disappointment on his face is touching.Some critics may say that Country Strong is cheesy clichd and predictable but I found that not to be true. I felt the desperation of Kelly's predicament and the doomed love of her marriage. I found the relationship between Beau and Chiles to be refreshing and romantic. And most of all I found the music to be stirring and awardwinning. Maybe it will never win an Oscar but it's still two thumbs up from me!".

I never tried to impress a girl by pretending Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift is my type of music and I can honestly say I have never participated in a line dance. So what was I doing at a screening of Country Strong? Maybe it was because I knew that this genre of music has millions of fans worldwide and a long history going back several decades. With that extensive history the music and the performers have a chivalrous quality. The film begins with Beau Hutton played by Garrett Hedlund and Kelly Canter played by Gwyneth Paltrow both in an alcohol rehab facility. Kelly was once a sixtime Grammy winner in this fictional country world. It is implied that something awful happened in Dallas due to her drinking problem and that is why she is in rehab now. Dallas soon becomes code for rock bottom throughout the story. Beau works at the rehab facility as Kelly's sponsor a sponsor who drinks but her sponsor none the less and is also a country music singer. Kelly's husband manager who is about 20 percent husband and 80 percent manager James Canter played by Tim McGraw comes to pick up Kelly from rehab. Instantly there is tension between James and Beau. McGraw does a great job of playing the reserved yet highly focused and determined manager of Kelly's career. James pulls Kelly out of rehab early to reboot her career. It was never stated that he was doing this for money. The underlying issues of James have something to do more with money than with fame. James recruits a young beauty queen Chiles Stanton played by Leighton Meester to open for Kelly's comeback tour. Again there is tension between James and Beau. Beau doesn't want to open for Kelly he wants to stay true to the music by playing in the honky tonk bars and not do it for the money. How noble. Beau also has an instant love hate with Chiles and sees right through her phoniness. Beau and Chiles represent the two sub genres of country music. Beau wants to have a good time singing country tunes while Chiles wants the pop stardom and to sing songs that have titles like rides at Disneyland that was a joke from the movie. Kelly's first show is a disaster. An event from her past yep you guessed it Dallas comes back to rattle her and she goes back to drinking. James graciously forces Kelly onto stage where she has a breakdown. For much of the film there was a series of relapses for Kelly followed by fits of her crying followed by instantaneous sobriety. I hope the studio was paying Paltrow by the tear drop she would have made millions off that deal alone. The story goes from a love triangle to pretty much a love rectangle between the four main characters. We move into a series of romances on the tour between three of the stars. Beau wants Kelly. Kelly wants Beau her husband and her booze. Chiles only wants Beau. Then Beau wants Chiles. James really just wants to be left alone while he works on his business deals. The story finally climaxes to Kelly's big finale in Dallas yes the same Dallas as before where all three of the top stars give great performances. To add a the dramatic element before each musician gives their superb concerts they have oneonone hearttoheart talks in the dressing rooms letting each other know how they feel about each other. Should you see this movie? Maybe if you are a fan of country music you might appreciate it a little more than I did. If you are a casual listener there might not be enough to hold your attention. It did give a great view of what goes on behind the scenes of the music industry. The performances and singing by the cast were amazing McGraw the only real country music singer in the film doesn't sing a single note. The ending was unique because it was something new to this type of film. It does end like an old country song.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie. It wasn't what I expected at all but I really enjoyed it and did tear up a couple of times. I have to say I am very surprised by the harsh reviews by critics and some of the users on here!The movie is a bit too long at almost 2 hours. I think a couple of the acting scenes were repetitive but I am glad they did not cut any of the music they had. There is a LOT of music but the actors all pull it off quite well with some of the songs actually being recognizable as real country songs if you are familiar with the genre.I must admit I am a huge country music fan and I like all country not just the newer pop stuff. So take my review knowing that. However I did take 3 people with me to the advance screening and 2 of them listen to NO country music. All 4 of us thought the movie was great. Three of us cried.I think the previews are marketing the movie all wrong. It looks like it will be an uplifting film that shows us the bad stuff in the beginning then maybe a bump or two then everybody winds up happy and Country Strong. This is not the case at all.It is a sad look at addiction but I think more realistic than someone coming out of rehab and everything being sunshine and lollipops. The characters are all flawed with perhaps Beau being the only one who comes out in a mostly positive light but even he has his issues and is far from perfect.It also looks like Gwyneth is the only lead in the previews but all 4 major characters have quite a large amount of time on screen and I think Beau has the same or maybe even more screen time as Gwyneth. I had never heard of this actor had no clue he has the lead in TRON and I came home to look him up immediately because I thought surely he was a real up and coming country singer.Gwyneth's voice is really good and if Garrett or Leighton ever made a country album I would buy it. Tim doesn't sing in the movie but has a song on the soundtrack but that was the way he wanted it and I respect him for that. This was the first movie of Tim's where I did forget at least a couple of times that I was looking at THE Tim McGraw. He was fine in Blindside but it was a small role.If you have a passionate hatred for country I do not think you will enjoy the movie because there is a lot of singing in it. However you do not need to love country as I do to enjoy it. If you can so much as tolerate it or accept the singers as being talented I think you'll be fine.I plan to buy the soundtrack but wish it had more from Garrett and Leighton because they each sang a lot more than 1 song in the movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a relatively new fan of country music I must say I was disappointed in this movie. It had its moments but overall I cannot recommend it. The clumsy disconnected screenplay was probably the worst aspect of the film as it gave the actors little to work with. There didn't seem to be much continuity to the film but just a bunch of scenes thrown together. Aside from her singing the title song there was nothing about the main character played by Gwyneth Paltrow that was remotely strong and the ending was hardly inspiring in that regard. I cringed through the first half of the movie which seemed to go overboard in portraying her flaws and failures and wondered how much lower she would get before she turned things around. It was quite depressing with no payoff at the end to make it worthwhile.What the movie does have is some pretty good music. Paltrow Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester all sang quite well and almost made this movie worth seeing. Hedlund gave the best acting performance and Meester wasn't bad. But I was quite disappointed in Tim McGraw's effort and feel it was the weakest of his budding career. I don't know if it was because he was playing an insensitive jerk as opposed to the nice guys of his previous roles but he seemed strained and unnatural. And as well as Paltrow sang and as much as I have enjoyed previous work by her she was unconvincing in her portrayal of a country superstar limited in part by the poor script as noted earlier. The charisma just wasn't there.Seeing a movie like this makes me appreciate wellwritten and wellacted movies all the more. They have a unifying theme that takes you somewhere and ties things together at the end unless of course there is to be a sequel. Country Strong just didn't have what it takes but ending up looking more like a directtovideo film. It should have been titled Country Pathetic.".

Yes that really is Gwyneth singing in the film.The good news doesn't end there because the supporting cast are just as good Garret Hedlund and Leighton Meester were fantastic and so good as country singers that I immediately looked for their albums but apart from the Country Strong Soundtrack there aren't any! These are just great actors with great voices. Add in a strong performance from Tim McGraw Oh why cant you just love your woman?  that's all she needs!!.With fine layered performances from all and a storming soundtrack this is definitely unmissable for any country music lover. I'm still humming the tunes days later.By the way be careful if buying the soundtrack album. There are two! The first has other artists covering many of the film's songs and though it's a good album isn't strictly from the soundtrack in every case. The second album with the same name seems to have original performances from the film but was out of stock and I have it on back order. I think this is the more popular one.Anyway if like me you don't watch films that score less than about 6 on IMDb make this one an exception. You wont regret it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a decent movie but not one that I loved. The singing in the movie is top notch except for 1 or 2 of Paltrow's songs which were just okay. These are some seriously talented people. Huge surprise that Leighton Meester is a terrific singer. You might know her from Gossip Girl.You probably already know the synopsis  alcoholic singer goes back on the road to try and reclaim her past star status pushed along by her managerhusband. She bonds with a young male singerguitar player who she brings along on her minitour who despite the best of intentions can't quite pull her out of her addictive cycle. Leighton Meester plays a very sympathetic and likable character who is just trying to live her dream...she's brought along on the tour by the husbandmanager.Overall it was a depressing movie....to see someone battling addiction and how it eventually wears down the people around them to the point where they look like they are nasty poor McGraw when in reality they are just tired of the cycle of selfdestruction.What was entertaining and enjoyable about the movie was the songs and the concert scenes. It was a nice movie to go see on a snowy night....doubtful that I would rent it once it became available or buy it on DVD...which is kind of the benchmark for me on what is a good movie.You won't waste your money seeing it but you'll probably wish you'd seen it at a reduced price or at the matine if you paid full price.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a decent movie but not one that I loved. The singing in the movie is top notch except for 1 or 2 of Paltrow's songs which were just okay. These are some seriously talented people. Huge surprise that Leighton Meester is a terrific singer. You might know her from Gossip Girl.You probably already know the synopsis  alcoholic singer goes back on the road to try and reclaim her past star status pushed along by her managerhusband. She bonds with a young male singerguitar player who she brings along on her minitour who despite the best of intentions can't quite pull her out of her addictive cycle. Leighton Meester plays a very sympathetic and likable character who is just trying to live her dream...she's brought along on the tour by the husbandmanager.Overall it was a depressing movie....to see someone battling addiction and how it eventually wears down the people around them to the point where they look like they are nasty poor McGraw when in reality they are just tired of the cycle of selfdestruction.What was entertaining and enjoyable about the movie was the songs and the concert scenes. It was a nice movie to go see on a snowy night....doubtful that I would rent it once it became available or buy it on DVD...which is kind of the benchmark for me on what is a good movie.You won't waste your money seeing it but you'll probably wish you'd seen it at a reduced price or at the matine if you paid full price.";

But then she leaves the stage right after her comeback show to lock herself in her dressing room to purposely OD? That ruined the entire movie for me. The music was great and I hope it establishes Garrett Hedlund as a strong actor. And who knew he could sing? But it was so depressing I would never want to see it again despite the good qualities. I don't know if people like it because it's one of the few movies about country music or if people just want to be depressed. If you want a movie about country music watch Walk the Line. Yeah it gets extremely depressing at times but nothing like this. And it's a true story. Sorry it could have been a really good movie...until the end.

It is hard to compare it with other movies I have seen but I guess you would call it a Drama  romance movie. I think it will appeal to people in their 20's and up. Maybe a date movie? This movie is NOT just for people that like Country Music. As I stated I am not a Country music fan but came out thinking I would not mind owning the soundtrack.

But this actor kept me watching for about half the film before I gave up.Alcoholism is such a boring and clichd plot device.

Even the scene where she goes to an old dive she knows gets wasted singing on the bar when her young cowboy boyfriend comes and drags her out. He was even a young cowboy that did the same thing to Bette in The Rose. Only difference Bette did it so much better she is a real singer. She wasn't a Barbie Doll movie star who they had to let sing to do the movie. They changed Bette's manager exlover for Gwyneth's husband. Made her a drunk the Rose was a drug addict. I have no need to buy this movie I have The Rose. They even have them both dreading a certain city they are scheduled to perform at during the tour. In The Rose it is because it is her home town for Country Strong it's because of her meltdown getting on stage drunk five months pregnant falling and loosing the baby. They even copied the ending both women suicide with a drug overdose. At least Country strong added two young characters and they have a happy ending as unbelievable as it was. I girl with so much ambition she would seduce the main characters husband but she would give it all up for love. I understand that country music is very in now as rock and roll was when The Rose came out but it doesn't excuse copying an earlier movie. It's hard to believe I am the only one of my generation that noticed it.Muzzy".

Despite the fact that Kelly knows she is not yet ready to get back out on stage she agrees to do so under one condition she can bring along musicallytalented friend and lover Beau Hutton Garrett Hedlund as her opening act.While Kelly struggles with her relapse into alcohol addiction Beau finds love with young rising star Chiles Stanton Leighton Meester and James is left disappointed and hurt. All cast members do a great job of really embodying their roles and Paltrow does an exceptional job of showing the struggles and depression of alcohol addiction.Although this movie is not really like any other I would probably compare it to the movie Blow. In both movies the main characters try to leave their addictions in the past but are so reliant upon them that they continually relapse which ultimately leads to their downfall.".

	schema:headline " Probably the most misunderstood film of this decade";
	schema:reviewBody "Given the vast majority of major criticisms levelled at this film it would appear that a large percentage of the audience has completely missed the joke or simply didn't find it at all amusing. With Death Proof 2007 Tarantino creates such a loving homage to a notoriously cult cinematic subculture that many people seem unaware of how to approach it or even how to appreciate the sheer fact that the film purposely goes out of its way to ape the style of late 60's and early 70's exploitation cinema in look feel and content. The film isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously but rather is a parody andor pastiche of the kind of films that the vast majority of mainstream audiences simply wouldn't want to see. I'm talking about films such as TwoThousand Maniacs 1964 Ride the Whirlwind 1965 Manos The Hands of Fate 1966 Satan's Sadists 1968 The Big Bird Cage 1971 Boxcar Bertha 1972 Fight for Your Life 1977 or Satan's Cheerleaders 1977 lowbudget films made with oftennonprofessional actors little in the way of conventional film logic and highly controversial in terms of plot theme and content.It also sets out to pastiche the grindhouse cinema phenomena with the original idea of two films being shown as a double feature at drivein movie theatres from state to state with both films often being recut and reedited not by the filmmakers but by the theatre owners themselves. This is evident in the amusing switch in title with the film opening with the caption 'Quentin Tarantino's Thunderbolt' before awkwardly cutting to an obviously out of place title card with 'Death Proof' crudely emblazoned across the screen. This is also the explanation for the purposeful mistakes in continuity the sloppy editing and the switch between colour and black and white as well as the faade of severely deteriorating film stock. It's not sloppy filmmaking but rather a purposeful appropriation of sloppy filmmaking geared towards appealing to the kind of obsessive movie aficionado who gets the references and can appreciate the joke that Tarantino is attempting to pull.With this in mind it seems hard to understand what people are complaining about. Do audiences actual expect this film to keep them enthralled and entertained when the vast majority of them would balk at experiencing many of the lowbudget semiobscure films that influenced it? Hardly! The accusation here that nothing happens is fascicle. The fact that there is film running through the camera is proof enough that something is happening with the hilariously bland dialog deconstructing the film in much the same way as the purposely amateurish composition editing and sound all intended to fracture the cinematic language in the same way that Godard did by reminding the audience that this is the film and the point of the film is to experience the sights and sounds that unfold before us. Added to this the colourful iconography the music the characters the girls in tight tshirts the for once entirely justified performance from the man himself all reminding us that this is a joyous darkly comic romp in which the point is not why? but why not?.The effect is reminiscent of Kill Bill 2003 which at times felt superficial or perhaps even too knowing for its own good but still demonstrated to us the filmmaker's great use of tone texture colour and movement as well as turning many people on to a whole new world of cult Japanese cinema from the works of highly individual filmmakers like Seijun Suzuki Kinji Fukasaku and Takashi Miike to cult performers like Sony Chiba. Death Proof attempts to do something similar with the likes of the American revisionist road movie the Bcinema of Roger Corman and the femsploitation subgenre of films like The Big Bird Cage 1972 Caged Heat 1975 Day of the Woman 1978 and Ms. 45 1981 a coolly ironic series of films in which wronged women take bloody revenge in an often elaborate and over the top style chiefly intended to give a feminist slant to the still rampant degradation and misogyny prevalent in the exploitation genre.Other reference points are more obvious as they're mentioned explicitly in the film notably car chase cinema such as Vanishing Point 1971 TwoLane Blacktop 1971 Dirty Mary Crazy Larry 1974 Gone in 60 Seconds 1974 and even Spielberg's Duel 1971. Some have complained that the film fails on account of its lack of action and emphasis on dialog and technique but this seems churlish when you think of the films being referenced with Vanishing Point featuring a number of cryptic desertset sequences in which characters talk and talk and talk while TwoLane Blacktop punctuates its scenes of hard driving and dragracing with much in the way of meandering smalltalk. Then we have the fact that films like Reservoir Dogs  which takes place almost entirely within a single setting  and Jackie Brown  which places emphasis entirely on character  use dialog to not only create the characters but to also tell the story.Regardless of this Death Proof is meant as a piece of entertainment. There's no real desire here for Tarantino to prove what kind of filmmaker he is because he's already done that with the number of great films that came before. Sure it can be seen as selfindulgent but surely those of us familiar with the style of filmmaking being referenced here will revel in this particular kind of extravagance loving everything from the continually inane female banter to the awesome scenes of high speed carnage. If you're not a fan cult cinema or exploitation cinema or indeed a devotee of Tarantino's work then this film really isn't going to impress you. There's no shame in that. Some films are made for a niche audience destined to be a cult in their own right. However for those who get it Death Proof has the potential to be a truly exhilarating oneoff piece of filmmaking.".

Tarantino is undeniably a pro director and though I personally think his trademark elements  bizarre dialogue about pop culture foot fetishism  are somewhat annoying I was willing to give him a try. He couldn't possibly screw up a movie that is SUPPOSED to be bad I thought.Suffice to say he could. Oh how he could.We begin our long and arduous journey through the demented mind of Quentin I made two cult classics in the early 90s and am therefore beyond criticism Tarantino by joining a motley crew of four young women on their way to a local bar tended by none other than Tarantino himself in an utterly pointless cameo role. Then nothing happens. Twice.I'm serious the first hour of this movie it might have been less but it certainly didn't feel like less consists of absolutely nothing else but four women whose admittedly good looks cannot mask the fact that they are about as intriguing to watch as display dummies and slightly less entertaining drinking in a bar and talking.What they are talking about I have no idea. I really cannot remember a single sentence of note said in this torturous first hour for the protocol I cannot remember anything said in the second half either but I am fairly sure that it involved some kind of prank about a lap dance one of them don't ask me for the names pulled on one of the others.After meeting Stuntman Mike whose introduction moves at about the same snailpaced crawl as everything does in this movie and another twenty minutes of talking and an embarrassing lap dance we finally get to the action part of the movie. The use of quotation marks is deliberate since the much anticipated murder scene didn't I tell you? Stuntman Mike is a serial killer using his car as a weapon.

It's an insufferably boring and egomaniacal mess and there is absolutely no reason to see it. It's not funny not even unintentionally so. It's not scary. It's not interesting not overthe top surreal nothing. There is no gore no monsters mutants freaks demons or at least a cool villain to hold your interest Kurt Russell wasn't bad as an actor but to call his character twodimensional would be an exaggeration there isn't ANYTHING in here that makes a good Bmovie entertaining .

Unfortunately by this time I was so mad at having had to sit through so much mind numbing dialog that I couldn't even enjoy the car chase and what followed. No payoff could have been big enough for having been subjected to about a full hour of excruciating boredom except for maybe the credits to roll. I don't know what the heck happened to Tarantino but if felt like he was channeling Oprah or The View through some sort of trailer park filter. It was in a word bizarre. Another 5 minutes of car chase action. Then the movie ends.This movie is supposed to be a spoof on the 70's Bgrade camp movies. However it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've seen in my life!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little dubious about seeing this out of context of 'Grindhouse' as i figured despite what the greedy distributors might think it would make less sense and the idea as a whole would work better in Europe particularly after we've been waiting for so long. It started off brilliantly style wise the whole seventies exploitation flick look was there and executed fantastically the scratches the jump cuts the poor continuity and worked better than i expected as it successfully walked the difficult tightrope between homage and parody. Then the talking started. I don't want to labour the point about the dialogue but feel i have to as it is painful. Tarantino has never been able to write for women. Far and away the worst scenes in terms of dialogue in Pulp Fiction are those involving women. The Uma Thurman scenes with Travolta are ham fisted attempts at fantasy chemistry how a teenager might practise talking to a high school crush in front of a mirror. In Reservoir Dogs one of the only women characters that doesn't get shot was cut from the final film. In fact all of his original work aside from Kill Bill is male based but even the Bride is merely an action revenge figure in female form so the scripting here would have worked either way. With that in mind what made him think him he could pull off a two hour movie with 8 women talking incessantly all the way through it? Worst still amongst all the talk Tarantino self references his own films in it even when he's doing one of his useless cameos he references Pulp Fiction! I know he's made a career out of this but in previous films most of the dialogue was in short snappy burst with outside views on mass pop culture and it was charmingly woven into strong individual characters that moved the plot and story along. Quentin has got to the point now where it's clear when HE is talking through the characters to put across a personal point of view or about his knowledge of obscure trash Americana from yesteryear. This is all laced with his wet dream on how he thinks women talk when he's not around. Here one woman is much the same as the other and by the time a brief anticlimax comes along involving Kurt Russell i want them all to die! When Stuntman Mike does finally appear it's good but too brief in fact it's a cameo role. I understand that there's no explanation for his actions there doesn't need to be it's supposed to be exploitation. But without wanting to sound like a sadist if it is supposed to be exploitation then where was it? These films were supposed to be a retro study of the cheap drivein extreme cinema of the seventies OTT comic book violence and unrealistic set pieces. There's more sex and violence in Bourne than in this! If the movie had kicked into overdrive as i expected after that point i could have perhaps forgiven the poor exposition. But from there we have another cameo from Russell who disappears until the end a clean up of the reel and 4 more women impossibly more annoying than the last. This again allows Tarantino to put words in their mouth so he can have a conversation with himself about his favourite muscle car movies for another hour. When Russell does pop up again for the final pursuit he's inexplicably turned into a groveling whining bitch. Then it ends.There's a popular lazy argument on IMDb lately that if you don't like a film you don't 'get it'. Don't tell me i don't get it. I get the retribution i get the elongated build up i get the missing and throw away characters i get the metaphoric idea of women screwing Stuntman Mike with a car i get and liked the abrupt ending etc etc. And I like Tarantino but this is not good not good at all. Sure there's a couple of genius strokes the four view death the reverse hospital set the fact that there is no CGI and Tarantinos perfect use of popular music is as ever outstanding on par with if not better than the original master of this skill Scorsese. But it's not enough to make this worth seeing. Buy the soudtrack put that on and listen to your girlfriend chat with her friends on speaker phone at least the conversation will be more realistic.Any film no matter who is involved in the making of it that causes you to drift off while you're watching or can't hold your attention is poor. Even at the 'Grindhouse' 90 minute mark it would still have been 10 minutes too long and it's a shame it's been taken out of it's context and elongated to it's detriment. If you want real Grindhouse get some originals or see 'Devils Rejects' or 'House of 1000 Corpses' as Rob Zombie seems to have done this already to much better much more extreme effect...and with a retro twist.usprodgmail.com".

Stuntman Mike is easily one of the most cool villains ever or in this case a hero.Death Proof wastes more of our time with another set of even more unlikeable chicks with more inane chitchat. These ones were so bad that they left one of there own to the hands of a drooling lunatic to satisfy their selfish desires. I hated that and wanted Mike to waste them too. This second half of Death Proof was weak. Seeing Mike chase down the unlikeable chicks and taunt them was entertaining but the revenge chase was unspectacular in epic proportions. I hated seeing the one awesome Stuntman Mike become a whiny little bitch in a split second and the ending was atrocious. The Last Word A Tarantino ego trip. This was dedicated to himself. Russel should have gotten A lot more screen time and to see him finally play the bad guy would have been a treat but he is almost nonexistent here. Russel aside I hated this movie.

	schema:headline " Quentin Tarantino owes Kurt Russell an apology";
	schema:reviewBody "The 2nd half of the Grindhouse film feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino respectively. Death Proof is specifically Tarantino's contribution whereas Rodriguez's contribution was the small town redneck community VS. zombies feature Planet Terror.The result? Well Planet Terror was fairly entertaining as it embraced its trashiness and provided fairly engaging action sequences. Death Proof however does not live up to the hype. Now I admit right now I've never really been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. I admire the reckless kinetic energy his films usually exhibit and at times I even briefly embrace his bizarre sense of humor and hey even I laughed a few times at his obscure pop culture references as I'm an unabashed pop culture junkie myself but at the same time his films come off to me as extremely repugnant unpleasant and even a tad repetitive. Thus I can only be a curious observer of his organized chaos on film and never a true fan while the rest of the world praises his genius and tries to silence the few who don't care for his work people like me. But even by trashy action film crime movie standards Death Proof is an insult to human intelligence in a vein similar to George Lucas's awful Star Wars prequels and the lackluster SpiderMan 3 the difference being that those films at least featured engaging action sequences to pad out the banality of the overall product. No such luck with Death Proof.The story  or lack thereof  concerns Stuntman Mike McKay Kurt Russell an old pro at both trashy action films and well made action films having cut his tough guy teeth on John Carpenter's beloved cult epic 'Escape From New York' and his 'death proof' car. A veteran stunt man and stone cold psychopath Mike has an obsession with using his car to kill people specifically beautiful but shallow vapid and above all else annoying obnoxious unlikable and unsympathetic women. The film revolves around his encounters with two sets of beautiful but  you guessed it  shallow vapid annoying obnoxious unlikable women. The first set of said women led by screen legend Sidney Poitier's actress daughter open the film by heading out to score weed possibly have some wild unprotected sex submit another to a potentially humiliating yet erotic lap dance and prepare for a lake house get away they have planned. They spend most of their time driving around and sitting in the bar talking or rather droning on and on about nothing with an uninspired blandness worthy of Uma Thurman's Bride in Kill Bill they encounter Stuntman Mike at the bar and well long story short after even more lackluster dialogue they get run over by Stuntman Mike who is hospitalized but lives to see and destroy another day while they die rather horribly.Cut to 14 months later we encounter yet another group of beautiful but unlikable and unsympathetic women including but not limited to Rosario Dawson Mary Elizabeth Winstead and real life stunt woman Zoe Bell playing herself  she doubled for Lucy Lawless on TV's Xena Warrior Princess and Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill films who happen to be working on a movie in the south. Guess what? They also spend most of their time droning on and on with the most uninspired and unengaging dialogue this side of the coast and they're just as annoying obnoxious and unlikable as the first group of women  if not more so they actually leave Winstead stranded with a Southern lunatic. Well while out for their aimless drive with Zoe performing a stunt on the roof of the car they cross paths with Stuntman Mike who decides to go after them for no better reason than the fact that they happen to be there and are making asses of themselves on the road. In the midst of this Mike gets shot and his tough guy persona falls apart and he is reduced to a cowering weakling the women then turn the tables and chase after him taunting him with possibly even more venom than he tossed at them and the film ends with the women basically beating Mike to death in the middle of the road.What can I say other than this film is overlong selfindulgent boring and lacking focus? Stuntman Mike was a potentially interesting antiherovillain and Kurt Russell fine actor that he is made the most of his role  for the few minutes he's on screen he's the only actor who seems to exhibit anything resembling a personality or feeling  but he is woefully underused and underdeveloped and reducing him to a whimpering fool at the end in an apparent attempt to parody the old alpha male tough guy image which Russell himself wore in earlier better films was far from endearing or even funny. As I stated before the women who appear in the film are among the most repulsive and disgusting characters I've ever seen. It doesn't matter if they're meant to embody girl power these women were simply not likable characters and their absurd dialogue probably meant to be funny due to its absurd content only adds insult to injury and the finale of the film where the 2nd group of women essentially clobber Mike to death only demonstrates that deep down these women were just as psychotic and despicable as Mike himself. And Zoe Bell who spends most of her screen time smirking is no actress a fine stunt performer yes but she's no actress. Even worse Death Proof lacks the reckless kinetic energy that defined Tarantino's other films making his obscenely bad dialogue and repugnant characters all the more unbearable. The car chases are fine but the film doesn't have enough going for it to justify its absurd running time and unpleasant atmosphere. It was inevitable that after all that praise Tarantino would make a mistake and this is probably it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The 2nd half of the Grindhouse film feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino respectively. Death Proof is specifically Tarantino's contribution whereas Rodriguez's contribution was the small town redneck community VS. zombies feature Planet Terror.The result? Well Planet Terror was fairly entertaining as it embraced its trashiness and provided fairly engaging action sequences. Death Proof however does not live up to the hype. Now I admit right now I've never really been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. I admire the reckless kinetic energy his films usually exhibit and at times I even briefly embrace his bizarre sense of humor and hey even I laughed a few times at his obscure pop culture references as I'm an unabashed pop culture junkie myself but at the same time his films come off to me as extremely repugnant unpleasant and even a tad repetitive. Thus I can only be a curious observer of his organized chaos on film and never a true fan while the rest of the world praises his genius and tries to silence the few who don't care for his work people like me. But even by trashy action film crime movie standards Death Proof is an insult to human intelligence in a vein similar to George Lucas's awful Star Wars prequels and the lackluster SpiderMan 3 the difference being that those films at least featured engaging action sequences to pad out the banality of the overall product. No such luck with Death Proof.The story  or lack thereof  concerns Stuntman Mike McKay Kurt Russell an old pro at both trashy action films and well made action films having cut his tough guy teeth on John Carpenter's beloved cult epic 'Escape From New York' and his 'death proof' car. A veteran stunt man and stone cold psychopath Mike has an obsession with using his car to kill people specifically beautiful but shallow vapid and above all else annoying obnoxious unlikable and unsympathetic women. The film revolves around his encounters with two sets of beautiful but  you guessed it  shallow vapid annoying obnoxious unlikable women. The first set of said women led by screen legend Sidney Poitier's actress daughter open the film by heading out to score weed possibly have some wild unprotected sex submit another to a potentially humiliating yet erotic lap dance and prepare for a lake house get away they have planned. They spend most of their time driving around and sitting in the bar talking or rather droning on and on about nothing with an uninspired blandness worthy of Uma Thurman's Bride in Kill Bill they encounter Stuntman Mike at the bar and well long story short after even more lackluster dialogue they get run over by Stuntman Mike who is hospitalized but lives to see and destroy another day while they die rather horribly.Cut to 14 months later we encounter yet another group of beautiful but unlikable and unsympathetic women including but not limited to Rosario Dawson Mary Elizabeth Winstead and real life stunt woman Zoe Bell playing herself  she doubled for Lucy Lawless on TV's Xena Warrior Princess and Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill films who happen to be working on a movie in the south. Guess what? They also spend most of their time droning on and on with the most uninspired and unengaging dialogue this side of the coast and they're just as annoying obnoxious and unlikable as the first group of women  if not more so they actually leave Winstead stranded with a Southern lunatic. Well while out for their aimless drive with Zoe performing a stunt on the roof of the car they cross paths with Stuntman Mike who decides to go after them for no better reason than the fact that they happen to be there and are making asses of themselves on the road. In the midst of this Mike gets shot and his tough guy persona falls apart and he is reduced to a cowering weakling the women then turn the tables and chase after him taunting him with possibly even more venom than he tossed at them and the film ends with the women basically beating Mike to death in the middle of the road.What can I say other than this film is overlong selfindulgent boring and lacking focus? Stuntman Mike was a potentially interesting antiherovillain and Kurt Russell fine actor that he is made the most of his role  for the few minutes he's on screen he's the only actor who seems to exhibit anything resembling a personality or feeling  but he is woefully underused and underdeveloped and reducing him to a whimpering fool at the end in an apparent attempt to parody the old alpha male tough guy image which Russell himself wore in earlier better films was far from endearing or even funny. As I stated before the women who appear in the film are among the most repulsive and disgusting characters I've ever seen. It doesn't matter if they're meant to embody girl power these women were simply not likable characters and their absurd dialogue probably meant to be funny due to its absurd content only adds insult to injury and the finale of the film where the 2nd group of women essentially clobber Mike to death only demonstrates that deep down these women were just as psychotic and despicable as Mike himself. And Zoe Bell who spends most of her screen time smirking is no actress a fine stunt performer yes but she's no actress. Even worse Death Proof lacks the reckless kinetic energy that defined Tarantino's other films making his obscenely bad dialogue and repugnant characters all the more unbearable. The car chases are fine but the film doesn't have enough going for it to justify its absurd running time and unpleasant atmosphere. It was inevitable that after all that praise Tarantino would make a mistake and this is probably it.";

	schema:headline " Tarantino's Bmovie a spectacular ride!";
	schema:reviewBody "It all started as an homage to old exploitation cinema and double feature screenings. It was meant to be one of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the year. Sadly after flopping in the US Grindhouse has been chopped in two with Quentin Tarantino's segment Death Proof being the first to be released on its own after competing at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not presented in its Grindhouse version which included scratches dirt missing reels and other visual aging techniques instead we get the full cut containing additional information regarding certain plot points and a few juicy bits that were left out first time around a hot lap dance being the best new scene. And while it certainly would be fun to see the entire doublebill in all its glory hopefully it will get a worldwide DVD release I must say I really enjoyed QT's half as a separate picture.As this is intended to be Tarantino's answer to '60s and '70s Bmovies the plot of Death Proof is extremely simple there is a psychopath named Stuntman Mike Kurt Russell who enjoys killing women with his car a virtually indestructible vehicle This car is 100 death proof. Only to get the benefit of it honey you REALLY need to be sitting in my seat!. Whenever he arrives in a new town he selects a group of girls and sets his perverse plan into motion. And unless he runs into someone who is as crazy or drives as well as him there is no way to stop him.Those expecting QT's usual stream of film references will be disappointed apart from a hilarious restaurant scene that sort of spoofs the opening of Reservoir Dogs and a couple of nods to similarly themed horror flicks and of course the casting of Russell which is a deliberate homage to John Carpenter the director is not interested in exposing his absolute knowledge of this kind of cinema. This time he delivers a straightforward genre movie albeit with his trademark tough women at the center. The trailer promised a wildly fun Bmovie and that's exactly what Death Proof is a movie like they don't make anymore oldfashioned ironyfree and exciting as hell.However this does not mean Tarantino has set his visual or verbal obsessions aside the dialogue is as imaginative and surreal as it has always been and there are enough shots of bare female feet to keep fans happy. Naturally being this a QT flick those feet belong to a quality cast the only real star in the film apart from the villain that is is Rosario Dawson but she is part of a talented ensemble which includes Vanessa Ferlito CSI NY Rose McGowan Scream and stuntwoman Zoe Bell who doubled for Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. The mention of honor though goes to Russell who finally has the opportunity to go all bad again and boy does he go bad even when he is pretending to be a friendly chap who offers you a ride home he exudes a sense of menace that doesn't leave until the end of the picture. Also worth praise are Michael Parks reprising his role of foulmouthed sheriff Earl McGraw of From Dusk till Dawn and Kill Bill fame and tying the two halves of the film together and Tarantino himself popping up as smug ridiculously likable bartender Warren. The latter is particularly charming because unlike other times From Dusk's Richie Gekko is a good example QT does not try to prove he can act although he pulled off a remarkable job in Alias. He's just there for the sheer fun like everyone else.Pure unadulterated fun and excitement that's the key to appreciating Death Proof. Do not expect a smart unusual take on an overused genre like the director has done in the past this time around he sticks to the rules delivering a loud silly sexy violent piece of Entertainment with a capital e. It may not be the best film of 2007 but it sure as hell is one of the most purely enjoyable.".

And this is not just a man's perspective!Secondly nothing actually happens in the film there is no real action save for one car crash 30 mins in then one car chase at the end. There's no attempt to tell a story or build character development or build any sort of suspense.Thirdly the artistic film making to make it look like a low budget grindhouse film fails because these films weren't made to look like that they just did because of the film that was used lack of budgetetc. This is not an homage to 70s grindhouse or exploitation films it makes a mockery of them. They were actually good this is not.Anyone who tries to cover the total crapness of this film with lines like if you don't 'get it' or like it its because you don't understand or get Tarantino. I would say thats is simply an excuse for a director producing really really poor films.My biggest concern is that a very good actor Kurt Russell may now find new work hard to come by as unfortunately he has the misfortune of having this awful film on his CVMy advice save your money if you've seen the trailer then thats you seen the film!!

	schema:reviewBody "This is an absolutely brilliant film and a film that I could watch over and over. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino this film seems to have divided audiences like no other it has been adored and despised in many quarters and there seems to be no middle ground for opinion. It is cited by Tarantino himself as being a remembrance to the B movies of the 60s and 70s through the guise of Grindhouse cinema. In order to fully appreciate what Tarantino has done then I would agree that you must be at least familiar on some level with the films of that genre and era and familiar with Grindhouse cinema and its workings. It is not an absolute necessity to be fully aware of this type of filmmaking but it helps if you want to completely appreciate this film. Grindhouse cinema was never revered in its day and many have questioned its reprisal. For an audience to require adequate knowledge of such a minnow in cinema history is regarded by many critics as asking too much and is adduced as being a major factor in its downfall. This is due to the belief that Tarantino has made a film for too niche a market and as a consequence it should be of no surprise that it flopped at the box office. This is something that I whole heartedly disagree with because to the contrary I believe that Tarantino has made his most selfish film to date he has made something that he wanted to... that no studio dictated... no executive planned and no audience asked for this film is 100 percent his and it just so happens that not that many people like it all great directors make films that fit into this category.A major critique of Death Proof has been that it contains a lot of dialogue but I feel that this should be expected as it is a remembrance to Grindhouse cinema and these types of movies are notorious for the amount of talk they can contain and the amount of build up they might have and Tarantino himself is recognised as being a writer that emphasises the dialogue in his films. Modern cinema goers are likely to not have the patience for such an offering and thus dismiss its significance and become agitated at a lack of action and this is evident from some of the reviews on this website.The film is about two separate sets of voluptuous women who are stalked by a stuntman called Mike that uses his death proof cars to execute the women. The essence of the story at the heart of Death Proof is that it's impeccably nostalgic as it insinuates to the very essence of cult it is a forged story because of its countless renditions and numerous retellings by the way of novels films and tales. Being familiar with such a story allows for an ease in understanding and following of narrative  a common attribute in cult films. The voluptuous women or female characters in the film are all so similar in appearance yet all so different in disposition because the film is essentially split into two parts we witness the floundering of one set of female characters and the resurgence in dominance of another. The female empowerment in Death Proof is symbolic to a desire for masculinity which is so wonderfully conveyed by their attempt in taming the car I shouldn't need to mention what the car is symbolic of. It's often perceived that in these films masculinity must be achieved in order to succeed which in itself is a direct reference to the inspired B movies of Russ Meyer.On a personal level I was happy to watch a film that accomplishes its stunt work without any CGI and relive many of the films I dismissed too eagerly in my youth. Being a homage the film is littered with references the most notable of which being the casting of Kurt Russell  a deliberate nod to the master of cult and horror John Carpenter the shirt worn by Jack Burton from Big Trouble In Little China is visible on the wall in the bar The Dodge Challenger driven by Stuntman Mike has the plate numbers OA5599 which correspond to the white Dodge Challenger from the heavily referenced film Vanishing Point. The film also contains lots of Tarantinoesquire moments from the copious amount of foot shots to reappearance of Sheriff Earl McGraw and there are some moments of pure Tarantino ingenuity i.e. the fourshot death scene the reversed hospital set the lap dance the shot of the car in the rain Stuntman Mikes nod to the third person and the wonderfully constructed soundtrack. Upon seeing Death Proof I immediately watched it again as I felt it deserved it. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly think Death Proof is one of the most underrated films at the time I'm writing this 2015. A lot of people on this board seem to complain about the dialogue or the delivery of some of the actors. I personally think this movie has a lot of punch with a strong car chase sequence very good actors wellwritten script....and a perfect soundtrack!I really like how the first part of the movie is a classic slasherhorror movie and the second part is a great throwback to car movies.Death Proof came out in 2007 and I remember watching this movie with my friend and having a really good time. I watched the movie another time a few years later and really enjoyed it to for other reasons especially the classic car chase sequence. Now it's 2015 I've just watched Death Proof for a third time and it's still a blast to watch. The music is perfect the movie is very funny and I love the performance from Kurt Russell Sydney Poitier Jungle Julia and all the other supporting characters.R.I.P. Sally Menke I really love her work on this movie...not only for the great grindhouse jump cuts but also for one of my favorite scene halfway through the movie that I won't mention and the awesome 11min well edited car chase.I gave the movie a strong 910 and I hope this movie will have a better reputation 510 years from now. Great work from Quentin Tarantino!".

I personally think this movie has a lot of punch with a strong car chase sequence very good actors wellwritten script....and a perfect soundtrack!I really like how the first part of the movie is a classic slasherhorror movie and the second part is a great throwback to car movies.Death Proof came out in 2007 and I remember watching this movie with my friend and having a really good time. I watched the movie another time a few years later and really enjoyed it to for other reasons especially the classic car chase sequence. Now it's 2015 I've just watched Death Proof for a third time and it's still a blast to watch. The music is perfect the movie is very funny and I love the performance from Kurt Russell Sydney Poitier Jungle Julia and all the other supporting characters.R.I.P. Sally Menke I really love her work on this movie...not only for the great grindhouse jump cuts but also for one of my favorite scene halfway through the movie that I won't mention and the awesome 11min well edited car chase.I gave the movie a strong 910 and I hope this movie will have a better reputation 510 years from now. Great work from Quentin Tarantino!";

An hour and a half or more time begins to lose its meaning when watching this rubbish and 95 of it is spent watching either group of 4 women having a laugh with each other. Basically this involves unrealistic swearing and dialogue which would have been slightly more believable had it been men saying the lines. There is a short break for a minute or two while the first group of women are killed. After another interminable fly on the wall peek at a further group dribbling on there is an attempt to kill them followed by them deciding to kill Kurt Russels character. This film is reminiscent of a 5 year old's first attempt inexplicably brought to life. Previously I would watch one of Tarantino's films without reading more into it. Now I would have to read some positive reviews. An hour and a half or so I will never get back.".

And oh how I wish I hadn't.Of course everyone is by now familiar with the Grindhouse story how Tarantino and best buddy Robert Rodriguez decided to assemble a couple of shoddylooking 'drivein' movies and put them out together in a double bill how said double bill failed to lure in audiences and how the films were then reedited for individual release in a desperate attempt to claw back some of their budget. The films may look cheap but they weren't. Now I've already seen Planet Terror Rodriguez's contribution to the double bill and I have to say that though it's no masterpiece it looks like Citizen bloody Kane compared to Tanantino's effort.I've long been known that Quentin longs to be black but from the evidence of Death Proof what he really longs to be is a black woman. How else are we to explain the seemingly endless succession of conversations that bookend the two car chases that are the only other element of this dismal excuse for a movie? A bunch of females sit around drinking smoking and talking and talking and talking. About nothing. Presumably we're supposed to find what they're saying hilarious but it's frankly an ageing white man's idea about what hip young women might have to say to each other and is consequently as convincing as the awkward supporting performances contributed by Mr Tarantino and his other best buddy Eli Roth creator of the Hostel tortureporn films and another 'filmmaker' currently wanted for crimes against viewers.Into this tedium wanders Stuntman Mike Kurt Russell a scarred psychopath who likes nothing better than killing young women in car wrecks. No explanation is given for this unsavoury hobby perhaps he simply finds their endless yapping as irritating as I did. At any rate he stalks four women then kills them in a headon collision. A couple of good ol' boy cops wander on to say that hot damn they can't do a Godamned thing about it because there's no proof that Mike did it on purpose and so he's let go and then he homes in on three other young women and they drink and smoke and talk for ages and thenLook I don't even know why I'm bothering to give you any plot details since it's virtually non existent and really all this pile of misogynistic crap exists for is to invite viewers to gloat as a series of attractive partiallyclothed females perform pole dances and then have their bodies torn to shreds in automobile accidents. Tarantino once possessed a smidgen of genuine talent but these days seems to revel in a pool of retarded sexuality that wouldn't disgrace a fourteen year old. And Quentin it may seem hilarious to you to pepper the film with smudges and scratches and awkward jump cuts but believe me no amount of it is going to hide the fact that this is witless sexist crap of the lowest order. See what would have been good is if you'd applied these techniques to a genuinely engaging story then you'd have had something entertaining and maybe just maybe audiences would have come to see your original double bill. But let's be honest it's a long time since Pulp Fiction the last genuinely good thing you were associated with and from what I've been hearing about your next project  Inglorious Bastards  my hopes are not high for any kind of progress in the near future.".

This is a film that illustrates our everyday idiosyncrasies and shows us both the real yet dark side of humanity and shows us that real life is far more exciting and intriguing than fantasy.The dialogue between characters was funny real and interesting. Bringing together a variety of different characters eg cheerleader successful celebrity ghetto girlie etc he illustrates the common traits of the human psychology that we all pretend don't exist. Most other films take us into unrealistic fantasy Tarantino knows reality is far more exciting! Kurt Russell surpassed himself. He's been absent for too long and his part in Death Proof leaves me wanting to see more from him. His acting was superb and I hope this film relights his career and we see more from him soon.I definitely saw touches of Pulp Fiction in this film but in a subtly different way.Cinematography was awesome and the use of weird and wonderful camera techniques made this film more than just interesting.When it comes to films I'm a tough critic I'm disappointed far more than I'm surprised so giving a 10 out of 10 for me is very unusual.This is a clever interesting and unusual film that will appeal to serious lovers of movies. Tarantino is both a movie scholar and genius. I bow before you Quentin and hope desperately to see more like this.Many thanks ... Shaun".

There's no violence except for some punching at the end and one car accident. There's no humor. There's nothing smart or charming about this movie. There's nothing interesting whatsoever happening in ANY scene in the movie! There's nothing to like about this film  I can't stress this enough! Basically this film is watching 3 people you hate having boring conversations for 40 minutes... then just when you think it's over because of about 5 minutes of scenes of a car wreck and a hospital visit 3 MORE people sit around and have boring conversations for another half an hour about nothing. Then just when you think something's going to happen a girl rides on a car for 20 minutes. She just rides on the front of a car. Then the girls punch a guy. The end. That's the entire film... does that really sound appealing to anyone? So to sum things up here's a film that isn't dramatic isn't funny isn't fun isn't likable from any angle ironic or not.

The sound quality is only good when we hear the roar of Mr Russell's car and those garbled scenes involving women clearly suffering from Tourette's syndrome.Did the concept of a plot get discarded along the way perhaps? There is no clue given as to why Mr Russell might get his kicks wanting to snuff the lives of so many women although I found them so boring and irritating that I would gladly have driven the car for him.If this is really the best that you can do for us I have a suggestion for you pop down to your local DVD rental shop and ask them if you can get a job.

The sound quality is only good when we hear the roar of Mr Russell's car and those garbled scenes involving women clearly suffering from Tourette's syndrome.Did the concept of a plot get discarded along the way perhaps? There is no clue given as to why Mr Russell might get his kicks wanting to snuff the lives of so many women although I found them so boring and irritating that I would gladly have driven the car for him.If this is really the best that you can do for us I have a suggestion for you pop down to your local DVD rental shop and ask them if you can get a job. It's where you started and where you deserve to end up after giving the world this abortion of a movie.";

	schema:headline " Quentin Tarantino at his Best and Worst";
	schema:reviewBody "Only a Tarantino film can give you the feeling of pure boredom and electric intensity all at the same time. Both can come of simple conversation and overthetop action. Death Proof is the quintessential Tarantino film where he has long drawn out conversations that are constantly interrupted yet free flowing and very natural as the characters talk about everyday things pop culture and use quirky old sayings. Tarantino is easily the greatest writer you could think of for pure dialogue and even though that's his greatest asset it's also his biggest flaw. The film is cut into two halves and the first half is excellent. The ending is great in both halves but man did that middle nearly put you to sleep or what?!?! It's not that it was incredibly boring material. The problem was This was two similar movies smashed into one with a ton of common parallels Stuntman Mike Kurt Russell being the main figure. The second half doubles back on the first half ultimately repeating itself. The women are powerful. They can control men because men are pigs and only think with their little heads as the women in charge tease them with their sexuality. Even though the girls aren't whores they surely push the limits because when they don't put out they'll get a guys respect a common theme with both the first half and the second coming from eight different women who all think the same. The standout female performance came from Vanessa Ferlito Arlene who brought a certain flare to the screen that made the viewer care for her more than anyone else. She nailed this performance and carried the first half along with Russell. The dialogue and there is a ton of it is as usual captivating at the start. Death Proof is a faller not a riser but the action packed ending is strong enough to give this fair remarks. This is a common issue with Tarantino. Kill Bill Vol. 2 may have had the longest most drawn out ending this side of The Good The Bad and The Ugly and the worst part is that we know exactly what's going to happen because like most Tarantino films the women usually come out on top. The first half of the film is flawless. The conversation is perfect. The mysteriousness of Stuntman Mike who has a thing for car crashes and testing the death proof slogan that goes along with his scary car is great and the best part is that we never know where the movie is going to end Or at least this story. Kurt Russell actually gave a very strong performance. His look was great and when he imitates John Wayne that should crack everyone up even if they don't know what John Wayne sounded like. The ending to the first half of the movie is great and the look of the picture is incredible as Tarantino pays homage to the 70s style look. You have random cutaways intentionally poor editing where the conversation will skip double back and some parts will completely cut away During a lap dance too at what feels like an inopportune time but that's what makes it so great. The texture and overall look is dazzling right from the very first shot of one of the girls feet rockin' away to a modernized Scorsese styled catchy beat on the dashboard against a light blue sky. Tarantino stylistically has a style all his own and this was great to see.The second half of the film brings in four more women that walk talk and act just like the four we seen in the first half. The film doubles back on itself and repeats the first half over again just with different girls. The conversations are the same all about sex but there's one difference these girls will fight back. That will bring us to a wonderful stunt worked high speed well choreographed and even better shot car chase that just doesn't want to end and I guess in a way that's okay. We deserve to indulge in a thrilling sequence for as long as it was after Tarantino toyed with our concentration and focus dulling us with repetitive banter. Zoe Bell the stunt women had too many speaking parts. She's not a good actress where the first group of girls were much much better and more engrossing. The last four girls weren't all that effective Maybe because we seen it all before just minutes earlier. The final sequence will leave you laughing not only because it's ridiculous but how long it lasts and the camera work along with Russell' face is very funny. Death Proof was for the most part an enjoyable film but this same old Tarantino song and dance is running on thin ice. Conversation as always in a Tarantino film is starting to take over more than ever for plot and the second half of Death Proof nearly ruins a nearly flawless first half. There's not much here in regards of plot and a lot of people are going to be getting sick of tired pointless goingnowhere talk. It's time Tarantino reinvents himself.".

No surprise that they chose the leaders they have if they like this kind of movies. Anyway I was told to expect an action movie with loads of chases good old cars and 70's style nothing intellectual but a good entertainment at least. Instead I got a two hour boredom torture with less than 15 minutes of real action scenes. I have nothing against movies with many dialogs on the contrary I like them when they are interesting well written and interpreted. However this horrid movie takes you inside a multiracial bunch of dirty ugly junkie and silly girls whose only goal is to get easy sex loads of drugs and more alcohol. It's an insult to Tarantino's adult audience to portrait such a teeny and stupid girlie characters. Perhaps he made it this way because he only expected this kind of people to watch his movie. Well we got two hours of brainless girlie talking and no more than 15 minutes of middling action because you know from the start that the second chase will end with the bad guy killed. I left the cinema with the feeling of being rippedoff and regretting myself by having let this movie to steal two hours of my life that would have been better even if I was dead. Had I gone alone I would had ran away before the first 10 minutes. And above all what a bad taste what a monstrous demonstration of teenage idiocy what a disgusting portrait of women... Is that all you can think about Quentin? Is there also a girl like those inside of you perhaps? You won't swindle me again I promise.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a pity that the critics gave 'Four Rooms' as hard a time as they did back in 1995 because for everything that can be said to be wrong with it it really does sparkle with creativity and a desire to stand out from the rest of the crowd. And let's face it there was enough popular talent involved including Alison Anders Alexandre Rockwell Robert Rodriguez and last but not least Quentin Tarantino for it to have been hailed as an instant cult classic. Instead it was bashed into submission and retreated very quickly to the back of nearly everyone's resume. With retrospect most of this reproach was probably illdeserved  'Four Rooms' does have its blatant moments of weakness but then again so do a lot of the more halfbaked cookiecutter comedies which have somehow garnered more admiration than this. On the whole it's a very unusual and interesting combination  an offbeat frisky and strangely feelgood comedy with some sinister undertones and lots of weird intricate little details. Consisting of four 20minute segments each assembled by a different director's hands it takes us through the various happenings inside separate rooms of the same hotel on New Year's Eve as experienced by Ted the only bellhop still left standing for the night shift. There is the slight feeling of inconsistency in moving from one directing style to the next and a couple of attempts to interconnect the segments are a little selfcontradictory. Some of it works and some it doesn't but the end result is an episodic anthology that if nothing too spectacular still proves itself to be very likable in the long run.'The Missing Ingredient' and 'the Wrong Man' are often credited with constituting the weaker half of the film and I can't really say I disagree. 'The Missing Ingredient' tries hard to be risqu but falls pretty short  for a story concerning a coven of barebreasted witches trying to extract an unwilling man's semen for use in a ritual it's remarkably innocuous and fluffy and the visual effects only add a layer of tackiness to boot. 'The Wrong Man' is a tad more snappy and sports some stylish direction the shot where Sigfried grabs the ringing telephone is righton but is ultimately swallowed up in its frenzied editing. We can vaguely understand what's happening in this segment if not then Ted does drop a pretty big hint later on in the film but it makes itself unnecessarily incoherent with bizarre imagery that adds nothing but extra confusion the baby flashback anyone?. It's almost as though Alexandre Rockwell isn't sure whether he wants us to be in on the whole setup with Sigfried and Angela or confused and in the dark like Ted and in the end tries to accommodate both perspectives which doesn't really wash.It's once we reach the second half that the true quality really starts to seep its way in and the film suddenly becomes very rewarding. 'The Misbehaviours' is a spirited little contribution that combines a moderate dose of macabre darkness with its cartoonlike innocence. Antonio Banderas certainly hits a good spot as the nononsense father who appoints Ted to keep an eye on his two young children while he's out whilst the children themselves are rebellious but not irritating all making for a surprisingly sharp and sophisticated slice of knockabout. 'The Man from Hollywood' meanwhile is equally brilliant  Tarantino's vibrant wellscripted take on Roald Dahl's chilling short story 'the Man from the South' which pits Ted in the same room as cocky Hollywood director Chester Rush and it's always a treat to see Quentin himself tackle such a winking selfdepreciating role. It manages to be tense and enjoyable with the usual smart direction that any Tarantino fan should be able to appreciate. Overall there's enough vitality in these particular segments to just about redeem the shakiness of the first half.Besides we have Tim Roth playing our hapless protagonist throughout and yes that is a lot. He proves himself to be very capable in a comic performance bringing enough gentle magnetism to his character Ted the bellhop through his good intentions perseverance and various neurotic mannerisms to get us genuinely attached to him. It is hard not to come away with the impression that all four directors had a slightly different take on Ted's disposition  he goes from being timid and impressionable to obtuse and jumpy then highlystrung and a little devious and finally composed and relatively rational  but Roth does well in singlehandedly bridging these gaps and with the many mishaps his character has to endure over the course of the night ensures that all changes in temper seem understandable. He retains his goodnatured lovability for the entire running time and for anyone who can really relate to poor Ted like yours truly he'll have you rooting for him to the very satisfying end.To my knowledge there was never any other film quite like 'Four Rooms' and judging by just how unwelcome this one was made to feel when it arrived there probably won't be another for quite some time. It remains an ambitious and not entirely successful little sleeper but has a good deal going for it nonetheless and I urge all fans of Tarantino Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet.".

Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed Love American Style on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made Pulp Fiction and worked on Dusk Till Dawn with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four storiesThe Missing Ingredient  Madona has simply never looked better and her come get me dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.The Wrong Man  Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing In the Soup so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted's sex organ is a cinema classic.The Misbehavers  Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.The Man From Hollywood  This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the tasty beverage line from Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense before the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.The best bit in the whole film might be Roth's phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose postNew Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her My Cousin Vinnie expert witness routine this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious but totally stoned inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's impossible to analyze this film without breaking it down into its four segments for separate comment.  It would also be improper since it was not intended to be anything less than an anthology from four notable independent filmmakers  Alexandre Rockwell Alison Anders Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.The first episode is exactly the sort of thing that someone in a high school drama production would want to do but can't get away with in a high school drama production.  It's juvenile unfunny and lifeless but it has the pointless nudity and lines of dialogue likeWitch 1  I am your mother.Witch 2  Then why are we sleeping together?that sound like the screenwriter is giggling and thinking I can't believe I'm getting away with this!  I'm so clever!Nothing is at stake in the first episode  it's generally expected that a story must have conflict in order to BE a story.  This has none.  Just some halfbaked jokes and a pair of topless women If I wanted that I'd skip renting a movie and go out instead.Second episode is a hair better but you'll find yourself crying Why doesn't Ted the Bellboy do insert plot resolution here and get the bloody hell out of there!  When it finally does end you're disheartened to find that it had no reason to exist.  Two snips with a pair of scissors  a bit of tape and we wouldn't know the difference.  Roll opening credits go straight to the Rodriguez segment.Third episode has some structural support to keep it from caving in on itself.  The surprise in the middle I won't give it away don't worry is horrifying enough to give the segment some heft.  Rodriguez and his d.p. Guillermo Navarro move it along dexterously and as usual have a good handle on visual comedy.The last segment is the best.  I think it's safe to say that Quentin Tarantino has officially never disappointed me as a director or screenwriter.  My heart leapt as soon as I heard his trademark dialogue coming from the lips of Marisa Tomei as Four Rooms segued from The Misbehavers to The Man From Hollywood.  I wasn't sure if his take on Ted the Bellhop's misadventures was going to be any good but I knew that if he wrote it and helmed it it wasn't going to be all bad.What a pleasant surprise still just talking about the fourth segment here. This part of the movie with its ridiculous premise lifted form an old Hitchcock episode which it acknowledges out loud moves along speedily and the actors take to it as naturally as any other movies by Q.T. Basically playing himself Tarantino is hilarious.  If anything he knows A how people really act when they're drunk i.e. not like Dudley Moore caricatures  B why people think he's so obnoxious like a reallife fasttalking Jar Jar Binks and  C how to put some bang in his visual storytelling.  It's lowrent Tarantino don't get me wrong but it's also the best part of Four Rooms.All in all the first film I've ever seen that starts out with a loathsome horrifying badness gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes and ends as good as one would like.  Just don't make me watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "An anthology film is often an interesting watch. Seeing as how multiple directors come together to create a project if often gets people curious as to how each director's individual style meshes with the others and what the finished film is like because of that. Sadly most of the time anthology films fail miserably as the styles of each director are too different from one another to truly gel meaning that while there may be standout parts here and there they often don't work as complete films. Four Rooms unfortunately is one of the prime examples of this. While nowhere near as bad its initial hostile critical reaction would have you believe the film is still very problematic.The story is that Ted the Bellhop is asked to look after a hotel during New Year's Eve and while there has to deal with multiple situations including a convent of witches a hostage situation involving an angry husband babysitting for a gangster's children  a bunch of drunken Hollywood stars and directors having a very dangerous bet. That is the basic story of the film with four segments in the film directed by a different person for each. Connecting these stories is Ted the Bellhop who is one of the film's major problems. Tim Roth delivers one of his worst performances to date as Ted hamming it up every chance he gets and gets annoying rather quickly. While the film is a comedy it isn't as wacky or as farcical as Roth plays it lacking the restraint and subtly that all the other actors have which clearly shows that he wasn't well directed acting like something out of Fawlty Towers and considering the seriousness of some scenes feels widely out of place. All of this makes Ted not only not funny but very annoying and hard to care for and you'll wish for him to go away as soon as possible.Each story varies in quality although none of them are better than decent. The first one is The Missing Ingredient directed by Allison Anders whereby Ted has to have sex with a witch in order to create the ingredient needed in order to reverse the spell put on the coven's goddess Diana 40 years prior. It's about as ridiculous as it sounds. While it may appeal to some arthouse fans it is very corny silly and cheesy. It is watchable though acted well enough Roth being the exception and has a quirky charm to it that keeps you entertained throughout.The second segment is The Wrong Man directed by Alexandre Rockwell and is honestly the worst segment of this film by a country mile. I'll go as far as to say it is one of the worst things ever put on a cinema screen. It consists of Roth going into the wrong room for delivery service and encounters an angry husband with a gun and believes Ted to be the one who slept with his wife. Everyone acts way overthetop in a noncomedic scenario making the piece tonally confused has multiple plot holes Why does the angry husband go into the bathroom during a hostage situation giving Ted the perfect opportunity to free his wife or call the police? Why doesn't Ted take advantage of this either or after he leaves for that matter? Why does the wife mock and taunt her angry gunwielding husband? and has some forced ambiguity about the husband's homosexuality that is never explored. It is frankly unwatchable and considering that Rockwell was the one who had the idea for the film in the first place leads me to believe that he made a terrible film knew it and dragged in the other directors to make other segments to hope noone would notice it. Sadly they did and it is no wonder that Rockwell hasn't worked much since the film came out.The other two are the closet thing this film gets to decent. The Misbehavers directed by Robert Rodriguez is about Ted looking after some gangster's kids with the instruction of not letting them misbehave. They do and what follows maybe a onejoke skit but it is quite funny and the child actors are very good Roth is thankfully restrained. It's unpleasantness towards the end a dead hooker being found for example may stop it from becoming great but this is the best segment and it's punchline is priceless.The final segment is The Man from Hollywood directed by Quentin Tarantino whereby Ted goes to a room of famous Hollywood actors and directors playing a drunken bet to chop off someone's finger for a 1000 and Ted gets involved in the process. While funny and well acted this is the most pointless segment in the film as it builds up to the bet and then just ends very aburptly as if nothing happened. Yeah no negative psychological side effects can come from chopping off from someone's finger. Makes sense to me.Overall this is just a failed experiment whose segments are widely uneven in terms of quality the film is really smug at points and the thing connecting them together is really irritating and hard to care for. All of this combined makes this film something which while OK and not as bad as the critics at time would have you believe isn't very good and it's no wonder why everyone involved has been actively trying to forget it ever happened. Sadly it does and stands as a strong example as to why anthology film often don't work as despite the talent behind camera you often get overcooked messes like this. For curiosity's sake only.".

They do and what follows maybe a onejoke skit but it is quite funny and the child actors are very good Roth is thankfully restrained. It's unpleasantness towards the end a dead hooker being found for example may stop it from becoming great but this is the best segment and it's punchline is priceless.The final segment is The Man from Hollywood directed by Quentin Tarantino whereby Ted goes to a room of famous Hollywood actors and directors playing a drunken bet to chop off someone's finger for a 1000 and Ted gets involved in the process. While funny and well acted this is the most pointless segment in the film as it builds up to the bet and then just ends very aburptly as if nothing happened. Yeah no negative psychological side effects can come from chopping off from someone's finger. Makes sense to me.Overall this is just a failed experiment whose segments are widely uneven in terms of quality the film is really smug at points and the thing connecting them together is really irritating and hard to care for. All of this combined makes this film something which while OK and not as bad as the critics at time would have you believe isn't very good and it's no wonder why everyone involved has been actively trying to forget it ever happened. Sadly it does and stands as a strong example as to why anthology film often don't work as despite the talent behind camera you often get overcooked messes like this. For curiosity's sake only.";

	schema:reviewBody "Four Rooms was concocted like one of those many many collaborative efforts from directors in the 60's and 70's i.e. The Witches Ro.Go.PaG Boccaccio '70 etc except this would revolve around a bellhop on New Years Eve. It disqualifies itself as being any kind of masterpiece or classic in independent filmmaking and sometimes the filmmakers Alison Anders Robert Rodriguez and Alexandre Rockwell and Quentin Tarantino the last two also serving as executive producer look like they're relishing too much in their limited clout and exuberance to concentrate. As was with many others who viewed the film I found that the first two segments were the lesser ones and the last two were the best ones. It all comes down in this case to which two were funnier. So let's break each one downAllison Anders' film is a quirky quasilesbian take on a coven of witches featuring the likes of Madonna and Lily Taylor are the first to shake up perhaps for the better in this one Ted the bellhop. Ted by the way is played with a continuous nervoustype of fervor that goes from being innocuous to annoying and then acceptable again. It's also interesting to see how his character goes through different motions when under each director for example in Rodriguez's film he's more of a cartoontype of character and in Tarantino's film he hearkens slightly to his previous collaborations with the director quieter on edge in a particular way. Some of the laughs are surrounded by a kind of attitude put forth by the director that seems a little off. Maybe I'm the wrong audience for it though the women in the audience may appreciate it or rather amused by it more than I. I give it a BAlexandre Rockwell's The Wrong Man is my least favorite of the bunch as Ted gets stuck with a couple of crazed fetishists David Proval and Jennifer Beals. The problem here lies with two things the fact that the comedic timingchemistry is a little iffyoff with the three actors and that the writing doesn't come off like it's naturally funny. When Beals' character Angela runs off about Ted's private parts this could be funny but it's more 'hoho' than 'haha' to me. Some of the tension from Roth brings some laughs but not enough to compensate the uncomfortable atmosphere around the whole segment. I give it a CThe third segment The Misbehaviors displays how clever and quick Rodriguez can be with physical comedy slapstick as well as in getting laughs from kids as he did here and there in his Spy Kids movies. It is also a boost that the whole segment comes off as though it's like a liveaction Looney Tunes short it's so ridiculous that in some scenes I burst out laughing i.e. Ted's reaction to the corpse. The setup with the parents was also amusing in how Banderas and Tamlyn Tomita act towards the kids. Then the payoff knocks it out of the park. Grade AThen we come to the closure featuring the indie wunderkind at the time Tarantino as he takes on two sources of inspiration Rohald Dahl's Man from the South short story later translated through Alfred Hitchcock's television show. It's a smart hip little piece of Hollywood satire from Tarantino as he himself plays an overly obnoxious Hollywood filmmaker with two guys by his side Paul Calderon and Bruce Willis as they take a gamble right after the stroke of midnight. It took me a couple of time to watch this to really get into it but when I did it was even more promising. The camerawork in the scene via 'Dogs' and 'Pulp' cinematographer Andrzej Sekula is deliberately paced and it's perfectly leisurely for the pace of the last segment. That much if not all of the dialog is funny it's because of the skill and chemistry between the four of them. Plus a little prologue with Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin gives the indication of what insanity is in store. Grade A.So is this film a success? For it's time I'm not sure. With the power of four million off the success of each director's previous efforts Tarantino with 'Dogs' Rodriguez with El Mariachi Anders with Gas Food and Lodging and Rockwell with In the Soup all from the 92 Sundance place they did whatever they wanted and it's not the success it could've been. On the other hand when one looks at the films in perspective it could've been a lot worse and it wasn't. At the least it works as one of the quintessential party movies for fans of the 90's newwave crop.".

But what I found in it was a bizarre little comedy that wasn't so bad after all.Four Rooms is an anthology film with four 'episodes' about a fading hotel on News Years Eve and with a quirky bellhop named Ted Tim Roth and his misadventures on this one crazy night. The first episode entitled The Missing Ingredient is about a group of witches staying in the hotel who need some sperm in order to complete a spell. And guess who knocks on the door...Ted the bellhop! The next episode The Wrong Man is a shorter episode about Ted getting mistaken for another man. This is certainly the strangest of the episodes. Then next comes the hilarious The Misbehavers. Ted is asked to babysit two kids of a Mexican gangster Antonio Banderas in a parody of himself and how everything possible can go wrong. And the final episode The Man From Hollywood the best is directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is about a cocky Hollywood newcomer Tarantino also in a parody of himself who rents out the Penthouse for New Years Eve and then plays a dangerous game that ends the film in a very funny way.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this film.

Tim Roth is to carry this film and he really does get on your nerves and even though he acts absurdly over the top off the wall in a totally unrealistic well he's not the only one character it's what the role calls for and in that context he succeeds brilliantly. Watching him lose it was the strongest moments. It's New Years Eve and being the new bell boy like the Gekko Brothers at The Titty Twister Ted don't call him Theodore Roth he's got one hell of a night ahead of him. Lets start with the covern not oven of witches where we get to see Ione's Skye's slightly pathetic boobs. A ceremony of bologne is in in the waiting. This is the weakest one of the four stories. Things get weirder and much more intense as we move onto the lover's quarrel where poor Ted as just having pashed Ione Skye hits more serious waters unwittingly getting in the middle of this mad couple problems of infidelity where the husband holds Teddy at gunpoint. Finally surviving these two nutjobs where we do have a second serve from one of them the less threatening later on we move onto The Misbehavers which provide a bizarre and stylishly different scenario I liked where finally we come to the main story we've all been waiting for about a director played by.... have a guess? and his entourage who really set a good example of what stupid things people do when they're drunk minus a pinkie. Tarantino really steals the moments here acting not like an actor but a director acting like a director with a lot of CU shots where his presence holds are complete attention. He's eloquent and his body language is fantastic. I just love watching him trying to act but he's just being him comparing movie's what not. He shows up the other writers with his input of dialogue though of course more suited behind a camera despite his awesome confidence in front of it. Yes that was the worst club sandwich I've ever seen too. Four Rooms is certainly different with same truly impressive performances which I will note because they deserve credit beside Roth who's wonderful of course. Refer by Surname Skye Proval Beals especially Wills especially Banderas Tomei. If a QT fan don't pass it off. It's animation in the opening credits is a killer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Please note Although it is not written in full story some paragraphs may contain plot information that could be a spoiler.Four Rooms is a 1995 anthology comedy film that follows Ted the Bellhop the lone working employee as he works New Years Eve at the Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles interacting with several guests on four different rooms. The film contains four different segments which are the rooms he visits. Each room is written and directed by a different filmmaker.Segment 1 The Honeymoon Suite  The Missing Ingredient Written and directed by Allison AndersTed assists several unusual women with their luggage up to the Honeymoon suite. He soon discovers that they are a coven of witches trying to reverse a spell that was placed on their goddess 40 years earlier. However when they learn one of them is missing an ingredient needed to complete the spell they convince Ted to help her out in retrieving the missing ingredient.Room Review This is the weakest of the rooms. Although very well conceived and directed it doesn't have that feeling the rest of the rooms do.710Segment 2 Room 404  The Wrong Man Written and directed by Alexandre RockwellAfter a confusing phone call from a party in a room and unsure of which floor it's on Ted arrives to room 404 where he finds himself in the middle of a fantasy hostage situation between a husband and wife. At gunpoint Ted is forced to participate in the scenario with uncertainty of what is real and what is part of the fantasy.Room Review Of the four segments this is the second best one. The entire concept story directing acting and comedy is stellar and all around shows how a great story can be told in a short time.910Segment 3 Room 309  The Misbehavers Written and directed by Robert RodriguezA husband and wife pay Ted to babysit their son and daughter as they go out to a New Years party. The very stern father demands his children to not misbehave and Ted to make sure they are well taken care of. Ted alone in the hotel cannot stay in the room so he orders them to stay in the room and watch TV. After Ted leaves the children begin to explore and vandalize the room. After Ted arrives back after a few more times the events of The Wrong Man take place during this room the room is in total and complete chaos which ends in a hilarious tone as the man and wife return.Room Review The best of the rooms. Rodriguez cleverly put much thought and effort into this room using all of the actors skills especially Tim Roth and made the entire film worth it.1010Segment 4 The Penthouse  The Man from Hollywood Written and directed by Quentin TarantinoAfter a famous director request several items Ted brings them to the room and is soon acquainted with the party. Ted is asked to take part in a challenge that comes directly put of an episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents'. Ted. Initially declines but is offered a guarantee 100 just to listen to the request and an additional 1000 if he accepts.Room Review The third best or second worst depending on how you think of it. The room of course has the Tarantino formula of characters that never stop talking. Of course the concept is nowhere near as original or as far fetched as the others but is still a very stellar segment. They even mention the very episode of 'Hitchcock' they use in the conversation. The ending is perfect however for Ted to end his otherwise very odd and terrible night.810".

	onyx:emotionText "Please note Although it is not written in full story some paragraphs may contain plot information that could be a spoiler.Four Rooms is a 1995 anthology comedy film that follows Ted the Bellhop the lone working employee as he works New Years Eve at the Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles interacting with several guests on four different rooms. The film contains four different segments which are the rooms he visits. Each room is written and directed by a different filmmaker.Segment 1 The Honeymoon Suite  The Missing Ingredient Written and directed by Allison AndersTed assists several unusual women with their luggage up to the Honeymoon suite. He soon discovers that they are a coven of witches trying to reverse a spell that was placed on their goddess 40 years earlier. However when they learn one of them is missing an ingredient needed to complete the spell they convince Ted to help her out in retrieving the missing ingredient.Room Review This is the weakest of the rooms. Although very well conceived and directed it doesn't have that feeling the rest of the rooms do.710Segment 2 Room 404  The Wrong Man Written and directed by Alexandre RockwellAfter a confusing phone call from a party in a room and unsure of which floor it's on Ted arrives to room 404 where he finds himself in the middle of a fantasy hostage situation between a husband and wife. At gunpoint Ted is forced to participate in the scenario with uncertainty of what is real and what is part of the fantasy.Room Review Of the four segments this is the second best one.

	schema:reviewBody "Short story anthologies can often suffer from being only as strong as their weakest link. This fact almost destroys Four Rooms an anthology seemingly organized by Tarantino picking some of his favourite upandcomers of his generation at the time. Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell has since faded into obscurity but two of the directors on the bill El Mariachi's Robert Rodriguez and the man himself Quentin Tarantino are now two of my personal favourite working directors. Four Rooms has too many weaknesses to fully recommend but the final two segments almost fully redeem it.The stories are mostly unconnected save the presence of Tim Roth's Ted the bellhop character. As such each segment should be reviewed individually.The movie opens with Anders' The Missing Ingredient. A coven of witches convene in the honeymoon suite with a cauldron and nudity at their disposal attempting to revive a fallen comrade. When one of them fails to obtain their sacrifice of semen she must get it from the only man in sight...the bellhop.This segment is by all means godawful. The only good thing I can even say about it is that it makes the next one look good in comparison. Ione Sky as the main witch has that girlnextdoor look to her essential to her role and is perhaps the only good thing about the segment. Madonna has a nothing role with an annoying goth daughter who seems like she should have had a more important role but is instead throwaway. Of the other witches only Lili Taylor is memorable in any way. The effects used are right out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and don't fit at all with the rest of the film. If you ignore this segment the movie is likely all the better for it.Rockwell's piece The Wrong Man has a very interesting setup but fails to be consistent. Ted is given the wrong room number to deliver ice to and ends up in the hands a guntoting jealous husband an excellent David Proval who has his wife gagged up and is smoking out the man named Theodore she's been sleeping with.The segment definitely has its moments such as Ted yelling for help out of a bathroom window or Proval's gunwaving antics but it digresses a little too much. A heart attack twist at the end is a major groaner and Tim Roth hams it up far too much in his role here. The music is also quite horribly used. Not nearly as bad as the first part but The Wrong Man doesn't add much to the movie.The saving grace comes in Rodriguez's The Misbehavers the direct precursor to Spy Kids. A smooth Spanish thug a hilarious Antonio Banderas wishes to attend a party with his wife and pays Ted 500 to keep an eye on his children and make sure they don't misbehave. Through VapoRub and dead bodies of all things Ted has his work cut out for him.The Misbehavers is actually the high point of the entire film. The ending is simply hilarious the setup is very well detailed. And unlike the cleaner Spy Kids movies its pretty damn dark. Banderas is absolutely excellent as are the children.This leads to the final story Tarantino's The Man from Hollywood. Fed up with the crazy night Ted calls his boss and complains that he's quitting. A call comes in from the penthouse and he is convinced by her that he must fill their request as an important customer from Hollywood is staying there. Ted caves and finds himself in the middle of one of the most eccentric bets straight out of Hitchcock.While not as memorable as The Misbehavors Tarantino's bit is very entertaining. It has that traditional Tarantino swagger. Tarantino himself plays the man from Hollywood making the dialogue a little more annoying but at the same time all the more stylish. Marisa Tomei is excellent in her short role. And Bruce Willis has a cameo. Whats not the love? The ending is simply amazing as well.The only thing left to address is Tim Roth the most uneven part of the whole picture. As the only character in all stories being under four different directors must be difficult to maintain consistency. As such Tim Roth gives us two horrible performances The Missing Ingredient and The Wrong Man one brilliant one The Misbehavors and one very strong one Man from Hollywood. While his 50ssitcom performance in Missing Ingredient fits in with the general badness of that segment his performance is arguably the worst part of The Wrong Man. His timing in The Misbehavors is the stuff of legend as is his role at the end of Man from Hollywood.If you switch on halfway through Four Rooms is a delightful little hodgepodge movie. Its a shame two poor segments distract from that. For simplicity here's all four rated individuallyThe Missing Ingredient 10 The Wrong Man 30 The Misbehavors 90 The Man from Hollywood 85At least you leave it feeling good despite sitting through some drudge at first.".

Antonio Banderas is surprisingly good and the whole segment has a great way of piling on the complications to create a chaotic ending.The fourth segment will make you puke watching Tarantino thinking he can act. the worst thing about that is that he's also the director so he gives himself plenty of screen time. Notice during his monologue to Tim Roth the camera never once leaves his face! Obviously he's got rather a high opinion of his execrable acting abilities. Lucky for him he's a director otherwise he'd never appear on film. Oh how I wish it were so.Then there's the plot. Stolen from a Hitchcock story which was stolen from a Roald Dahl story. They do acknowledge the Hitchcock thing but it's merely a notsoclever ploy to try and disguise the fact that he didn't even come up with a story but used some previously reheated leftovers from 30 years ago. There are no twists whatsoever on the Hitchcock theme that Tarantino describes. So bad enough you have to endure his acting but you don't even get a good tale out of it.So all in all a terrible film. Fast forward to the third story and you can safely skip the rest.".

This movie stunk so bad I can still smell it even after I returned it to the video store. This movie just didn't do anything. It was boring and flat from start to finish. Please do not rent this movie. Spend your money on some gum or a coke. You'll definitely be spending your money on something more meaningful.".

It is difficult to get into but once the viewer gets into it it is a funny disturbing and unique film. The plot is basically of a bellboyplayed by the always good Tim Roth who has to take care of a hotel for the night on New Years Eve. He gets involved in some strange and offcolor characters and slowly is driven insane by it all. There are four stories total. he first one is about a coven of witches who must find semen for their magic potion to resurrect a model. The second is about a suspicious husband who ties his wife up and holds a gun to the bellboy's face because he thinks she is cheating on him with the bellboy only the bellboy soon discovers that this is just a weird trick. The third storyand by for the goriest is about a rich man and his wife leaving his children alone at the hotel with the bellboy to babysit. And the forth is about a macabre bet involving a bunch of Hollywood yuppies a car a lighter and removal of body parts.The first story is really only for certain audiences. I didn't dig it but I could see why certain people may. The jokes about sex and possible incest were tiresome the witches were stereotypes and were poor ones and the camera angles were terrible never allowing the audience to really get into the story. The reason why is because it is shown at a flyonthewall distance and for a plot involving witches it helps to know what they are up to in a closer way. Normally this cinematic approach would work well most noticeably the brilliant Peter Greenway film THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER which the movie strongly reminded me of for some reason and Tim Roth was also in it.The second story was very perverse but didn't offer any way to involve the viewer in actually finding it interesting which it should have been. There is a sequence in which Tim Roth is put to inane stuntwork where he must get himself back into the apartment even though he is falling out of it through the window. The stunt seems misguided and out of place in the drama of this story. The ideas are good but the execution didn't quite work. Some pretty strange intensity by Jennifer Beals here.The film takes a large jump forward into sharp comedy and independent ideas. The tone was meanspirited and wicked. The children were appropriately mischievous and the fatherAntonio Banderes was nuts. The camera work was involving and the comedic notes were hit correctly. The story worked and the viewer will have it stuck in their minds for days if they can't make it to the next story.The best of the four is the last one with quick and sensible dialog an inspired plot appropriate acting and an offkilter ending that is shocking brutal and brilliant.Rated R for pervasive strong language sexuality and some drug use.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent film... Looking at the credits the usual gang are all listed Tarantino Rodriguez Bender Banderas Roth....As the name might suggest after a brief intro the film is split into four stories each in a different room. The stories act independently of each other although if you watchlisten carefully you should be able to spot how they interlink for instance a background phone call made during the misbehaver's. The character who moves between all the stories is played by Tim Roth The Bellhop. Roth is working on New years eve in the hotel as the bellhop. Throughout the night for one reason or another Roth is called into each of the four rooms and so each story begins. If you are a fan of films which usually involve Tarantino Rodriguez and Bender or if you just like to see something refreshing and different once in a while then you will like this. If on the other hand you need great special effects and actors who can't act then you probably won't enjoy 'Four Rooms'The dialogue is pretty intelligent and the acting is excellent although perhaps not to everyone's taste. Tim Roths character seems to be a bit of a tribute to The Bell Boy which is mentioned in the film in true Tarantino style who usually references other films in his own. Tim Roth is bang on as the Bellhop and I couldn't think of anyone better to play the role.The hardest part for me was deciding which story I liked the best. The first was light hearted and hilarious. Admittedly I didn't enjoy the second story as much it was a little slow. The style reminded me of the cut scene from Pulp Fiction with Esmeralda and Butch after the fight  it was interesting good but slowed the whole film down. The third story was much more attention grabbing and constantly had me cringing waiting for the worst to happen. The final story was witty pretty fast moving and when the purpose of Tarantino's bet is revealed you find yourself moving closer to the edge of your seat until the credits role.Favourite bits The cheeky dialogue in the first story The missing ingredient Roth telling the misbehaver's how his baby sitter used to make sure he stayed in bed with his eyes closed. Tarantino's bet and the final conclusion!".

	schema:reviewBody "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SEXUAL CONTENT WHICH MAY BE DISTRESSING TO SOME READERS.'Marquis' is the only film I've ever seen by the oddlynamed Henri Xhonneux but it's so imaginative and entertaining that I'm eager to see more of his work. 'Marquis' alleges to be based on incidents in the life and novels of the Marquis de Sade. If you're seeking a Cliff Notes cribsheet about de Sade or his works look elsewhere. On its own merits though this film is highly enjoyable for those with a taste for the bizarre.Some of the activities of the reallife Marquis de Sade were downright contemptible but I intensely admire the tremendous efforts he took to write down his prose in prison where he was forbidden to possess paper or writing implements and to smuggle his text out of prison for publication. I was intrigued to learn that the Marquis was a prisoner in the Bastille until only a few days before it was captured by the revolutionaries in 1789 it now appears that de Sade actively fomented the riot of Bastille Day shouting to the people outside that there were weapons and allies within the prison.IMDb lists 'Marquis' as an animated film but that's only partly accurate. The animation occurs chiefly in the sequences in which the Marquis de Sade has long hearttoheart talks with his own penis! The penis has a small human face upturned oddly and a voice and personality of its own.All the characters in this film are anthropomorphised animals walking upright and played by human dancers in elaborate costumes and masks. I thought these were even more impressive than the ones used in the Beatrix Potter ballet film. Thus for example de Sade's Justine is a white mare dressed in a dominatrix costume which displays her very shapely human figure! Juliette is a cow only slightly less pulchritudinous than Justine. The characters' dialogue is postdubbed by voice artists and the credits generously list both the performers who embody the characters and the voice artists on the soundtrack.The filmmakers cleverly match the personalities of the various characters to appropriate animal species. Still I was pulled up short by one scene in a coffeehouse. More than a dozen species of landbased animals are interacting and then into the room walks a fish! Somehow it felt wrong to see an aquatic species among the land beasties. Thankfully all of the voice artists speak normally rather than trying to moo or whinny their dialogue.The Marquis spends most of the film in prison where he is harangued by his warder a rat who is obsessed with being buggered by the Marquis. He is apparently unaware that the Marquis's penis has its own thoughts on this matter. I found the rat character implausible as a warder unlike his inmates he can go home at night and find sexual release outside the prison.There's lots of hearty comedy here not all of it sexual ... but the sexual content is deeply aberrant throughout the film so 'Marquis' is not for all audiences. The animal costumes are so intensely detailed that there's an atmosphere of bestiality throughout this sexuallycharged comedy. I'll rate 'Marquis' 9 out of 10.".

Let the kids watch The Lion King for the umpteenth time then lock the door and watch this for yourself. Just remember that a film like this would NEVER be made in the USA. You'll have to hunt for this one so don't bother looking for it in your local Blockbuster.Sidenote The designer of the costumes is a puppeteer for a French children's TV show along the lines of Sesame Street and it caused a brief sensation when the film was first released.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's plenty of films about the Marquis de Sade their purpose and effectiveness being rather varied but this one stands out from them all due to it's style and execution...both of which are extremely weird to say the least. The film grabs you right from the start with the bizarre character costumes but unfortunately doesn't manage to keep the interest throughout despite a number of very good and amusing ideas. I really do admire what director Henri Xhonneux was trying to do but unfortunately the otherworldly style of the film and general artiness leaves it feeling cold and distant long before the end. The film focuses on the Marquis de Sade during his imprisonment in the Bastille. His only desire is to write erotic novels but there's debauchery going on all around him. A corrupt priest arranges for a woman who was impregnated by the king to be raped by the Marquis de Sade so as to excuse the king while also stealing the Marquis' literary works to sell for his own profit.The costumes used in the film are interesting to say the least and are all a cross between humans and some sort of animal. This gives the film a style all of its own which is very much to its credit. This does however leave the story and characters as costars as while the audience is likely to be fascinated by the costumes the plot is not nearly as interesting which is unfortunate. I've also got to say that the style didn't really work for me  it's interesting but inherently ugly me being a viewer who enjoys visually pleasing aesthetics. The most interesting and original idea in the film has to be the one that sees the lead character talking to his penis which happens to have it's own face and personality. It works rather well and helps to increase the overall strangeness of the film. There's no shortage of debauchery in the film although its impact is quelled somewhat by the style which at times verges on being childish. Overall this film will certainly be of interest to those that enjoy original films. I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't call it a favourite!".

The comedy is funny and Jack is a character you want to root for in the end. The only flaw really is that it does take a long time to get into the action. But up until then it is still extremely entertaining and pretty funny. It i a great homage to brated monster films from the 50's and is a must for any horror fan. The cinemagoraphy is creative in parts and the effects are really good. Watch this now!".

All they ever intended to do was bring homage to the glorious horror decade of the 80's and make a nonsensical movie with clichd themes stereotypical characters and overthetop gooey makeup effects reminiscent to the movies the young filmmakers grew up with like The Evil Dead and Demons. I saw this film at the Belgian Fantasy Film Festival were it fulfilled the role of ideal midnight movie crowdpleaser. Jack Brooks Monster Slayer offers plenty of splatter absurdly crude humor identifiable antihero characters silly story lines and  last not least  Robert Englund himself in another terrific supportive Brole. Jack Brooks is an ordinary twentysomething man working as a plumber during the day and attending chemistry classes in the evening in order to reach a more valuable certificate. He suffers from one major problem though. Ever since he helplessly witnessed his family getting butchered by a forest monster as a child Jack can't control his anger and regularly suffers from aggressive outbursts. When his teacher Professor Crowley gradually transforms into a monstrous entity after a plumbing job gone awry Jack comes to realize the monster slaying business is exactly the type of anger management he needed. Monster Slayer is pretty weak in the plotting department as you can see but this widely gets compensated by the enthusiast spirit and determination of everybody involved in the production. The film starts off a little slow and hesitant but once Prof Crowley starts undergoing his transformation there's no more stopping the camp and cheese! You can clearly notice how genre veteran Robert Englund enjoyed helping out the young crew and the makeup department seemingly just received a carteblanche. The monster designs and demonic grimaces are delightfully cheesy and gross just like they were in the 1980's and the film constantly remains comical and lightheaded in spite of the gory bloodshed. Trevor Matthews is terrific as the reluctant Bruce Ash Campbell typed horror Savior and he receives good support from various other young and still unknown players. Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is a totally unpretentious and entertaining throwback to Bcinema and even though it'll never be regarded as a classic it's warmly recommended viewing for all fans of the genre.".

But for every funny scene there were numerous boring scenes. I could have done without the science teacher vomiting on the blackboard then smearing it around. Not funny just disgusting and dumb. The monster that the science professor morphed into was pretty weird I will say that much. It reminded me of a creature from the much superior film 'Slither'. I did like when Jack FINALLY started kicking some monster butt. But that didn't happen till the last ten or fifteen minutes of the dragged out film. To late to save the rest of the movie. And I hated the scenes where the poor pet dogs were eaten. That was totally unnecessary. Why is it that in most films where a pet dog or cat appears something bad ends up happening to them.Anyway I did not care for the film over all. It might have made a good 20 minute episode on the old 'Monsters' TV series or something like that as a full length feature it was a waste of my time.Just my opinion but I wish I had skipped this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is not a good movie. In fact it is a big letdown. While the production quality and tongue in cheek use of rubber costumes reflects the moderately large budget the story itself is both flawed and boring. The culprit of the failings is found in the assumptions made by the film makers. By focusing on monster creation process the film neglects important character development and playful action. Overall this is a film to be missed. Admittedly JBMS will strike a chord with some nostalgia buffs yet as a film this is little more than a mediocre rehash of genre clichs.The downfall of this film is two assumptions. First the makers assume that showing the history and creation of the monster is both necessary and amusing. Second supplying detail to the above mentioned monster ontology is assumed to also be necessary and interesting. Neither assumption is wrong per se. The execution in this film however is outright boring. An extended example may help to clarify. Cooking shows run a tenuous line. Watching the act of creation is interesting and informative. Detailing every action that goes into dish preparation is dull. A cooking program needs to find a balance between informative exposition and potentially dull but important detail. The answer seems to be that every part of a cooking show is a mix of technique and technique explanation. As such breaking down an onion is shown because it informs on knife technique in practice and also illustrates the benefits of uniform piece size in cooking. Peeling a potato or boiling water is not shown because they are important techniques that benefit little from being demonstrated. The point is that all elements of the process are evaluated on the levels of understanding that are conveyable. The same is true for the horror film. A background to the protagonist and antagonist is appreciated as long as it sets the current context as well as developing the actual characters. JBMS provides a great amount of detail concerning how the main monster is formed. The slow transition from human to demon is the body of the film. Choosing this transition as the focal point of the story leads to a ninety minute film a ninety minute film that could very easily have been forty minutes. Furthermore the added detail affords no real development. To the contrary the monster development is the cinematic equivalent to watching a trained chef peel a potato. Essentially this film would have benefited from a focus on devious monster action and not hum drum monster ontology.The above stated the film is not a total loss. The characters are likable enough and Robert Englund clearly enjoyed this production. The use of rubber suits as opposed to CGI is a welcome throwback to the creature films of the eighties and before. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that these benefits do not come near enough to balancing out the dry elongated boring story telling. This film is worth a miss. I am loathe to recommend this movie even to the horrorcomedy buff. There are a great many more interesting and better told stories that are actually worthy of one's time.On a personal note I will mention this film to friends as a real Turkey. Unfortunately this will almost guarantee that it is seen by at least one more person. Should you feel the need to hunt this film down the movie is best paired with low expectations and somewhat sloppy drunkenness.".

	schema:headline " Jack Brooks Insomnia Slayer";
	schema:reviewBody "After viewing Still Life a short film directed by Jon Knautz I was genuinely excited for his feature film debut Jack Brooks Monster Slayer. Still Life had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of The Twilight Zone and I was eager to see what Knautz could do when taking on the horrorcomedy genre. The campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of Evil Dead or Army of Darkness a fun gory 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters. While that was what Knautz was going for he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had.The problem with Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horrorcomedies that it tries to evoke so great in the first place. Twothirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero Jack Brooks a plumber and college student as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger. There's nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horrorrelated. Even if Evil Dead or Dead Alive had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out they'd still be entertaining. Jack Brooks isn't. It's plain boring which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be. Jack Brooks himself is not all that interesting at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given. All one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster and he rarely does he's not worth watching. The movie goes nowhere following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates.Eventually things do pick up. Jack Brooks battles a few monsters some heads are crushed a few humans are slaughtered and then it's over. Just like that. All within the span of about fifteen minutes. It is a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all fairly inventive and done entirely in camera and there's some great gore gags the best being a zombies head crushed in but after sitting through seventyfive minutes of pure tedium fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it.That's really all there is to it. I could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done especially horror icon Robert Englund in a nontraditional role and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didn't use CGI but it really doesn't matter. Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is utterly boring and while Jon Knautz obviously does have the talent to create a good film once again the last fifteen minutes are killer and Still Life was amazing  check it out Jack Brooks completely misses the mark.

	onyx:emotionText "After viewing Still Life a short film directed by Jon Knautz I was genuinely excited for his feature film debut Jack Brooks Monster Slayer. Still Life had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of The Twilight Zone and I was eager to see what Knautz could do when taking on the horrorcomedy genre. The campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of Evil Dead or Army of Darkness a fun gory 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters. While that was what Knautz was going for he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had.The problem with Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horrorcomedies that it tries to evoke so great in the first place. Twothirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero Jack Brooks a plumber and college student as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger. There's nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horrorrelated. Even if Evil Dead or Dead Alive had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out they'd still be entertaining. Jack Brooks isn't. It's plain boring which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be. Jack Brooks himself is not all that interesting at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given. All one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster and he rarely does he's not worth watching. The movie goes nowhere following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates.Eventually things do pick up. Jack Brooks battles a few monsters some heads are crushed a few humans are slaughtered and then it's over. Just like that. All within the span of about fifteen minutes. It is a good fifteen minutes. The monsters are all fairly inventive and done entirely in camera and there's some great gore gags the best being a zombies head crushed in but after sitting through seventyfive minutes of pure tedium fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it.That's really all there is to it. I could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done especially horror icon Robert Englund in a nontraditional role and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didn't use CGI but it really doesn't matter. Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is utterly boring and while Jon Knautz obviously does have the talent to create a good film once again the last fifteen minutes are killer and Still Life was amazing  check it out Jack Brooks completely misses the mark. It has its successes acting makeup but those don't change the fact that it's not very entertaining at all. The screening I caught this at had the director and cast in attendance. One piece of information I picked up was that a sequel was in development and that this time it would focus more on fighting monsters as opposed to the creation of a hero.

Which means the remake will be out in about 10 yearsCons  Takes at least 10 mins too long to get into the action.  When the action does start it doesn't last long enough!  Some of the acting is well um...  The entire thing with the therapist is pointless and adds nothing.  I don't think some character Character? threads were properly concluded.  End of film was way too sudden!  Needed to have a bigger variety of monster.  Some of the effects were...questionable cant decide if this was good or bad!?!?Pros  Robert Englund actually gives a pretty good performance. He obviously had fun with this and didn't mind getting his hands dirty! I have met the guy! Just thought id say! He he!  Hello!! I believe this film was meant to be ridiculous!!  This film should be watched for the old guy in the hardware store funniest thing in the entire film!!  It is most refreshing to see a modern film that IS NOT infested with CGI!!  Jack Brooks has a nicely thought out background and motivation for his actions. Nice moment in the van with the Sinatra songIn conclusion this is not the best film ever made and I have seen much better 'Hats Off' films of 80's type Bmovies. But mostly due to the Hardware store guy and Robert Englund this movie is staying in my collection and if you have 85 mins to mindlessly kill or are drunk with mates I recommend Just make sure you fastforward to the action!Icarus.".

	schema:reviewBody "I picked up this title from DVD sales mostly because of the fun and inviting cover and like I usually do I check from my mobile what scores movies have gotten before I buy a totally unknown title.I thought that a 6.210 then could be an OK for a horrorcomedy and the age limit was 18 maximum in my country so how could this go wrong? Let me count the ways...First of all halfway through the film I actually had to check had somebody switched a cheesy teenage flick to my player or was this the wrong DVD in the first place. It takes forever for the plot to get any speed. You mostly get to watch a troubled manic depressive guy arguing with his girlfriend and visiting a shrink and that's about it. And when we finally get to the action part I was ready to cry. The advertising titles suggested that this is extremely funny and fun to watch. The only even remotely funny thing about it was David Fox as the old timer veteran in the plumbing store. If you watch the last 10 minutes of the movie you won't miss anything.Secondly the acting by Trevor Matthews as the protagonist is just so awkward. It's like he's wearing a ear piece and he's listening two directors shouting instructions to him at the same time. Robert Englund takes whatever there is left to save but even he seems to be confused of what they wanted him to do or act.If this were a pilot episode to some halfbaked TVseries that involved slaying monsters and occasional drama I could understand but even then any episode of Charmed or Buffy would sweep the floor with this piece.The movie is everything but funny and mostly awkward. The action is basically one scene at the end otherwise it's just unbelievably boring. Do not waste your time or money on this unless you have to own every movie of this genre ever made. And even then I'm not if the genre is correctly defined.".

He is someone I would like to know and the hilarity comes from his Happy Gilmore reactions to every day annoyances from unresolved issues.

My favorite movies are those with characters for whom I am rooting whatever the story or how it's told no matter their flaws or goodguy badguy personas as developedmuch like Ash's and the character's humor when well writtenplayed. I felt Jack Brooks fit this bill to a T. Loved him!Don't look for an Evil Dead comparable let go of pretense and limited expectations and just enjoy.

Well Robert 'original Freddy Kruger' Englund is in it so that does mean it's not going to be completely awful and the former spikyfingered one does overact nicely.As for the rest of it well it's okay.The first three quarters of the film don't contain many monsters.

The effects are cheesy and silly but some of the battle sequences are impressive for no other reasons then you can tell there are literally thousands of people fighting in these scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "first of all its unfair to compare this movie with a Hollywood product this is an eastern maninrubbersuit monster movie made in north Korea and must be evaluated as such. and in his niche this is one of the very best. for the originality and meanings it deserves to be put on the same level of Honda's Godzilla of 1954. it sports believable effects real mass scenes ok they were soldiers drafted to act in a movie but nevertheless it's better than what i've seen in Gappa and believe it or not a plot that is less nonsense than the usual Gamera  Rodan  Godzilla  Gappa stuff we got used to. at least all the story is more fantastic than SciFi and this places everything on a completely different perspective. comedy episodes are laughable but i suppose that asking to a NorthKorean movie to meet the standard humor tastes of a western audience is way too much. the interpretative key of the story revolves around the goods and evils of capitalism one may appreciate or not the intentions but go find another Kaiju with more sense than the Japanese are still scared after the atom bomb poor souls and the Japanese scientists save the world.

	onyx:emotionText "first of all its unfair to compare this movie with a Hollywood product this is an eastern maninrubbersuit monster movie made in north Korea and must be evaluated as such. and in his niche this is one of the very best. for the originality and meanings it deserves to be put on the same level of Honda's Godzilla of 1954. it sports believable effects real mass scenes ok they were soldiers drafted to act in a movie but nevertheless it's better than what i've seen in Gappa and believe it or not a plot that is less nonsense than the usual Gamera  Rodan  Godzilla  Gappa stuff we got used to. at least all the story is more fantastic than SciFi and this places everything on a completely different perspective. comedy episodes are laughable but i suppose that asking to a NorthKorean movie to meet the standard humor tastes of a western audience is way too much. the interpretative key of the story revolves around the goods and evils of capitalism one may appreciate or not the intentions but go find another Kaiju with more sense than the Japanese are still scared after the atom bomb poor souls and the Japanese scientists save the world. Pulgasari is finally less nationalistic than the average Japanese movie and this is outstanding for a product of a dictatorial country isn't ?";

It's the one and only North Korean kaiju movie out there a film that's been inspired by the likes of GODZILLA and YONGGARY although I think plotwise it has most in common with the Japanese DAIMAJIN trilogy.The story is a straightforward one in which the poor are presented as a righteous oppressed people and an evil general and his army are the outandout villains. A humble blacksmith is captured and starved to death by the villains but not before he's created Pulgasari a tiny humanoid creature who eventually grows into a lovably Baby Godzilla type beastie.After a time Pulgasari becomes the citystomping giant monster that kaiju cinema loves although given the budget there's little destruction on offer here and the effects are lacking to say the least. But the story with its uniquely North Korean slant is a solid one and the novelty value alone is enough to keep you watching. It's good fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "Seldom have I watched a movie that fails so completely in all that it attempts to do. There could be a good reason for this however the director and two leads were abducted from South Korea by Kim and then forced to partake in this schlock whilst the Dear Executive Producer Kim Jong Il ran the show. This was ten years before he became the ruler of North Korea. I guess he runs his country on the same principles as he ran the production of this movie. Unfortunately the kidnapping victims escaped before the movie could be completed which could explain much of the disjointed nature in the latter part of the film. Quite bizarrely the director's 'punishment' was to have his name removed from the credits until he SUED the film company to have it reinstated although heaven only knows why.The movie opens in a nameless village somewhere in Chosun Dynasty era Korea. A peasant girl is fetching water from a well. She is a kind and selfless young woman as indicated by her desire to see the old people fed first at dinner time. Her father is the town blacksmith and makes many tools for the farmers. All is not well in the idyllic village however. An evil king sits on the throne and a great rebellionwar is brewing. He has his army appropriate all the metal in the kingdom in order to forge weapons. It emerges that the leader of the banditsrebels lives in this particular village and has hidden a weapons cache near the blacksmith's forge. The first of many 'epic' battle scenes unfurls as Korean People's Army soldiers forced to act as extras fight it out dressed as wicked royal guards slavishly obeying the king and virtuous peasants defending their right to bear pots and pans. Yawn.The rebels are routed and arrested and the blacksmith is then drafted to make weapons out of the confiscated metal but allows the village people to take back their items when the army leaves. The army comes back and discovers the iron gone and this leads to his imprisonment and torture. As a form of protest he decides not to eat and begins to starve. His daughter Ami tries to get him to eat rice balls by throwing them to him through the bars of the jail. He is a man of principle however and refuses to eat even this food prepared by his loving daughter. Instead he makes a little figurine of the rice balls and clay and makes a dying wish to some unseen force to give it life and help the peasants. He then dies and the obligatory wailing so prolific in North Korean films starts. Once Ami her brother her mother the village the bandits and their dogs have recovered from the loss wiped their tears away and shouted 'aigoo' for the last time the little sculpture finds its way to Ami. She pricks herself whilst sewing and some blood splashes onto it bringing it to life. Pulgasari is born and from this point on the movie never lets you forget that his name is PULGASARI! Every time PULGASARI gets screen time there is an annoying peasantbanditkingvizierrandom extra shouting 'It's PULGASARI!' 'Hey PULGASARI!' 'LOOK OUT IT'S' or 'HERE COMES ' Only the heinous abomination that is 'The Outlaw of Gor' can rival the number of times the lead character's name is repeated as part of the movie dialog.So moving on Pulgasari starts out small he eats the needle Ami was using then he eats the door hinges then he eats the scrap metal in the forge. He grows bigger and bigger under Ami's control since it's her blood that infused him with life. I immediately saw a problem with this monster the peasants' woe is due mainly to the fact that the king wants all their metal for weapons but their newfound hero eats the same metal. The rest of the film uses made for TV effects reminiscent of 'Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' as Pulgasari stomps his way through Feudal Korea MiniTown killing the king and liberating the peasants. Stuff happens along the way but the rubber suit is more convincing than the plot and character development. Predictably the monster continues to eat metal and becomes a burden to the peasants. Ami sacrifices herself by hiding in the village's bell before Pulgasari eats it. Pulgasari and Ami die. Roll credits on the ninety minutes of my life that cannot be taken back a horrid mess of a movie that cannot be unseen.Reflecting on the didactic nature of the several North Korean films I have watched IE Peasants GoodPowers that be Bad I'd have to say that there you could interpret this as a young Kim Jong Il giving the middle finger to an establishment that had molded him from a young age to take over from his father despite his wishes of film making glory. In 'The Flower Girl' we see how the peasants are oppressed and need the Korean Liberation Army to free them it takes food lives and money metal to support in order to drive out the Japanese Imperialists the evil king taking the peasant's resources but once in power the KLA and the Communist Party continue to take all of these things from the peasants eventually requiring the peasants to die in order to rid themselves of the scourge that they themselves have helped feed. The irony would be delicious but I think that it's actually just a ham fisted attempt to knock capitalism yet another aspect of this movie that fails with unintentional yet hilarious results.".

The monster eats metal and begins to grow.The rebels battle the government with the monster. The monster grows bigger and bigger and even after the rebels win the monster still goes on eating and growing until some way has to be found to destroy the beast....Its a weird twist on the Daimajin films from Japan.The monster is one of the stiffest rubber suits I've ever seen outside of a bondage film and is screamingly funny to look at.You can see how the head piece sits on the body. The actor playing the monster at times looks like a boxer warming up for a fight weaving and rocking in a jerky style that brought giggles to this viewer.Those of you into bondage may want to see about getting one for yourself since it severely limits movement and is probably torturous to wear The blue screen work is laughable simply because the film stocks don't match.The destruction scenes are surprisingly good and well done in many ways better than most Godzilla films. The collapse of the buildings seems to be very realistic.The battle scenes while epic in scale are laughable simply because many of the weaponssay the boulders are obviously cardboard or plaster. There are thousands of people on screen for some scenes and it looks good but they are often simply running to and fro.The film is supposedly a North Korean fable about the evils of capitalism and what ever else Kim Jongil deemed it to be about.My question is who did they think this film is for? It looks like a TV series blown up to feature size. The level of the story seems to be that of a second or third grade mentality especially in its humor but it has real animals being carved up torture nasty battlefield death and ideas that no child would grasp or care about. Its a childrens film made for adults.This is one of those its so bad its...something movies. Its a mind warp and complete mess. I like bits of it and other bits leave me with slack jawed disbelief. Frankly I was thinking that if it was suppose to be a tongue in cheek sort of thing then I could consider it a good joke film but since the film is serious and meant to mean something then its a disaster.AND LEST YOU ASK IF I'M CERTAIN ITS SERIOUS The South Korean director was kidnapped by the North Koreans to make movies like this for them. Luckily he eventually escaped.Do I think you should see this movie?First how much do you love giant monsters?Second how drunk can you get and still see the screen clearly?I don't think you really need to see this unless you want to laugh your ass off with drunken buddies or if you really need to see every rubber suited giant monster movie ever made.Either way DO NOT WATCH THIS ALONE you'll need someone to help you pick up your jaw off the floor.And no its not one of the worst films I've ever seen just one of the most inept".

Emer's opinion made me think that the production value was going to be akin to a school play obvious cardboard furniture obvious cardboard miniatures I was basically expecting a kaiju equivalent to Manos The Hands of Fate. Thankfully Pulgasari was not THAT bad. The acting is very poor but there are a handful of actors who are trying. The monster costume looks amazing it's on par with the Heisei Godzilla suits! The animatronics are good Pulgasari is actually able to show emotion!The miniatures are good on par with the miniature effects of the '70s.Still I can only recommend this movie for diehard kaiju fans those who want to watch every kaiju film ever. Me personally the chances of giving this movie a second watch is very unlikely.I had made a top 10 list of worst giant monster movies. Pulgasari was number 3 with Godzilla's Revenge at number 2 and finally Gamera Super Monster at number 1. Having now seen Pulgasari it's position on the list is still number 3.The fact that Gamera vs Barugon at the time of me writing the review has a lower rating than this when it's a far better movie makes me trust IMDb a little bit less.".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely not your average kaiju film and not just because it's North Korean. This movie has some destruction and loads of fire but about 75 of that comes from the evil government. Yes some people would call this a propaganda piece because how dare you say the peasants are being treated terribly by their feudal monarchy. The government heads make sure to steal from starve and torture the citizens and what's sad is this is what is happening regularly in North Korea to this very day. I hate to get political here but that's really what the film is about. The titular character is more of a side story or simply a way to draw a bigger audience. I mean we don't see any creature for over 20 minutes and we don't see any kind of giant monster until 20 minutes after that. Large and small Pulgasari is on the side of the peasants who revolt against the governor and then the king after they can stand no more abuse. Pulgasari charging the battlefield was easily the funniest thing I saw in this movie but unlike something like Mothra or some Godzilla sequels I don't think this is supposed to be humorous in any way...did I mention the torture? Considering this was done in the mid80s the monster suit is about 15 years behind the times and at times they use rear screen projection which is what they used for King Kong back in 1933! Despite that it's still a good story of rebellion against forces of evil I would just question if we even needed the monster? For me the film could stand on it's own as a historical war action piece but I have to admit as a kaiju fanatic it was the picture of the monster that made me want to see the film in the first place and that was probably what the North Korean government was counting on...".

Now from what I understand Kim Jong Il the eventual leader of North Korea was an avid movie buff and wanted Sang OK Shin to produce a film along the lines of Godzilla. This movie is the final product. Unfortunately this movie doesn't translate as well to worldwide audiences as its famous predecessor did. That's not to say that this movie is necessarily bad but it clearly had some weaknesses. For starters the special effects were quite poor and the movie had some scenes which could have definitely been trimmed here and there. Along with that the movie I saw was filmed in Korean but had English subtitles. I only mention this because this is a film that is probably best suited for young children and subtitles simply won't suffice for that particular audience. Be that as it may I rate the movie as slightly below average.".

It's very hard to talk about this film at all without explaining its backstory. It was actually made when Kim JongIl kidnapped a movie director. Yep this guy was actually a fan of movies and probably would have himself made a good Bond villain in real life. For a propaganda film this didn't really have that much that was offensive in it.It's still a pretty dumb movie as it features a toy monster that comes alive when blood gets on it. The monster grows when eating iron. It's very silly but it's really no dumber than most of the films in the Gamera series. North Korea is known for knockoff products but this really wasn't one. It seems like every country has done a kaiju movie. Pulgasari is actually a mythical figure so it's no Godzilla ripoff. The colors in this film are just plain gaudy. Some of the action scenes really aren't that bad. It is very hard to enjoy something that was forced. Imagine if people could kidnap those who worked on their favorite franchises like Pokmon or Doctor Who. George Lucas would be clich. It's still a shame the Kim family has yet to be put to justice. Oh and this is all the fault of religion according to Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher. Yeah it's hard not to get political when talking about this. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a solid decent bloody fastpaced decent slasher from 2000's that delivers plenty of suspenseful action. It is not a better than original slasher 80's but it is a decent solid remake that I enjoy. I love this film but I love the original to death. They are both my personal favorite horror slasher films. I love the setting which takes place in the mine shaft and in the forest on a Valentine's Day. This movie has gore nudity in which original didn't had nudity and it is a fun thrill ride. This is a American remake of Canadian slasher film. From the cast too murder scenes these are impressive 3D effects the director Patrick Lussier knew what he was doing and everyone on the set did a fine job.A young man who survived a vicious massacre returns to his hometown only to become the prime suspect when someone wearing miner's gear begins pickaxing the locals left and right!This is a good impressive slasher film that I love. I love the 3D murder effects. I love in the opening scene in which a guy get's a pickax in the eye I love that effect. I love in which a retired sheriff get's a pickax in his jaw and you see that effect in which that mask murder takes out pickax from his jaw and you see a blood flying in the camera that is a satisfying gore. You see a nude topless girl walking around the parking lot and her ex boyfriend gets pickaxed and so does she later in the motel. I love the gore in this movie. I love Prodigal Son Soundtrack from Michael Wandmacher for My Bloody Valentine song. I love the masked killer in a miner outfit with mask and pickax not a bad custom I love it.The performances from the three leads Jensen Ackles Jamie King and Kerr Smith are solid decent I love them they are likable characters. You have Tom Atkins from Halloween III and The Fog. You have Kevin Tighe from Another 48 Hrs. who did another solid job in this movie. Jensen Ackles brought me in to this film because I was huge fan of his TV show Supernatural back than. I love this film to death. Jansen Ackles I love the guy so much I love his performance in this movie. Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek and Final Destination was not bad as Sheriff Axel Palmer I enjoyed his performance I love him. Jaime King from Slackers as Sarah Mercer Palmer was a sexy babe but smart she out smarted the killer I love her as the final girl. I love Betsy Rue as Irene she is not bad at all I love her been all nude in this movie. I don't prefer the remake over the original but it is an pair with the original for me.I love the good twist in the climax on the end definitely my favorite slasher in remakes of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry a 3D remake My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films a strong unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible nonridiculous finale. Unfortunately the movie is not as strong as its bookend acts but it is certainly gory fun terrifying tense and nothing but entertaining. And yes there is also nudity. The use of the trademark in your face 3D tactics is mostly restrained although it seems that director Patrick Lussier who has mostly been in horror movie limbo since he directed Dracula 2000 could not avoid the intermittent pickaxe to the screen. The performances are actually quite strong and while this is becoming more the norm in horror films MBV even forgoes the smartalecky prankster character which removes the propensity for us to be taken out of the film.The unique opening is actually a threetier start. Flashing newsreels reveal that the collapse of the Hanniger Mine in a small town which claimed the lives of 6 miners Or was it something else that killed the men?. Awakening from a comma years later the sole survivor of the cavein Harry Warden picks up where he left off slaying dozens before being killed himself concluding what the town dubbed the Valentines Day Massacre. But all is not what it seems as 10 years later Tom Hanniger Jensen Ackles a nearvictim of Warden returns to the small town to sell the mine but the killings suspiciously begin once again and it is up to Tom to clear his name.My Bloody Valentine is a fullfledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films like Friday the 13th and is ironically better then the Friday remake this year and never for a single second tries to be anything it's not and in doing so it ultimately becomes something it shouldn't be fun.6.5  10.0Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry a 3D remake My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films a strong unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible nonridiculous finale. Unfortunately the movie is not as strong as its bookend acts but it is certainly gory fun terrifying tense and nothing but entertaining. And yes there is also nudity. The use of the trademark in your face 3D tactics is mostly restrained although it seems that director Patrick Lussier who has mostly been in horror movie limbo since he directed Dracula 2000 could not avoid the intermittent pickaxe to the screen. The performances are actually quite strong and while this is becoming more the norm in horror films MBV even forgoes the smartalecky prankster character which removes the propensity for us to be taken out of the film.The unique opening is actually a threetier start. Flashing newsreels reveal that the collapse of the Hanniger Mine in a small town which claimed the lives of 6 miners Or was it something else that killed the men?. Awakening from a comma years later the sole survivor of the cavein Harry Warden picks up where he left off slaying dozens before being killed himself concluding what the town dubbed the Valentines Day Massacre. But all is not what it seems as 10 years later Tom Hanniger Jensen Ackles a nearvictim of Warden returns to the small town to sell the mine but the killings suspiciously begin once again and it is up to Tom to clear his name.My Bloody Valentine is a fullfledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films like Friday the 13th and is ironically better then the Friday remake this year and never for a single second tries to be anything it's not and in doing so it ultimately becomes something it shouldn't be fun.6.5  10.0Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remake of a Canadian horror film that I grew up with and is still very dear to me. Even though I don't think they make great horror films these days the 3D gimmick was too much to pass up. And it's nice to see that the original motivated someone to try and remake it. That said this film is nothing extraordinary but worth it if you have some time to kill. And be prepared to pay extra since this is a 3D film. They charged me an extra two bucks for the glasses. It isn't often you pay 9.50 for a movie at 3 in the afternoon but what the hell.The film is faithful to the original in a few ways. Using many of the same names and the mining community for the setting. The story centers around the aftermath of a violent rampage by a coal miner ten years earlier. And a spate of grisly new killings that coincide with the arrival of a young man who left town at the time the original murders took place. Is it just a coincidence or is the young man picking up where the murderous miner left off? This time around the script has a lot more going on than in the original. Sometimes a bit too much but the action is spread out to more locations than just the creepy old mine. There is a very strong amount of gore that the original sorely lacked thank you Paramount. You will see people mangled in just about every way you can kill someone with a pick ax. This film even recycles the dead body in the dryer shot from the original too. It seems like they made a point to be much more graphic for the fans who had always complained about too much gore cut out from the 1981 version. And the 3D was a nice treat. It looked very good even from the rear of the theater where I was seated. And a man in full mining gear is still a very scary sight.I expected problems with the script and I was correct to do so. Much of the dialog is very weak and it seems like they used a test audience to pick the actual killer since it really could have been either of two people. Some of the acting was more than passable and it was good to see Tom Atkins working again. The locations above ground were more lush and not as economically depressed as they looked in the original. And this kind of hurts when it comes to creating a spooky atmosphere. There are a couple moments during fight scenes where the actions of characters produced groans from the audience due to stupidity and I really doubt the county sheriff of such a supposedly impoverished area could afford such a nice home and a housekeeper. I guess the film was still as good as I thought it could be and I'm not a worse person for having seen it. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Well it seems 2009 will make up for that with My Bloody Valentine Final Destination 4 and Pirahna all adding an extra dimension to their proceedings.My Bloody Valentine is a great start. It's fun gory doesn't spend too much time on the dialogue because it understands we're wearing these ridiculous glasses for a reason! I really enjoyed it actually and for someone who has watched so many slashers the 3d did add some wonderful novel touches so it felt like more than just a retread. I know it's cool to bash remakes these days and admittedly so many are very weak but I much prefer this to the original which seemed to plod along at quite a pedestrian pace and besides the mining town setting really didn't offer anything especially new. This film is far tighter and doesn't take itself so seriously it has its tonguefirmlyincheek.The only downsides are perhaps the stalk and kill sequence involving a naked lady. I guess some horror fans like their nudity but in a genre so often viewed as misogynistic it didn't do itself any favours. Admittedly the character is actually quite strong and fun you don't feel her nudity weakens or humiliates her but... I dunno perhaps pandering a little too much for the teenage boys? Go catch this at the cinema take a few friends and enjoy an hour and a half of silly fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Years ago in the town of Harmony a horrible mining accident occurred due in part to the negligence of young Tom Hannigar. Five men were found dead and one Harry Warden in a coma. It soon came to light that Harry Warden killed those men to conserve his own air supply. On valentine's day Harry mysteriously awakens from his coma and goes on a killing spree and ultimately met his end at the hands of the town sheriff But not before confronting the main characters AxelKerr Smith SarahJamie King and her boyfriend Tom HannigarJensen Ackles who still harbors the guilt of causing the accident in the first place. Years pass teenagers become adults and have families. Suddenly mysterious killings start to happen again with a very familiar M.O killed by a man in a mining outfit similar to Harry Warden's. Axel and Sarah are now married but there is trouble brewing in paradise. To complicate matters Tom Hannigar returned to Harmony and where he goes the mysterious killings follow.Is some deranged copycat killer out to make a name for himself by repeating the tragedy from 10 years ago? Or has Harry Warden come back from the grave to exact his revenge on Tom Hannigar and everyone close to him? For the first time i surprise even myself by saying that i liked the story. Or at least i was mildly hooked by it. Usually stories in such slasher horror remakes are bland and shoved aside in order to focus more on silly teenage shenanigans and gruesome killings. The story of My Bloody Valentine plays with the mystery element very well throwing many red herrings and misleading little clues as to the identity of the killer. Literally everyone is a suspect and this film keeps you guessing up until the final reveal. There is even a smallthough weak but passable attempt at a tragic love triangle between the 3 main characters which ties in rather well with the whole valentine theme of the movie. The characters are at least more bearable than the usual slasher movie fare and easier to get into emotionally. The acting may be a little stiff at times but i did not expect much good acting from horror genre movies. A mystery story would only work one time aroundonce you know the ending the mystery element kinda ends there so is it worth watching this movie again on DVD or blu ray??? I give it a resounding yes thanks to.......you guessed it the 3D gimmick.It has been said many times over that the 3D gimmick coupled with some fresh new ways to kill off characters is the highlight of this movie. I never knew one could get so creative with a pickaxe and shovel. The gore itself is not gratuitous but the kills are shockingly gruesome and some of them rather unique.my favorite is when the killer shoved a shovel into a girl's mouth and cleaved her face in half. Really must hand it to director Patrick Lussieralso directed Dracula 2000 for his clear straightforward directing style which keeps the usual frantic cuts to a minimum and allows the violence to be played out in its full gory.....i mean glory. Of course what would a slasher film be without some mandatory nudity? Thankfully the nudity is played more for laughs than to titillate here as a dumb blond runs around a motel and car park completely buck naked in the middle of the night trying to confront her boyfriend and then trying to escape the killer.In retrospect My Bloody Valentine actually plays out like an extremely violent episode of Scooby Doo complete with surprise ending and unmasking. There were some issues with the overall feel of the non3D portions of the film which felt cheap and at times looked no better than a madeforTV miniseries. Slasher genre fans are sure to love this and casual movie viewer can easily immerse themselves in the well plotted mystery and suspense. My Bloody Valentine is a surprisingly fresh take on the slasher genre. It takes familiar elements and adds a new twist to it. This movie among other recent slasher remakes is like a breath of fresh air after spending hours in a gas mask. Definitely one of the better ones in the market. Maybe there is hope for the slasher genre yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "The use of three dimensional effects have not been a part of cinema for over twenty years with IMAX the exception but now it is back and better than ever in 2009. During My Bloody Valentine 3D the audience will experience large pickaxes flying bullets and tree limbs coming out of the screen and into your lap. At times the effect seems gimmicky as the story forces the occurrence of projectiles moving through the air and other times the three dimensional effects hit it just right. When you see the film you will know when the effect works the mesmerizing visuals are sometimes jawdropping literally.Writers Tom Farver and Zane Smith keep the pace up throughout My Bloody Valentine 3D right until the end when it appears that a miner with grievances will take on a whole town. Right from the beginning the story starts off with a woman on the run from a mysterious figure behind a breathing mask who seems to delight in wrecking other people's good time. The start to the movie is explosive and the film does not back down from creating a suspenseful horror flick that is simply out to horrify and be fun. At times the dialogue or introduction of characters into scenes comes off as slightly campy but the delivery of lines in each scene is generating intensity for the final climactic act.The plot of this horror film is somewhat conventional with Tom Hanniger returning to his hometown in order to heal some past misgivings at the hands of a bloody serial killer. My Bloody Valentine 3D mostly centres on the character of Tom Hanniger with Sarah and Axel Palmer supporting. Adding enough smaller characters to keep the story complex and creating enough diverging plot lines to keep things tight My Bloody Valentine 3D does a good job of keeping the killer's identity mysterious while piquing viewer's curiosity. Instead of going for a closed box Hollywood ending the film slightly steps it up by leaving the ending open for a sequel. Some of the most successful film franchises come from the horror genre and My Bloody Valentine 3D might be trying to capitalize on future returns by delivering a plot twist that slightly disappoints.Lighting environments and music are all spot on only the overacting of certain characters distracts from an otherwise excellent horror film. Many of the scenes within My Bloody Valentine 3D take place in darkly lit mine shafts or the interiors of houses at night and the overall tone feels like a thriller while showing enough gore to entertain horror fans. The music in the film is subtle enough while picking up the pace slightly during action sequences. On the other hand the musical score of My Bloody Valentine 3D could have been much more eerie in order to build up further tension. The acting of Jaimie King comes off as pretentious and somewhat naive while Kerr Smith appearing to take his role of a small time sheriff a little too seriously displays some awkwardness. The rest of the actors including veterans Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe play their smaller parts well Jensen Ackles could have taken a darker approach to his character in order to truly deliver a role of someone who is struggling with the trauma of past brutal events but the portrayal is still good.Overall My Bloody Valentine 3D delivers an entertaining ride through dark alleys mine shafts and the evil minds of writers Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Slightly on the lighter side of the horror genre this film develops enough jump scares with the help of three dimensional effects to deliver a fun and fast 101 minutes. See this one with a friend and laugh out loud when a 20' branch comes screaming at your head and try not to duck! 6 Mesmerizing Skulls out of 10.".

My Bloody Valentine 3D mostly centres on the character of Tom Hanniger with Sarah and Axel Palmer supporting. Adding enough smaller characters to keep the story complex and creating enough diverging plot lines to keep things tight My Bloody Valentine 3D does a good job of keeping the killer's identity mysterious while piquing viewer's curiosity. Instead of going for a closed box Hollywood ending the film slightly steps it up by leaving the ending open for a sequel. Some of the most successful film franchises come from the horror genre and My Bloody Valentine 3D might be trying to capitalize on future returns by delivering a plot twist that slightly disappoints.Lighting environments and music are all spot on only the overacting of certain characters distracts from an otherwise excellent horror film. Many of the scenes within My Bloody Valentine 3D take place in darkly lit mine shafts or the interiors of houses at night and the overall tone feels like a thriller while showing enough gore to entertain horror fans. The music in the film is subtle enough while picking up the pace slightly during action sequences. On the other hand the musical score of My Bloody Valentine 3D could have been much more eerie in order to build up further tension. The acting of Jaimie King comes off as pretentious and somewhat naive while Kerr Smith appearing to take his role of a small time sheriff a little too seriously displays some awkwardness. The rest of the actors including veterans Tom Atkins and Kevin Tighe play their smaller parts well Jensen Ackles could have taken a darker approach to his character in order to truly deliver a role of someone who is struggling with the trauma of past brutal events but the portrayal is still good.Overall My Bloody Valentine 3D delivers an entertaining ride through dark alleys mine shafts and the evil minds of writers Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Slightly on the lighter side of the horror genre this film develops enough jump scares with the help of three dimensional effects to deliver a fun and fast 101 minutes. See this one with a friend and laugh out loud when a 20' branch comes screaming at your head and try not to duck! 6 Mesmerizing Skulls out of 10.";

Instead of a homecoming however Tom finds himself suspected of committing the murders.Seeing my first 2009 horror film let alone film this year I can tell horror movies are looking promising this year. I'll admit it. The film didn't surpass my expectations but that isn't fair since I set the bar up unusually high for these types of films. Yes I would have never seen this film in theaters if it weren't in 3D. If you're thinking to watch it in 2D DON'T! Spend the extra 2.50 or more because the extra fee is worthwhile. If you don't have a theater with 3D screenings near you all I can say is that the film will not be as good as if it were in 3D and I stand by this statement.With that warning out of the way I'll say this is one of the most fun times I've ever had of watching a horror film in theaters. The 3D factor is just an icing on top of a red velvet cake. As a slasher fan myself I found the film entertaining. I had myself laughing from death scenes that are sometimes ridiculously overthetop the gore the gratuitous nudity and the horror clichs. This must mean the film is poking fun of itself as a slasher genre or it must mean we're back in the 1980's. I'll go with the latter. But really does that really matter?The plot was fun but in films like these it doesn't really matter either. I had a grand time guessing who's the killer and who's not just to have myself getting slapped in the face back. It will literally keep you guessing until the end and even if the conclusion has been done several million times before one will wonder why one would fall for it again. The 3D gimmicks were great and sometimes shocking. You see human body parts flying in your face. You flinch when a pickaxe come flying in your way. It's just that great.I had a mix reaction with the performances. Jensen Ackles was decent although I had myself laughing from his odd performance. Fortunately Kerr Smith and Jaime King did a better job. Betsy Rue the actress who would show her body in full frontal nudity for five minutes in a part of the movie does her part so well that you forget about the nudity barely. The score is also better than in many other horror films because really horror films these days usually have annoying loud rock songs playing in the background for no apparent reason.In the end you should really watch or consider to watch this film in 3D if you're interested. The kills are great there's some suspense and the 3D aspect is really mixed well with the movie that you will have a fun time watching it. If you're expecting something original don't bother watching it. However if you like slashers that are similar to those in the past do yourself a favor and watch it.".

Ten years ago a tragedy changed the town of Harmony forever. Tom Hanniger Jensen Ackles an inexperienced coal miner caused an accident in the tunnels that trapped and killed five men and sent the only survivor Harry Warden Richard John Walters into a coma. But Harry Warden wanted revenge. Exactly one year later on Valentine's Day he woke up and brutally murdered twentytwo people with a pick axe before being killed. Ten years later Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony on Valentine's Day still haunted by the deaths he caused. Struggling to make amends with his past he grapples with unresolved feelings for his exgirlfriend Sarah Jaime King who is now married to his best friend Axel Kerr Smith the town sheriff. But tonight after years of peace something from Harmony's dark past has returned. Wearing a miner's mask and armed with a pick axe an unstoppable killer is on the loose. And as his footsteps come ever closer Tom Sarah and Axel realise in terror that it just might be Harry Warden who's come back to claim them... The 3D experience was amazing and so lifelike which seems like that it is really happening. The movie was pretty good that was best viewed at the 3D theatre although it is another slasher movie which has been tackled a lot of times in Hollywood but I had no problem with it because I had a good time watching it. It is not the kind of film that is going to appeal to everyone and it is best not to take it too seriously. I would recommend it to people who liked movies like Scream. The story is simple and the cast is unknown but it is better that way because then you can just concentrate on the mystery. Overall if want a good 3D experience andor like horror slasher film then My Bloody Valentine is the movie for you.".

The directing is so god awful it's actually painful to watch and the reason for me saying this is that every single shot is a missed opportunity. It's like they intentionally looked at the scene and said wow it would be really scary if we filmed from these angles with this lighting and these sound effects and background music....and the went in the complete opposite direction. This might all be on purpose because the movie studio thought it would make more money on a cheesy movie that even the biggest wuss would dare to see.Besides all this it lacks several of the other key elements1. Bad character development  you don't care about the characters at all or relate to them.2. Lame killer  No reason for him killing the people Yes a killer with no motives can be scary but it's very hard to pull off and this movie doesn't come close...at all And also no reason for the way a does it and no back story.3. Just generally a poor story that seems half baked and with lots plot holes and stupid ideas.So to sum up...NO ! this is not a good movie.

	onyx:emotionText "I was not expecting a lot from this movie and yet I was still disappointed. The directing is so god awful it's actually painful to watch and the reason for me saying this is that every single shot is a missed opportunity. It's like they intentionally looked at the scene and said wow it would be really scary if we filmed from these angles with this lighting and these sound effects and background music....and the went in the complete opposite direction. This might all be on purpose because the movie studio thought it would make more money on a cheesy movie that even the biggest wuss would dare to see.Besides all this it lacks several of the other key elements1. Bad character development  you don't care about the characters at all or relate to them.2. Lame killer  No reason for him killing the people Yes a killer with no motives can be scary but it's very hard to pull off and this movie doesn't come close...at all And also no reason for the way a does it and no back story.3. Just generally a poor story that seems half baked and with lots plot holes and stupid ideas.So to sum up...NO ! this is not a good movie. I really love horror movies and I hope someone will come along and bring the genre back on track Basically it's needs the BeginsDark Knight treatment...In which I mean it has to be a serious project for all the parties involved";

Some of the problems are with the script others are with the actors and many are due to poor filmmakingdirection.One of the things a movie called 'My Bloody Valentine' should feature prominently is the Valentine's Day celebration. There was almost no mention of it being near Valentine's Day yet everywhere in town valentine hearts are festooned heartshaped boxes of candy are passed around and yet get this all the exterior scenes look like late spring. Trees are full of green leaves blossoms are on others not a trace of snow on the ground or ice or winter in any way. Last I checked Valentine's Day is in the dead of winter on February 14. This was careless or sloppy or apathetic.I know that some of you might be OK with a movie that has such blatant disregard for the intelligence of its intended audience but the seasonal incongruity stuck out like a sore thumb.The movie could have been about a murderous miner and it would have worked better or made more sense than trying to tie in to the Valentine's Day theme. Really just make a movie about a psycho miner leave the Valentine stuff out and you immediately have a movie that makes more sense than this mess did.The 'surprise' identity of the killer was telegraphed clumsily about halfway through the movie. The killer is alone in the mines with a guy who is going to be a victim  then we are led to believe that he's in a fight for his life with the boogie man while only about 30 feet from the other guy who hears nothing sees nothing just is oblivious to the shouting clanging of metal steel doors rattling etc. Then the killer comes facetoface with his opponent in a split screen scene that bluntly and with no ambiguity shows the two as mirror images of each other. Way to go Director  lack of subtlety reveals the 'twist' far too soon so the rest of the movie is essentially spoiled.There's a lot more that is ridiculously stupid about this movie. Early on the original killer Harry Warden is hospitalized in a coma for more than a year. Suddenly he awakens after being in this coma for a year or so and goes on a rampage. Stunningly he has the strength to not only get out of bed but to literally hack ALL the people in the hospital to pieces and escape. No muscle atrophy for this guy. No hospital security nothing but bodies ripped in half all over the place.I could go on but there's no point. I've spent more time on this than this awful movie deserves. See the original  it's superior in every way.".

If it was intended as a parody of the original version or slasher films in general it failed miserably because it was so damn boring and uninteresting.

The last 15 minutes in Training Day were a mess and tainted the movie. Here the performances are on par and there's no ridiculous John Wootype chaseaction scene to end on. Clifton Collins is great and Gooding reminds us what an actor he can be if his agent gives him a halfwaydecent script to work with. I recommend.".

Cuba Gooding Jr.'s portrayal of a cop who has lost his moorings is mesmerizing funny heartbreaking very engaging. But it is Clifton Collins Jr. who represents the moral center of this movie. An incredible performance the best I've seen in years. A gangbanger stricken with an attack of conscience. Fisher sets up a brutal world and then finds a glint of light in it. I mean it's easy to behave morally in a sheltered safe middleclass environment. But these cops  the movie is based on the L.A. Rampart scandal  must confront a violent deadly compromised landscape at every turn. What I most liked about Dirty is that it was an action movie that didn't require you to leave your brains at the door.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dirty will unfortunately draw comparison to Training Day but if you can get past the similarities of the cover of this book the content will come back strong and stand alone as a polished original. This movie reminds you that with decisive deliberate direction an excellent score and solid performances a routine storyline can serve as the boilerplate foundation for the more difficult aspects of filmmaking to shine.Collins has always been a favorite of mine to watch almost singlehandedly destroying stereotypes of Latino actors while simultaneously stewing in the shallow pool of roles offered him. His stand out performances in 187 and Tigerland have only been improved in Dirty with his ability to bring humanity and sincerity to his otherwise bland characters. Gooding pulls it off in the end almost through the sheer pleasure of watching him portray such an offtype character that the over the top performance was a necessity to draw your attention away from the believability of his playing the role. It was as if with every screamed expletive he was daring you to not take him seriously.Dirty is a poster child film for how a director through what would appear to be either deliberate clever and wise choices for the cast and crew or was very lucky in the outcome. But to this writer that is the magic of filmmaking. The end result of this film looks like a seamless collaboration of professionals turning out what is an interesting exciting visceral portrayal of bad cops and worse cops trying to outplay the system. Luck can only take you so far and no doubt every component played a part in making this film work. The cinematography keeps the grit and grime of the streets in full focus and the action and sometimes brutal violence is always just around the corner to snap your attention back into place as the plot moves forward.To compare this movie to any other is doing it a disservice. Dirty takes any preconceived lemons it clearly had as a disadvantage going in and made lemonade worth a second glass. Try it you won't be disappointed.710  Maddis".

I am sorry to say that that potential was lost after the first 15 minutes of the film. The first and major contributor to my sentiment was Gooding attempting to sound like a street cop. Not only was his flagrant use of a well known expletive forced but the manner in which he attempted to use cuz was just awful. I don't consider myself a product of the streets but my surrounding barrio and years of film watching have enabled me to spot an actor trying to sound hood and failing horribly. Second point is the subtitles. There were subtitles to English!!! Sure Wyclef was attempting to mimic the accent of people from Jamaica or nearby provincescountries but give the audience some credit...or at the very least a sense of authenticity.I could go on and on but there are too many other horrible clichs and subplots that make this a lackluster movie. It still may be better than Battlefield Earth but it definitely deserves to be placed on the shelf of awesomelyawful movies...right next to Pearl Harbor and The Musketeer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dirty lives up to its title. This really is a Dirty movie and not quite on Training Day's level but it's still a decent DTV attempt. Some of the language in this movie is very hard to bare. Cuba's character mutters constant swear words and his character is very abrasive and often physically abusive but it's definitely one of his best performances DTV wise. I really dislike movies that give away part of the ending at the start of the movie with the narrative and that kind of ruined the impact of the ending for me on this one too. I will say the ending to this movie is impactive and quite sad in a way as well. Cuba and Clifton Collins Jr.'s chemistry is right on target despite them being opposites. The violence is pretty grisly i'm warning you right now. I'm not very squeamish but this hard me turning my head on a couple of occasions to be honest. It's a decent little movie about cop corruption a lot better than I expected.Performances. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good here. He is despicable unlikable and deserved his fate completely at the end. It was great to see him play against the type and I relished the fact that he did. Clifton Collins Jr. is very solid as our reluctant hero and storyteller. Well I wouldn't call him a hero by any means but compared to Cuba's character it is the best we have. I enjoyed his conflict with Cuba. Keith David and Cole Hauser do well in their limited time.Bottom line. It is not a pleasant viewing nor will it set your world on fire. Dirty however for a DTV film it's not that bad at all. Worth a look.610".

Some of the language in this movie is very hard to bare. Cuba's character mutters constant swear words and his character is very abrasive and often physically abusive but it's definitely one of his best performances DTV wise. I really dislike movies that give away part of the ending at the start of the movie with the narrative and that kind of ruined the impact of the ending for me on this one too.

The only people who probably enjoy this film are the gutter people who feed on mind numbing gangsta rap with its twisted nihilistic and perverse view on society. This is a vile unwatchable film about corrupt street cops that no discerning film viewer could endure. The implausible nefarious portrayal of a corrupt police unit is so overboard that the script's credibility is totally lost. The script would have been more believable if it was about a street gang that disguised themselves as police to help pull off a drug dealscam from a rival gang. The moral struggle that the main character Clifton Collins Jr. unsuccessfully deals with could just as easily work without the badge. If the unrelenting verbal diarrhea were to be removed from the script this would be a silent movie. The verbal expletives literally outnumber the actual words of true dialog. I am disappointed that an actor of the caliber of Cuba Gooding Jr. would accept a role in a film that unabashedly defames and dishonours the police in such a blatant and untruthful manner. If he was trying to throw off his good guy image with his role in this film I think he has done his career a lot more harm than good.".

Cuba Gooding and Clifton Collins give excellent performance as the lead characters. In particular Cuba shows his versatility again and is definitely something to watch. As far as supporting performances Cole Hauser stands out with another of his long list of notable supporting appearances.What adds most to the feel of the movie is the soundtrack and background score.

Yes we are all aware of the Rampart scandal that perhaps is the nidus for this story but what DIRTY shows is a group of despicable foul mouthed evil crime perpetrating opportunists who will do anything to make a hit  all 'protected' by a police force that condones their actions.Cuba Gooding Jr. is a fine actor whose recent roles have not allowed him to demonstrate his craft. Perhaps he wanted a role as a bad guy in the vein of Denzel Washington Richard Gere et al who opt for smarmy roles to 'prove' their acting grit! but he is artificial in this film as a man willing and waiting to do filthy deeds without conscience. He is paired with the also fine actor Clifton Collins Jr. as the Hispanic equivalent of Gooding's Black bad cop. The story jumps all over the place with so many subplots and characters identifiable only by their total body tattoo differences and hampered by a script that depends on the F word and the N word and MF word as a means of communication.Gooding and Collins are partners and while Gooding seems to be the major offender to decency Collins does little about it leading us to believe he is an innocent victim to the Internal Affairs investigation that appears to be the endpoint of this drama. Just when the viewer is saturated by the dirt of this film's techniques and story the gritty collision of loyalty and redemption enters at the very end making reflection on the tale that has been assaulting our senses almost embarrassing for the viewer. In the police code what is permissible what is wrong what is justifiable? Fighting crime with crime doesn't seem a viable answer but we are left asking the question 'What is?'

Then came that dreadfully slow night at home a couple of years later faced with a choice on the ol' tube between endless reruns of Three's Company and HBO showing  oh no!  Parenthood.  So I clicked on HBO gritted my teeth prepared for the worst . . .And was wrong.Ron Howard is one savvy filmmaker.  Maybe one of the savviest I'm not sure. But I do know that to make Parenthood he combined his savvy with all the heart he could muster which was plenty apparently and that the result is a masterpiece.Virtually every aspect of parenting is examined moreover it is done in a way that  miracle of miracles!  causes you to think and to feel every bit as much as it makes you laugh.  Throat lumping up?  Not to worry here comes another bellylaugh to smooth it out.The key to the film's message may lie with Jason Robards' speech There's no goal line in parenting no end zone where you spike the ball and that's it . . .  or it may lie with Keanu Reeves  You know Mrs. Buckman you need a license to drive a car or buy a dog . . .  or it may simply be Gil Buckman's Steve Martin heroism in salvaging his emotionally disturbed son's birthday party then again it might be embodied in the frantic stressed out stoicism of Dianne Wiest's single mom character as she comes to grips with her teenage daughter's choices and impending motherhood.  But wherever you find it herein the message is simple and profound Parenthood is nothing less than heroism on a daily basis.  Quiet unheralded underappreciated heroism.One of the finest things about this movie is that nobody steps out of character.  There are no miraculous revelations no nickoftime cavalry charges or character transformations.  Characters here solve their individual dilemmas by growing WITHIN their characters.  And realistically at that.It's been said that a really good story leaves its author crying as heshe writes the final pages.  Sometimes  not often enough  a really good movie can leave a reviewer the same way as he finishes his commentary crying and laughing simultaneously.Well don't just stand there!  Someone get me a Kleenex!!".

Not to worry here comes another bellylaugh to smooth it out.The key to the film's message may lie with Jason Robards' speech There's no goal line in parenting no end zone where you spike the ball and that's it . . .  or it may lie with Keanu Reeves  You know Mrs. Buckman you need a license to drive a car or buy a dog . . .  or it may simply be Gil Buckman's Steve Martin heroism in salvaging his emotionally disturbed son's birthday party then again it might be embodied in the frantic stressed out stoicism of Dianne Wiest's single mom character as she comes to grips with her teenage daughter's choices and impending motherhood.  But wherever you find it herein the message is simple and profound Parenthood is nothing less than heroism on a daily basis.  Quiet unheralded underappreciated heroism.One of the finest things about this movie is that nobody steps out of character.  There are no miraculous revelations no nickoftime cavalry charges or character transformations.  Characters here solve their individual dilemmas by growing WITHIN their characters.  And realistically at that.It's been said that a really good story leaves its author crying as heshe writes the final pages.  Sometimes  not often enough  a really good movie can leave a reviewer the same way as he finishes his commentary crying and laughing simultaneously.Well don't just stand there!  Someone get me a Kleenex!!";

	schema:reviewBody "This might very well be the most balanced and excellent mix of drama and comedy I have ever seen. I already loved Parenthood when I was a kid and I perhaps love it even more now as a grownup when I recently watched it again.Perhaps the greatest strength of this movie is in its realism. Sure every character and event in the movie are somewhat silly and overthetop but yet they also feel like very real problems and persons at the same time. This due to the great portrayal of the drama elements in the movie. These are real recognizable or not familyissues portrayed in this movie. It handles some delicate subjects but never without a smile as well. It makes this movie both touching and warm to watch as well as fun and amusing.Reason why both the dramatic and comical elements all work so well is also thanks to the cast. The movie has many well known actors in it. Tom Hulce especially impressed me and also Steve Martin was a great leading man from the period when he was still funny in movies. Solid as always were Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Wiest. Rick Moranis surprisingly doesn't play a loser this time but he still is a nutty character in the movie. He shows in this movie that he also has some real acting skills. Keanu Reeves is also good in his role from the period when he appeared mostly in just comedies. The still very young Joaquin Phoenix also plays a great and quite big role in the movie.It has some totally unforgettable moments in it both comedywise as in its drama. It all makes this movie one of the most warm and subtle movies ever made. It doesn't try to be funny it doesn't try to be melodramatic. The end result of it all is an extremely well balanced and crafted mix of drama and comedy that works on both levels. You can watch this movie as a drama or as a comedy so fans of both the genre will be pleased with this movie that surely does not disappoint in any way.An early subtle Ron Howard masterpiece that is criminally underrated here on IMDb.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

She was great in this and in Running on Empty. Who plays that grandmother? She's great! Mary Steenburgen Rick Moranis... Goes on and on. And the great Jason Robards.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful film that takes full advantage of both a great script and an outstanding cast.  It shows with equal measure the joys and pain of parenting.  We see great examples of dysfunction and love.  It is sentimental but not to the point of being unreal.Steve Martin gives a tremendous performance as a father who wants to be everything that he feels his father wasn't loving caring and involved in his children's lives in a positive manner.  He is torn between his duties as a provider and the need to be there for his children.  Mary Steenburgen is wonderful as always as a devoted wife and mother.  She tries to keep her family on an even keel and to soothe their anxieties her husband included. She conveys so much with just body language and has a smile that seems to come from her soul.  Jason Robards is his usual powerful self as the patriarch who made himself a success but at the expense of his family.  He recognizes his mistakes and finds a chance to make some amends in his twilight years.Diana Weist is the single mother trying to provide for her troubled children and find some life for herself.  She wants to give her kids what they want but is torn between giving to them and watching them make mistakes.  Rick Moranis is the parent who wants their child to succeed to the point of smothering their childhood.  He wants the best for his child but fails to see that childhood should be as much about play and new experiences as it is about education.  His wife wants the same but wants their daughter to be a little girl too.  She also wants another child but feels that she is alone in this area and is losing her husband.  Tom Hulce is the irresponsible youngest sibling who has run off whenever things have become too tough.  Things get tough when you are a parent and he stays true to form.The young actors are all tremendously talented and the little ones are quite cute.  It is no surprise that these performances are so good given that the director was a child actor himself.  Ron Howard really knows how to bring the best out of young actors as well as their adult counterparts.There is so much to savor in this film.  There are great laughs and touching moments.  There is drama and satire.  There is the joy of watching great character actors display their craft.  There are the clearly defied roles with great complexity that are easy to identify with.This is a film that all parents should see. Kids should see this when they are old enough to understand the sacrifices that their parents make for them and why they make the decisions that they do.  Parenting  it's the toughest job you'll ever love!".

But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthood is the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters have nuanced complicated and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REAL PEOPLE and unlike many of the onefaceted characters seen in movies today.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius Martin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere conforming perfectly to his role and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch for great appearances by Tom Hulce perhaps best known as Amadeus poor guy where'd his career go? and a very young Joaquin Phoenix as Gary.All in all a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a 910!!".

I think we all forget that our parents are people too every once in a while and I ask my mom and dad how they did it but they always tell me there is no book to raising a child you just have to do the best you can and Parenthood is a comedic and sometimes serious interpretation of what all parents go through in the greatest and scariest times of their kid's lives.We go through four siblings Gil played by Steve who is trying so hard to be the perfect dad to his four children but finds it to be too much than he expected. Larry played by Tom who can't seem to grow up and accept his responsibility to be a dad. Helen played by Dianne who has rebellious kids and she's a single mom learning how to handle her high school married daughter.

	schema:reviewBody "'Parenthood' is an alright comedy. I mean it's funny. I like watching it to identify the places in my hometown where it was filmed. I normally don't like Ron Howard movies nor even Steven Martin comedies he's the same character in every movie. Instead I consider the real gem of this movie to be Diane Wiest and Jason Robards. They really make this a great movie despite it's rather generic approach to dealing with parenting issues.The story concerns several families each related to each other and each dealing with what would hardly be a typical Ron Howard familythe standard uppermiddle class white Hollywood family who's conflicts seem to pale in comparison to those of 'real' people though the situations might be funny. Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen are Gil and Karen Buchman parents of three strange kids. Justin is the primary worry diagnosed with some sort of anxiety disorder his father often tries too hard to somehow correct Justin's problems with obsessive parenting. But what he's really doing is acting out in response to the lack of fathering his own father gave him.His father is Frank Buchman played by the terrific late Jason Robards. He deals with several realms of parenting when his irresponsible son Larry Tom Hulce shows up suddenly on his doorstep and announces he's going to be staying a few months. He tries to play everything off smoothly to hide his gambling addiction and a horrid debt and his father is struggling with the difficult decisions he has to make with his save his son...or not. And in a way Frank seems to try to make up for his own absenteeism with his own boys by taking on a surrogate son Larry's own son Cool.Then there's Nathan Rick Moranis and Susan Harley Jane Kozak who are having difficulties raising their own children just like everyone else. Nathan spends all his time training their three yearold daughter to be a supergenius while Susan wants Patty to be allowed to behave like a normal child and not have to worry about all that crap while she's young. Basically she wants Patty to have a childhood. Plus she's feeling abandoned by Nathan who spends nearly all time on his pet project Patty the genius.The last of our families and perhaps the funniest in the whole movie is that of Diane Wiest as Helen Buchman and her two kids Julie Martha Plimpton and Gary Joaquin Phoenix. Diane is a single mother and one who tries very hard to communicate with her kids though she does tend to get too judgemental consistently referring to ToddKeanu ReevesJulie's boyfriend as that Todd etc. Julie is the wild teenager type who thinks she's all sure about growing up so fast and rushes into a difficult relationship with a wellmeaning dummy named Todd. Gary is the quiet kid who just wants a guy around to talk to as he's at that age of discovering girls and everything. I find this to be a funny movie. Like I said Diane Wiest as the cynical sarcastic mother trying to get through to her sometimes braindead kids is the best character in the movie and certainly the one with the funniest lines. She's terrific. I love Grandmother Buchman too though she hardly get's any dialogue or screen time. What a pity. She's the one who comes up with the life is most interesting if you consider a rollercoaster rather than run for the safety of the ferris wheel. But the movie despite being funny manages to wear out its welcome. For one thing Steve Martin makes an incredibly annoying character as usual and the way he just has to be so damned precise and inyourface about everything can be quite irritating as well as overriding the role of his wife. Also there is one sad realization about the whole thing the possibility of getting stuck doing the same thing for the rest of your life makes me think about how many people hate going to their same job or same career day in and day out. But more importantly the theme of the difficulties of parenthood and life and relationships being no easy task is made quite clear and sometimes too often. They've taken about every situation they can to create as screwed up a family as possible to make this point. Okay we get it. By the time the ending arrives few of the scenes are memorable. Diane Wiest as Helen Buchman seems more realistic when she predicts that Julie and Todd don't stand a very good chance of being together very long. Jason Robards too as Frank Buchman when he is told that Larry is going down to Chile to check out something that a business associate told him about either he was going to get killed by his creditors or he was going to run from them knows that he'll never see Larry again. Frank is so sure that he even asks Cool if he'd like to stay with him and his wife. But beyond that everything is so painstakingly ridiculous. Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen as Gil and Karen stand at the school play glaring happily into each others eyes realizing that hey even though they've had a hard enough time raising three young children that a fourth one would be welcomed why are babies always used as symbols of problemsolving in the movies?. Nevermind how things are going to change when it grows up and behaves as children and later as teens do it's just how they are...is it always a problem like this movie suggests?. And the stupid ending with Rick Moranis as Nathan serenading his wife in front of her science class. Cute but stupid. And the finale was the just an absolute gagfest. In order to make everything super peachy I suppose this is the thrilling part of the rollercoaster ride they have the finale at the hospital where almost all of the Buchman women are pregnant. What the hell is this suppose to do? It's so stupid and much too much a Hollywood ending if there ever was one.".

It's great to see Steve Martin not having to do so much slapstick unlike some of his other movies. Their really isn't a plot it's just showing the lives of a bunch of relatives. Jason Robards is the grandfather and Steve Martin is his son who thought Robards was a bad father. Robards has three other sons including one who owes 26000 to some bookies. Rick Moranis wants his daughter to be a genius so he reads Kafka to her while the mother just wants her to act her age. Dianne Wiest has a lot of problems with her kids like her daughter running away and getting married and her son destroying his father's doctor office just because he couldn't stay with him. Their is a lot more and it's just a really great movie.".

My parents love the movie because they can understand what the cast is going through.  This was the best Steve Martin movie that I have ever seen in my entire life.  The supporting cast is phenomenal Keanu Reeves Mary Steenburgen Dianne Weist Rick Moranis and many others.  I think this is one of the first Keanu movies that I've seen besides Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and man doesn't Keanu look so sexy with the shaggy look he's excellent in this movie.  The movie revolves around the life of the whole Buckman family it includes many different relationships too like siblings grandparents parents boyfriend and girlfriend cousins aunts and uncles.  This movie is the perfect movie because it's about a family that's just like everybody else's family and it explains to you what parenthood is all about.".

Mary Steenburgen as his wife and Dianne Wiest as his sister were standouts as were Jason Robards as his father. Helen Shaw as the grandmother was a delight and Rick Moranis was very much in character from his Blew Up... series. Oddly enough in a movie about parenthood other than mostly all the kids having some sort of problems I didn't find them particularly lovable.

There are three reasons for this though. The first one is the terrible script. The second one is awful directing. And last but not the least is the ridiculously pathetic acting. I was never a fan of Steve Martin whose acting abilities to me are as shallow as a puddle but the rest of the cast make him stand out simply by being even worse. The only exception is of course Jason Robards who is in a league of his own here. Actually in some of his scenes I felt like I was watching a different movie all together a smart touching sometimes funny movie. And then it was back to Steve Martin and his crowd... One last point to make. Here be spoilers. Could there be a more stereotypical clichd and silly ending? The boy catches the ball the father gets the promotion the marriages are saved everybody happily procreates and the family of morons lives on. God bless America. Wow.

	schema:reviewBody "To be a teenage girl when the Spice Girls were around there was no better time to be 12. I admit it I was such a fan of the girl power group. How could you not be? Admit it you say you hated them but secretly you had a poster of Ginger Spice in your closet. They were cute they were fun they were talented and before you knew it they were gone. But for 2 years it was nothing but girl power! So out of the height of their fame we naturally had to see if the Spice Girls were good for something else and that meant a movie! The Spice Girls made a movie to show how crazy their lives were at the time and let them just have fun with it and they did spice up our lives real good.The Spice Girls are enjoying their fame but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. A sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford is trying to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines and even dispatches a photographer to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Annoying film director Piers CuthbertsonSmyth who stalks the band along with his crew hoping to use them as documentary subjects at the same time the girls' manager Clifford is fending off two overeager Hollywood writers Martin Barnfield and Graydon who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this the girls must prepare for a concert at the Albert Hall their biggest performance yet. But between all this craziness would they even want to continue to sing at the price of their friendships? You'll have to see but I'm sure you could figure it out.I think a lot of people are a little too harsh on this film the girls gave it a genuine try. You can tell they just had fun and wanted to do this for the fans. I think there were actually some really funny parts like when they went through the spice boot camp. The whole last scene where they are going through their action scene in London it's so random and just a good time. See what I liked about this film was it's harmless nature. It was made for the fans specifically because we loved them so much. I admit that I'll watch it every once in a while still just to go back down memory lane and it still brings a smile on my face. The songs are so darn catchy I can't help it. There are some very fun cameos that get a good giggle. The story is very predictable and the movie is over the top silly but that is what makes it fun. I'm here to defend the film I think people over analyze things way too much. Sometimes you can't explain it but you just want to let go of the real world and spice up your life a little bit. The Spice Girls may never win an Oscar but they won the world's hearts for 2 short years the girl power may have fizzled a little but I'll take a trip down memory lane any time for Spice World.610".

It's just a guilty pleasure and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too closeminded to see that. The general consensus seems to be It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful! and either they never see the movie or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.Firstly let me say that I am not and was never a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wideopen. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators' and while they didn't have particularly strong voices except perhaps for Mel C they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also my 65yearold father loves this movie and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls but not knowing their music at all. Yes Spiceworld is an exploitation movie BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant saying It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars! when it's obvious that they're not and everyone knows it  there's even a scene at the beginning where he says Yes but can they ACT? and his boss responds with 'Who cares? or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act some are worse than others I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link it's obvious that they're having fun with the script and they don't do too badly at all.The script was another great surprise to me it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the Chief who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager Richard E. Grant and every time we do he is stroking in pure Bond Villain or Dr Evil fashion a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal first it's a cat then a rabbit a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic senseless but hysterical lines like When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not. and The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken. I love that offthewall humour and this movie is full of it. Of course some people just don't GET that kind of humour which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.Other moments I love which elevate this film from couldhavebeendodgy to funny are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver and then having him say lines like on fixing the clogged toilets Hey I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!  which is of course a play on Meatloaf's hit song Anything for Love. Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls which of course were made up for them anyway like Victoria not knowing what to wear and Mel C saying It must be really hard for you Victoria trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress or the little Gucci dress or the little Gucci dress and Victoria responding Exactly! or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued and yelling This dress is dryclean only! or Geri saying Calm down haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'? There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes it's not the greatest but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think and yes it has its cheesy moments but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film whose only aim was to be FUN and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion is in IMDb's Worst.".

These are the greatest pop legends of the 90's Girl Power shook the world and so of course they were gonna exploit it for all their worth but the thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are the cameos the list is endless.Its got more start turns than an Austin Powers movie and thats saying something and great thing is everyone has a sense of humour about their own position even the girls themselves.I grew up with the Spice Girls and was a major fan  I'm 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier  cos now i understand the jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago and i know exactly who all these brilliant actors and musicians who make their cameos.It has great lines a great and beautiful cast and shows the lives of the spice girls at their most normal and bizarre at the height of their fame for the young girls the world over who loved the spice girls this is a great film to bring back the memories of almost 10 years ago.A must for fans  avoid if you had no love for these girls".

These are the greatest pop legends of the 90's Girl Power shook the world and so of course they were gonna exploit it for all their worth but the thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are the cameos the list is endless.Its got more start turns than an Austin Powers movie and thats saying something and great thing is everyone has a sense of humour about their own position even the girls themselves.I grew up with the Spice Girls and was a major fan  I'm 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier  cos now i understand the jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago and i know exactly who all these brilliant actors and musicians who make their cameos.It has great lines a great and beautiful cast and shows the lives of the spice girls at their most normal and bizarre at the height of their fame for the young girls the world over who loved the spice girls this is a great film to bring back the memories of almost 10 years ago.A must for fans  avoid if you had no love for these girls";

You will probably not enjoy. Unless you are looking something 'so bad it's good'. Film goes nowhere and gives you nothing unless you are a fan and enjoy seeing them on big screen mostly singing familiar songs bickering and having fun.

One of the funniest bits in the movie is quite near the end the journey from the hospital to the Albert Hall. The bit with the bus 'flying through the air' was hilarious.

Admittedly I am not exactly the biggest Spice Girls fan but I am extremely open minded but it doesn't matter how open minded you are it is close to impossible to enjoy this big ugly embarrasing piece of film.

The Saint?  Five series seasons in black and white and two series in colour?  Mr. Moore was coproducer of the two color seasons and gets his bit whenever a videotape is sold or the package is aired which is quite often on both counts.

	schema:reviewBody "If you have a playful sense of humor and enjoy films with an early Fellini celebration of lifequirky characters flavor you should make it a point to watch Cousin Cousine. Released in 1975 on the surface this is just an offbeat love story about two middleaged cousinsby marriage who are drawn to each other by a shared playfulness. These kindred spirits awaken in each other a zestful and irreverent attitude toward life that distances them from their large and somewhat strange extended family. They want to experience as much of life as possible the man has made it a practice to change professions not just jobs every three years so that nothing gets stale. They are very open about their affair reasoning that the rest of the family will think the worst anyway. Not surprisingly their affair also distances them from their respective spouses who do not share their funloving and irreverent attitudes.The lovers are played by Christine Barrault nominated for an Oscar and Victor Lanoux. Although they are fun and likable characters most of the comedy in this film emanates from the performances of the actors who play their respective spouses. Guy Marchand plays Barrault's husband as a cranky and pathetic Cassanova whose philandering lifestyle is cramped by his inability to cope with his wife's sudden infidelity. MarieFrance Pisier as Lanoux's neurotic airhead wife subtly steals each scene in which she appears when a character introduces themselves with the revelation that the only time they have ever been happy was during hypnotherapy you know that interesting moments are ahead. And for what it is worth Pisier is breathtakingly beautiful.The affair causes the Marchand and Pisier characters a great deal of pain for most of the film but by the end they have pretty much adjusted to everything. Marchand has resumed his pursue of other women and Pisier has returned to her main source of pleasuretherapy. Marchand's regeneration occurs with his first playful moment he mounts a knife fake in his back and staggers into the living room to the shock of the assembled relatives. While Pisier's regeneration is the best scene of the film. Alone and fully clothed in the bathroom she halfheartedly tries to slit her wrist with a razor blade and falls backward into the empty tub which she unexpectedly finds a pleasant and relaxing place to think. And how appropriate since the bathtub is a device we associate with privacy purgation relaxation openness and regeneration.They say that all films are political and Cousin Cousine is no exception. Films have the power to deconstruct the traditional values of society and this love story is also a social commentary on the hypocrisy and doublestandards of 1970's western middle class culture. And while pointing out these issues it offers psychopolitical messages that each viewer can relate to personally and specifically. The theme is that each day should be a celebration of life experience and growth.The grandfather is shown as someone whose long life has given him a real perspective. He is pleased when his teenage granddaughter reveals that she has discovered sex and found it to be wonderful delighted that she has found something see finds wonderful and amused because her joy is so contrary to the nihilism she had been embracing. He is selfsufficient the widowed grandmother from the other side of the family enjoys being with him but realizes that he is perfectly comfortable and prefers living alone. He is disturbed by the failure of the family to take any significant time from their lives to mourn his brother's passing.The strange antics of the adults in this extended family are a source of great amusement to the observant children. The carnival music score gives the many extended and flowing group shots a pleasing circus sideshow attraction flavor.Note how the film opens with one of families driving to the wedding parents in the front seat brother and little sister in the back seat. The parents are agitated and scolding the children calm and attentive to the experience of the moment. They go out of the scene with the little sister sliding over to be closer to her brother and smiling in adoration. The same little observant girl appears in closeup periodically throughout the film smiling in amusement at the antics of everyone around her. The film ends with the little girl smiling serenely out the window as she watches the lovers leave on their motorcycle.".

And how appropriate since the bathtub is a device we associate with privacy purgation relaxation openness and regeneration.They say that all films are political and Cousin Cousine is no exception. Films have the power to deconstruct the traditional values of society and this love story is also a social commentary on the hypocrisy and doublestandards of 1970's western middle class culture. And while pointing out these issues it offers psychopolitical messages that each viewer can relate to personally and specifically. The theme is that each day should be a celebration of life experience and growth.The grandfather is shown as someone whose long life has given him a real perspective. He is pleased when his teenage granddaughter reveals that she has discovered sex and found it to be wonderful delighted that she has found something see finds wonderful and amused because her joy is so contrary to the nihilism she had been embracing. He is selfsufficient the widowed grandmother from the other side of the family enjoys being with him but realizes that he is perfectly comfortable and prefers living alone. He is disturbed by the failure of the family to take any significant time from their lives to mourn his brother's passing.The strange antics of the adults in this extended family are a source of great amusement to the observant children. The carnival music score gives the many extended and flowing group shots a pleasing circus sideshow attraction flavor.Note how the film opens with one of families driving to the wedding parents in the front seat brother and little sister in the back seat. The parents are agitated and scolding the children calm and attentive to the experience of the moment. They go out of the scene with the little sister sliding over to be closer to her brother and smiling in adoration. The same little observant girl appears in closeup periodically throughout the film smiling in amusement at the antics of everyone around her. The film ends with the little girl smiling serenely out the window as she watches the lovers leave on their motorcycle.";

	schema:reviewBody "Cousin Cousine directed by Jean Charles Tacchella was probably the first French movie I ever watched at least in French with English subtitles. I was in my first year of college French at Indiana University and this movie was suggested by my teacher a very enthusiastic grad student and mentor to all of his students. At that time the Midwest was my birthright and I had rarely traveled outside its familiar confines. I knew that I wanted to get away from where I had lived almost my entire life up until then but I didn't know how to do it or know where to go. I was studying French mostly because it was a required part of an undergraduate degree. I suppose that I just saw it as another course like economics or history. After watching this movie at an offcampus art house movie theater I couldn't help but think that the French were very different from the people I knew. At that time as far as I was concerned different was the same as good. I immediately developed an overlyromantic view of France that I hold to this day. Cousin Cousine also gave me an overlyromantic view of love that I have maintained to this day.I just watched this movie again recently a film that was made in 1975 yet holds up extremely well both as a timeless work of art and as something capable of speaking directly to me. In some ways I think that I haven't changed a single bit over the course of what has been my adult life. I still think this movie is just about the sexiest thing ever put on film a story about two people who become best friends before consciously and deliberately deciding to be lovers.I don't even know where to begin as far as my praise for this beautiful film. I love everything about it even the music remains wonderfully whimsicala lot of movie scores from the 70s are woefully dated. Cousin Cousine has soured me on a generation of American films that don't have the slightest clue about how to portray ordinary people. The central characters are a handsome couple but not movie star perfect. They haven't been airbrushed surgically enhanced and stairmastered to within an inch of their lives. All of the characters in this movie have ordinary if not dumb jobs. Hollywood's idea of a normal person's job is an advertising executive and forget about accurately portraying all of the other details of middle class life. I think it was this movie that started my prejudice for books and movies about ordinary people people I can recognize from my own very ordinary life.If you haven't seen Cousin Cousine I think you should give it a look if you can find it. It should only take about the first 15 minutes or so to turn you into a Francophile.".

The movie's value lies in its anarchic and refreshingly droll drle? spirit. The lovers are the lovely Christine Barrault and her cousin by marriage Victor Lanoux. They win our sympathy because they are such a delightful contrast to the sham and selfpity of their respective mates Guy Marchand and MarieFrance Pisier. Marchand is an especially hilarious cranky type. JeanCharles Tacchella directed this bubbly and yes gallic comedy with wit and sensitivity and you can't help enjoying it immensely. So all this makes adultery OK? Well we at least are supposed to think that. The movie was remade in 1989 as Cousins with Isabella Rossellini and Ted Danson in the two leading roles.".

The reactions of the two effected spouses were very funny too.  The two who were in the affair were very funny as they tried to contrive more and more ways to get back at their spouses.  It was very interesting and not as glossed over as Hollywood films in which it takes the two cheating partners about 17.23 seconds to jump in the sack together.

	schema:reviewBody "Retrospectively speaking this French comedy's dark horse success mainly can be attributed to the fact that it opportunely corresponds with the sex liberation trend in the 1970s not just a commercial hit in its homeland it also has conquered the audience in North America entering Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM race and most absurdly it even procures two other nominations BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY and BEST LEADING ACTRESS for Barrault. Why it is absurd? Simply because it is one of those outof theblue nominations in Oscar's history which don't make any sense to even be encompassed as the fillers among the year's best. COUSIN COUSINE is about two cousins by marriage Marthe Barrault and Ludovic Laloux she is married to a philandering Pascal Marchand and they have a teenage son whereas he is in his second marriage with Karine Pisier and has a teenage girl from his first marriage. The film blithely opens with the wedding of Marthe's mother Biju Garcin the new husband is Ludovic's uncle Marthe and Ludovic meet for the first time and they gradually grow a platonic affinity while Pascal and Karine enjoy a brief fling on which they turn a blind eye. Labelled as a Gallo farce with its radical antimonotony feelgoodism the film is not parsimonious to ridicule all its supporting characters as a mean to attest that the click between two soulmates cannot be bridled by common shackle of marriage or morality and quite obviously the platonic slogan cannot sustain too long in a French romance. Still Director and cowriter JeanCharles Tacchella steadily presents their inappropriate relationship through the prism of family gatherings a wedding first a funeral follows then another wedding and the film ends on Christmas eve each time Marthe and Ludovic become more and more intimate meanwhile Pascal and Karine's senses of jealousy and exasperation become more and more comical to behold.Granted one cannot speak ill of the nonchalant attitude and freewheeling spontaneity of the film's core romance Barrault and Lanoux register convincing chemistry through the journey sauntering with tacit rapport sharing a knowing smile revelling in their firsttime copulation in a hotel or bathing together while facing their respective nuclear families they never sink to awkward evasions or flagrant lies to their spouses or stage a scene to befit their own benefit.Guy Marchand occasions most of the buffoonery as a deplorable womaniser cannot overcome the blatant adultery of his wife the only threatening moment comes when he fiddles with a pistol but indeed he is really not that gruesome kind he is vengeful truly but not homicidal. MarieFrance Pisier comes off appreciably as a jittery trophy wife who is much interested in her sleep therapy than her husband openly admits she doesn't mind Ludovic's affair but to really assimilate the facts and convey a healing process it is another pair of shoes for her.Overall this lighthearted relationship comedy is a runofthemill novelty from 70s actually it has spawned a Hollywood remake COUSINS 1989 by the very prosaic Joel Schumacher and as expected the rehash is a much more forgettable offering. However Tacchella's career has already hit its crest in his second feature and all his luck runs off since then he retires permanently in 1999.".

Interestingly enough in both the Actress and Screenplay categories there were two foreign nominees apiece Barrault and Liv Ullman in Ingmar Bergman's FACE TO FACE and for Screenplay Lina Wertmuller's SEVEN BEAUTIES and incidentally both directors made the cut among the final 5 nominees for Best Direction! Barrault and her female costar MarieFrance Pisier a Cesar winner herself here and for my money more deserving of an Oscar nod than the latter are the only familiar names in a sympathetic cast even director Tacchella seems to have been a onehit wonder. Bafflingly COUSIN COUSINE had been 'announced' as an upcoming Criterion title since the earliest days of DVD in fact the copy I watched culled from a US TV screening sports the telltale Janus Film header before the film's opening credits but this release never came to pass! For what it is worth this is one of the earliest examples of a Gallic success being revamped for Hollywood consumption when it was remade by Joel Schumacher as COUSINS 1989 with Ted Danson Isabella Rossellini and Sean Young.In any case the plot line is simple enough an extended family is reunited for two weddings and a funeral anticipating the popular 1994 British farce FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL by 20 years! and a series of infidelities come to the fore between two particular couples. Barrault's chronically womanizing husband Guy Marchand had been cheating on her with among many others the vulnerable Pisier whose own restless spouse Victor Lanoux starts an initially secretly platonic but subsequently openly passionate affair with Barrault. There are several memorably delightful episodes which add to the charm of the film during the wedding reception of Barrault's mother the groom proposes to sing but when vetoed proceeds to indulge in mooning baring his buttocks in public when Marchand decides after the opening wedding ceremony to mend his philandering ways he is shown running from one flame to the next to end their relationship...ultimately being thrown off a bus by the burly female driver! at the second marriage Marchand again keeps getting into fisticuffs with the bridegroom's father a former business partner who had defrauded him etc. The whole is set to a jaunty musical accompaniment courtesy of yet another obscure element one Gerard Anfosso.".

	schema:headline " Abominable look at failed faithless marriages about which no one cares";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Cousin Cousine when it was released and saw it again this evening. In the guise of a light comedy with twinkly peppy little music this movie is virtually a dirge for matrimony but is yet more striking for the gaiety with which humiliation is deliberately caused the outsider and the astonishing ease with which even youngsters treat their parents' abandonment of their marriages. It is an extraordinary movie  as foreign from reality in its treatment of the young children's reaction to their middle class parents' humiliation of their other parents before all their relations as any science fiction movie. SPOILERS Moreover the movie shows the utter indifference of those alive toward those newly dead  the impatience to leave the funeral the distraction at the gravesite by the possibility of sex with an attractive stranger an absence of family feeling so devastating that the brother of the deceased cannot get a single person from the family to lunch with him upon the funeral's conclusion  exams work swimming all take preeminence. Although presented as a comedy this is one of the gravest indictments of the destruction of the family. The protagonists  a man who's destroying his second marriage by his deliberate infliction of humiliation upon his second wife in front of his daughter   he pushes his wife into attempted suicide and attempted abandonment of her stepdaughter and a woman who repeatedly says she sought to kill herself a year before has previously been unfaithful to her husband and now does so again in spectacular fashion  before her young son. Their spouses a man whose train of affairs has led him to merely 30 fewer than Casanova and a woman whose inability to cope with her husband's feckless approach to life e.g. the changing of jobs every three years has led her to most enjoy sleeping  these two will leave their spouses to have sex during the course of the wedding reception of their spouses' mother and uncle. In its portrayal of a family past all caring the movie is fascinating. As the rest of the family celebrates the birth of Christianity in one room two of the members commit adultery in the next  yet other family members pleased at the humiliation prevent their interruption. The amazing thing is the absence of the humiliation's effects on the zombielike remainder of the family who seem to romp a in the knowledge that their parents and children sisters and cousins will again divorce due to the betrayal of their spouses and b in the humiliation of their parents. But perhaps the effects are indeed there  one daughter announces her intention of killing all human beings  when she announces her retraction of the decision  it is only because human beings are not worth her trouble  and the other couple's son is often cranky  he wants to go home but must wait for his father to finish sex with another. The stories the children tell each other all revolve around the debauchery of family members the pictures the female child takes at weddings are of fornicating members of the family the drunken exhibitionism of the grandfather and the sickness of other drunken members. Toward the end of the movie the girl announces to her grandfather that she had sex the previous week  the grandfather kisses her forehead! Perhaps the moviemaker does realize the awesome effects of the debauchery on the family. The movie is quite dark  the female protagonist asks that she be made to cry because she has never been able to do so  the male middle aged protagonist who shrugs when asked about what work he would ever like to do in life. Neither has any sympathy for the spouses upon whom they seek to inflict public humiliation as frequently as they can  at family weddings at family funerals at gatherings at restaurants. When one spouse leaves after attempted suicide there is parental indifference and smiles by the children.  End of Spoilers  This is an amazingly creepy and depressing movie.".

SO when THEIR spouses get together and build a friendship and then eventually sleep together you have some sympathy for them. BUT what about the children? They both have kids and one of them is pretty young but all they are concerned about is their infatuation and getting back at their unfaithful spouses. While this might have been accepted by audiences when the film was released I just felt this was ugly and selfish. They could have divorced their slimy spouses but neither showed any regard for the innocent kids. The film is wellmade but way too selfcentered to have any positive lasting message.".

A BIG hit in the US and even nominated for Best Foreign Film this is a lightweight fluffy and totally unremarkable film. It's flatly directed and the story wanders all over the place. It also presents adultery as being no big deal !!! At the beginning when Marthe's husband Pascal is breaking up with the multiple women he's been sleeping with it's presented as cute charming and even funny! This was obviously long before AIDS but I still find that attitude pretty disgusting. Adultrey is not funny and cute and shouldn't be presented that way. Seriously how about the kids in the respective families? Their feelings or thoughts are never bought up. To make it worse it ends with Marthe and Ludovic run away with each other and THIS is presented as a good thing!!!! The morals or lack of them in this film is bewildering. It gets a 4 only because the whole cast is good it IS pleasant if morally bankrupt and Barrault and Lanoux play off each other well. There's also some minor female nudity. I can't recommend this at all but a lot of people liked it back in the 1970s. Use your own judgment.".

Their storyline is thus the most heartwarming of all.The two soldiers from opposing forces provide much of the slapstick of movie and they are very good with exceptionally funny facial expressions.And lets not count Lena Farugia and Hans Strydom out who play a doctor of law from New York and a zoologist on assignment C their oppositeattract romance is rather stereotypical but Lena in particular is such a charming delight that I forget how much Strydom looks like Tom Selleck instead wonder why Lena had not since made another movie  yes really sad   she couldve been a big star.So in the end one very funny little film worth every penny and more to rent or buy. Keep some bandaids with you while watching as you may get some stitches in your side.".

	schema:headline " A worthwhile sequel that's a microcosm of South Africa";
	schema:reviewBody "Series note While it's not imperative to watch The Gods Must be Crazy 1980 first it's recommendable. If you watch II before seeing I it might act as a slight spoiler to I for you.Set an unspecified amount of time after the first film Part II has Xixo N!xau living back with his tribe of bushmen in the Kalahari. His children ask to go with him on a murulacollecting trip. He's reluctant to take his small son because he says that if his small son is not as tall as his bow it's too dangerous. His small son talks him into it anyway. But not too long into the trip Xixo and another bushman find signs of an injured elephant. He sends his kids back home but a large truck driven by poachers sidetracks them. Xixo's kids end up in the back of the truck unable to jump off once it starts rolling.Meanwhile Ann Taylor Lena Faugia a lawyer from New York has traveled to Africa for a convention where she is supposed to deliver a lecture. Her group is staying at a safari lodge. While there a ranger hits on her and talks her into going for a short safari flight in a twoseater airplaneglider. While away they run into Stephen Marshall Hans Strydom who ends up hooking up with Ann instead. In another thread there are a number of military vehicles riding along the edge of the Kalahari. We eventually meet two men on opposing sides of the intermittent skirmishes that have been occurring in the area.Like the first Gods Must be Crazy Part II's plot sounds overcomplicated on paper. But also like the first film writerdirector Jamie Uys shows himself to be a master of handling a number of concurrent threads that gradually merge. The film is never confusing or incoherent as it would be in less capable hands.The bad news however is that part of the reason for the above is that Uys used the first film as something of a template for this one. The threadsbushmen military guys and experienced rangerDr. guy with an attractive fishoutofwater woman with whom there is a budding romance are direct parallels to the first film as are the way they develop and merge as well as some specific comic scenarios. The bushman is searching for something that brings him into contact with the others. There is a wreck of sorts that leaves the fishoutofwater woman and the ranger stranded in the bush. The woman gets her dress caught on something so that she shows some skin and it emphasizes the building romanticerotic tensions the military guys and poachers are bumblers who can't shoot straight and so on. It's not that any of this material is bad most of it is quite good actually or that I subtract points for formula. It's more that the film is bound to remind you of Part I's similar scenes and Part I is a work of sublime genius.However there is a major thematicsubtextual difference from Part I. The first film was a parablelike satire of culturesocietycivilization that suggested that maybe we'd made some missteps and should reconsider where we'd ended up culturally. Although there are hints of the same ideas here Part II's most prominent themessubtexts are much less ambitious and maybe less universal but no less enjoyable.Uys sets Part II almost exclusively in the bush. There are neither the cities nor villages of Part I. Instead Uys seems to present something of a microcosm of South African culture circa 1989 against a functionally abstract backdrop.Ann and the other characters in her group whom we only see very briefly represents both suave urbanites and the plethora of tourists who head to the area for ecotourism. Xixo and his fellow bushmen represent the various native groups who have tried to go about business as usual as much as possible while having to adapt to the ways of nonindigenous per more current anthropological history at least peoples who have come to occupy and often control the natives' land. Stephen represents the nonindigenous who have tried to also adapt themselves to their adopted country and its environment to live in harmony with both the natives and the land. The two poachers represent all of the opportunists who have tried to exploit the area and its resourcesnot intending to do it harm exactly but not caring if they do either as long as it doesn't affect their profitcomfort margin. And the military guys represent regimentation political control and the constant armed conflicts in the area whether official or not engaged in by natives and the nonindigenous alike who have all chosen a nonnative lifestyle dictated by ideas of possession lawsrules control force and so on. While these are not the only groups in the region they represent the primary conflicting interests that underlie much of the tension the area has experienced in the past and continues to experience even now if in a less formal and violent way.While Uys doesn't employ the unusual editing of Part I with its extreme timeaction manipulations during the course of scenes and single shots to the same extent there is a bit of it here but it is very subtle and he doesn't amp up the spoof nature of the film as much the bushmen speech isn't so comically exaggerated via overdubs for example he present even more beautiful cinematography with a lot of fantastic desert shots plus more suspense utilizing native fauna. I think I prefer the score in this film also.Part II is funny but the tone isn't quite as madcap and there isn't quite as much slapstick although there still is plenty to be had as Part I. However this is still a more than worthwhile sequel to a masterpiece.".

Along the way he encounters a couple of dueling soldiers trying to capture each other and two doctors Stephen Marshall Hans Strydom and Ann Taylor Lena Farugia who are having troubles of their own.Like the first film the three leading actors gave off a lot of physical comedy from Xi's surprised and confused expressions as he spots the foreigners to the awkward chemistry between Marshall and Taylor. While not much to a story compared to the first film with just a lot of running around bumping into wild animals and getting lost in the desert there are still a bunch of innocent slapstick and laugh outloud comedy that will sure captivate an audience. I especially enjoyed Lena Farugia's performance as Ann Taylor and it's fun watching each character's misadventures in the big hot desert.Jamie Uys did a pretty good job directing this movie carefully assimilating the primitive villagers with the modern people. It's more nonstop fun laughter and entertainment.Grade B".

Lena Farugia playing beautiful Dr. Ann Taylor is always into the center of the problems and does an astounding job. There are many funny moments like scenes involving the tiny twin engine plane Ann fighting with monkeys over a glass of water and my favorite Hans Strydom's love hate relationship with a wild creature who is stuck to his boot.

	schema:reviewBody "Xixo is one of the Bushmen of the Kalahari. His children Xiri and Xisa come along on a hunt. The kids are on their way home when they follow tire tracks. He get on the truck of the ivory hunters and get stuck as it takes off. Xixo chases after them. Meanwhile Dr. Ann Taylor from NYC is in Africa for a conference. She accepts a flight from zoologist Dr. Stephen Marshall on his ultralight plane. They crash in the Kalahari. Marshall is hounded by a skunk. A Cuban soldier and an African soldier are fighting each other.One of the main problem is that the movie is scattered with five main characters and four others that have big roles. The attention is scattered through all of these characters off in different places doing their own things. The story is all over the place. The slapstick is really broad and silly. The only truly compelling section is Xiri being chased by a hyena. It's something I've never seen before and something really memorable. I don't hate this but it's really dumb at times. Also I don't know how fast a bushman runs but it's unreal that he chased down the truck. The two doctors are not good enough to be funny and the two soldiers are horribly cartoonish.

I was so favorite to be on the set of the 'exodus' scene  the producers were looking for some extras and the info that there is an audition for a movie reached us kids on cb radio. We were hired on the spot and spent two days on an unfinished part of the Autobahn in Lower Saxony playing the 'sausage sellers' for the Heribert character portrayed by the famous Ulrich Wildgruber. He was the one we found most impressive and he filled the term 'stage presence' with a meaning. He was also looking out for us kids and made sure we got enough to drink and to eat on these very hot summer days. It was actually so hot that the guys in the ABC suits had their rubber boots filled with liters of sweat the production company noticed this and doubled their pay. The ambulances you see in the movie are real ones they caused a halt of the shooting when a serious car crash happened on a public road nearby. Lives were saved because the ambulances were at the scene of the crash within minutes and could take care of the 6 severely injured people. Helmut Griem didn't seem to be in a good mood he complained about his digestion and was farting loudly between the takes but just like all the other actors he showed that he was a true professional as soon as the arriflex was running. As so often in movies most of the scenes shot on these days fell victim to the cut probably to keep the pace of the getaway theme. The movie offers no explanation for the disease nor does it have a straight end I can imagine the writers were looking for metaphors representing the insecurity and hopelessness felt in Germany at that time a country stacked with nuclear weapons and struggling for direction. The journey in the movie from the north to the very south of the country could be seen as a cross section of a nation with even the idyllic places in the mountains offering no refuge for the free spirit of the arts. All in all there is a mysterious quality to the movie underlined by the spacey electronic music by Jean Michel Jarre. I recommend this movie because I think it gives a good impression of the time quality and shows the work of several great actors who are not with us any more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Hamburger Krankheit or The Hamburg Syndrome is a West German  French coproduction and the outcome is a Germanlanguage film that runs for slightly over 110 minutes and as such it does not stay far away from the 2hour mark. The writer and director is Peter Fleischmann and this is one of his most known films. The cast includes a couple actors that are still known in Germany today such as Helmut Griem Tilo Prckner Rosel Zech and Rainer Langhans not really for being an actor though. The film is from 1979 so close to 40 years old and is of course in color with sound. It is about the mysterious outbreak of a virus in the German city of Hamburg and the result is not only many deaths but also a social divide between the healthy ones and the sick ones. From that perspective I believe it was an interesting project but sadly the film does not have great love to detail and frequently loses itself in extremely irrelevant scenes or elaborations on characters that are just plain uninteresting. I found this pretty disappointing as the film with the focus on Griem's character early on had some decent potential to become a quality movie. Maybe it could have at 90 minutes max and with better writing on many occasions. The way it actually turned out it is not a failure but far from a success too. I do not recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "An American freighter docks in Marseille and three sailors head for the red light district for drinks and a bit of the old inout inout. The three hit a bar called the KITKAT Club to see if they can find both. The one sailor Jean Pierre Aumont sees a dazzling beauty at the bar and dumps the working girl he is with. The beauty Maria Montez Aumont and Montez were married at the time agrees to have a couple of dances with Aumont. Aumont is completely smitten with Montez and off they go to Montez's rooms.Aumont's ship is leaving next day so early in the morning Montez walks Aumont down to the docks. They stop at a caf for a last cognac. Out of francs he pays the bill in US dollars which catches the eyes of waterfront thugs Jean Roy and Marcel Dalio. Aumont asks Montez to wait for his return from sea. Montez just smiles as she has heard this tune before.They leave the caf Aumont is jumped by the thugs beaten unconscious and relieved of his cash and papers. They give Montez a smile and take off. Aumont wakes up in a hospital with a splitting headache. The police arrive and ask how he ended up there. All he recalls is that one of the men that mugged him was whistling a strange tune.Released from the hospital he goes to the KITKAT to look for Montez. He is refused entry since he cannot pony up the 150 franc cover. Out into the street he goes. His ship left a week ago he is broke and has no papers. He tries the American Consulate but is turned away because he cannot prove who he is. No papers no money and no way to get a work permit. What a mess. Several days go by and things are getting worse. No place to stay and hungry. A young street peddler slips him some oranges and a few clues about possible work.Speaking several languages Aumont finds he can get work as a hawker for the nightclubs. By directing sailors etc to the clubs he gets a piece of the cover. Every night he takes his wages and hits the KITKAT looking for Montez. She is never there. Aumont hears from the boss that Montez had struck gold and has a rich sugar daddy. Aumont does not believe it because he 'knows she loves only him.One night while walking the club's gypsy fortuneteller Lilli Palmer home he hears some strange whistling. He pulls Palmer into the shadows and has a quick look down the alley. Sure enough here come the two thugs who robbed him. Aumont ambushes the pair. Dalio escapes but Roy is killed when he cracks his head open on the pavement following an Aumont punch.Palmer grabs Aumont and quickly rushes him to the gypsy camp where he is hidden in case the Police come. Palmer has a crush on Aumont which of course Aumont does not notice. The Police soon grab up the second thug Marcel Dalio once his dead partner Roy is found. He tells them about Aumont and that he will find him for the Police. The detectives give Dalio 5 days to deliver Aumont or they will charge Dalio with the murder.Aumont learns from the young orange peddler that his ship has returned to Marseille. He pays the ship a visit and finds that the ship is leaving for the States that night. He signs on for the trip back. He also arranges with some of the crew to smuggle the orange peddler on board. He wants the kid to have a better life in the U.S. than he has here.Aumont tells Palmer he is leaving. Palmer sighs and tells him it is best he leave because the Police had searched the camp that morning. Aumont grabs the kid and smuggles him on board with some wine casks. He returns the truck to the merchant and starts back to the docks. Needless to say he does not make it.Just outside the docks he sees Montez sitting in an expensive car. The car takes off before he can reach it. Does he get on the ship or go after his true love? He makes for the KITKAT where he finds Montez showing off her prize mark. Montez ignores Aumont when he approaches with a big grin on his face. But it is me darling! Spouts Aumont. Who? Is Montez's answer. Aumont is stunned.Also in the club is Dalio who grabs a phone and drops dime to John Law on Aumont. One of the bartenders warns Aumont that Dalio had ratted on him. Aumont exits in a hurry just as the cops arrive. He waits in the dark outside of Montez's rooms for her return. Montez shows and Aumont forces his way in.Aumont says. How can you ignore me after you said you loved me? Don't you remember? Montez laughs and responds. I don't even recall your name! Needless to say that was the wrong thing to say. Montez quickly finds hands tightening around her throat. Finished Aumont lets her lifeless body slip to the floor.

	onyx:emotionText "An American freighter docks in Marseille and three sailors head for the red light district for drinks and a bit of the old inout inout. The three hit a bar called the KITKAT Club to see if they can find both. The one sailor Jean Pierre Aumont sees a dazzling beauty at the bar and dumps the working girl he is with. The beauty Maria Montez Aumont and Montez were married at the time agrees to have a couple of dances with Aumont. Aumont is completely smitten with Montez and off they go to Montez's rooms.Aumont's ship is leaving next day so early in the morning Montez walks Aumont down to the docks. They stop at a caf for a last cognac. Out of francs he pays the bill in US dollars which catches the eyes of waterfront thugs Jean Roy and Marcel Dalio. Aumont asks Montez to wait for his return from sea. Montez just smiles as she has heard this tune before.They leave the caf Aumont is jumped by the thugs beaten unconscious and relieved of his cash and papers. They give Montez a smile and take off. Aumont wakes up in a hospital with a splitting headache. The police arrive and ask how he ended up there. All he recalls is that one of the men that mugged him was whistling a strange tune.Released from the hospital he goes to the KITKAT to look for Montez. He is refused entry since he cannot pony up the 150 franc cover. Out into the street he goes. His ship left a week ago he is broke and has no papers. He tries the American Consulate but is turned away because he cannot prove who he is. No papers no money and no way to get a work permit. What a mess. Several days go by and things are getting worse. No place to stay and hungry. A young street peddler slips him some oranges and a few clues about possible work.Speaking several languages Aumont finds he can get work as a hawker for the nightclubs. By directing sailors etc to the clubs he gets a piece of the cover. Every night he takes his wages and hits the KITKAT looking for Montez. She is never there. Aumont hears from the boss that Montez had struck gold and has a rich sugar daddy. Aumont does not believe it because he 'knows she loves only him.One night while walking the club's gypsy fortuneteller Lilli Palmer home he hears some strange whistling. He pulls Palmer into the shadows and has a quick look down the alley. Sure enough here come the two thugs who robbed him. Aumont ambushes the pair. Dalio escapes but Roy is killed when he cracks his head open on the pavement following an Aumont punch.Palmer grabs Aumont and quickly rushes him to the gypsy camp where he is hidden in case the Police come. Palmer has a crush on Aumont which of course Aumont does not notice. The Police soon grab up the second thug Marcel Dalio once his dead partner Roy is found. He tells them about Aumont and that he will find him for the Police. The detectives give Dalio 5 days to deliver Aumont or they will charge Dalio with the murder.Aumont learns from the young orange peddler that his ship has returned to Marseille. He pays the ship a visit and finds that the ship is leaving for the States that night. He signs on for the trip back. He also arranges with some of the crew to smuggle the orange peddler on board. He wants the kid to have a better life in the U.S. than he has here.Aumont tells Palmer he is leaving. Palmer sighs and tells him it is best he leave because the Police had searched the camp that morning. Aumont grabs the kid and smuggles him on board with some wine casks. He returns the truck to the merchant and starts back to the docks. Needless to say he does not make it.Just outside the docks he sees Montez sitting in an expensive car. The car takes off before he can reach it. Does he get on the ship or go after his true love? He makes for the KITKAT where he finds Montez showing off her prize mark. Montez ignores Aumont when he approaches with a big grin on his face. But it is me darling! Spouts Aumont. Who? Is Montez's answer. Aumont is stunned.Also in the club is Dalio who grabs a phone and drops dime to John Law on Aumont. One of the bartenders warns Aumont that Dalio had ratted on him. Aumont exits in a hurry just as the cops arrive. He waits in the dark outside of Montez's rooms for her return. Montez shows and Aumont forces his way in.Aumont says. How can you ignore me after you said you loved me? Don't you remember? Montez laughs and responds. I don't even recall your name! Needless to say that was the wrong thing to say. Montez quickly finds hands tightening around her throat. Finished Aumont lets her lifeless body slip to the floor. He then slowly walks out of the apartment and into the arms of the just arrived Police.The rest of the cast includes Pierre Bertin Roger Blin Gregoire Aslam Jean Marie Simon and Lita Rico.Montez was in Tangier and Portrait of an Assassin.

	schema:reviewBody "From the very beginning of this movie you know what you have let yourself in for when Lee Marvin belts the ship's bosun over the ear with a broom. Followed by Permission to leave the ship then literally jumps ship and swims for the beach.  You realize then that you are in for 150 minutes of a Fordian boisterous  knockabout comedy.   This was the last time that Ford and Wayne would team up together. Maybe this production was a farewell raveup for both of them.  With Lee Marvin thrown in to assist in turning it into a roughhouse just for the hell of it. Added to this pugilistic mixture you have the jumbosized heavyweight Mike Mazurki serving as a French Colonial Gendarme.  As a welcome opposite to the boisterous muscle we have the smooth suave Cesar Romero oozing glossy charm and good manners serving as the colonial governor of this supposed French Polynesian paradise.  Add to that Dorothy Lamour back in the sarong after a long absence as a duskey maidentype decoration. The three children belonging to Doctor Dedham  add a nice childlike innocence to this warring male atmosphere.  Here the softer side of Big John comes to the surface when he tries to comfort the eldest of the three children who becomes emotional over her halfcast origins.  Elizabeth Allen adds a well bred prim and proper touch of class to this nonsensical tropical South Pacific potion.   This movie then has a friendlylike approach to bar room brawling with smiles thrown in.  Harmless and bruising fun all the way.  I always imagine that this kind of rough and tumble movie seems to be cobbled together...somehow.  Then  everything seems to fall into place at the end. The end result being order out of chaos.   It's a sad to think that nearly all the lead characters plus John Ford have all faded out and gone to the big movie studio in the sky.  God help anybody else up there with this lot! That's all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Donovan's Reef is an accurately made funny lighthearted work with some moments of deep poetry. For the audience it is more a relaxing vacation than an actual movie we are transferred to a paradisiac South Pacific island where a bunch of supernice guys our friends John Wayne Lee Marvin Elizabeth Allen Dorothy Lamour Mike Mazurki Cesar Romero make a funny show to entertain us. From the very beginning we find John Ford's characteristic sense of humour we see a family meeting of sullen Bostonian shipowners who all take for granted that their relative Dr. Dedham Jack Warden is living in orgiastic promiscuity over there in the Islands of Sin. And then there is the usual number of harmless fistfights and brawls... and a quarrelloaded lovestory... and many comic misunderstandings... Donovan's Reef is one of the very last cinema appointments of John Ford. Inside this light comedy the old Master inserts touches of his poetic legacy his trademark messages of peace brotherhood antiracism. An evident instance is the scene of the Christmas Mass and Ceremony with the islanders in their native costumes. And then there is an extremely poignant short scene just few seconds. The nice little French priest is walking on a beautiful sunny lawn shaded by palmtrees close to the sea it's the cemetery. We see tombs with a Celtic cross a French cross a David's star then the priest stops at a native barrow covered with garlands and he starts to pray this is the tomb of the late native princess the doctor's wife. After the storms of our life on this earth we become all brothers in a better world. This quiet and dignified yet full of religious hope acceptance of death is one of the most felt and profound themes of Ford's poetry. I recommend Donovan's Reef enjoy the humour the funny action the fine performances of the cast and don't miss the deep poetic touches of the Master John Ford.".

Here in Donovan's Reef the music under the credits sets the mood for the story set on this South Seas Paradise.Secondly this was the last film that John Ford made with John Wayne. I believe this is the most successful actordirector relationship in the history of film by just about any standard you want to use box office quality of work etc. The partnership went out on a high note.John Wayne's westerns are usually a self contained world that operates on the principles of his universe. This film does also but here it is more believable. This mixed group of people really do know the secret of living and let living. And the outside world occasionally does intrude and violently as the World War II background of the principal characters demonstrates.This is also a film about believing stereotypes. John Wayne Lee Marvin and the rest of the island believe Elizabeth Allen will be a racist. She's hurt by the abandonment of her father Jack Warden but she does come to accept her halfsiblings. The film is antiracist but it also teaches a great moral lesson in not making your mind up about people prematurely.The comedy as in all Ford films is heavy handed but I still crack up at Wayne and Marvin and their escapades.This is what the definition of escapist entertainment is.".

This movie is a departure for Ford and Wayne collaborations in that it plays more like a 30s screwball comedy in a scenic location that the typical FordWayne picture that you've seen before Rio Grande She Wore a Yellow Ribbon etc. All the actors do good jobs and the script like a 30s screwball comedy is not likely to happen in real life but fun to watch. The movie was filmed in Hawaii and the scenery is gorgeous. The interplay between Wayne and CoStar Elizabeth Allen Amelia is reminiscent of Wayne and Maureen O'hara. Allen compares favorably to O'Hara in that she plays the strong woman who is not overshadowed by Waynes Guns Donovan. I enjoyed Caesar Romero who played the Governor of the island and is looking to court Amelia only after he checks her wealth in Dun and Bradstreet. Pay particular attention to Lee Marvin's Boats Gilhooley grab a beer and sit back and enjoy.".

Allen compares favorably to O'Hara in that she plays the strong woman who is not overshadowed by Waynes Guns Donovan. I enjoyed Caesar Romero who played the Governor of the island and is looking to court Amelia only after he checks her wealth in Dun and Bradstreet. Pay particular attention to Lee Marvin's Boats Gilhooley grab a beer and sit back and enjoy.";

If compared against Ford's acknowledged masterpieces Dononvan's Reef does not measure up but measured against other escapist films it is a great movie. John Wayne's performance is consistently good and as always believable. Wayne was so real in his films that he is never considered to be a good actor but if you look at his body of work you have to admit he could do it all. His Guns Donovan character is certainly up to snuff and he does well with what he has. His interaction with Lee Marvin as Boats Gilhooley is as good as any of his other brawling headbutting clashes with legends like Ward Bond or Victor McGlaglen. Lee Marvin is very funny and clever in his scenes and very rarely over the top. He could always deliver on a character that was supposed to be likable but mentally ill.Aside from the fun we have a significant plot element of prejudice considering the behavior of Guns Boats and Andre where they hide the Doctor's halfcaste Polynesian children from the AllWhite Bostonian daughter Amelia. Paradoxically we have Chinese stereotypes in the form of goofy looking morons with toothy grins and heavy accents. Still in the end reason prevails in that the young Leilani shows wisdom beyond her years. When she sings a prayer of thanks to the goddess of the canyon where Guns chops down their Christmas tree Amelia asks if she believes in gods and goddesses. Leilani replies I believe in one God as we all do but I respect the customs and beliefs of my people. Amelia subsequently accepts the cultural differences with a gracious bow to Leilani who is being honored as the last hereditary princess of the island. That is a nicely done scene.If you focus on what Donovan's Reef isn't it will be a disappointing film. If you enjoy it for what it is you will have a great time.".

And the kids in this film could not have been cast better. Jacqueline Malouf plays her part as the teen age daughter of Jack Warden so convincingly you forget she was 22 at the time. And Cherylene Lee is the cutest little girl who ever played a part in the movies.The plot is a little lame and Elizabeth Allen is a little young to be playing John Wayne's love interest. John Wayne appears to look the oldest of the three Americans who stayed on the island to help the inhabitants during WWII. But the movie comes off pretty good if you can over look the age difference. Besides Wayne and Allen do work well together. I like to watch this movie from time to time. It's a feel good movie were everything comes out good in the end.".

	schema:headline " Happy Beautifully Shot WWII Polynesian ComedyRomance";
	schema:reviewBody "Donovan's Reef is a strange film I suggest or many reasons and about as physically glowing as a film can be. it is a hymn to Polyneisa to its natural beauty its friendly people and its future from John Ford and John Wayne who clearly by the film's message hope not to see these qualities spoiled. I find it a strong element in the script that the faults of Bostonians an allegorical composite for superrichgovernment connected types are discreditedwith the qualities that describe unrealistic powermongersinability to enjoy simplicity lack of a sense of humor intolerance frigidity in sex inability to seek amity unwillingness to compromise on nonessential points bigotry against all those poorer or differently worship of power...all the traits that define corporateman of the U.S. increasingly throughout the 20th Century but have the opposite quality of truly American values. The film is gentle deliberate in pace and pits two screwball comedy types the seemingly overmacho but lovable brute and the seemingly stuckup by basicallygoodhearted girl against one another and from the beginning as his steely spirit and her iron resolve meet sharply  sparks fly. In the film's focused storyline a youthful wouldbe heiress from Boston Ameiia Elizabeth Allen travels from her cold snowy and overlyformal zone of existence to locate her father missing since WWII. She had been born near the beginning of that Pacific conflict but he stayed in French Polynesia and has never seen her. He stands to inherit millions that is the prospect she needs to prove that he is morally unfit in order to overturn that provision of a will. The assumption is he must be living in sin he's in paradisenot Boston. She is met not by her errant papa but by his friend Guns Donovan an exsailor and a man who who owns the local saloon 'Donovan's Reef'. What she does not know is the father has had three children since by a Polynesian mother. It takes time a brawl over a shared birthday meeting and growing to love the people some tense scenes with her father ceremonies arguments a waterskiing contretemps involving two sorts of bathing suit representing Boston and Polynesia and an opportunistic play for her by the governor that the girl finally meltsin so far as iron can. She decides it is more logical to stay with Donovan than to deny her feelings and her love for the island. Donovan spanks her the Amelia that was but the action is symbolic for from this point on they will be equals his brawling partner will own 'Gilhooley's Reef' and and they will make a life together where people get along and respect one another's differences. . The film is an amiable servicestyle comedyJohn Ford is never far from cavalrypost humorand the build of the romance from a hotlydenied spark through incidents misassumptions mutual interactions and learnings prepares us not for surrender but for a warlike alliance at the end and for a procession of priests friends children Gilhooley her father and a huge French policeman bearing her worldly goods to Donovan's house in train behind the happy couple. The cinematography by William Clothier and the art direction by Sam Imazu and veteran Hal Pereira are I found often stunning. Icons Sam Comer and Darrell Silvera did the set decorations Edith Head the colorful costumes and Nellie Manley the many hairstylings. Wayne's favorite writer James Edward Grant worked with Frank Nugent on a story by Edmund Beloiout of James A. Michener's works uncredited Cyril Mockridge provided original music. In the cast Wayne whose heavyhanded but genial comedic touch went unrecognized for years stands his own with Elizabeth Allen one of the strongest and mostunderrated actresses in the history of the screen. Other standouts in the cast include Cesar Romero as the governor Lee Marvin who gets to be loud and occasionally rambunctious Marcel Dalio Jack Warden Dick Foran Edgar Buchanan Jon Fong Mike Mazurki as the policeman and the children Jacqueline Malouf Cherylene Lee and and Jeffrey Byron. The movie has a Christmas feel about it in some strange manner I believe it is its message of Americanism set against a rather silly and stuffy set of 'republican' attitudes of petty powerwielding that cause it to be so happy a film this was what despite its errors worked for It's a Wonderful Life and Giant for instance. This was also the last that lasted over many years. And we are the richer for it. if you're looking for tons of action for this one it's more of the How Green Was My Valley and Rio Grande sort of atmospheric tale about common sense being taught to those who have been avoiding it by gentle comedic example.".

	schema:reviewBody "This colorful story of Wayne and Marvin getting together for their annual fist fight on their shared birthday might have been preposterous and funny  something along the lines of What Price Glory?

The director was to sell it shortly because it was so old that just keeping it up was a financial burden. Ford hated giving it up as he hated relinquishing anything from the past.

While the film was certainly not 'topdrawer' for either the director or star it is a pleasant diversion and would mark the final 'film' teaming of the legendary pair.Donovan's Reef equal parts South Pacific Hawaii What Price Glory? and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon was already 'nostalgic' by the time it was made as so many actors who would have been Ford 'naturals' in key roles had passed away or were too old to play the characters believably. Thus you have Lee Marvin instead of Victor McLaglen Jack Warden in a 'Ward Bond' role and Elizabeth Allen in a part 'tailormade' for a younger Maureen O'Hara. Even Wayne himself at 56 seems a bit 'longinthetooth' for the physical demands of his role challenging the 32yearold Allen in a swimming race? as well as the romance a fact that even the Duke would agree with this would mark the last time he would play a romantic lead 'winning' an actress so much younger. Also knowing that in less than two years Wayne would lose a lung to cancer one winces at the number of cigarettes he lights up throughout the film. Donovan's Reef was certainly geared to an earlier time and sensibility.All this being said if you can leave 21st century wisdom about tobacco and alcohol abuse at the door the film is a treat with postcard images of Hawaii Lee Marvin an 'overthetop' joy as Wayne's drunken buddyadversary tuning up for his Oscarwinning role in Cat Ballou hilarious support from Cesar Romero as the lecherous GovernorGeneral and Dorothy Lamour who'd starred in Ford's classic South Seas adventure The Hurricane as a husbandhungry chanteuse and in memorable bit roles Duke's son Patrick Edgar Buchanan Dick Foran and Mike Mazurki.I truly wish there WERE a Donovan's Reef in our world...it's the kind of place where I'd want to live!".

	schema:reviewBody "A flawed film certainly but also an enormously beautiful one. It seems like simple frivolous fun at first but I also found it quite moving. I love the setting above all else. The film is set on a small island in the Pacific where elements from a handful of cultures have been mixing for many years already. There are the Polynesians who originally inhabited the island the Japanese who took it over during WWII the French who established a mission there the Americans who washed up there after their ship was sunk during WWII the Australians who occasionally dock there and the various Asians who have established themselves there. Perhaps the most beautiful scene takes place on Christmas Eve where all the people of the island celebrate in a joyously syncretic festival. Silent Night is sung first in the Polynesian and then in English. During a Nativity play the three wisemen are the ancient Polynesian king of the island then the emperor of China and then the king of America. After the king of America delivers his gift a broken phonograph a cloud bursts into torrential rains that easily penetrate through the roof. The audience unfurls a gorgeous rainbow of umbrellas. This sequence brought me to tears.The film's problem is its plot. It seems to just want to exist in its state of sheer beauty but is worried that its audience will walk out if they aren't spoonfed a conventional romantic plot. A young wouldbe heiress from Boston Ameilia Elizabeth Allen goes to this tropical paradise to find the father whom she has never met. She was born near the beginning of WWII and her father although he had survived had decided against coming home. Now he stands to inherit millions of dollars unless she can prove that he is morally undeserving of the inheritance. When she arrives she finds not her father but his friend Guns Donovan who owns a local saloon Donovan's Reef. Donovan is afraid that an uptight Boston woman would immediately reject her father who has since had three children by a Polynesian princess. The most cliched part of the plot has to do with the burgeoning relationship between Donovan and Ameilia. It's basically adopted straight from The Quiet Man which is despite its fame one of my least favorite of Ford's films. Not too much time is wasted on this part of the plot and what is there isn't too bad. Lee Marvin and Cesar Romero have really nice supporting roles as well. In fact Lee Marvin is so funny in his role that I almost wish he had more scenes. 910.".

Trouble comes in the form of Dedham's longestranged daughter Ameilia Elizabeth Allen who travels from Boston to prove her father is not of fit moral character to own a piece of his family's fortune. Donovan hides Dedham's three native offspring by pretending they are his to buy time while winning Ameilia over to the ways of the island and her father.There I just spent more time on the plot of Donovan's Reef than the movie itself does! Donovan's Reef is a rambling mess perhaps an attempt to grab all the comic relief bits from Ford's more serious films and build an entire movie around them. Either that or an excuse for Ford to throw himself a party in the Pacific. Beyond the arrival of Ameilia nothing happens during the film's twohour running time. Gilhooley and Donovan smash up the latter's bar Donovan's Reef while Gilhooley is chased by aging barfly Miss Lafleur Dorothy Lamour. Christmas is celebrated in a rainy church. The French governor of the island Cesare Romero makes eyes for Ameilia.William H. Clothier fills the screen with some remarkable Hawaiian landscapes and Allen gives her part Miss Bunker Hill as Donovan calls her more than it deserves. She also gives Wayne someone to play off of that rouses his better moments in this film something that can't be said of any other member of the cast including Marvin who after a big buildup retreats to the background and acts drunk. Maybe he WAS drunk it's that kind of film.Warden plays his part way too straight and Marcel Dalio as a French priest plays his way too broad. One of these guys is in the wrong picture I think it's Warden. Ford plays everything too broad with annoyingly repetitive musical cues and endless ceremonies. The island seems a haven for Ford's cinematic tics and idiosyncrasies. People don't walk anywhere they file in tight parade two by two. They also burst into sudden song the same dreary number complete with arms waving in unison and invisible instrumental accompaniment. When Ameilia swims onto an empty beach in a revealing bathing suit an unidentified character runs into the frame throws her a towel and runs out.What really annoys me is the script by James Edward Grant. We are asked to side against Ameilia because she took badly to her father's abandonment and because she is stuck up. Yet as soon as she's on the island she's being abused by Donovan doused in the ocean and then dragged across a beach. Grant liked his women being spanked and thrown out of windows but here he really shoves your face in that along with icky cute scenes featuring the Dedham offspring.If not for Allen and Clothier Donovan's Reef would be much worse than it is. As it is it's pretty bad showing even the best of movie partnerships needed the right help to make something for the ages.".

It's a surprising flick and very intriguing whose value more remarkable is the ambiguity that its filmmaker Oliver Stone poses in this . A surreal psychohorror pastiche in which a famous cartoonist of comics named Jonathan Lansdale Michael Caine who lives unhappily with his wife Andrea Marcovicci loses a hand  being severed in an unfortunate car accident that ends with his career and creates a strong tension in their marriage . Soon after  the hand is on the loose with a mind of its own . As a harrowing nightmare the lost hand appears seeking out victims  committing atrocious murders with an obsessive revenge.This first important Oliver Stone film contains chills  thrills  suspenseful and is quite entertaining . It's the first commercial outing in medium budget from Oliver Stone which was not well received by the criticism at the time. . Stone's sophomore directorial shows us a dense  unique  atmospheric and surreal ambient  where the subjectivity seizes the story . There are times when the film that we question whether what we recount and we see is really the case or any other remedy used to deceive and confuse the spectator . Through the film and gradual manner the story is complicating and becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy . This theme about a hand on the loose with a a mind on its own is already been seen in former films such as The Hands of Orlac 1924 by Rober Wiene  Mad Love 1934 by Karl Freund with Peter Lorre and Hands of Orlac 1960 by Edmond T Greville with Christopher Lee and Mel Ferrer . First rate acting by Michael Caine as Jon Lansdale  a comic book artist who loses his right hand in a car accident  though Michael said in a TV interview that the only reason he did this film was to earn enough to put a down payment on a new garage he was having built .Oliver Stone initially wanted Jon Voight to play the lead role but was turned down by him  Christopher Walken and Dustin Hoffman also declined the role . Very good support cast formed by expert secondary actors such as Bruce McGill  Viveca Lindfords  Rosemary Murphy  among others . Furthermore  a cameo by Oliver Stone as Bum . Colorful cinematography with a right management of the camera by Baggot  as the picture packs a turbid dark surreal disturbing atmosphere . Thrilling and tense musical score by the great James Horner .The motion picture was professionally directed by Oliver Stone  though usually panned by mostly critics  nowadays is best considered .Stone returning from the Vietnam war did his first film  it was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam 1971 followed by the gritty horror film Seizure 1974 for which he also wrote the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films Mad Man of Martinique 1979 and this The Hand 1981 . He also wrote many screenplays for films such as Midnight express 1978 Conan 1982 and Scarface 1983.

Making things worse is the rocky relationship with his wife and his daughter being caught up in the middle of it. A drearily intense psychological shocker which bestows a strong tailored performance by a professional Caine but there's also good support offered by Andrea Marcovicci Bruce McGill Annie McEnroe Rosemary Murphy and minor turn by Tracy Walter. The forcefed script plays around with the idea of our central character is he losing his marbles due to the stress of the ordeal and what's going on around him family issues or is his decapitated hand moving around on its own knocking off people. I don't think the mystery is hard to guess but still Stone's direction is ably pulled off in creating an unsettling nightmare with a convincingly edgy Caine to sell it. It's done in a serious tone which this type of story has been recycled many times before and even mocked. But it works here. There's one interesting technique where Stone's changes the screen to a washed out black and white when the hand attacks its like reality is becoming a comic world. Maybe this is a clue especially when blackouts are mentioned? Also the sound FX along with James Horner's music score are simply unnerving and dread induced complementing the paranoid state growing. The camera work is beautifully implemented and there are numerous POV shots of the hand at work. Kind of liked the horrific closing too which throws a spanner into the mix although could have been easily discarded. The Hand was a lot better than I expected.I don't think it was really alive.".

I kind of agree with another reviewer's disappointment at the ending not wrapping it up but The Hand is enough of a thing that I feel neither way about the end. Stone's vitriol for women a characterization many have stuck on throughout his career is very apparent here. Caine as Johnathan Lansdale is comfortable in his beautiful country home crafting a semipopular syndicated cartoon. But his yogic wife Anne Andrea Marcovicci wants to do something with her life and demands a move to NYC. This ends up undoing him but not before he struggles with having his writingdrawing hand severed.

His incredibly prolific filmography 132 appearances and counting in just over 50 years is littered with high highs a handful of alltime classics and 2 Academy Awards and low lows actually from quite early on in his career to unsurprisingly the present day. Still the latter bunch are for all their glaring faults hardly unwatchable and at times fairly tolerable and this rare horror item is certainly among his more interesting failures.Apart from its horror elements and the chance to watch another Michael Caine stinker although as it turns out Jon Voight and Christopher Walken had both previously turned down the lead role the film's main draw nowadays is watching an early though not the first directorial stint from Oliver Stone he even has an amusing unbilled cameo as an illfated tramp and most intriguingly within an exploitation genre from which he has distanced himself completely since then. As I mentioned earlier the film ends up being less the disastrous embarrassment I had anticipated and more a watchable if hardly original horror flick which moves rather slowly but has has the occasional effective shock moment to satiate genre fans. In fact Stone infuses the film with a modicum of style including subjective shots from the marauding hand's point of view delirious dream sequences often shot in monochrome and most incredibly an utterly grisly freak car accident sequence with fake blood galore early on in the film in which cartoonist Caine loses his drawing hand and which sets the narrative in motion.The thing is that while it starts well enough the film is soon bogged down by repetitive marital squabbles between an increasingly unhinged Caine and his freespirited wife Andrea Marcovicci. Besides Caine's stump is not exactly the greatest and when all is said and done we have been here once too often and I only need to point out the other more notable cinematic examples of the walking hand  THE HANDS OF ORLAC 1924 MAD LOVE 1935 THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS 1946 THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962 DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS 1965 and ...AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! 1973  for this film's relative redundance to become apparent. Still that such an oldfashioned concept was revived at this point in time and by these filmmakers is extraordinary in itself but even if they did try to bring it uptodate with the addition of gore and sleaze I can't say I was too surprised by the twist ending which  while not making a great deal of sense and somewhat dispelling the strong similarities with Michael Caine's previous role in another imitative but much more successful slasher DRESSED TO KILL 1980 which had previously been to the fore  provided Hollywood veteran Viveca Lindfors with a very brief but notable cameo as Caine's nononsense shrink.".

Caine asks a few other students but does not get better results. The scene creates a perfect atmosphere of disillusionment and doom. A girl at least makes eye contact and she's not even bad looking. She later looks the Caine character up for some joyless sex and the bottomless sadness that girl displays throughout is simply heart wrenching and epitomizes the dead end aspect of life one would rather like to forget.

I mean Idle Hands was gory funnier fastmoving has a great soundtrack and better but it's still a great flick.The story is about a cartoonist played by Michael Caine who shows his girl a lizard's tail The name of the story the movie is based on which is still moving which foreshadows what happens later in the movie. Then in an automobile accident he loses his hand. They can't find it so they give him a robot hand for a replacement. And the hand he lost was the hand he draws and writes with so they have to have a replacement. He complains the artist is not as good as him and they find a recent cartoon scribbled on. And then there's the murders. A bum played by director Oliver Stone is killed by the hand In a brilliant black and white sequence. Then Caine moves to some place to teach and cheats on another girl. Then other murders happen.I won't give away what else happens. If you want a psychological thriller about a killing hand rent this Or And Now the Screaming Starts. But if you want a killer hand and a comedy see Idle Hands Don't listen to critics.The Hand B Idle Hands A".

John's hand is never found  he has to learn to cope with a prosthetic hand from now on the accident has a big effect on John's life as he can't draw anymore  has to accept a lowly teaching job in a small town called Sarahville in California which means he has to separate from Anne who then has an affair while John is away. As things go from bad to worse John gets the feeling that his severed right hand has a mind of it's own  is singlehandedly ha!killing people around him who have angered him...Written  directed by Oliver Stone this psychological horror thriller with a touch of drama has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it it's certainly not a film that will appeal to a general audience but I think there's enough here to keep one interested throughout it's 100 odd minute duration. The script was based on a novel called 'The Lizard's Tail' by Marc Brandell  centers a tale of psychological drama about a man losing his sanity  failing to adjust after a life changing accident around the old horror clich of the living disembodied hand used to good effect or not depending on your opinion in such films as The Beast with Five Fingers 1947 The Crawling Hand 1963  Dr. Terror's House of Horrors 1964 amongst other's  I thought the concept plot  way the story progresses was pretty good. The character's are good  I was interested in them it's nice to see proper people in a horror film rather than faceless teenagers  while the pace isn't the quickest it develops it's story to the point where the events actually matter  have some significance to the audience. I also liked the way Stone gives the film a certain ambiguity  mystery it's not clear until the end whether John's severed hand is responsible or whether it's John himself committing the murders during his blackouts. Having said that The Hand is not perfect it's undeniably silly who did that car belong to that rolled down the diff on fire  why was that scene even in the film in the first place  I really thought the ending was poor too.The film has a nice clean look about it it looks a bit dated with a very static camera but it's well made. There's not much gore here but there is one half decent money shot here as John gets his hand severed  we see his bloody stump spurting blood everywhere. The severed hand effects are variable  to be honest not that good although I suspect they look better than any modern equivalent CGI effects would. While not overly scary the film does have a few creepy moments here  there  at least it does try to create a bit of an atmosphere although the bizarre scene when a cat decides to literally jump through a window for no apparent reason is unintentionally funny. There's some nudity as well if that sort of thing interests you as the local slut gets her breast's out within five minutes of meeting Caine I wish I had that effect on women...Filmed in California The Hand has good production values  looks nice enough. The acting is pretty good even if Michael Caine goes a little over the top at times apparently he took the role after Jon Voight Christopher Walken  Dustin Hoffman turned the part down  Caine has also said in interviews the only reason he made The Hand was to earn the money to pay for a new garage he was having built at the time! Fair enough I suppose but was rolling around on the floor fighting your own severed hand really worth it?The Hand is a film that I feel like I shouldn't have liked but I did like it  even if I would find it hard to recommend it to one  all I think anyone interested in psychological horror could do a lot worse  watching Michael Caine overact as he wrestles with his own severed hand  lose is fun too. If nothing else The Hand teaches us one very important thing never put your hand out of a car window while your wife is driving otherwise it'll end in tears...".

The job itself is nothing to write home about but an affair with a student StellaAnnie McEnroe offers a promise of happiness as Anne becomes involved with another man much more attentive to her emotional needs..and it does help that this man is kind to her treating her with respect which seems to be faults JL lacks. But JL is not the kind of person to give up his family because his pride is a monster to deal with and his very thought of that man fulfilling his role as father enrages him. That's where the horror elements come into play. Those who cross JL's ire are being attacked and killed by his severed hand! That hand seems to have such power in it that it crushes bones and throats with gusto. Director Oliver Stone though often provides doubt regarding whether it's really that hand or JL himself as we see his face twist in bitter anger as if he's on the verge of unleashing furious violence. Caine does this well but unfortunately his cartoonist can often be so vile and harshly aggressive and taken to outbursts towards Anne that we feel nothing for him at all when his life becomes threatened itself. I certainly don't blame Anne for wanting to leave him and seeing his life fall apart isn't that shocking. It's hard to feel any sort of sympathy for his plight because we rarely have a chance to like him. Stella is able to get through to his calmer side which seems to soften him until we find out a secret regarding her and another teacherBruce McGillshe's involved with sexually. Decent horror fare with a nasty little bloody sequence where JL loses his hand with blood squirting all over the place. Stone creates enough a mystery keeping us from totally believing this hand is doing the offing. It has an end result regarding JL when that hand has one last task silencing Annenot that surprising huh?which might provide enough answers to satisfy yet Stone doesn't release us but instead drags it out further. That last five minutes I believe could've been left out and it wouldn't have hurt the film. Stone it seems wants one last grisly scene to close his film.".

The Hand is just terrible and the story and direction both fail miserably. From start to finish one wonders how anyone could believe this would make a fine film. The sole redeeming feature of the motion picture fiasco known as The Hand is that Michael Caine is such a truly superb actor that he single handedly pulls this stinking mess from the sewer of bungled films and brilliantly distracts viewers with his excellent work so they are not completely embarrassed to find themselves watching total trash.".

It's good to see a director crediting working class people with creativity and dignity long before The Commitments. Most of all the film is a very lovingly put together period piece in which every detail is just right.
