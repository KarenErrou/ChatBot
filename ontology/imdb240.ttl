I really don't understand why this exceptional war movie shot with absolute genius remains invisible. Be patient it must get released one day every powerful movie addicts must rediscover this fantastic and suspenseful war drama fastpaced from beginning to end. How can we imagine Un Homme De Trop staying invisible for again thirty years when so many invisible but dull movies get released well there are some exceptions of course. But I believe in CostaGavras great reputation this forgotten gem will soon have a fabulous comeback it deserves it. The cinematography and editing are so brilliant the action is tense and very fastpaced the actors follow that dynamic direction. No particular principal character just Resistance in the Cvennes mountains. I was so surprised by Brialy tense interpretation like Cremer Brasseur Blain Piccoli of course and Vanel as the old timer. Only one woman not really useful but it is Julie Dassin Jules's daughter. What a great day when it will be shown again on a giant screen.Thank you for the following friends for being fan of this masterpiece  Philippe Marc JeanPierre and that unknown guy from south.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the Second World War somewhere in France a group of fighters of the Rsistance attacks a German police station to release some of its members imprisoned there. The released guys are taken in a big hurry to the camp of the people of the Rsistance. Once in the camp the rsistants discover that among their companions who were released there is a guy who was also detained by the Germans and who doesn't belong to their group. Inicially they think that this guy is a spy and in this case they should kill him to protect their group. But this guy tells to them that he was detained because of his smuggling activities and that he doesn't support in any way the Germans. He fails to convince them they decide to kill him and appoint one of them to do the job. When this rsistant takes the guy in the forest to shoot him the guy succeeds to convince the resistant to let him free. After walking for a while in the woods the guy discovers that the Germans have surrounded the place and are about to catch the rsistants. Instead of getting away the guy walks back to the camp of the rsistants to tell them that they are being attacked by the Germans. Eventually after some fighting most of the resistants are killed and a handful of them caught alive. The last scene is on an iron bridge across a mountain gorge. The Germans line up the resistants and go killing them one after the other. The guy who is a the end of the line takes advantage of the distraction of the Germans to escape climbing down the iron structure of the bridge. The title of the film says all about this story Un De Trop which means that there is no place in a conflict for one person who doesn't belong to one of the parts of this conflict or in other words for an outsider. It is a great and instructive story. I saw it more than thirty five years ago but I remember very well of it. It is a pity that it has not been widely publicized.".

UN HOMME DE TROP looks like a practice ground for those highly political films and a very good one indeed.".

Exceptional cast wonderful film. The camera work is outstanding and the Gavras touch is all over the film he followed it with Z L'AVEU and STATE OF SIEGE  all classics. UN HOMME DE TROP looks like a practice ground for those highly political films and a very good one indeed.";

	schema:headline " One of Mary's most enjoyable movies";
	schema:reviewBody "This delightful film marked a turning point in the career of Mary Pickford the first time in adulthood that she played a little girl. The illusion was enhanced with specially scaled sets and props that made Mary look smaller and also by casting unusually tall actors as the grownups but it wouldn't have worked if Mary herself hadn't been such a gifted performer in her own right. She is remarkably convincing as 11 yearold Gwendolyn. It's notable that when Mary who was 24 when this film was made plays scenes opposite Maxine Elliott who was 12 at the time the illusion is not spoiled. The great success of The Poor Little Rich Girl at the box office ensured that Mary Pickford would be playing little girls well into her 30s despite occasional attempts to demonstrate more versatility. Eventually she came to consider the role something of a curse but in any event the film holds up nicely today it's interesting suspenseful and funny with odd touches of surrealism during the extended dream sequence that forms the climax.Mary's Gwendolyn is certainly a sympathetic protagonist. The story paints a vivid picture of the girl's loneliness and her desperation to receive some attention from her high society parents but she's no sad sack she's a spirited kid bursting with vitality though she's surrounded by servants who devote themselves to stifling her energy. She's sheltered but no snob and much of the havoc she creates comes when she invites some of the scruffier neighborhood kids inside to play. The comic high point is a mud fight that takes place in the green house of Gwendolyn's home. Oddly enough Mary Pickford revealed in later years that director Maurice Tourneur was opposed to the inclusion of this sequence and had to be persuaded to film it. The mud fight is great fun but for me the movie's real highlight comes when Gwendolyn ill and delirious has a bizarre dream that offers metaphors for her life and the people she's known. For instance her meanspirited governess described earlier as a snake in the grass actually appears as such in the dream while another character is shown to be twofaced. I won't reveal any more of the imagery for anyone who might see this film except to note that the dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission.P.S. I happened to see The Poor Little Rich Girl at a recent screening at the Museum of the City of New York where locallymade movies are occasionally shown. Viewers interested in New York City history may be interested to learn that this film includes location scenes of Mary taking a ride along Riverside Drive as well as some brief shots of Wall Street. My fellow New Yorkers got a big laugh at one point when Gwendolyn's father contemplates selling his mansion for 35000!".

	schema:headline " Wonderful Mary";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an exquisite film and a wonderful introduction to Mary Pickford if you are unfamiliar with her films. The Poor Little Rich Girl was originally done on the stage in 1913 with Viola Dana playing Gwendolyn. Even though Mary had played young girls in all her feature films this was the first time she had ever portrayed a child except the Famous Players Lasky film A Good Little Devil  a role Mary had originated on the stage in 1913 for David Belasco. She could have no better director than Maurice Tourneur.Tourneur a French director specialised in fantasy films  The Blue Bird Prunella Treasure Island The Wishing Ring etc and he bought style and imagination to them. In the dream sequence which so brilliantly explores the mind of a child Gwen brings the nick names she hears to life. Her father is made of money the servants are big ears two faced thing and snake in the grass. She goes to the land where they burn candles at both ends. This is so magically done by Tourneur who certainly expanded the film from how I could imagine the play. The sets and actors also seem to be on a larger scale to make Mary appear even tinier than she was I think she was 4' 10.Gwen Mary Pickford is a poor little rich girl who's father is too busy making money and her mother has too many social obligations to give her the attention and affection she needs. The servants who are introduced by the title  Servants by name  Masters by disposition  are seen as bullying tyrants. All except Silly Ass  the only one Gwen has a strong affection for.One afternoon she has fun  she invites the organ grinder and a street boy in and she and Mr. Piper the man who fixes the pipes have a dance. The street kids feel sorry for Gwen and call her the poor little rich girl. Another day one of her mother's friends brings her own little girl over to play but Susie May Maxine Elliott Hicks is not nice is a sneak and a tattle tale and gets Gwen into trouble. Gwen gets her own back when she makes Susie sit on a plate of cakes.

	onyx:emotionText "This is an exquisite film and a wonderful introduction to Mary Pickford if you are unfamiliar with her films. The Poor Little Rich Girl was originally done on the stage in 1913 with Viola Dana playing Gwendolyn. Even though Mary had played young girls in all her feature films this was the first time she had ever portrayed a child except the Famous Players Lasky film A Good Little Devil  a role Mary had originated on the stage in 1913 for David Belasco. She could have no better director than Maurice Tourneur.Tourneur a French director specialised in fantasy films  The Blue Bird Prunella Treasure Island The Wishing Ring etc and he bought style and imagination to them. In the dream sequence which so brilliantly explores the mind of a child Gwen brings the nick names she hears to life. Her father is made of money the servants are big ears two faced thing and snake in the grass. She goes to the land where they burn candles at both ends. This is so magically done by Tourneur who certainly expanded the film from how I could imagine the play. The sets and actors also seem to be on a larger scale to make Mary appear even tinier than she was I think she was 4' 10.Gwen Mary Pickford is a poor little rich girl who's father is too busy making money and her mother has too many social obligations to give her the attention and affection she needs. The servants who are introduced by the title  Servants by name  Masters by disposition  are seen as bullying tyrants. All except Silly Ass  the only one Gwen has a strong affection for.One afternoon she has fun  she invites the organ grinder and a street boy in and she and Mr. Piper the man who fixes the pipes have a dance. The street kids feel sorry for Gwen and call her the poor little rich girl. Another day one of her mother's friends brings her own little girl over to play but Susie May Maxine Elliott Hicks is not nice is a sneak and a tattle tale and gets Gwen into trouble. Gwen gets her own back when she makes Susie sit on a plate of cakes. Gwen's mother then forces her to give up her best lace dress but Gwen refuses and throws all her clothes out of the window  the neighbourhood kids then take them. To punish her her father forces her to dress in boys clothes but she secretly likes it and joins a boy's street gang.The underlying theme is that Gwen is searching for happiness.

	schema:reviewBody "If you had to pick a typical Mary Pickford film to understand her appeal in silent movies you should look no further than The Poor Little Rich Girl. In this the 24 Mary with the curls that audiences the world over loved plays an 1112 year old girl neglected by her status conscious parents.Not that the idea was anything new but Mary does put it over quite well. Her parents Madlaine Traverse are caught up in their busy societal world and pretty much ignore their child. But when she accidentally overdoses on some medicine and hovers between life and death her parents wake up and smell the coffee.One thing I found absolutely fascinating was that apparently as a punishment for misbehavior one was forced to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. That certainly raises some interesting questions about gender identity in American society in 1917. Mary is forced to wear boys clothes and when she goes out and meets a gang of street kids she's questioned about her masculinity and really lashes out at her tormentors.What makes the film really standout though for me is the fantasy world that director Maurice Tourneur created as Mary is in a coma fighting for her life. Given the times the special effects cinematography was wonderful for its time. Cecil B. DeMille couldn't have done better creating a view of how a child saw the world around her and the possible paradise she could have if she quit fighting for her own life.Great special effects and a standout performance by Mary Pickford make The Poor Little Rich Girl a classic from the days when movies had no voice.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most original aspect of this film is that it translates into images the delirium of a seriously ill little girl fighting for her life. The beginning of the film is quite conventional both as regards the story a little girl is ignored by her rich parents and bullied by the servants and the way of filming mostly indoor long duration wide shots with fixed camera with some medium shots and a few closeups. There are some slapstick gags and a funny scene when the father remembering that as a child he had been dressed as a girl to punish him decides to dress Gwen as a boy. Far from considering this as a punishment she enjoys her boy costume and has a lot of fun having a mud fight with street boys.The film becomes more interesting in the second half when it veers towards surrealism. It shows what Gwen is imagining taking literally expressions that she hears e.g. her father fighting bears and the servants looking like their nicknames snake in grass doubleface or big ears. It also shows the father who has big financial worries visualising his double taking a gun to commit suicide with Gwen overlooking the scene.acinemahistory.blogspot.com201312".

	schema:reviewBody "Although it has been well documented as to the use of taller actors specially scaled sets and larger props all used to help Mary Pickford appear as childlike in appearance as possible it was Pickford herself who discovered by accident during the filming of The Poor Little Rich Girl a new lighting technique to further enhance the little girl illusion. She describes in her autobiography of one morning while powdering her nose in the large mirror of a dresser when a small hand mirror lying at an angle caught the glow of the early morning sunlight and reflected it flatteringly on her face. She went to the studio bursting with her discovery and immediately went to director Maurice Tourneur and asked if he would have the cameraman place one of the spotlights down low. Mr.Tourner laughed at her new idea but Mary convinced him to shoot a scene the usual way then shoot it the way she suggested telling him then to decide for himself. The difference was so great that the use of lowlying light to reflect back into the actor's face called ' baby spots' became standard practise in the industry. Another example of the genius of Mary Pickford and her keenness to further the advancement of cinematography. Her portrayal of Gwendolyn the neglected little rich girl is absolutely astonishing to watch. Both Mary and Frances Marion had great fun adding comical bits to the screenplay and the merriment shows in Mary's performance. With the tremendous success of this film Mary Pickford would comply with her fan's wishes and continue to successfully play the little girl role in several more delightful classic novels. Unfortunately many still believe the accomplished actress only played little girls and nothing could be further from the truth. If only one could view the entire work of Mary Pickford years before this film her roles were filled with amazing diversity. With that being said Pickford's film version of The Poor Little Rich Girl is a wonderfully enjoyable work of silent cinema.".

	schema:headline " A Must See for Pickford's Legend";
	schema:reviewBody "Poor Little Rich Girl The 1917  out of 4 Mary Pickford 25years old plays Gwen an 11yearold girl who has all the money in the world but she's quite unhappy. This is due to her parents not paying any attention to her and the servants pretty much push her around. The fact that she has no friends doesn't help matters but a tragic turn might be what causes everyone to realize how special she actually is. THE POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL isn't the masterpiece that some people make it out to be but it's quite an interesting little film. I think most people would go into any film with a bit of skepticism whenever you had an adult at the age of 25 playing someone that is just 11 when the movie ends. Pickford became a legend playing these young parts and she would be doing this nearly ten years later and people were still eating it up. Her performance here is certainly the main reason to watch this film because there's no doubt that you're watching a truly talented actresses doing a rather remarkable job. I was rather skeptical going into the film but it takes a matter of seconds for you to believe Pickford is this young child. I'm not sure what it was but not once did I see an adult playing a child but instead you were watching a child play the part. Pickford was just downright marvelous when it came to the facial gestures and just simple looks that you'd expect to see from a child. No matter if she was being playful or or throwing a temper tantrum you believe it is a child. Pickford goes through a wide range of emotions and she nails all of them perfectly but my favorite has to be a rather long sequence where a new friend is brought to the house but the girl is a rich snob who quickly gets into a fight with Pickford. The playful but bratty way the actress plays this sequence makes for some big laughs and it's certainly the highlight of the movie. Madlaine Traverse and Charles Wellesley are both good as her parents but there's no question everything in the screenplay by Francis Marion is for Pickford. Director Tourneur handles the material quite well but the really highlight of his vision comes from some of the more nightmarish scenes including one where a large snake goes after the girl and another one where her father visions himself committing suicide. The film runs 65minutes and I must admit that there were several times where I got a little bored and this is just one reason why I'd stop short of calling the film a flat out masterpiece. I thought there was a little too much melodrama showing how unhappy the girl was and this includes one scene where she's punished by being forced to where boys clothing. With that said those interested in the legend of Pickford will find this film a good place to start because it shows her in the type of role people loved her for.".

Plus of all her films playing a child this is certainly not up there with the best of them such as Daddy Long Legs and Sparrows. First it was a bigger stretch than usual. Instead of playing a teen like she did in many films here she plays a girl of about 11too big a stretch if you ask me. Second the script is more obvious than most and lacks the subtlety of her better work.Mary plays the title charactera rich girl who is miserable. That's because her parents are selfish jerks who have no time for her. Instead she's left to a cruel governess and other staff who see her as a nuisance. As a result she's starved for affection and needs her parents. You know however as a Mary Pickford film that by the end she will somehow get her wish. The only suspense is how this will occurand I must say how they arranged it was certainly original and strange! Mary is poisoned with a narcotic and is dyingduring which she has some bizarre dreams reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland! It's all quite odd but somehow manages to result in everything being happily ever after.The film is well made if predictable. If you are a Pickford fan like me then by all means watch it. However if you aren't try watching either the two films mentioned above or some of her other great films like Suds or My Best Girl my personal favorite.

The elegant visuals are excellent as is a young Mary Pickford in the lead role despite looking older than the 1011 years she was supposed to be.The final act then is something else entirely as the poor little rich girl is accidentally given too much medicine and enters a surreal dream sequence somewhat akin to Alice going down the rabbit hole complete with double exposure ghosts and a costumed donkey that looks as if it just walked off the set of Baum's absurdly funny 1914 fantasy 'His Majesty The Scarecrow of Oz'  an early adaptation of 'The Wizard of Oz'  which no doubt took influence from this film.All of this is based on a moral that says love is of far more importance than social appearances and material possessions and while a strong moral it is unfortunately reiterated at every step of the journey from the very first scene to the very last so it does become tiresome continuing to hammer the wall once the nail has already been driven in. As such the film is overly long I saw the 76 minute version but has enough memorable scenes to make up for the drag.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mary Pickford stars as Gwendolyn an 11 year old who longs for the love of her wealthy parents but has only the servants for company. Her attempts to find friendship and ease her loneliness lead to comic and touching situations. This vehicle was one of the highest grossing films of 1917 and consolidated Mary Pickford's stardom even further. Frances Marion contributes a fine screenplay. Gwendolyn is an appealing character  she's not flawless but she is very sympathetic. Mischievous spunky and resourceful yet also longing for love and tenderness she is a memorable heroine. There are plenty of comic moments like when Gwendolyn invites the organ grinder into the house a mudpie fight with neighborhood boys her escapades in the bathroom etc. And there are touching moments as well such as Gwendolyn's visit to her father's office and Gwendolyn's battle for life after an irresponsible servant gives her a poisonous sleeping medicine. A dream sequence near the end while a bit lengthy for my taste astutely plays on the movie's themes and shows a surreal child'seye view of things in a delightful way. Mary Pickford is very charming and believable. I had my reservations about watching Pickford who was then about 24 years old playing an 11 year old girl but when she came on screen I was hooked right away. It's easy to see why she was such a big star  she is utterly charismatic natural spunky and witty tender and moving with a distinctive luminous beauty. Charles Wellesley and Madlaine Traverse contribute fine support as Gwendolyn's parents. Wellesley is especially good in the scenes where he interacts with Pickford's character he conveys a father who wants to reach out to his daughter yet is hesitant to do so. Gladys Fairbanks is fine as Jane a domestic worker who has the unenviable job of trying to rein in the freespirited Gwendolyn. Maurice Tourneur one of the most acclaimed directors of early cinema makes this film a beautiful viewing experience. The restored copy I watched displayed beautiful tinting moody expressive shadows and Tourneur's use of space to emphasize Gwendolyn's loneliness. The editing is seamless and no shots linger too long showing the advancement that cinema had made since the beginning of the feature era five years before. Overall POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL is a classic of its era that has stood the test of time very well. The fine acting beautiful cinematography and poignant story make it worth watching. SCORE 910".

Who else is better outfitted to protect the average working stiff from cutthroat competition and unemployment than a tiger shark bigger than those circling around. Department store shark Warren William is in charge of 12000 average Joe's and by golly he's going to keep them swimming even if he has to eat half of them in the process. Bravura performance from William watch his eyes slink around the hallway before he enters the hotel room to ravish a drunkenly compliant Loretta Young. His authoritative presence commands the movie as completely as he does his underlings. Film may come as a revelation to viewers unfamiliar with preCode Hollywood before the censors took over in 1934. Nonetheless it was an era of social frankness that would not emerge again until the countercultural 1960's while the movie itself would play as well today as it did then as one reviewer sagely observes. Much of film's value lies in getting us to think about the appeal a strongmantyrant presents during turbulent times. We loathe William's ruthless and often cruel tactics. But at the same time he's inventive decisive and brutally logical with a singleminded dedication that goes beyond personal happiness. In short he becomes The Department Store in the same way an effective tyrant can personify The State. He's a figure to be loathed yet grudgingly admired at the same time while it's a credit to the filmmakers that they pull off the ambivalence as well as they do. Two scenes stay with me that help define William's compelling sidewatch him nearly throw up at the smarmy speech given in behalf of the store's worthless owners plus his facetoface denunciation of bankers as parasitically unproductive a passage that probably brought depressionera audiences to their feet.There are also unexpected deposits of humor such as the bald manballoon gag that is hilariously inventive and likely a brainstorm from ace director Roy del Ruth. On the other hand Wallace Ford simply lacks the kind of edge to make his role as William's assistant plausible. Instead a faceoff between William and say Cagney would have exploded the screen.Anyhow don't let the forgettable title or the now obscure Warren William fool you. There are so many memorable glimpses of human honesty that the movie must be seen to be appreciated especially by those unfamiliar with the preCode era. So catch up with this cynical little gem if you can.".

With climbing profits over the years the depression has hit the store with a downfall and Anderson is put in complete charge to boost up sales  and he will go so far as to ruin any man who doesn't live up to his high expectations. He likes women but not for marriage  his motto towards females is love 'em and leave 'em. He soon meets beautiful Loretta Young who is desperate to get a job at the store apparently a hard nut to crack and she apparently will do whatever it takes to get it as she spends the night with him at his apartment despite her indication she would like to go home. Anyway  she's hired on as a model even after she said she would like to be hired for her brain  okey dokey  and soon has met and married a gungho salesman Wallace Ford who has been promoted as Anderson's new assistant. Anderson believes that a man should be married to his job only  so the marriage is kept a secret and the workaholic boss expects his assistant to be there by his side pretty much night and day.Okay this is a really terrific precode film entertaining through every scene and featuring one of my thirties favorites Warren William who pretty much steals the film. As for the women though Loretta Young is fine in her part here and looks really gorgeous  it is the scenes with adorable Alice White that are the most fun to watch as she plays Polly a blonde who takes extra pay from Anderson to do his bidding seducing male employees for various purposes. A very enjoyable film and a treat to see.".

	onyx:emotionText "A standout performance by Warren William as Anderson the hard uncompromising ruthless and fearedbymost General Manager of a giant department store helps make this a really excellent and interesting film. With climbing profits over the years the depression has hit the store with a downfall and Anderson is put in complete charge to boost up sales  and he will go so far as to ruin any man who doesn't live up to his high expectations. He likes women but not for marriage  his motto towards females is love 'em and leave 'em. He soon meets beautiful Loretta Young who is desperate to get a job at the store apparently a hard nut to crack and she apparently will do whatever it takes to get it as she spends the night with him at his apartment despite her indication she would like to go home.

	schema:reviewBody "I have never been a fan of William Warren's but this is the perfect role for him. I usually find him thoroughly unlikable and obnoxious imagine my surprise when he is cast in just such a role and pulls it off so perfectly I find I must now respect his prowess as an actor. Well done WW! In Employees' Entrance we find Warren playing Kurt Anderson an unapologetic cad who rules the Franklin  Munroe Store like a dictator. He is so flawless at playing someone so reprehensible I loved hating him I hoped he'd win. I especially loved him telling off the rich fops who run the store in the opening board room scene Do you think YOU did it?! he demands in reference to the store's unprecedented success. I worked for a man like that once I was crazy about him. No one ever got more work out of me. And the viewer actually doesn't feel too terribly sympathetic to the people Anderson fires throughout the movie so much as they wonder why they were ever stupid enough to make such silly suggestions or resist Anderson when they had no ideas of their own.As the great department store enters the great depression things get even tougher and Anderson must drive his staff even more ruthlessly than before but he does this to protect their jobs. And what an eyeopening timecapsule! The Franklin  Munroe store is said to employ 12000 people...you'd be lucky to find 12 in a department store today! Imagine a store that actually provides SERVICE.Note the precode relationships between the characters Anderson sleeps with Madeline twice and neither character seems to feel it is the end of the world as would have been required of them in films just a couple of years later. Further Anderson literally pimps Polly out to divert the attention of a troublesome board member. She doesn't mind not because she's easy but because she's figured out how to work the system.Lots of faces familiar to the Depressionera movie fan. Alice White is perfect as Polly Dale perhaps the most amusing character in the film. Loretta Young plays Madeline with more depth than was probably written into it. Ruth Donnelly is her usual self as Miss Hall and Allen Jenkins has an unbilled but significant role as the security chief Sweeney. Wallace Ford is surprisingly good as Martin West the scene where he flirts across the store with Madeline by holding up sheet music with titles like I want to call you Sweetheart and You're Beautiful is adorable.I highly recommend this entertaining film.".

Most of the story is spent setting him up as a conventional villain a ruthless guy who capriciously ruins lives. A hateful selfish man arrogant and exploitative.Along the way he sleeps with a pretty employee and then when he finds she is married to his protg he tries to ruin the pair. A man he fired kills himself and the pretty girl Loretta Young tries to. In his manner he is as brusque and offensive as he can be. He hires a floozy to compromise a fellow executive. He harangues everyone.And yet by the end you actually like the guy and are surprised at being tricked into doing so. He fights to avoid laying off thousands of employees because of the depression in a fight to the death with the bankers. He proves to be honest if misogynistic.The two girls are incredibly sexy as this was made just before the code slammed the shutters on women in film.Alice White plays the floozy just before a sex scandal ruined her career a second time. She had previous been helped by a few directors including Chaplin. We are seeing a real fading flapper here.Loretta Young at 20 is as beautifully photographed as she would ever be. How odd to see the pretty girl as one who could be seduced so... twice.But that's all by the way. The writing of this thing is so competent it rocked me back. I watch a lot of movies and usually have to let my imagination fill in for various deficiencies. Not so here. The writer of this also did the Kennel Murder Case of the same year also excellent.Excellent again. A good old straight ahead movie that fools you into thinking it is straight ahead and then it turns things a bit upside down.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

This sort of subject matter was rare after the Code went into effect and remains rare today.Wallace Ford as Martin West delivers a fine performance as a man who accepts an important position under Anderson in good faith and finds that if he keeps the position he has to sacrifice all his scruples.  He stops before he becomes like the bad boss but as so often happens in real life his career declines as a result of defying the one in power.I found myself sympathizing a bit with Anderson however and I didn't dream that I would I mean he's awful. He treats the women in his employ as his personal toys.  He's not totally amoral because of his concern for the greater good of the employees of Monroe's Department Store.  Although he doesn't mind killing off a few employees who disagree with him he perceives that it's the Depression after all.  If the store goes out of business because of weakness thousands more will go hungry.  He himself is willing to take a pay decrease to keep the store solvent.   Also he freely admits to his rotten acts.  He hides almost nothing and so is unusual.The bad bosses I have met in the real world are completely self serving and interested in power and prestige within the organization.   They give lip service to teamwork profits productivity and employee success while their behavior they display a contempt for these values.  Such bad bosses never admit to any wrongdoing plot and scheme against members of their staff in closed door meetings and use their influence as bosses to enlist their company personnel departments in their schemes to wound or destroy an employee's career if they seem to stand in their way toward getting more power and prestige.You will however like the movie.

He also made some not so good movies but that's par for the Hollywood story. I have ordered about ten of his movie efforts and look forward with great anticipation in seeing them.

William Warren is at times ruthless yet he also displays occasional compassion and a considerable amount of vulnerability. As the no nonsense top boss in a major Manhattan department store he stops at nothing in his quest to keep his store at the top. He thinks nothing of summarily terminating loyal long time store employees if they offend him in any manner. Although all of the cast is superb in their well written roles make no mistake this is Warren's film. It moves fast and does none of the slow dragging that many films of the early 1930s suffer from.".

He shamelessly manipulates the lives of everyone he deals with and has no qualms about driving a longtime employee to suicide.The movie begins with Anderson demanding and receiving a 100 salary raise from the Board.

Anderson also flirts with Polly Alice White the store's resident airhead. The store's Board attempts to fire Anderson but he pulls a fast one with some proxy votes and continues as the store's absolute monarch.William as usual really delivers in a very unsympathetic role. Loretta Young is great and very lovely as the innocent Madeline and Alice White is very convincing. Ford could be better but he's not bad. The venerable Charles Lane has a brief role as a shoe clerk.

One thing leads to another and Loretta and Wallace wed secretly so Warren doesn't find out. However there's trouble in paradise and after a tiff at an employee's party a drunken Loretta once again sleeps with Warren. In the meantime the bankers are plotting to oust Warren which causes him to seek the proxy votes of the vacationing fatuous store owner. In the course of his machinations the caddish Warren has Wallace listen in secretly to a conversation twixt himself and Loretta in which she admits to cuckolding Wallace. Time is getting tight with the board of directors meeting at 10AM. At the last minute Warren gets the proxy votes he needs to forestall the bankers. Loretta and Wallace kiss and make up. The End.I give this film an A. Excellent acting and direction. The minor players almost all familiar to precode film fans are great. Warren William is in his element here playing a cad and brutal businessman. He was never better. Loretta Young is beautiful and turns in a very good performance too as does Wally Ford. This aired on TCM the other day and given TCM's film rotation is likely to show up again in the next few months. Not to be missed!!!".

Breen to make use of the Production Code before special interest groups such as the Legion of Decency became official censors.When considering 'Employees' Entrance' it is important to get certain facts correct The central male lead character 'Kurt Anderson' is played by the experienced stage actor WARREN WILLIAM who came to Hollywood in 1931 after silents were no longer being produced.Because one of the actors playing an important character part of 'Ross' died in an auto accident on 16 December 1932 after principal photography ended we know that costar LORETTA YOUNG playing 'Madeline' was not yet 20 when this film was made. She was born on 6 January 1913. She was photographed as well as in any of her films. The film was released in later January 1933.ALICE WHITE who plays 'Poly Dale' had been a secretary in the movie business and became a major star from the end of silents to the first wave of musical talkies. One problem was she did not sing or dance as well as taller women. 'Employees' Entrance' was to be her comeback but another scandal finished her move career as an actress. She returned to being a secretary in the studios and did very well.IMDb does not list ALLEN JENKINS as being credited and many reviewers say this. However in the official posters he is prominently credited as would be expected because he was one of Warner Bros most popular character actors.I completely agree all the elements needed for a classic such as 'Casablanca' click for 'Employees' Entrance'. The script is typical of WB ripped from the contemporary headlines about the Depression and then exceptionally polished. The casting was ideal. The production values were 'A' level. This film was released a few weeks before '42nd Street' so it was not the top box office hit for WB in 1933 but it made a lot of profit.Although PreCode it is only suggested that any character slept with another with fadeouts and dissolves as later standard after The Code was enforced.I admit to being a Warren William fan. I never cared for Loretta Young in her post 1935 films but because at 19 she was so fresh and beautiful I have watched a lot of films she made before 'Employees' Entrance' to see her learn to act dialog on camera. Loretta was on top of her game as 'Madeline' here.Do yourselves a favor and watch 'Employees' Entrance' when it is shown and ask for it to be released on DVD. I bought a VHS copy and watch it often.".

The more people stand up to him the better he likes it knowing those are the people because of the ruthlessness he can squeeze out of him will help increase his business.The dashing Mr. William is the whole show here ripping apart everyone around him with gnashed teeth foaming and nostrils baring. He realizes that when his own usefulness is done he too may head for that 9th story window. Young and Ford get a few chances to have an important scene or two but are simply puddy in Williams' cold hands to mold as he sees fit.

Instead Warren William plays an overthetop caricature of a businessman that is highly reminiscent of Hitlerand as a result is highly reminiscent of some of Williams' other films SKYSCRAPER SOULS and THE MATCH KING! Despite this all being a bit silly and hard to believe in an odd way the film is still very entertaining and is sleazy fun. I especially like how again and again the writers chose NOT to take the subtle path but chose to make the story a trashy soap opera. For example when William forces yet another employee off the job after years of service one jumps to his death from the 9th floor. Later when he gets in an argument with a floozy in his employ she tosses her Pomeranian at himat which point he stares at it and then tosses the poor pooch into the trash can! With such silly scenes abounding it's obvious that the film makers did NOT take themselves too seriously and Williams' character is so awful you probably will laugh at some of his hysterics.By the way after seeing this film didn't you also get strong gay vibes from Williams' character? He did everything he could to separate his 2 man from his wife because he wanted him all to himself! Considering this is a socalled PreCode film I seriously think they intended many in the audience to pick up on this undercurrent.".

I'm not sure how clearly it plays here or how willing people are to watch it especially as it turns the idea of the scary bad French projects somewhat on its ear.This isn't a criticism of the movie on the contrary. Kechiche has shot a riveting crosssection of teenagers growing up in social housing in broken homes and poverty who lack the tools of expression and who have adopted the posturing of the wounded and in the story almost entirely absent adults who raise them attacking the movie unfolds at a nearconstant level of verbal aggression and dodging esquiver means to dodge or to evade one another's attacks with all they can muster.The film's intensely political side feels almost accidental in its unfolding it has great heart and its actors who are apparently mostly amateurs from around the shooting location are outstanding. On the whole it reminded me a great deal of David Gordon Green's George Washington a simple love story set against a landscape of poverty played out frankly and honestly allowed to unfold at a distinctly unHollywoodian rhythm. If Green's film is more beautiful cinematic ally L'Esquive is more concentrated more unflinching in its examination of the deep repercussions and violence of economic social and familial hardship. Its statement that France is no longer a country of the FrenchofFrenchancestry and that its refusal to accept its own transformation does not mean its lost generation accepts its loss could not be more clearly nor more poignantly made.Without spoiling or going into detail there are things about the plot that are implausible things that probably hurt the film overall but watching this movie for plot is like watching Ocean's Eleven for social insight. This is a positive study of character in a bad situation of a stratum of society rarely filmed and still more rarely treated as fairly as it is offered up here beautifully and eloquently.".

This is one realistic and wellperformed movie. The director got some fantastic acting out of an almost 100 amateur cast. Very realistic and fastpaced.

Both movies employed nonactors and got great performances but the similarities end there. L'Esquive is set in a Parisian housing project with a majority Muslim population. The slang translation subtitled is matched to the slang used in a New York City housing project. Part of the humor comes from this posturing and there is a lot to be laughing about. The performances are strong all around and although the story is simple a girl drops her boyfriend and he becomes interested in another girl the kids fill it with energy and drama. There is none of the extreme violence that a similar story set in the States would have. There is no bloody shootout at the end  this fact alone recommends it. Sara Forestier Lydia you might have seen if you watch French film and will see more of  possibly in American film. Osman Elkharraz Krimo also has a charisma that makes him a candidate for future roles. The film is a very energetic and fresh examination of kids growing up in a fishbowl up to and including their harassment and abuse by the French police. If you have any interest in French film here is a refreshing and funny movie. Enjoy.".

And yes they don't speak like Moliere did yes they use F words. It's the way they talk to each other. But when talking to adults they're just very polite.

The good thing in this movie is that it shows the suburb as it can be  not really fun but not the awful thing we think it is. No they're not all juvenile delinquents. Their lives are just no fun. And yes they don't speak like Moliere did yes they use F words. It's the way they talk to each other. But when talking to adults they're just very polite. And even if there's no much suspense in this movie it's just about wondering if Krimo will go out with Lydia L'Esquive shows another suburb. A suburb where teenagers all french but from different origins from Spain to Asia are not dangerous people.";

Like any period farce the real relationships are dizzyingly circular A loves B who loves C who is in disguise with D. A threatens C B changes places with D to pursue his suit and use Marivaux like Cyrano C can't make up her mind friends of B and C misunderstand everyone and the course of true love doesn't run smooth. While marred by wincingly heavyhanded intellectualizing on class social criticism by the literature teacher who is directing the kids in the play and a deus ex machina insertion of biased cops the frank life and deathness of adolescent romance strongly comes through in comparison to Marivaux's mannered floweriness even as these kids communicate amongst each other with four letter obscenities bluntly crude slang that may not be too well represented in the English subtitles but I'm sure French subtitlers likewise have trouble with the patois in movies such as Four Brothers hearttugging looks of longing painfully hurt tears and finally in frustration physical action.It is not clear if the blonde as she is referred to in the English subtitles played by the excellent Sara Forestier who seems to have been the only member of the cast with some previous experience before the cameras is also from an immigrant family or Muslim or if she just picked up use of a couple of Muslim catch phrases in her slang as to whether Kechiche is adding another layer of social commentary. Or she could just be part of the trend in French cinema to fixate on pouty young blonde temptresses viz. La Petite Lili  Tout de Suite Right Now Lila Says Lila dit a. This film has a lot of parallels with Lila Says Lila dit a not just about sex and social setting though it dealt with older kids but also how literature can be an escapist outlet yet also a threat that brings hidden emotions to the fore. The grim mise en scene makes wonderful use of a crowded high rise neighborhood where the kids hang out chilled because they have little privacy at home some fathers are in jail their loving mothers try to keep tabs on them and cell phones are their expensive lifelines.While the film goes on a bit too long as scenes meander probably because it isn't clear how much has been scripted and how much the kids are very effectively improvising particulars around a basic story line their relationships are enthralling both the romances and the friendships. Each teen actor creates an indelible and different character.270 years since Marivaux and the human heart hasn't changed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its a very multilayered film. It looks rough and row however its just a directing trick mostly because its about kids and young actors. However its a complex social drama where the most important stuff are on the margins of the script yet quite visible.Its about the troubled tenage poor kids from the typical suburb blocks of flats whose life looks very simple although at the same time full of hardships and difficult situations lack of money conflicts with other kids fathers in prison etc. There is a lot of anxiety and aggression in their dialogues although only in the end of film we see the pressure they live under and race and class struggle that exist in French society. All the jovial representations of the class differences from Marivoux' play used in the film get quite a rustic hyper realistic and graphic shape in the actual context of the kids' lives. What is in background of the story is a bit unspoken social and ethnic background of the girl Lydia who is blond while everyone else is clearly of African or Asian ethnic origin. Lydia might not even be a European French she could be a Muslim too just her white skin light hair and eyes imply certain trouble for possible love plot in the film. For some reason she is different and often called names by other jealous girls or guys. On the other hand she also seems quite aware of her distinction. The irony of the fim is that they are all French just they have not been treated like ones. So the kids in the film are even halfsupportive of Lydia and Krimo's potential dating since they all grew up together so they still dont apply racial and class distinctions. They do try to see it as an ordinary coupling and give it a romantic dimension. However the harsh reality of their lives will come between them. Krimmo himself is a depressed and almost mute guy who desperately tries to be with Lydia. In the end we suspect that its not even love what drives him but more like some kind of desperate move desire for escape wish to bring a difference in his life with a clear expectation that he would be either turned down by Lydia or exposed to some other trouble. Krimmo is suspiciously lifeless which is explained by his father being in jail. However he is obviously depressed kid with desperate idea of reaching something extraordinary in his life which will always stay out of his hands. All female roles in this film are outstanding. Script and directing are very efficient in spite of long scenes of disputes and conflicts. Kechiche is apparently very good at getting the maximum from his actors. This is highly recommended film.".

He is surrounded by his macho violent homeys confused girlfriend conniving teenage girls and a beautiful actress named Lydia played by what may be the Olson Twin's longlost triplet.It plays out like the French Kids without the poignancy. It's tedious. In fact it gives new meaning to tedious. These shrill teenagers are constantly at each others throats.

But I was wrong. Not only was it quieter and tolerable. It was void of a climax at all. Not only is there no character change but there seemed to be an adamant effort to avoid this natural convention at all odds.

His florid fullthrottled female leads have always been the most sought after while his deeply personal works not only made celebrated stage stars out of Jessica Tandy Barbara Bel Geddes Elizabeth Ashley and Jessica Lange but created film legends out of Vivien Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor.  Fortunate in having a large number of his prizewinners transferred successfully to film Williams seldom failed to pique interest with his oldfashioned reveries of sexual longing or depravity.  1961's Summer and Smoke set in smalltown Mississippi in 1916 is a refulgent exercise in the former.The original Broadway version opened a year after the resounding success of Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire 1948 and though it doesn't match Streetcar in brilliance what does??? it has a luminosity all its own with Geraldine Page arguably the finest American theater actress of her time providing most of the wattage.  Page is one of the more fortunate stage stars to have had the honor of recreating a Williams' heroine for the screen.  She did so again a couple years later with the equally potent Sweet Bird of Youth.Ms. Page portrays prim genteel Alma Winemiller Miss Alma a minister's daughter chided as a youth by her school mates for being such.  Far removed from experiencing life's libidinous pleasures the grown up Alma has consigned herself to living a respectable straightlaced unbearably lonely existence as one of the town's more prideful eccentric symbols of religious piety.  Still living at home her drab life consists of teaching voice lessons and leading bible studies with matronly ladies twice her age. Adding to the drudgery is the obligation of caring for her elderly parents especially her emotionally erratic mother who delights in taunting Alma with cruel remarks while humiliating her in front of town folk with random acts of shoplifting.  The malcontent but dutiful Alma bravely bears up under the weight living a spinster's life way before her time.Enter Laurence Harvey's John Buchanan an exceptionally handsome hardliving playboy who lives on life's edge.  A nextdoor neighbor to Alma whose first passionate schoolyard crush was Buchanan the prodigal son has been sent back home to straighten out his reckless ways.  But life's sinful pleasures prove far too tempting and soon he is back to his old  habits of cathouse carousing and cockfighting matches.  Buchanan's return rekindles Alma's youthful stirrings for underneath the thick confining layers of corsets and bustles still lies a heart teeming with unbridled desire.As she reinserts herself slightly into Buchanan's life under the religious guise of soulsaving the effort leads to a brief lifealtering romantic interlude for Miss Alma. To witness the bipolar directions the two end up taking is the essence and fascination of Williams' elegiac piece.Geraldine Page Oscarnominated is spellbinding as Alma showing brilliant range and delicate power as the fading wallflower who suddenly overblooms. Laurence Harvey gives a remote synthetic performance as the roving Lothario which  I suppose is consistent with the character yet his rakish good looks and polished charm cannot be denied.As Alma's maddening mother who reverts to childlike behavior Una Merkel stands out among the supporting cast with a brittle flavorful Oscarnominated performance.  Malcolm Atterbury appropriately shows unflinching oldtown values as her stiff aloof minister of a father. Beautiful Pamela Tiffin in her early career plays Alma's young songbird student and object of attraction for Harvey with youthful vibrance.  And having just won an Oscar for West Side Story Rita Moreno unfortunately returns true to form in one of her many spitfire stereotypes as Harvey's jealous roundheeled paramour.  John McIntire is all gruff and grimace as Harvey's deprecating old man while young energetic Earl Holliman has a poignant showstopping scene with Page in the final reel as a traveling salesman.Leisurely paced with fine frilly attention to period detail and atmosphere the film earned Oscarnominations for its art direction and lovely lyrical Elmer Bernstein score.Required viewing for Tennessee Williams fans and a must for those who love to lose themselves in costumed romantic drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Summer and Smoke is another Tennessee Williams southern drama that after debuting as a play was made into a film and later an opera. Set earlier in the 20th Century it's the story of repressed passion unrequited love and desperation. Geraldine Page stars as Alma Winemiller the uptight daughter of a minister. She teaches voice sings a little and lives with her father and an insane mother Una Merkel. Alma since childhood has been in love with the young doctor next door John Buchanan Laurence Harvey the son of a doctor and a playboy. Buchanan has recently returned to town and is still a reckless playboy. Now he's involved with Rosa Zacharias Rita Moreno a girl from the wrong class and the wrong side of town. On the evening that something could have happened between Alma and John she runs from him. One night while a wild party is going on at the Buchanan house Alma goes next door and learns that Rosa and John are going to be married. Upset she calls John's father John MacIntyre at the hospital and urges him to return home. The result is tragedy.This is a very powerful and poignant story of two people one interested in earthly pleasures and one focused on the soul and spirit. Neither one is entirely right or wrong but it creates a chasm between them. When each realizes what the other has been saying it's too late for them.Geraldine Page who played this role to great acclaim on stage brings her magnificent portrayal to the screen. The role was based on Williams' sister who eventually went insane. If physically Page is a little less delicate looking than one imagines Tennessee Williams' female characters her portrayal contains all of the fragility of the role. The final scene between Alma and a salesman played by Earl Holliman shows the shocking contrast between Alma in the beginning and at the end of the film. Geraldine Page gave us all too few gems on films as she concentrated on the stage. We have to savor what we have.Laurence Harvey is very handsome and desirable but probably a little too refined for the role of John. The role needs someone whose sexuality is less ethereal and more earthbound. Una Merkel is excellent as Alma's mother a truly disturbed and frightening woman.Very good film based on a Williams play worth seeing for the wonderful Geraldine Page and its thoughtprovoking story.".

Una Merkel and John McIntire were especially worthy of praise Earl Holliman acquits himself manfully in a brief role in the chilling final sequence and Pamela Tiffin was touchingly beautiful as a heedless young thing.  However Rita Moreno who has since complained about all those spitfire roles with which she was saddled during her earlier Hollywood days probably counts this appearance as one of those she'd prefer we forget.  But parenthetically she has more than reason to be grateful for a list of credits that had already included the lovely Tuptim in the megabox office hit The King and I an Academy Award for her supporting role in West Side Story resulting in a career that continues to this day outlasting many of the top stars who had led the casts of her earliest film assignments.Peter Glenville's direction whose filmography is notably sparse marshalls his actors and the topnotch production values with aplomb aided by one of Elmer Bernstein's best scores.  The VHS version does not appear to be letterboxed thus losing cinematographer Charles Lang Jr.'s elegant Panavision framing which was one of this film's handsomer attributes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Geraldine Page received an Oscar nomination for her sterling portrayal of a small town spinster hoping to kindle a spark with the ne'erdowell doctor's son who has lived next door since they were kids.

	schema:reviewBody "Tennessee Williams brilliant and expertly told tale of a woman and man whose moral standards or lack of standards never meet as they they both journey to opposite extremes. The story is set in 1916. The lead role of a meticulous yet nervously self conscious reverend's daughter is skillfully portrayed by Geraldine Page. Her name is Alma as she indicates early on is Spanish for soul. Too highly moral minded to act on or even think of the physical acts of pleasure she exists in a fantasized world of the romanticized connection of souls. The realities of her life justify her mental escape. Her motherUna Merkel had a nervous breakdown some years back and is childishly stubborn. Alma to the outside observer purposely projects a maturity beyond her age as she has taken over many duties usually the responsibilities of a preacher wife. She also bears the duty of disciplinarian to her bratty shoplifting and childlike mother. She lives up to the responsibilities thrust upon her. Also she provides public vocal performances at special events and gives voice training lessons. In her fantasy she loves the young doctor next door with whom she grew up.Her handsome neighbor JohnLawrence Harveyis the son of the town doctor. He has recently finished his medical internship. He is morally the extreme opposite of Alma. He is a drinker womanizer gambler and lacks any sense of responsibility. He has just returned to town and shows Alma a bit of interest but is is distracted by newest town slut Rosa Zacharius whose father owns a nearby casino featuring drinking gambling and what else one can only imagine. He is bewitched by RosaRita Moreno. He still shows a mild interest in Alma.He takes Alma to the Casino one night and she is horrified by the activities there. She is with John watching a cock fight and is sickened. Suddenly a spot of blood from the fighting roosters splashes on her blouse. She screams. Brilliant T.W. symbolism! The pure spinster being marked with the symbol of original sin. John and Alma walk outside to a secluded spot. They become rather excited by one another. Alma is about to give in to her physical desire but her pure and high morals overtake the moment and she runs off.John and Rosa become engaged. One wonders why he thought he had to marry her since her character was one of the easiest conquests ever depicted.John's father is in another part of the state treating victims of a deadly outbreak of illness as a volunteer Alma alerts him about a wild party at his house. He returns home to find drunk people all over his property. He sees Rosa's father and starts beating the passed out man with his cane. He wakes up and shoots John's father. His father linger a few days and dies stating he does not forgive his son. Alma tells John she alerted his father to return home. John verbally assaults her with insulting dialog and blames her for his father's death.Alma descends into deep and dark depression. Meanwhile John is shocked into the reality of the situation and takes up his father's volunteer work at the clinic. He returns a hero to take over his fathers practice as town physician.Alma at this point has taken a dark journey. Her father asks her why she never dresses during the day and where she has been disappearing to at 200am. She reminds him of all the chores she does everyday and sayswhat more do you want of me? He says what will I tell people that ask about you? Her startling reply is You can tell them I have changed. You don't yet know how or why... but you may wish that I hadn't. The most important key scenes follow filled with amazing emotion and dialogue. Miss Page is at the top of her game in these scenes. Believe me Alma's father would have wished she hadn't changed. The final scene is lurid. Don't miss this underrated Tennessee Williams masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to see this film after reading reviews of Splendor in the Grass which claimed that the basic idea for that movie was borrowed by William Inge from Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke. I love Splendor and wanted to see if the 'Bard of the Midwest' could possibly have copied from his friend's homework.I think nearly all the films made from Tennessee Williams' plays reveal their stage origins but none more so than Summer and Smoke. Sometimes that theatricality works in a film's favour as it does in A Streetcar Named Desire but here it put me off at first. Nonetheless there are many things I do like about the film. Set in a small town in Mississippi in the early 1900's the story centres around Alma Winemiller Geraldine Page the daughter of a minister. She is in love with the boy next door John Buchanan Laurence Harvey the son of the local doctor. Repressed emotionally she believes that personal dignity is the most important thing of all he on the other hand is adventurous and wild. While she stays at home nursing her mentally ill mother he goes out into the world experiencing life to the full.John returns and has affairs with other women including Rita Marino's Rosa Zacharias in a couple of overthetop sequences. Alma is crushed but although both eventually come around to the other's way of thinking in the end they are just as apart as they were in the beginning.Although Inge probably saw Summer and Smoke when it opened on Broadway in the late 40's any influence was slight to say the least. As far as the two movies are concerned Splendor is the more accessible work while Smoke struggles to overcome its stage roots.Summer and Smoke does picks up the pace along the way and the two leads are good together. Geraldine Page is an unusually arresting actress and repeats her role from the stage. She has some tough speeches to deliver but the vulnerability of her character is painful to watch.I've always found Laurence Harvey a terrific screen presence but a number of his peers from British cinema and theatre would disagree  some even thought him a bad actor. Maybe they got his roles onscreen mixed up with his life offscreen. However there could also have been sour grapes involved he was very goodlooking had a great voice and the camera loved him he gives a confident performance in this film.I knew Elmer Bernstein's score long before I saw the movie. It is a beautiful and nostalgic work with a heartwrenching main theme. The music gives a haunting sense of loss to the film offsetting the static sets and overlit photography. It shows the power of music to enhance a film.Summer and Smoke presents some challenging ideas. It's not the best translation of Tennessee Williams to the screen but more than one scene stays in the memory.".

And since the twosome slip and slide off each other for two remorseless hours there's little let up in the ennui. The best part is the ending which I didn't see coming and was indeed unusual for it's time.

	schema:reviewBody "Geraldine Page had her first true starring role in Summer and Smoke released in 1961. Yes she had been a theatrical star and did television work and did fine in 1953's Hondo opposite John Wayne. But here Page brings the repressed Tennessee Williams character of Alma to glorious life. The story set in the 1920's deals with the Southern small town stifling morals of the day. Page is a preacher's daughter making her even more repressed her father is played by actor Malcom Atterbury with all the proper moral condemnation. Her mother played by old Hollywood star Una Merkel is mentally unbalanced adding to the responsibility Alma feels as she lives at home with both of them. Alma is at an age that would have been considered a spinster of the times. Enter the young handsome doctor John Laurence Harvey whom Alma has known since childhood since he lives next door with his cantankerous doctor father John McIntyre. Alma desires John but her own sexual inhibitions will now allow her to explore that so she secretly lusts after him. John is a fellow who focuses on the physical and takes up with a woman who would have been considered quite loose at the time Rita Moreno in an early performance. John knows Alma desires him and he is not sure how to handle it. He tries to take the relationship further but Alma resists his sexual advances. Neither of these individuals is wrong for how they feel  and they seem to go through the whole movie not connecting. This is probably the finest work Laurence Harvey did on screen  his smoldering sexuality is used here to great effect. He and Page have palpable chemistry. The supporting players are capable as well but this is Geraldine Page's show and her genteel demeanor and southern accent are spot on. We are left pondering Alma  she is both tragic and wonderful.".

Yes she had been a theatrical star and did television work and did fine in 1953's Hondo opposite John Wayne. But here Page brings the repressed Tennessee Williams character of Alma to glorious life. The story set in the 1920's deals with the Southern small town stifling morals of the day. Page is a preacher's daughter making her even more repressed her father is played by actor Malcom Atterbury with all the proper moral condemnation. Her mother played by old Hollywood star Una Merkel is mentally unbalanced adding to the responsibility Alma feels as she lives at home with both of them.

She carried these movies by her great acting skills and hard work.All of her movies need to be on DVD.

This Tennessee Williams play has a fiery script by James Poe  Meade Roberts and a brilliant performance by Page. Harvey is as stiff as he is in nearly all of his films. There's little chemistry between the two stars and while that's a detriment it doesn't derail the film. Peter Glenville an expert director who only made seven films recreates 1916 Americana nicely. Elmer Bernstein wrote the score. The supporting cast including Pamela Tiffin Rita Moreno John McIntire as Harvey's saintly father and Thomas Gomez is excellent. Lee Patrick has a great cameo as the town hussy and Una Merkel is a standout as Page's demented mother.".

Page won't give him that.But when you've got a raging libido like Harvey has the only kind of girl you want to quench it is Rita Moreno. 1961 was Rita's year to be naughty she won her Oscar playing gang girl Anita in West Side Story. Had that film not been out more attention might have been paid to what she did in Summer And Smoke.As Page is frigid and won't give up a little to land Harvey she resorts to a bit of trickery to break up Harvey and Moreno which ends in tragedy for one of the cast. Ironically both Harvey and Page modify their behaviors but there's too much that now makes them incompatible. In fact Page at the end is showing hints of becoming a lot like Tennessee Williams's other great character Blanche Dubois.Four Oscar nominations went out to Paramount for Summer And Smoke Best Actress for Geraldine Page Best Supporting Actress for Una Merkel Best ArtSet Decoration and Best Musical Score. Sadly it did not bring home a statue and poor Una Merkel her portrayal of Page's kleptomaniac mother lost to Rita Moreno for West Side Story.Summer And Smoke is a base hit for Tennessee Williams but not a home run.

	schema:reviewBody "The Boxer From Shan Tung 1972 is a rags to riches story about a country bumpkin who aspires to become the greatest gangster of his era. Ma Yong Zhen makes a name for himself from the ground up by getting the poor and the down trodden to become a part of his empire. But like all fast rising gangsters they have to fall sometime. The battle in the Tea House has to be the single greatest piece of action filmmaking I have ever seen. The usual Shaw Brothers players can be found in this two hour plus epic of bloodletting proportions. Kuan Tai Chen stars as Ma Yong Zhen. As usual he makes a great lead actor. He always sports a smile and never let his personal situations bring him down. Kuan also makes a credible butt kicking fighter. David Chiang has an extended cameo as Tan Si a fellow gangster who becomes a mentorfriend to Ma. Feng Ku costars as one of the 4 Champions of Shan Tung Wang Chung and HarkOn Fung have small roles as Tan Si's henchmen. Ching Li costars as the Tea House singer who falls for the mackdaddy charm of Ma Yong Zhen. Check out the remastered print from Celestial Films. Not only is the film restored to it's original running time but the picture is in pristine condition and the English subs are excellent. Get ready for some action packed bone crunching excitement!! Another winner from Chang Cheh and the Shaw Brothers!Highest recommendation possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "BOXER FROM SHANTUNG aka KILLER FROM SHANTUNG 1972 successfully combines gangster and kung fu genres to create a compelling twohour ragstoriches tale of a poor drifter in early 20th century Shanghai who rises up in the local mob by virtue of his kung fu skills. Ma Yung Chen played by Chen KuanTai so impresses the local bosses that he is quickly given his own teahouse and protection racket yet he remains loyal to his friends including a hapless little sidekick and friendly to the poor. He has a runin with another local gangster Tan David Chiang in an extended cameo but they soon develop mutual respect.The kung fu comes in when Ma is confronted by rival gangster Yang whose henchmen consist of the Four Champions. When Ma beats three of the Champions in their very first encounter an enmity develops that finally culminates in a massive brawl at a neutral teahouse where Ma takes on dozens of Yang's thugs. In this remarkable fight scene Ma is hit with an ax but continues to fight up and down the two stories of the building with the ax imbedded in his stomach. It's all shot in the Shaw Bros. studio and backlot in Hong Kong with some additional work on HK locations familiar to kung fu fans.Chen KuanTai EXECUTIONERS FROM SHAOLIN was bigger and strongerlooking than most Shaw Bros. kung fu stars and carries the right air of brute force and intimidation in what is essentially the role of a petty gangster. Yet his broad smile outgoing manner and protective nature give his roughhewn character a likability that attracts audience sympathy. Ma is not just a standard vengeanceseeking kung fu student forced to learn new styles to beat a more powerful opponent. He is more at loose ends trying to find his way in the world and not necessarily on the straight and narrow path.Aside from Chen and David Chiang the few familiar kung fu faces in the cast include Cheng Kay Yeh as Chen's sidekick Ku Feng as one of the champions and Wang Ching. Topbilled actress Ching Li costars as Chen's love interest a singer in the restaurant he runs although her role is less significant than the billing would indicate. The film was directed by kung fu specialist Chang Cheh with Pao Hsueh Li given a codirecting credit. The action directors are an impressive lot and include Tang Chia Liu Chia Liang Lau Kar Leung and Liu Chia Yung.ADDENDUM A followup of sorts is the similarlystyled MAN OF IRON 1972 also reviewed on this site which also costars Chen Kuan Tai and Ching Li but gives Ms. Ching a larger more interesting role. QUEEN BOXER 1974 also reviewed on this site is an unofficial nonShaw sequel to SHANTUNG and focuses on the sister of Ma Yung Chen as she arrives in Shanghai and begins a quest for vengeance.

The music has also a sad feel to it. Avarice is the main driving force of most of the characters as they go about their business but over all there is a doomed air.Kuan Tai Chen who plays Ma Yung Chen very well has a pleasant appealing smile but there is something sad in him too. His yearning to be somebody is touching. He is plausible in the fight scenes too particularly the tremendous gory fight at the end which seems to go on endlessly like a nightmare you can't wake up from. David Chiang as usual is great though not on the screen long enough. The 'four champions' in the film include the Shaw Brothers regular Feng Ku who is always good value.I believe John Woo worked as an assistant director on the film and is a fan of the director Cheh Chang. Compare the end of this film with the end of Woo's 'The Killer'.There is a lot of combat in this film but it sits well with the narrative and the characters. Some martial art films are all fighting and no plot but 'Boxer from Shantung' has both in equally good measures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before the advent of DVD media films such as Cheng Cheh's Boxer From Shantung could only be seen in severely butchered form complete with laughable and awful dubbing fair to poor picture quality always in pan and scan format with a percentage of the picture chopped out and in most cases with the harder violence removed as well. Finally Ma Yong Zhen can be seen the way director Cheh envisioned his passionate rags to riches epic with epic being a suitable word as this film is quite big in scope and surpasses the 2 hour mark. The tale itself is a familiar one to be sure a young ambitious street urchin uses his unique boxing skills and mental cunning to climb the bloody ladder of success and fortune. But this tale has rarely been filmed so eloquently. There is so much to praise here beginning with cinematography forget comparing this film with the endless and uninspired kungfu pictures made through the 60's to 70's. For the look of Ma Yong Zhen is that of a mostly beautiful arthouse style production. This can finally be seen in it's original aspect ratio of 235 widescreen and the difference is hardly describable. For years apparently this was only released widely with a running time of just over 90 minutes but the wonderful DVD from Celestial Pictures restores the feature to it's 124 minute running time. The lead character played by Chen Kuantai is really superb in his role as the ambitious 'Ma'. He possesses a strange utterly unique physical beauty which somehow elicits sympathy from the viewer. The film reminded me a bit of 1983's Scarface as the stories as well as the extreme violence are similar themes within both pictures. However Chen's character never loses touch with his own humanity unlike Tony Montana who became a monster. And I must agree with another poster who described the feeling of sadness that envelops the film. Much of it is quiet subdued featuring some haunting and totally unobtrusive musical score. Of course this is misleading as the film explodes with a brand of violence hard to describe for the films breathtaking climax. That new DVD also features the original Mandarin language audio track and hearing the original language is the only way to see this. There are English subtitles as well. Recommended viewing for anyone curious to see a how a traditional kungfu film can be transformed into a work of art.".

Unfortunately the times are tough and oftentimes he and his friends don't even have enough money for a roof over their heads. But after meeting a legendary crime lord Tan Si David Chiang Ma realizes that the only way to move forward in this city of poverty and misery is to do so through illegal means.Boxer from Shantung elevates itself above most of its peers by the virtue of its fight scenes. Chen is a fantastic fullytrained martial artist whose various moves and stunts are beautiful to watch. I also like the fact that unlike in so many other martial arts films the main character is not invincible. Fitting for a gangster film. The last fight scene is actually pretty brutal to watch because of this but all the more awesome for it. Definitely one of the best fight scenes I've seen in my life and worth the price of admission by itself.What keeps the film from being a masterpiece is the fact that the story is rather bland. It starts out well enough and the ending is fantastic but the middle part lost me pretty quickly. It felt like the film was simply going through the motions to get to the good part. It's by no means awful and you still get a lot of good fights but the characters themselves don't become as dear to you as they should.Still it's a film you see to watch people kung fu fighting. And for that it is a very good film. If you're looking a captivating story and fleshedout characters this is not your film but I think you already knew that walking in.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1970's Shaw Brothers studio epic from legendary director Chang Cheh still seems to be as increasingly watchable to this day.Chen Kuan Tai stars as Ma Yong Zhen a street urchin in 1930's Shanghai who gets by washing carriages for the upperclass. But he desires more he wants to have his own power wealth and status in the city of Shanghai. After a couple of errands with the Four Dragon's gang Ma gets the recognition he yearns for and is seen as a saviour to the poor and begins his parade by taking over districts in Shanghai. Soon the power and status he has craved for begins to crumble the innerhappiness he has longed for.The film has proved to be very influential to this day as John Woo was assistant director and the Four Dragon's gang was also used in Stephen Chow's 'Kung Fu Hustle' but known as the Axe Gang the finale of Ryo Seung Wan's 'City of Violence' also bears resemblance to the finale of 'Ma Yong Zhen'. Chen proves to be a worthy lead as his appearance and performance comes as very empathetic and proves quite adequately in fight sequences. Chang Cheh regular David Chiang plays a small role but sadly shows very little martial arts skills. The fights are somewhat average if not very bloody but the story line the central performances the cinematography and the music score make this film stand out as an evergreen classic. What drew me into this film was it's cool and slick opening sequence kind of like Chang Cheh's 'Vengeance' it creates the atmosphere of mystery danger rage and excitement.All I can say is if you can see a worthy version of this movie sadly there's no DVD released in the UK yet go and see it. But I'm sure other DVD distributors in other countries have released the full uncut version of this classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of those films that you find in a Everything here 1... bin at your video store. It's dated the video and sound quality are poor the acting is typically shthouse and the storyline has been done 100 times before. But being somewhat of a fan of kungfu films I try to see anything no matter how bad it looks. The Boxer From Shantung is no classic of the genre but it does provide some excitement some innovative concepts and some of your standard Shaw Brothers kick ass action so it can't be a complete waste. One thing that came straight to mind when I saw the 'House of Blue Leaves' chapter in Kill Bill vol. 1 was this film. The Boxer From Shantung inspired the sequence where the crazy 88s come rushing into the club through any entrance available. Admittedly though Tarantino did it better. Also the lead actor Kuan Tai Chen kept reminding me of Charles Bronson he looks like him but it's mostly his mannerisms. He went on to star in many more Shaw Brothers films see The Flying Guillotine. 710  but only because I'm partial to kungfu films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ma Yung Chen Chen Kuan Tai from Shantung yearns to be someone of importance. Someone people don't look past but admire as he walks own the street. He is going to take pal Hsiao Chiang Bei Cheng KangYeh aka Little Hsiao Chiang Bei along with him. Those who were with him when he was down and stick by his side as he rises will be rewarded well. When Ma meets the infamous Boss Tan the always amazing David Chiang Da Wei he knows exactly what he wants to be. He refuses a job from Boss Tan announcing he will get where he wants to be on his own. he will owe no one for his success. It creates an immediate respect between the two.Ma's steps to become important include accidentally intervening in a district fight between Boss Tan and Boss Yang Chiang Nan. Ma's Iron Fists easily defeat Yang's men who have nearly destroyed Tan's men in the district. Yang thinks Ma is working for Tan despite Ma's assurances he is on his own. Yang sees Ma as a means to indirectly screw with Tan over district dominance and an impending opium deal. Little Hsiao learns about a contest involving a Russian Muscleman and a 20 bet. If you can make the Russian fall you win 20 and no doubt recognition in Shanghai as someone on the rise. It's the perfect stepping stone for Ma. One of Yang's 4 Champion fighters Li Caishun Tien Chiang is on hand to guard the proceeds fro the challenge. Li and Ma have already had on run in and Li wants t make sure there will not be a third encounter. Li is one of those men who's powerful so long as he has minions around him. Ma defeats both Li an the Russian without much of a sweat Ma will have run in with two more of Yang's champions and also back them down without much effort. This irks the Champions and seems to amuse Yang who back burners the issue to focus on ridding himself of Tan before the Opium deal can occur. Ma learns he has become the boss of the poorest section in Shanghai. Tan lost the area to Yang who in turn technically lost it to Ma during their fist encounter. Tan sends along some of his best men including Bruce Tong YimChaan to help Ma establish himself as Boss. All profits from the area go directly to Ma. Tan sends a message nothing is owed to Tan or anyone else. Ma did this on his own.Ma has flirtations with a local singer Chin Lin Chi Ching Li. They exchange glances an smiles but it never goes beyond that Not like in Man of Iron where Ching Li and Chen Kuan Tai become an actual couple. Chin Lin Chi loses interest when Ma goes from being a no boy to the boss of her area. She sees him now as just another thug looking to make a name for himself while stepping on others. Ma is picked on by his men for his interest in Chin Lin Chi. Ma brushes it off by announcing he can get any woman he wants  and proves it.Ma gets a carriage and has it painted identical to Tan's  as he is still trying to emulate Tan. Even Tan's former men who are now with Ma remark how similar the two are. Ma is discussing expanded his holdings with his men but doesn't want to step on Tan's toes or deal with Yang. There is a Casino an Brothel that neither seems to possess. Ma goes on his own to take on the owner Chang Chin Fa Ku Feng one of Yang's Champions. Chin Fa is infuriated when Yang orders him to give the properties to Ma. It is all part of Yang's plan to deal with Ma once Tan is out of the way.When Tan learns the properties are now in the possession of Ma and that Ma has a carriage identical to his own his is flattered and offers a warning. Yang is far more devious than he appears. Ma needs to watch every move he makes where Yang is concerned. Little Hsiao promises to pass on the warning. Sadly Tan doesn't heed his own advice and is ambushed by Yang through information leaked by Tan's right hand man Wong Chung. Ma goes in search of Tan and finds the ambush aftermath. Ma vows to avenge Tan by taking on Yang. Ma prepares for the meeting with Yang by ensuring Little Hsiao is out of harms way. He tells Little Hsiao to get 100 from the cashier and get out of Shanghai. Little Hsiao should go buy a farm get married and live a happy life. The life Ma has created for himself has no room for someone as honorable as Little Hsiao. Ma ignores his men's behest not to confront Yang on his own. The man cannot be trusted. Ma promises things will work out the way they were meant to work out. His men should stay put and wait for his return. Everyone seems to know this is a suicide mission but none speak to it.Yang has filled the tea house with his own men. Which I have come to expect with storylines like this. You know what will happen but you have to watch anyway. I have to applaud Ma's stamina. He took a beating but kept coming back for more. Chin Fa has buried a hatchet in Ma's stomach and it didn't even phase Ma. Yang watches in interest and horror as his men are killed one by one by Ma. even his champions don't stand a chance against a man who has nothing more to lose.Ma's men arrive to help him as Ma struggles to remain on his feet to reach is final goal  Killing Yang for the murder of Tan. Yang's men are sent outside to deal with ma's men. The blood bath fills the street. Ma can barely stand by the time he gets his hands on Yang. One of Yang's men who is also mortally wounded attacks Ma after Yang has dawn his last breath. The irony of Ma's situation doesn't seem lost on him as he break out in hysterical laughter. He did exactly as he planned. He became someone. Someone people notice on the street. Someone people on some level respected. He also mirrored Tan's rise and fall nearly to the letter. Ma's men enter the tea house as Ma dies at the foot of the stairs. They take their revenge on the man who dealt Ma's final blow.Little Hsiao has done as Ma requested. He has packed everything he possesses and is boarding a train out of Shanghai. Also on the train are Chin Lin Chi and her uncle who are no doubt hoping to go where others will not dictate their lives.".

David Chiang shows up in supporting role as a crime boss who is admired by Kuan Tai. Although he only appears briefly he still gets a chance to show of his moves and be a tough guy.The main themes of brotherhood and betrayal are all here as usual and the film culminates in one of the finest final fight scenes to appear in a Shaw Brothers Movie.Of course there is still the usual problems as in a lot of the more modern day Chang Cheh films no one considers the idea of actually just shooting the hero from afar. Of course they don't that would be too sensible and most of the villains here are idiots. Of course if they just shot him it would end the movie quite abruptly. Instead Kuan Tai gets to fight it out in a bloody trail of glory and doesn't even give up when he's gets an axe in the stomach.An axe in the stomach and he fights till the end with it sticking out of him. Any other film you may think this is ridiculous but in a Chang Cheh film this is expected.Chen Kuan Tai would go on to work with Chang Cheh in numerable other occasions but was never better than in Boxer from Shantung.Also check out the remakes Hero starring Yuen Biao  Takeshi Kaneshiro and also the more recent Once Upon a Time in Shanghai. Both deserve a look but don't live up to Cheh's classic.".

Imagine this a kind of Chinese SCARFACE its morals of the power of corruption the falsity of greed and its story structure are all very similar. Unfortunately it's a lengthy film that can't quite retain interest throughout all of its scenes meaning I had to watch it in a number of goes to follow the story. And although the kung fu fights are adequate for the most part they are hardly classic examples of choreography with a few exceptions the battle with the Russian fighter is a great one for example.The thing that holds this film together remarkably well are the performances. Chen Kuan Tai EXECUTIONERS FROM SHAOLIN is excellent as the lead a dedicated ruthless but humane young man and he proves to be a worthwhile hero. John Cheung SNAKE IN THE MONKEY'S SHADOW provides support as his loyal friend and servant whilst Shaw Brothers hero David Chiang excels in his more minor turn as a boss. The villains are a remarkable bunch consisting of the vicious 'Four Champions' and their performances are also excellent as is the usual for a Shaw Brothers movie. The most memorable thing by far in this film is the thirtyminute finale in which a mortally wounded Chen Kuan Tai attempts to get revenge on those who caused his death and also the death of his friend. The result is a real bloodbath of a fight with violent director Chang Cheh really making use of the crimson gore with endless blood spurts and slimy torsos. Watching this finale is a real test as you can almost feel Tai's pain thanks to his strong acting. In fact the film is worth watching for this tourdeforce climax alone.".

I feel sorry for those stuck with a version shorter by a half hour. My favorite supporting actor of the era Ku Feng was in this too but if I told you I watched 2 Shaw Brothers movies today and he was in both... well this shouldn't be a surprise.

So what have we? Theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen Denmark. It came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from Bend it like Beckham where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister. Here we have it transferred to a Turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And we have a love story and a competition of course too. After I accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful Kung Fu I'm not an expert though. The lead actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress. Rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes  The male Turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right.  The audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge.  Xian Gao a Chinese cinematic Kung Fu instructoractor Hidden Tiger Crouching Dragon played the lead role's masterIf you get the chance to see this in cinema do it you'll probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if this works on small screen as well".

	schema:headline " kung fu movie set in the real world";
	schema:reviewBody "In regards to comparisons with Bend It Like Beckham I would say this film is like it's older mature cousin. Bend It Like Beckham was cute fun with a traditional Hollywood fairytale story. This film strips all the Hollywood fairytale and plonks the story in the mundane real world. The romance is careful and considered with real world reactions the family reconciliation doesn't leave you with a happy happy family feeling the Yoda equivalent offers opportunities but no answers and seems helpless through most of the film and the main character's kung fu obsession doesn't end with all conquering victory. What you do get instead is a character tug of war where one side wants her to be a traditional Turkish girl and the other wants her to embrace modern Western idealism. For me this is what makes the film clever. It's not simply about a girl trying to overcome her limitations but a girl fighting to not be boxed in by any ones social norms whether it be Eastern or Western. The Western lifestyle is not held up as some moral superior as it is in many other films of this nature. This film is simply about a girl trying to forge her own path without having to embrace everyone else's values. As a final note I noticed a lot of people thinking she is being kicked out of her martial arts class at the beginning of the film due to aggression. While it is true she is aggressive she's not being kicked out. The teacher notices her frustration at having no challenging opponents because she has out skilled everyone in the class the teacher feels be better of in a more advanced school.

	onyx:emotionText "In regards to comparisons with Bend It Like Beckham I would say this film is like it's older mature cousin. Bend It Like Beckham was cute fun with a traditional Hollywood fairytale story. This film strips all the Hollywood fairytale and plonks the story in the mundane real world. The romance is careful and considered with real world reactions the family reconciliation doesn't leave you with a happy happy family feeling the Yoda equivalent offers opportunities but no answers and seems helpless through most of the film and the main character's kung fu obsession doesn't end with all conquering victory. What you do get instead is a character tug of war where one side wants her to be a traditional Turkish girl and the other wants her to embrace modern Western idealism. For me this is what makes the film clever. It's not simply about a girl trying to overcome her limitations but a girl fighting to not be boxed in by any ones social norms whether it be Eastern or Western. The Western lifestyle is not held up as some moral superior as it is in many other films of this nature. This film is simply about a girl trying to forge her own path without having to embrace everyone else's values. As a final note I noticed a lot of people thinking she is being kicked out of her martial arts class at the beginning of the film due to aggression. While it is true she is aggressive she's not being kicked out. The teacher notices her frustration at having no challenging opponents because she has out skilled everyone in the class the teacher feels be better of in a more advanced school. If you ask me this is good teaching and I wish more teachers were this observant.";

Simple little things like this and the floating camera ? make it a good MOVIE and add power to the story and the acting. I don't know if it was intentional but Semra's less is more acting really helped sell the internal struggle she was going through to deal with the chains of Turkish societal and familial expectations.

And when he saw it he totally dislike it... said to me there was not much fights and the story didn't save it... Well it took me almost 8 months to finally rent it a night i really didn't know what to pick... and here we are... Glad i did cause i totally enjoyed it... Sure there is indeed not that much fight and this have nothing to do with grudge match bloodsport style or undisputed style... Its all about the story about a little girl who want to do what she want and should be allow to do so like every normal north American can do but sadly she is born in a country and a culture that is way too much old school like its still the 1800s.... I may shock people here but i could never and will never understand the Muslims culture.... I am just SO NOT in religion and old school way of life... So for me that movie was very important it use a subject i really likemartial arts to demonstrate a story about racial problems and discrimination... It may not show a lot of fights and they are very basic too but its so much more than that.... Im the kind of guy who can appreciate an old school 1995 kickboxing movie about a grudge match between the former and the new champion but i can also appreciate a good story movie and this is what it is.".

Fighter left a few side conflicts unresolved. The film didn't try to wrap up each and every story arc in a neat little bow. I believe this is intentional because for a long time afterward the dangling story threads provoked me to consider the issues Fighter presented a little more deeply. Basically this film respects the viewer enough to depart from the expected resolutions. I would have awarded it 7 stars but that earned it one extra.I think Bruce would have approved.".

A boy Emil helps Aicha train for the club championship and they fall in love. Aicha is forced to decide who she is and what she wants. This is more a movie about culture and it shows how immigrants to the west with Muslim values never really get to fit in as they cling to traditional ways of doing things. The coldness and at time cruelty of her father is probably not very unusual in similar family's. The fact that Aicha wants to do Kung fu is sort of irrelevant as she could have chosen anything that her family didn't approve of.As for the movie itself Semra Turan is pretty good as the main character although there is to much of her running in panic that gets a bit annoying. Cyron Melville as Emyl the boy who falls for her is a decent actor pretty good acrobat but clearly not a martial artist. I've never liked movies that overly feature wire work but this is what the director wanted.So if you like good Kung fu movies this isn't really for you but as a movie about clashes of cultures it is pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyone.The story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and wins.In Girlfight it's boxing in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer and now it's Kung Fu.But Fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this clich movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet. The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie  A first martial arts film from Denmark but don't be fooled it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincing.Bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story.".

In the end you are your own jury in determining the guilt of these blackwearing Metallicalistening boys who didn't quite fit in.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit that I've never been too crazy about documentaries.  For one thing I think that they are generally biased and you are only seeing what the filmmakers want you to see.  Now I watched Paradise Lost for several reasons.  One I've always been intrigued by peoples' ignorance and I'm still amazed at how quick they are to point a finger at something they know nothing about. Several years ago I remember this story being all over the news and the way it was presented then it was very easy to believe that these three outcasts were the killers.  I've been through West Memphis numerous times since the killings and I still get the chills everytime I pass by the Blue Beacon truckwash.I sat down to this three hour film with a pretty open mind.  While the film doesn't really answer any questions it does bring a lot to mind and never takes sides on whether the boys did or didn't do it.  That's what I admire about the filmmakers.  They managed to stay almost completely neutral no matter what their feelings or opinions may have been on who the actual murderers were.Watching this movie is scary.  I've polluted my mind over the years with just about every junkhorror movie that I could find and nothing has given me that icy feeling quite like this has.  I've seen it three times now and it never loses its impact.For those who don't know here's the story  In West Memphis three young children are found mutilated in a patch of woods just off the interstate. For no real reason whatsoever three nonconformist teens are brought to trial one of which has an I.Q. that is somewhere in the 70s.  When he gives a very phony sounding confession the trials begin with absolutely no other evidence to prove that the boys are guilty.  Throughout the film we meet each of the deceased boys parents the defendents and the defendents' families.  Most angry of all are the parents of the Byers boy who was murdered.  Now before I get started on the stepfather Mark Byers I really want to say that I can totally empathize with the guy and his rage is completely understandable.  However what I really can't get past is the guy's bizarre behavior and the impression that he left me with. The guy takes up a lot of screen time.  I know that the guy is a jeweler by trade and acting may not be his thing but this is a DOCUMENTARY and while watching him on more than several occasions I got a little confused. Yeah the guy has some mental problems he's on numerous medications he's suffering from a brain tumor and he's going through some major grieving. But why does he act like he's been watching TOO much WWF?  His lines are straight out of a BAD movie and if this is how the guy really is I'm staying the hell out of this guy's way.  Throughout the film there are several subtle or not so subtle indications that he may be a suspect. The fact that he gave one of the filmmakers a bloody knife as a Christmas present more than proves that the guy is a little off his rocker.  He even admitted to having beat the child the day that he was murdered.Remember there is absolutely NO physical evidence to pin on the accused and the only thing that got them there was a false confession given by a legally retarded teenager who had been interrogated for hours.  Oh and did I mention that his story KEPT changing?  Listening to Jesse Misskelly the time that the boys were murdered takes place all over the clock.  Once he states that the boys were murdered in the A.M. hours then during broad daylight then at night. I don't get it.  It didn't matter to the jury. Two of the boys still got life sentences and the other Damien Eckols got the death sentence. His crime is that he had a fondness for wearing black had a bad haircut and a slight interest in Wicca...Not a whole lot different from myself.  Anyway there is also mention of another mysterious person who made an appearance in a Bojangles restaurant restroom covered in blood. Oh yeah that is another issue that is barely mentioned and then dropped.After seeing this movie I was still terribly confused and my questions were still unanswered but I guess that is the sign of a good documentary.  I'm really glad that the filmmakers stuck with the facts and never let their opions get in the way of making the film.  The sequel is also very good but still leaves nothing answered.  Now it's been several years since the first time I watched this but the boys are still in prison still trying to get out.  I reccomend this film to anyone who has ever been criticized for their appearance.  It'll make you realize just how lucky you are while questioning the justice system at the same time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. Being a victim of a violent crime to something of this degree I understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them.Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid Jessie with a 72 IQ hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca he must be a Satanist.To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason and the most important is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't.".

Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason and the most important is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't.";

I am in no way claiming my support for the three found guilty but I for one could never convict them based on this evidence. The film shows just how unstable people can be when faced with those that don't conform. I was amazed by how much I disliked the parents of the murdered boys. They ramble and scream about killing these three already convinced of their guilt. They seem more unstable and threatening to me and not just because their children have been murdered. No real physical evidence is brought up against the boys whom should probably start training professional killers on how not to leave evidence at a murder site. I know for a fact that a lot of details were left out of this documentary and the celebrity worship that has followed the accused since is a bit too much. However this film is terrifying. It shows that just because of the way you look and what people say about you can take away your entire life. Make sure to check out all the evidence for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have ever doubted that there are some serious injustices in the political system you must see this film. This is a documentary about three teenagers who are accused of being murderers simply because they aren't conformists. They are accused of murdering three innocent children despite there being no evidence no witness testimonies and not a single shred of a motive reason or cause. The three teenagers who are convicted are Jessie Misskelly Jr. who is a mentally impaired young man Jason Baldwin who is a thin shy and slightly underweight kid and Damien Wayne Echols who is into metal music wears black and is part of the Wiccian religion. There are the three children who are murdered Christopher Byers Steve Branch and Michael Moore. The opening sequences depict the findings of the bodies in the woods. Christopher Byers looked to have been beaten to death after his genitals were mutilated. Steve Branch and Michael Moore were suffocated. There is not a single drop of blood at the murder scene despite the fact that Christopher would have bled profusely if his genitals were cut off and yet everyone seems to be extremely convinced for some reason that the murder of Christopher occurred in the woods. It's possible that Michael and Steven were drowned nearby but there doesn't appear to be any sign of a struggle. The parents of these innocent victims seem hellbent on insuring that Jessie Jason and Damien did it despite there being nothing to even suggest. There are rumors of them being seen planning the murders but those don't have any real backing. Meanwhile people make up stories about Satan worshiping and that the murder of these three boys involved some sort of sacrificial ceremony. You have got to be kidding! Why on earth would people believe this stuff!!! The town of West Memphis Arkansas is blinded by their religious faith that they aren't seeing things in a reasonable and more realistic light. This film contains footage of absolutely everything. Once you see it you can decide for yourself if they did it or not but I don't see any connection. Sorry.".

I had a lot of trouble with this film. One of the things that makes it unusual is that the filmmakers were given incredible access to most all the people involved from the accused to the legal teams to family and friends even to the judge. We are even given behindthescenes looks at defense strategy sessions. All of the participants agreed to be filmed. This special access is all well and good but it is well known that people behave differently when they know they are being filmed and I question how much of an impact the filming actually had on the trial. Are we seeing people's real reactions or are we seeing performancesthe whole affair has the feeling of being scripted. This question of performance for the camera is particularly relevant for Damien Echols the accused that the film concentrates on. In one scene we see him preening before a mirror. The stepfather of one of the murdered children actually turned over a knife to the film crew that was ultimately submitted as evidence! It is not good when those reporting on a story become part of the story.The film is slanted toward making a case for the fact that the accused boys were wrongly convicted. I don't know how long the trials one boy was tried separately went on but what we are given cannot be but a small percentage of what was presented to the jury. So many things were not covered that I began to feel that the biases of the filmmakers were dominating the proceedings. From what is presented I would not have been able to find the boys guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt but I felt that I was not given enough information to make a definitive decision.So many questions were unanswered. It seemed clear that the murders took place in a location other than where the bodies were found. How far was that location from a road from where it would have been convenient to carry the bodies. What was the relationship among the three accused? It was stated that one of them had an IQ of 72 could that guy have been a good friend to the other two seemingly intelligent guys? Was he a good enough friend to be trusted to remain silent? Were alibis checked out? Was the evidence connecting the accused boys to the crime really as tenuous as shown? And so on.Out of respect for the dead shouldn't we have been told at least something about the victims? The only role they played was to have their horrible deaths exploited by the sensational trial the media and by the filmmakers. Instead of a reasoned narrative to provide initial background the audience is first hit with shocking footage of the crime scene where lay the three naked young bodies.

	schema:reviewBody "Shocking powerful bizarre. This remarkable documentary by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky which chronicles the murders and subsequent trials of three 8 year old boys may leave you buzzing for days pondering what may or may not have happened.The film takes place in the small Southern town of West Memphis Arkansas. There's an abundance of churches the townspeople speak with thick southern drawls and routinely answer questions with a brisk 'yessir'. The town is rocked one day in early May of 1993 when the slain naked bodies of three 2nd grade boys are found in a wooded area known as Robin Hood Woods. No one knows who did it but an 18 year old outsider Damien Echols who has a penchant for wearing and dying his hair black as well listening to heavy metal music is brought in for questioning. It is not until a month later that a friend of Echols Jessie Miskelly Jr. is also questioned which leads to a confession that Echols and another Jason Baldwin carried out the murders while Miskelly himself helped subdue one of the victims who tried to escape. The three teens are quickly arrested and the townspeople especially the parents of the victims are convinced of the three teens' guilt. Nevermind that the lone confessor has a low IQ and may have been forced into confession or that there is a complete lack of physical evidence. Justice will now be served either by the court system or if need be by they the parents themselves.The prevailing sentiment here seems to be that yes the three teens have been falsely accused and that the real killer may be the stepfather of one of the victims one John Mark Byers. Byers is shown repeatedly throughout the film either quoting from the bible chastising the devilor hellbent on justice. But when he gives the filmmakers of the film a knife as a gift a shadow of suspicion is cast over him particularly since there is evidence of blood on it.I however have to say that the three suspects may not be so entirely innocent. The first thing of course is Jessie's confession. Now I know Jessie has an IQ of 72 and the record of his police interrogation is incomplete but that IS his voice on that tape confessing that he was there and saw Damien and Jason attacking the boys. His lawyer wants to argue that all this was coerced that Jessie was led throughout this entire confession. But I don't know that. Jessie never gets on the stand to testify. All I see from him during the whole trial is his head down in apparent shame the way a dog does when it knows its done something terribly wrong. Add to this that one of the police interrogators Bryn Ridge testifies that Jessie indicated he had attended Satanic ritualistic meetings with Echols and Baldwin where animals were sacrificed. I don't see any cross examination refuting that and that's some pretty damaging evidence going on prior to the killings.Jesssie is subsequently found guilty and sentenced to life plus 40 years. He offers no real response to the guilty verdict and is whisked away in a police car. A mother of one of the victims vows to mail him a skirt for his new home in prison and angrily hopes he gets what's coming to him.A month later Echols and Baldwin are tried for their part in the murders. Although Jessie is offered a reduced sentence if he testifies against the boys he refuses to do so apparently unwilling to lie in court in front of his stepmother. The prosecution doesn't have a whole lot to go on but it seems that Miskelly's guilty verdict in itself is enough evidence against both. There are few things during this segment that points to the guilt of these two. When Jason Baldwin is asked what he would say to the families of the victims who thinks he did this Baldwin stares at the floor in a loss for words finally saying I don't know. An innocent kid might have said he felt bad...but had nothing to do with it.Then there is the damaging testimony from a Michael Roy Carson who indicates Baldwin confessed the crime in detail to him while they were in the juvenile detention center. Carson says that Baldwin told him he cut the boys penis off sucked the blood and put the balls in his mouth. Shocking and believable testimony. The cross examination from Baldwin's attorney is weak. Later we see a meeting with these lawyers discussing how they could discredit Carson's testimony but it seems confusing and vague and never comes to light in court anyway.During his closing statement the lawyer for Baldwin Paul Ford argues that there's no physical evidence linking Baldwin to the crime and that guilt by association is a horrible thing. He seems to be conceding that Echols actually did it but Baldwin wasn't there. It's a weak argument. Everyone knows that Miskelly pointed to all three being there and that Baldwin and Echols were always locked at the hip. Even still there's no physical evidence linking Echols to the scene either.And what about that John Mark Byers anyway. While he's the type of guy I wouldn't want to be sitting next to in a bar after he's had a couple glasses of whiskey he can't be that DUMB to have handed over the actual murder to anyone. Particularly to the filmmakers documenting the whole story in the first place.I think that the boys did it but never really had a grasp of what they were getting themselves into. It's a stunning portrait of a small town America caught up in a tragic situation not knowing how to react except upon instinct.".

Scary as this seems take further into account that all the people in this documentary are real and agreed to be filmed. Calling this Jerry Springer Goes to the Movies would be exaggerating but not by much.Consider Paradise Lost starts with the old trick of shocking the viewer to draw them in. This is done with very graphic footage of three murdered and mutilated second grade boys. The film makers show little to no sympathy for their passing. The boys merely are props.Three murder suspects and a menagerie of relatives and friends then are introduced. It becomes evident within these first few minutes that Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky the film makers doubt the guilt of three misfit high school boys charged with the crime. They focus heavily on the leader Damien who enjoys the attention of the camera so much that he becomes unaware that he really is on trial for murder. He even plays up the part by openly showing his interest in witchcraft and death  the bodies of the dead boys appeared to have had ritualistic markings cut into them.Subtle suspicion is aimed toward the stepfather of one of the dead boys. The film makers repeatedly question him about the murders trying to pin down his uneven responses. The man simply isn't very educated and later we discover he has a brain tumor. In turn it's easy to confuse him into giving suggestive answers and cause him to appear somewhat guilty. Passing interest is given to his alibi which is airtight. Instead we are expected to believe that because he is mentally slow that he might have done it.Suspicion also is placed on a mysterious derelict reportedly seen in the area around where the boys were found. In fuzzy eyewitness accounts he is said to have acted strangely and of course is never found or identified.Uneducated also defines many of the other people shown in the film. The film makers however are very intelligent and use this to their advantage. While never directly stating their opinions they use leading and suggestive questions to twist the recollections and comments of those they interview. They also cleverly leave out important pieces of information that lead to the outcome of the trial. Both combine to place a shadow over the convictions of Damien and his two cohorts who lack the intelligence to do anything but play along.Damien whether guilty or not never shows remorse and floats back and forth between a druglike mental haze and an almost gleeful indulgence in playing the 90s version of Charles Manson. Indifference is not the mark of an innocent man.I wonder if Damien ever sits in his cell at night considering what he traded for his 15 minutes of fame.".

Damien Echols Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin were the victims of misdirected revenge convicted primarily on the hearsay of people who had long ostracized them for how they dressed. Rumor became hard evidence.After seeing this film I am truly ashamed of the behavior of the police the prosecution and the media.

Three teen outsiders Jessie Misskelley Jr. Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin are soon taken in as suspects in a supposed satanic sadosexual murder ritual. Despite questionable evidence and questionable police tactics the three are convicted with Damien getting death by lethal injection.Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky are functional documentarians. The film looks more like a TV news report from the 80s. It's gritty and raw. More than anything it is the subject matter that is the most compelling. It's a fascinating case with exciting trial revelations and obvious injustice that is better than most fiction written in Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Powerful and thought provoking look at American justice and how we treat those who are outsiders or 'different'. When three very young boys are found brutally murdered and mutilated the town of West Memphis demands retribution and closure and so after some fruitless weeks of police work the suspects become three teenage boys who listened to heavy metal and the oldest of whom dressed somewhat Goth and was interested in Wicca. A strong indictment of how at least some of the time in our justice system 'guilty until proved innocent' is the rule. That said the film makes some serious misssteps by not being clearer about some of the evidence it brings up but never explores. For example we're told early on by the filmmakers that all 3 boys had alibis for the night of the killing yet we never hear about it again. Are their defense lawyers THAT bad or were the alibis not solid? Two said they were home with their families yet the families never mention being with them that night. Similarly we are never told why the police picked up the first of the boys a borderline mentally retarded kid who clearly didn't know what was going on for questioning. The implication was that the cops wanted an easy pliable target but the issue is never explored either by the defense or by the filmmakers. In a 150 minute movie there's no need for those kind of loose ends leaving us to question whether we've seen a fair reporting of what went on or if there really was more evidence against the kids than we're shown. Still a powerful and important examination of how we often rush to judgment socially and legally. Recent history has shown this is far from an isolated case  people are sent to prison even death row on flimsy or incomplete evidence and by playing on a juries fears far more often then we would all like to believe.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a kid I used to figure that everyone was probably pretty much like I was stumbling through life acting on hunches trying not to step on more toes than necessary. Somewhere along the way I went through an experience similar to that of the Buddha when he left the garden at sixteen and discovered evil. I've begun to believe that thought is an irritant for most humans. Everyone in this documentary seems to be consumed by hatred of someone else. Of course a triple homicide in a small town is a shattering event. That was the first inhuman event. What followed was hardly better. All the families seem to be broken into fragments but this doesn't impede their rage. I don't believe he did it says the father of one of the defendants I'll never believe it. I wouldn't send him a nickel in jail says the woman who is evidently his stepmother. This before any evidence has been presented in court. A stepfather of the victim raves how about the three defendants carried on homosexual orgies I'm told and vows to spit and pee on their graves after they're buried. This guy believes in demons who possess people. Other relatives of the victims take target practice saying that the defendants will be taken care of one way or another through the justice system or otherwise and they brag about how these particular weapons leave no ballistic signature. I'd be happy lining 'em up he says I wouldn't have no problem with it. Religion is of little help although religious beliefs are deeply felt. How can you believe in Satan without believing in God?And yet I believe it's a mistake to view these individuals  victims defendants participants in the justice system  as somehow wanting. It isn't them. It's the culture they grew up in. These people have like the rest of us little choice over their emotional and behavioral responses. You believe in free will? Try wearing a toga next time you go to work. When we're inside the box when we take for granted the values we grow up in we tend to operate under a set of demands we can't begin to analyze because we don't recognize them for what they are. He's my flesh and blood says the father of a defendant. Right. That tells us a good deal. An interviewer asks a victim's mother Do you believe they were Satanists? Sure she says just look at them. They look like  punks. These individuals are instruments of a culture and would have as difficult a time switching values as they would have if they suddenly decided to speak a language other than Engish. The least constructive set of values is those that emphasize not understanding and selfprotection and reasonable punishment but revenge. I want to emphasize understanding here because far too many spokesman for our particular sociopolitical system have been prepared to wage war on Iran andor Iraq without apparently knowing how to pronounced the name of the country. Can you imagine an American consul in Italy referring to Eyetalians? Hatred is piled upon hatred and generates little other than more hatred. Terrorists fly airplanes into buildings. Our response is to declare war on global terrorism leading us to overthrow governments whose dictators we disapprove of which we can be almost certain will lead to additional terrorist attacks which will generate ultimately some sort of Pax Americana that doesn't work. This film shows us the seedling from which such major social movements grow.Cultures are a bit like families in that they are collectivities made up of individuals who subscribe to a similar set of sentiments. It feels good to belong to a group. Not only that but it reduces the need for thought. If a close relative of mine dies how long do I have to mourn? Until the funeral. The whole ritual is laid out and I don't need to think much about it. We don't have to actually know much about the things we're judging either. Is Islam good? Mohammed was a terrorist says one of our leaders on the Christian right. Okay. Now I don't have to find out who Mohammed was let alone read the Kor'an in order to discover the motives of Al Qaeda. It will take us a long time to realize that some cultures like some families are in desperate need of revamping before they self destruct. And other cultures like other families are not worth saving as Nazi Germany was not worth saving.For what it's worth there is a lot of gobbledygook on Satanic rituals and all of that familiar stuff. I taught a course on Satanism once. It's all baloney of course. It was a selfsustaining economic enterprise among other things with selfproclaimed experts explaining on TV and in the courts what a Pentagram was. No physical evidence linked the defendants to the murders. Convictions were obtained on the basis of rambling and selfcontradictory confessions. I don't think the Satanic punks did it but I might be wrong.".

The conviction is based only on a dodgy confession from one of the boysof which he later says he was forced to do and not from any shred of evidance at all! The film crew interview the murdered boys parents and family and also the accused boys family. The overiding thought you get from the film is that the boys should never be in court in the first place they seem to be on the witness stand simply because they are a little different from most kids because they like heavy metal music and dress in black. The film is a little too graphic for my liking do we have to see photo's of the mutilated children? I dont think so but this is America and this film shows what diverse and perverse place it can be. 8 out of 10.".

In short three just out of high school kids tango with death so they can keep a car. Adam West is good for a laugh as some sort of pimpdaddy business man.

Then a lot of other plot points occur that have nothing to do with each other. The first half is OK but then quickly disintegrates into this tangled nonsensical mess.

The very hot Tanya is staying in the dumpy motel Maguire runs with his dad while her father pimps her out to blackmail men he brings back to the motel to have never consumated sex with her. So far so good. Then the lethal beautiful female assassin also staying at the dump makes a mistake leaving her latest victim in the trunk of her car. Maguire and his two friends boost it dump the body in the lake then kick the crap out of some crackers. From here on it's all downhill. Ms. Smith the assassin proves too emotionally attached to her car to just walk away and get out of town. She keeps ineffectually threatening the kids while Benicio barely bothers to even try to appear to care he's supposed to be playing a detective in this movie. None of this makes any sense. The ending is ludicrous as Maguire who's supposed to be flat broke has the car repainted and adds on new tires. All this in an attempt to cover up the fact that this isn't the same car used throughout the earlier parts of the movie. In a final non sequitor the assassin blows up the car she's hung around town to retrieve at risk of arrest for double murders.Wilson Cruz is good Maguire isn't terrible in an underwritten part Amy Hathaway brings her role off. Most of the other actors don't have much to work with even Adam West as the hotties pimp dad. Benicio has no excuses though.".

There were hardly any close ups used.  I would recommend this film only really for diehard Tobey Maguire fans as it is interesting to see him in a early role before he got to work with first class directors of the likes of Ang Lee Lasse Hallstrum and Woody Allen who he has obviously learned a llot fromsince his performance in this film is a million miles away from his work in SpiderMan or Pleasantville or any of the other excellent films he has done in recent years.".

I wonder if Tobey Maguire regrets that this film is in distribution having such later hits as SPIDER MAN  and CIDER HOUSE BLUES.  Too bad.  It's a wonder that he got cast in another film after this one but lucky for us he did.  He's a good young actor although directed in this movie to go around with his mouth open wondering what is going on around him.Meanwhile we have Amy Hathaway a terrible actress walking around beating up people namely men.  They seem to just stand around and let her do this. Are they paralyzed?  The scene with Adam West Batman just letting this bimbo push him around was a joke.  She certainly wasn't a looker and in this viewer's opinion not worth the price of admission.  The same thing goes with the other bimbo played by Christina Naify who streaks her face with mascara and lipstick looking like a clown from a freak circus and supposedly is attractive to the male community in the film.  Guys open your eyes these broads are not that enticing.So I give the film a 1 on the fact that someone had to pay to have it made. I feel sorry for that person.".

I've seen better films from student filmmakers.Look I know that every actor has to cut his acting chops on something but there are thousands of better ways to do it than this film which felt more like a cheap low budget porno with a sheassassin and a few cops thrown in on the side. Not one character in this convoluted mess reacts like anyone would in real life to the situations they find themselves in. For example I'd be pretty freaked out if I found a dead guy in the truck of a car Tobey and company look at him as though he's nothing more than a spare tire. Seriously not one yelp. The only actor who even attempts to do anything resembling acting is Del Toro as your stereotypical police detective and he's not in the film nearly enough I suppose that's good for his resume though considering. Avoid at all costs!!".

I hate it when films do this and I've seen bigger budget film completely screw up because there are too many hands in the story and no one can keep it straight. This is why I always give DirectorWriter films special attention simply because it gives them the power they need to see their vision through to the end.Thank you Ivo WattsRussell for the splendid OST literally already had almost every song that played. I imagined a movie that ended with a Dif Juz top 10 just didn't think it was out there but here it is. Well done. I always say that the music makes the movie.

I like to believe there's a measure of logic behind these things not in this case. Christina Zilber's acting came off the same way but with hints of I'm not really an actor which is understandable considering she isn't actually Joyride could be considered her only feature.

An example of this is in the mirror shattering scene where she hits the ceiling light instead of throwing something onto the mirror causing a dramatic shatter... only to moments later hit the same mirror with her hand causing several cracks but no shatter.

I think people are upset because of the trailer honestly that trailer does no justice to the movie at all. It panders to people looking for a certain flavor but doesn't deliver merely because it can't.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't going to comment on this movie but something has been bothering me about this since I watched it a few weeks ago. First off let me state that I rented this because I wanted to see Adam West who I always have liked and think should be in more big movies. The only people who were any good in this movie were West and Wilson Cruz and maybe James Karen but that short scene is hard to judge. Everyone else was just awful particularly Tobey Maguire and Benicio Del Toro. Maguire is always smug and annoying. He's certainly one of the stupidest protagonists I have ever seen. Del Toro is really lazy here mumbling his lines and giving nothing to his part. Hard to believe this is the same guy I saw in Traffic' last year. And Quinton Peeples doesn't help much when it comes to his writing. Some of his directing is nice but it can't cover up the weakness of his pen.All that said let me get to what is bothering me the opening scene. There is a short scene where we see Maguire and Amy Hathaway helping a dazed and confused Adam West to his feet. I assumed this was a foreshadowing of a final scene. Yet this is not exactly what happens in the film's real end. SPOILER ALERT. Instead West is arrested by Del Toro. This scene really seems tacked on because the man getting into the police car isn't really West but some stunt double and we hear West's voice muttering how he is innocent. Peeples must have rewritten something either by his own accord or by order of a producer or executive yet he left in the opening scene which does not fit in with the rewrite. END OF SPOILER ALERT Anyway that was really troubling me. If you watch it check out the opening scene and try to make sense out of it in conjunction with the rest of the film. I sure can't figure it out. Zantara's score 4 out of 10. Thanks Adam for trying and making this a little better than what it would have otherwise been.".

This movie was awful the acting oh my God like the detective with the sunglasses oh my God I have seen Ed Wood movies with better actors. He is always is monotone why I don't know. But Toby he was even worse he just always smiles and is a sex machine is bothered me this movie should not exist. The plot was about these 3 kids who steal a car which is owned by an assassin and they find a body in the trunk and now the assassin is going to kill them if they don't give her the car back that's about it.

	schema:headline " French satire";
	schema:reviewBody "A classic of French preWar cinema Carnival in Flanders by the great Jacques Feyder is the most devious and cruel satire you might ever come across. Set in early 17thcentury Flanders which had previously been under Spanish rule the story opens with shots of a busy village preparing for the yearly carnival when the news break that the Spanish Duke Olivares and his troops plan to stay in town. At the prospect of looting and raping militia men the flabby mayor of the welltodo provincial nest called Boom volunteers as he puts it to sacrifice himself his plan to pretend he has just passed away thus hoping to convince Olivares to bypass the mourning town is eagerly adopted by his timorous menfolk. But while the males go about staging the mock funeral the women led by the mayor's energetic wife take over the action and in turn decide to sacrifice themselves to the soldiers. What follows is a grand tale of sexual libertinage and deception with a happy end of sorts where virtually noone is redeemed. The original title La Kermesse hroque literally The Heroic Fte operates in much the same way as Milos Forman's early satirical masterpiece The Fireman's Ball 1967 and the parallels are numerous no doubt Forman had taken a second look at Feyder's Kermesse during his studies. What immediately strikes one today is Feyder's directness in exposing his characters' human flaws which is hardly subdued by the general satirical tone. The way adultery homosexuality and eroticism but also greed cowardice and deceit are depicted leaves one speechless at times and certainly wondering how political correctness and all sorts of profit policies and conservatisms have infested modernday cinema to a point it would no longer dare think to produce anything like this. Not to speak of the 1930s Hollywood counterparts for which Feyder would have been light years off the mark proving the point that there was and still is such a thing as the French cultural exception. Apart from the latent debauchery creeping out into the open from the cozy interiors of a model town the film also has multiple strings of side puns that keep its pace up at all times  from spoton character studies the mayor the artist the butcher... to hysterical history sidekicks using a fork for the first time Spaniards wondering what beer is impious remarks on Dutch painting.... Most strikingly it is a hallucinatory mockery of the Dutch and their supposed idiosyncrasies avarice Protestant pragmatism selfrighteous middleclass rule bogus worldliness you name it. This goes to such an extent that it has been repeatedly claimed that Feyder had intended an allegory of the Dutch's collaboration with the German occupier in WWI  and from today's perspective one is tempted to grant it visionary power as well since substantial parts of the Flamishspeaking population of Belgium were eager supporters of Nazi rule. This assumption makes sense once you've witnessed the coldblooded irreverence and unmasked sarcasm Feyder uses to unmask his species which is surpassed only in literature by the untouchable Molire. Clearly all formal issues had to serve this main objective  the Vaudeville acting the picturesque film set the matteroffact filming and not least the purposebuilt dialogues. So although you should not expect a formidably audacious experiment in filmmaking you will be treated a deliciously immoral chamber piece on sexual banter and other not so politically correct behaviour. Released in 1935 it is also a cruel reminder of how conservative the world  and its cultural output  has become as of late.".

It is set in a fictional town in Flandersand apparently some thinskinned Belgians during the 1930s wanted to ban the picture because they thought it made them look bad. That's sillyit's just a cute little comedy! The film begins with some minor intrigues in townincluding a painter wishing to marry the daughter of the Burgomeister that's a mayor for us Yanks. However suddenly this is unimportantwhat IS important is that the Spanish army will be passing through and the town council KNOW this means they'll sack the town. So they come up with a crazy planto pretend that the Burgomeister is dead. This really won't help anyonejust the Burgomeister! So it's up to the man's wife and the women of the town to deal with these invaders. However they are shocked to see that the Spanish are incredibly politeand kind of cute!! What's next? See the film.I found myself laughing several times during this moviea very good sign for a comedy. I particularly liked the needlepoint scene! All in all very entertaining funny and exceptionally well madethey got the look of 16th century Flanders down pat. A wonderful little comedy that deserves to be seen.".

There are some lovely scenes of boats on the canal in the moonlight.The costumes are extravagant. The wealthy men and women wear black clothes with large white ruffs around the neck. The peasant women wear native folk dress with caps.The film has a cast of hundreds. In one scene the women of Boom graciously welcome the Spanish army who arrive on horseback in a long procession.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Maurice Pialat's film is more an exercise in star power than any presentation of narrative with Isabelle Huppert leaving her husband Guy Marchand for the leatherclad excon ruffian Loulou played by Depardieu. Even though the tone takes its cue from the character of Loulou as a womanising drifter the low key seemingly improvised rambling scenes are preferable to the gabfests of Eric Rohmer who is responsible for the negative connotations associated with French films by Americans. This film is actually mistitled since although it is Depardieu that is the catalyst for Huppert to change her life the story is more hers than his. Or perhaps it is that the representation of her crumbling marriage that is more dramatically interesting than Depardieu's loafing. If Loulou's character is sketched thinly that may to keep him as an enigma the mysterious badboy that women always seem to prefer. At one point Huppert says of Depardieu I prefer a loafer who fks to a rich guy who bugs me. And although we can see how limiting Depardieu's world is to Huppert we also understand her attraction to him highlighted by a silent image of the couple stumbling down a street in a drunken embrace. Pialat's best moments involve scenes of violence interrupting  a family get together soured by jealousy the loud music of a disco drowning out shouting and a brawl between Depardieu and Marchand in a courtyard with a following drink together as evidence of the French form of civilised behaviour. Huppert also has an early scene with Marchand where the camera follows his pursuit and humiliation of her and here Huppert's anger invalidates the myth of her as a passive performer. The film also shows us footage of her laughing which is unusual since her situations are usually so glum and she is funny when she yells in shocked reaction to being hit in the famous love scene where the bed collapses and when she falls in the street by accident. Pialat also gives Marchand a laugh by having him resort to playing the saxophone in depression.".

The storyline doesn't deviate much from this premise outside of a few interesting anecdotes here and there and the rest of the film is spent on depicting the interactions between the characters.So why does this simple film deserve eight stars? In my opinion it's because Pialat has focused his attention on a single element that dominates all aspects of its development realism. Characters depicted are paradoxical and confused just as many people are when it comes to love and relationships. There is no soundtrack to distract the viewer. Perhaps most interesting of all is the way the film is written and acted every line seems spontaneous not scripted and polished. Because of this the film really succeeds in the impression that you really are looking through a window into people's lives. It's all great cinema the techniques used in this film really should be used more frequently.Make no mistake though this is an actor's film. All three of the leads are equally brilliant. We can feel the raw emotion when one of them make a sudden outburst though we may not always understand their motivations. This movie certainly would not have been the same without them.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys arthouse cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite a dull movie. Wellshot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and arthouse connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu  I believe they made 7 together  Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and goodhearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like I don't know I like his arms I like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because... I assume he loves her. So he accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending docudrama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. Jules et Jim this is not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.".

Watching this film you get the impression that Pialet has seen Tennesee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire and focused on Stanley Kowalski and Stella DuBois at the expense of Blanche and decided to speculate on how Stella a genteel daughter of a plantation owner hooked up with Stanley a Polish lorry driver who has been walking erect only since Tuesday. So presumably using this speculation as a starting point Pialet takes up his scissors and a piece of thin cardboard and fashions Nelly Huppert an educated middle class bored woman and allows her path to cross that of LouLou Gerard Depardieu a guy about one and a half steps up from an ape lately out of the slammer whose only interests in life are sex and violence. The result is predictable the moth is attracted to the flame. And that's it. No fresh insights into the Human Condition no polemics no point of view just a trawl through a garbage can for its own sake. As ever Huppert and Depardieu are excellent as is Guy Marchand whom Huppert leaves for Depardieu but sometimes excellence is not enough.".

Basically middleclass Parisian housewife Nelly Isabelle Huppert is married to possessive husband Andr Guy Marchand but she is bored of her lifestyle and longs for something else. Then she meets charming street thug Loulou Grard Depardieu he has no job and resorts to robbery to survive but he provides Nelly some excitement and she leaves her husband to have a passionate affair with him. For a while it just seems like a casual fling Nelly is fulfilling lust and Loulou is getting sex and living off her money but in the mindset of a middleclass bourgeois Andr is doing whatever he can to win back and convince her to return. But then things get complicated when Nelly finds out that she is pregnant with Loulou's child but he says he will support her whether he can change his ways and provide for her is a big question. Also starring Humbert Balsan as Michel Bernard Tronczyk as Rmy Christian Boucher as Pierrot Frdrique Cerbonnet as Dominique Jacqueline Dufranne as Mmre Willy Safar as JeanLouis and Agns Rosier as Cathy. Huppert gives a good performance as the bored housewife who leaves her husband out of boredom and gives in to unadulterated lust Depardieu is interesting as the unemployed layabout who is charming and likable together they are an odd couple but great to watch there isn't much of story to talk about it is more a look at social and sexual interaction in contemporary France with some good backdrops it is a watchable drama. Gerard Depardieu was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!".

	schema:headline " A reporter becomes fixated with a group of teens that were students of his old college mate.";
	schema:reviewBody "Premiered at the Buffalo Niagara Film Festival in May 2009 and i must say what a pleasant surprise this movie is. Although set around the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy this flick does not use that in anyway that would diminish that horrific event. The ending could have gone that way but thankfully doesn't and it makes you leave the theater very pleased that it didn't.... as lesser film makers might have exploited it. You are left wondering just who the student was that caused teacher Sam Calallucci to throw himself off the roof of his apartment. His death coincides with the visit of Campbell Bobbitt played coolly by Steve Coogan an old college buddy who just can't get past a story he has written about a local hero who he has a relationship with. Bobbitt arrives in the New Hampshire hometown of doomed school teacher Christa McAuliffe. The town is putting on all sorts of events including a special play at the school. Bobbitt though gets caught up with a group of teenage students that had a special bond with Calallucci and in a way takes the place of his old chum even wearing his jacket. Bobbitt finds a hidden note about his friend being suspended for inappropriate behavior with one of his students. All eyes point to Lucy brilliantly played by Hilary Duff but it isn't so. In fact we never find out for sure as my buddy and I discussed after the movie as we both had varied ideas. A sub plot involving a teen romance with a girl paralyzed from the waste down never gets it's due and in fact is played for laughs which is the one major downpoint of this flick. Anyway you are in for a pleasant surprise if you come across this movie.".

Intriguing performances and slightly surreal situations make the film well worth the watch. Coogan is delightfully flawed and the surrounding cast truly resonates. Although I was prepared to be distracted by Hilary Duff I thought she shined brightly and held her own quite well. The truth is that most filmmakers when tackling tougher issues as ones presented in What Goes Up tend to talk down and diminish their audience while the makers of this film seem undaunted by the regular Hollywood mission of going for cheap humor and glamorized sexuality. There is a gravity here that hangs like a thick cloud over this cast and I suspect this movie will be looked upon later as having more layers than it would initially seem.".

	schema:reviewBody "'What Goes Up' written and directed by first timers Jonathan Glatzer and Robert Lawson is not a perfect film but it is by no means a terrible film either. At current the film has received 145 votes and has a score of 4.8 well that's just ridiculous and in the review below I hope to explain why.The Film starts off with much promise Steve Coogan's acting is superb and the rest of the cast do a very good job too. For the first hour this is a very good film it's deep engrossing and imaginative as it sets up for what seems to be a powerful and emotive story with an interesting array if characters and some brilliant cinematography. I found myself truly captivated the integration of the Challenger disaster was done very tactfully and we frequently get some wonderful shots from Space that I really liked. However about an hour in it starts to lose pace followed by a slight loss of direction as the main character Campbell Babbitt undergoes a sudden change that really doesn't suit and is poorly developed. The film then goes the same way as Campbell becoming a bit annoying and awkward at times. By the end I found myself feeling a little disappointed as it had thrown almost all the potential it had shown early on settling of a generic and uninspired end.All in all 'What Goes Up' is OK great in parts whilst boring and unoriginal in others yet for all its faults I liked it. It may not be perfect but come on people even 'Little Nicky' has a 510 and trust me this is much much better than 'Little Nicky'. The first hour and brilliant cinematography ensure that 'What Goes Up' is not a 4.8 it's a film defiantly worth watching and one I would happily recommend.610".

	schema:headline " What Goes Up??? Well I Sure Hope the Ratings Do!";
	schema:reviewBody "'What Goes Up' is set around the Challenger Space Shuttle Tragedy time frame in 1986 with the shuttle mishap as a backdrop. What the film actually revolves around is a group of teenage rejects or in the words of the writer  'The Unteachables' and Campbell Babbit played by British comic Steve Coogan a journalist leaving behind his misfortunes in New York to arrive at the town of New Hampshire where so much seems to be going on...For at the same time Babbit's old college mate  Sam Calallucci has 'died under unfortunate circumstances' leaving behind a disoriented group of teenage students from a classroom called 'The Shed'. What Goes Up guides us along the journey of these misfits who are falling apart following the death of their Idol and somehow look up to Calalluci's supposed 'best friend' Babbit for support. Babbit meanwhile is looking for redemption from certain false journalistic endeavors and a love affair gone awry and tries to find it as he gets involved in the affairs of the shed.Okay so may be this isn't the kind of movie that will have you at the edge of your seats gripping you throughout its entire run. But what makes the movie special are the beautiful moments that are scattered about the storyline and you can't help but be touched by them and feel for the characters involved! These moments come in bursts and they are funny and sad and plainly disturbing at times but mostly  altogether Ironic... Irony! Now that's something portrayed amazingly in the movie!!! There are some pretty powerful performances delivered by the actors and some of them have done more than the justice to the beautiful characters built up by Jonathan Glatzer. Steeve Coogan playing the cynical emotionally disturbed reporter shines throughout the movie. Hilary Duff as Lucy the confused perturbed wannabe temptress is in one word  AMAZING!!! Not only does she look stunningly beautiful in the movie but she has clearly proved that she has talent and I keep wondering why the critics keep denying that. She is still very young and I believe and hope that she has an awesome journey ahead of her in the film industry. Other performances worth mentioning among others are Olivia Thirlby as Tess and Josh Peck as Jim and these two captivate the viewers in each of their scenes. The episodes relating to Peggy the wheelchair ridden girl touch the heart. However Molly Shannon as Ms. Little goes overboard and I felt is clearly the least best part of the movie. The other characters from the shed are a bit lackluster and uninteresting too.Other factors that are impressing are the neat cinematography the nice integration with the space shuttle tragedy and specially worth a mention is the background score which seems catchy and likable.Personally I feel that What Goes Up in its run time somehow finds a way into your heart its characters striking a chord somewhere to get you thinking! I would highly recommend this movie not withstanding the ratings given above which I'm sincerely appalled by!!!. Definitely worth a watch!".

She is making the right steps into a direction out of Disney and I feel this will be an experience that will help her develop her acting talents for future roles.The premise of this movie is very interesting it revolves around the death of Sam Calallucci a teacher of misfit students who all felt very in love with him because he allowed them to be themselves. This makes me wonder why they decided to change the title of the movie from Safety Glass to What Goes Up I think the latter had more commercial appeal but the first title seemed to bring out more emotion. This was a very character driven movie however some should have been touched upon a bit more such as Josh's character but a movie can only be so long before boring its audience.All in all I enjoyed this movie it did have some weak links in acting and minor problems in its story which could have been written tighter if that wasn't what was the aim then some things should be left for interpretation in a more fashionable way.810XTC".

	schema:headline " Stunningly Original  Brilliant Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is hard to describe without possibly wrecking the viewing experience but as this is not for everyone I will try to talk around it without giving away too much. At its core it is a strikingly realistic mystery involving the death of a special education teacher. The people in this story are misfits realistically portrayed but very unusual people. Taken in total their strangeness makes the entire situation feel unreal as real things often feel when you know enough of the truth about them.Do not expect the people and events in this story to make some statement about people or events in general. This is about specific people and specific events. Do not look for comedy or jokes here. Do not expect a great deal of violence or a high body count. Though the sexual activity of some of these people may be disturbing to some viewers do not come looking to see a lot of naked bodies this is not a skin flick. In short this is not designed to appeal to any mass audience leave your expectations at the door  whatever they are  they are very likely to be disappointed.The excellent script by Jonathan Glatzer and Robert Lawson leads us through the discovery that a mystery exists why we should care about finding out the truth who are the people involved and what is the truth about them and their role in what happened. Marvelous direction by Jonathan Glatzer and an extraordinary cast including Steve Coogan Hilary Duff Josh Peck Olivia Thirlby and others produce an almost flawless film. Makes me really wonder why 9 out of 10 critics gave this film negative reviews. I think that says something about why so many terrible movies keep being made.If you are wondering why anyone should bother with this movie when it only concerns what happens to a bunch of misfits that you might not relate to  the answer is that this movie is about the nature of truth. How illusory how dangerous and how hard to deal with truth can be. It is about how difficult finding out the truth can be and how careful one must be with what one finds out. Actions have consequences and real truth is seldom purely good or satisfactory or pleasing and one must always filter what they reveal to others lest they do more harm than good.Perhaps that is why so many do not care for this film  it is not going to leave you satisfied or pleased do not expect to feel like cheering afterwards but if you want to see something that may give you something to think about this film is well worth your time.".

Given Steve Coogan's comedic talents it is able to rise above an implausible script and come close to be entertaining. The time frame is January 1986 and Campbell Babbitt the last name is well chosen as a reference to Sinclair Lewis' novel 'Babbitt'  a satire of American culture society and behavior it critiques the vacuity of middleclass American life and its pressure on individuals toward conformity played by Steve Coogan is a reporter for New York World writing a series about a woman who became a 'hero' by turning the anguish of seeing her son murdered in to acts of civil service the woman whom Babbitt has grown to love commits suicide and out of cherishing her memory he continues to write stories as though she were still alive  an act that Babbitt's editor Donna Molly Price finds ridiculous and sends Babbitt of to New Hampshire to cool off and to over the upcoming Space Shuttle Challenger. Babbitt arrives in a little town in new Hampshire the town is preparing to celebrate the Shutttle launch as Christa McAuliffe was raised there to discover that his old friend Sam who was planning to become a priest but opted for teaching had a class of 'problem kids' who adored him. Babbitt discovers Sam's body in the street. The class of odd kids mourn Sam's passing he was their hero.

In the midst of this strange crew and situation Babbitt as a reporter tries to sort every thing out falls for Lucy and is awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his woe begotten story in New York. His influence helps the kids sort out their priorities and leads Babbitt to find a way out of his own unwanted heroism. The story ends before we know the result of the Challenger explosion  and the creation of a real hero in Christa McAuliffe. But there really isn't a beginning or an end to a story in the ordinary sense of a film. WHAT GOES UP merely puts before the viewer the lives of some odd people and lets us watch how they cope. It has a bit of comedy though dark and a lot of tender moments that don't come into focus until movies end. For many this film will perplex for others it will satisfy. It is an offbeat tale with a lot of innuendoes. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "The new indie comedy What Goes up is somewhat amusing in its storytelling but is also too confusing for its own good. While it's all one story it packs too much into its story. The story follows reporter Campbell Babbitt Steve Coogan who writes a story about a woman who lost her son to civil acts. But then she commits suicide. He then is sent to report about the Challenger Space Flight launch. There he meets a group of misfit students. He gets a lot of his information from student Tess Olivia Thirbly. Later when reporting the story he falls for a student named Lucy Hilary Duff. The Movie shows him getting to know these students. The fact that it goes between Campbell's visit to the town and the days adding up to the Challenger Space Flight launch but making it all one story makes the movie feel forced and confused. As I was watching this I felt somewhat entertained but I also cringed in all the brain power it took to figure out just what was going on. Overall you can skip this one because even if you are entertained by it it won't be worth it for the simple fact that it's so damn confusing.".

	schema:headline " He was choking on Mars  What Goes Up";
	schema:reviewBody "Writers Robert Lawson and Jonathan Glatzer who also directed were in attendance to introduce their work and explain their hope to get audiences thinking about what it means to be a hero. Describing it as an example of tumultuousness and devastation breeding comedy it is interesting to learn that we never see the space shuttle explode. The tragedy at hand is instead the suicide of a beloved teacher one who may or may not have been having too close of a relationship with his students and how the group of misfits he brought together and gave hope to for the future deal with it. Throw in Steve Coogan's journalist in town to report a space related puff piece who had also been a college friend to the deceased and you get a story that delves into some dark places brings some genuine laughs mixed in with plenty of awkward ones and asks some good questions. The whole definitely doesn't add up to a success but some of the parts do resonate.In the film both of Steve Coogan and Hilary Duff are playing somewhat against the norm and not necessarily to good effect. Duff is not a great actress to begin with and here she is asked to handle some very hard subject matter as a girl who was in love with her teacher that just killed himself. She sees Coogan's arrival as a way to fill the void seducing him with her juvenile wiles while playing a troubled young girl but trying too hard at times. As for Coogan I'm not sure if he is cut out for serious fare. He is dealing with his own tragedy and professional lie a falsified series of articles that could ruin his career if discovered during their Pulitzer Prize nomination. When he is utilizing sarcasm and his inherent goofiness you do believe in his character however the filmmakers ask him to be completely serious at times in close up no less and unfortunately he doesn't look pull it off.In true indie film fashion What Goes Up contains a bit more quirkiness than needed. I enjoyed the creepy girls the first couple times on screen before they just got  creepy Molly Shannon's odd teacher composer of Blast Off the musical wow is the song from this performance so intentionally headshaking bad that you have to laugh is very weird and supposedly girlfriend to the dead teachera fact glossed over after a very brief mention the theft by the children of their teacher's body and coffin is unbelievable and what's with Coogan setting up toy figures to mimic the people he has met during his visit? A couple aspects to the script really do work though but you may miss them due to all the filler thrown your way. Just pay attention to the scenes pertaining to Josh Peck and Olivia Thirlby as they shine throughout and make me want to watch them in The Wackness even more now.Peck plays Jim one of the students affected by the death one who had been given direction by his almostpriest teacher. He looked up to and listened to the man only to find that he killed himself. When something like that occurs you can't help but question the validity of what you had been told. Peck becomes jealous and angry towards Coogan for coming into town and basically moving into his idol's shoes as he is viewed as a replacement even becoming the object of affection from Duff's Lucy the girl who loved him. Peck's hero is proved to be fallible and only when he himself prevails in a situation that could have resulted in the death of a baby is he able to let go of the memory. As for Thirlby she is absolutely fantastic. An abused child assumed to be carrying her uncle's offspring in her stomach Thirlby's Tess has experienced pain firsthand and sees Coogan as someone just looking to prey on her friends' emotions. Her life has built paranoia and a need to be the hero in her mind going so far as to lie about something that she knows isn't true but possibly could eventually become so like the relationship between a teacher and student. Her monologue at the end explaining her motivations throughout the film to Coogan is a powerhouse moment made all the more impressive by seeing Coogan's odd expressions in reaction shots. Thirlby acts him under the table.But Coogan's Campbell Babbitt has his own moments as well a hero in his own rite after writing inspirational articles in the paper about his subject and eventual love Angela and her selfless work done to honor her slain son. To add one more instance of moral ambiguity to a film ripe with pedophilia teen sexincluding that with a paraplegic girl shoplifting and misguided anger on behalf of many Coogan finds himself caught in a scandal still hidden as Angela killed herself after the first story he wrote. His love for her too much he continued her story with lies lies that helped people and brought happiness to many. So as a school teacher is about to go into space as a hero eventually to keep that title once her shuttle disaster never allows her to get there in the backdrop we see adults and children experiencing the many different definitions of that termhero. Sometimes that label means making a hard choice lying and deceiving for the greater good. If What Goes Up gets anything right it is this fact that heroes are who we make them subjective and often privy to debate. If the film focused more on this theme leaving much of the precious quirk so abundantly prevalent on the cutting room floor it might have been something I could have recommended more. Maybe the play on which it is based gets it done more successfully as a film though it's more uncomfortable than thought provoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was privileged enough to see this film with one of the producers tonight in Las Vegas. I went with some trepidation as I had heard from my DIL who's the producer's niece that while she thought the first cut was good it had some issues. And unfortunately I am very critical when it comes to movies due to my writing background.I have to say I was truly amazed at the quirkiness and depth of this story. Yes it did have some issues. There were places where I would have liked to have more indepth characterization there were places I thought the pacing was slow. The acting was good and dead on with what characters had on their plates. And in all honesty this is the type of movie that comes out of the blue and ends up a cult favorite. It is that good in some strange way. Maybe part of this is because I can remember this week so well myself. I was just out of college and worked for Lockheed. We were on top of the world and it just came crashing down on us all that Thursday morning. I can't imagine having the whole week being that bad. LOL!Then again maybe it's the part about being adult enough to understand when you've done something wrong yet there is no way to ever take it back. I remember this lesson well.Or maybe it's just that the misfits are so true to life that I can empathize with what is going on in their lives. I know that I would have been devastated if my favorite teacher had died during my high school years no matter what the cause.Still it would have been worse if said teacher had committed suicide. I was angsty enough then to have wondered if it were my fault in any way at all.Adding all these elements up you have one heck of a story that can appeal to the masses. I have to say I liked it.".

We were on top of the world and it just came crashing down on us all that Thursday morning. I can't imagine having the whole week being that bad. LOL!Then again maybe it's the part about being adult enough to understand when you've done something wrong yet there is no way to ever take it back. I remember this lesson well.Or maybe it's just that the misfits are so true to life that I can empathize with what is going on in their lives. I know that I would have been devastated if my favorite teacher had died during my high school years no matter what the cause.Still it would have been worse if said teacher had committed suicide. I was angsty enough then to have wondered if it were my fault in any way at all.Adding all these elements up you have one heck of a story that can appeal to the masses. I have to say I liked it.";

Steve Coogan plays a reporter goes to New Hampshire round about the time of the Challenger disaster and hooks up with the misfit students of a college friend who recently died. Quirky comedy drama is a film that has moments but it never clicked with me. To me it was trying too hard not to be the the typical American made film. It didn't help that I never warmed to Coogan who is an actor I either lover or hate. He is a funny man but at the same time his performances always strike me as much too mannered and structured. He never seems real. On the other end of the spectrum is Hillary Duff who is rapidly becoming one of the best actresses in film. Say what you will the girl has range and ability as this film and other films like War Inc have proved. It didn't work for me it might for you there is a great deal of passion at IMDb from people who feel its rated way too low. try it if the mood hits you.".

I'm not exactly sure why I liked it so much it definitely had a true to life feeling yet had a few surreal situations. I also felt I could understand all the characters even those whose parts were in honesty just a time filler. They gave it a bit of fun Peggy and Fenster but also added a sense of mystery Jim.

I'd hate for people who might completely groove with the film's strange rhythms to be dissuaded. Thanks to the guy who put up all those great quotes from the few critics who dug the movie. It's simply a movie that not everyone's going to love  but some definitely will. Some say this film tried too hard. I really disagree. It concentrates on the human emotions between the characters and it does this very well with humor and without straying into melodrama. Does it crowd in a whole bunch of other details like teen pregnancy and the Challenger shuttle and even shoplifting? You bet. But it deliberately lets those topics exist on their own. They are well trodden topics which we've all seen before and the movie lets them resonate without a whole lot of effort  so it is kind of the opposite of trying too hard. The film sets a mood it doesn't tell a sweeping story. It fools you into thinking it's ripping off Juno  but it's so different and far better.

	schema:headline " A disturbing title for a disturbing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first learned about this on the IMDb when the trailer was posted on this site. One of the IMDb's greatest strengths as it pertains to their trailer postings is that when you hover over the image a text popup appears with a short synopsis of what the film is about.The title of this indiesounding piece kindasorta intrigued me and seeing as it is very easy to obtain plot distillations via these popups I hovered.What I read was well pretty damn unnerving. I'm VERY surprised this hasn't been broached yet even in the forums.The second half of the saying what goes up is of course must come down. Keep this in mind as the chronological setting for this film is days before the Challenger disaster on January 28 1986 and the where is the late Christa McAuliffe's teaching hometown.Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive but given the film's date and place the title seems rather blasphemous. Can you imagine the awful stares one would've received if nonchalantly murmuring this whimsical phrase right after the explosion? Or how about when the Hindenburg burst into flames or when the WTC towers collapsed? This is a saying reserved for helium balloons and radio controlled airplanes not when hapless people and iconic objects are obliterated.Apparently this was originally entitled Safety Glass but was changed to What Goes Up shortly before its release. Why? I have no idea other than maybe shock value.What's even more perplexing is that the setting could've been practically any small town at any particular time. The Challenger disaster isn't even the focal point. It's just used as IMO a cheap gimmick and VERY uncomfortable reminder of when this film is suppose to occur.I dunno. Perhaps living only fifty miles from Cape Canaveral and LC 39B greatly colors my opinion. I also remember exactly where I was when the news was announced similar to those who precisely recall where they were when Kennedy was shot.Which is a shame because the cast does an otherwise fine job particularly the kids playing the shed misfits. I'm not entirely certain I subscribe to the film's dubious message  that facts shouldn't get in the way of perception  but many of the scenes were very endearing and even a little intense.Still I just cannot overcome the horrible title.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first learned about this on the IMDb when the trailer was posted on this site. One of the IMDb's greatest strengths as it pertains to their trailer postings is that when you hover over the image a text popup appears with a short synopsis of what the film is about.The title of this indiesounding piece kindasorta intrigued me and seeing as it is very easy to obtain plot distillations via these popups I hovered.What I read was well pretty damn unnerving. I'm VERY surprised this hasn't been broached yet even in the forums.The second half of the saying what goes up is of course must come down. Keep this in mind as the chronological setting for this film is days before the Challenger disaster on January 28 1986 and the where is the late Christa McAuliffe's teaching hometown.Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive but given the film's date and place the title seems rather blasphemous. Can you imagine the awful stares one would've received if nonchalantly murmuring this whimsical phrase right after the explosion? Or how about when the Hindenburg burst into flames or when the WTC towers collapsed? This is a saying reserved for helium balloons and radio controlled airplanes not when hapless people and iconic objects are obliterated.Apparently this was originally entitled Safety Glass but was changed to What Goes Up shortly before its release. Why? I have no idea other than maybe shock value.What's even more perplexing is that the setting could've been practically any small town at any particular time. The Challenger disaster isn't even the focal point. It's just used as IMO a cheap gimmick and VERY uncomfortable reminder of when this film is suppose to occur.I dunno.

Though he laughed at maybe 3 jokes this movie tried to force feed us I'd have to say we were more amused and embarrassed by this movie if we had to explain why others heard us laugh. The dialog was wretched. It was Buffylike speak and at the beginning it was way over done. I had to turn to my friend and ask him if we as gay men were expected to talk like this all the time. The acting was over the top by almost all the actors save for Caleb which was so understated that it made his passive character seem like a doormat. I think the only character that was remotely interesting was Tiffany the dildowielding gal since we could understand why she had to be over the top. There's nothing to expect from her as a character.The two lead guys are hot to watch but not much to write home about when it comes to their acting abilities. The blonde gal with the freaky hair at the end was excruciating. If I were her roommate I would have moved out a long time ago and changed Social Security numbers. The worst was that whole dinner scene with the parents. Talk about the need for acting classes and while we're at  directing classes or a whole new 4 year degree at another film school.As far as the nude scene by the two guys while it was gratuitous I say why the hell not? Women are subjected to this 50 times more than men are in mainstream movies. It's time the USA caught up with the rest of the world when it comes to the nude male form in film. I keep thinking Jack Valenti sitting in his personal screening room sweating bullets at the mere thought of a man's penis flashed in his face. It is what is and while it didn't add anything to this film or speak highly of the director's creative acumen it at least is a step in the right direction for the male form in cinema.".

It is what is and while it didn't add anything to this film or speak highly of the director's creative acumen it at least is a step in the right direction for the male form in cinema.";

The cast was brilliant carrying off incredibly witty and sharp dialog that snapped harder than Rupaul.

Nothing is as tasteless as a souffl that doesn't rise and this gay romcom has all the tasty buoyancy of a hockey puck. Forget the cheap sets poor cinematography and weak soundtrack a gay indie with a bunch of newcomers is entitled to take short cuts. But the script! So much lame drivel masquerading as dialogue with an occasional hip quip  about Meat Loaf or Anne Heche  that stands out like a sixth finger on a hand it's so clumsy.The actors no matter how cute are at sea with this poor a script. Scott Lunsford is a total cypher in the impossible role of a deeply passive straight guy who pretends to be gay so he can romance a screechy straight woman. She's Emily Hands and you haven't seen this raspy a performance since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls. Ryan Carnes is way cute as a gay stud but has little presence. He and Lunsford share the silliest most embarrassing nude scene in recent history. After some poorly shot and choreographed oral sex the director actually shoots them pulling up their pants so we can see their weenies! A new low of sorts. And yes that Jim guy from American Idol is the gay geek. His character is the closest to a real person but he's no actor.This is the worst gay comedy I've seen since All Over the Guy. If you flipped for the West Hollywood drivel run out and rent this. Otherwise stick with Trick or Passing Glances real movies about real gay people.I only go on so long because I am AMAZED at all the good reviews this film has received. Does the director have hundreds of dear friends or have gay people lost their common sense and good taste?".

The script and the dialogue suck but the actors are pretty good and they're able to make most of it palatable. Unfortunately the basic premise is just really uninspired. There is a phone sex scene which IS really well done though and it feels like the rest of the movie is just a sloppy construction designed to frame that scene. There's a really bad scene where four people play two pianos at a party  it just goes on and on forever in the most unrealistic way and then you realize that the whole interminable scene was constructed to set up a punch line that is only mildly amusing. The thing that keeps you interested in the movie is how cute the actors are... overall a forced boring movie where you get to see the exploitation of two cutegood actors' genitals for five seconds. 4 out of 10.".

It's like watching the rehearsal of a bad stage production designed to project to an audience that just happens to have been filmed.There is no chemistry between any of the characters.The male muscle Mary lead who admittedly has more charisma than most of the rest of the actors put together and is very easy on the eye should NEVER have been cast as a straight lead. One certainly doesn't believe for a fraction of a second he is in love with the fag hag who he is supposed to have fallen for. Cast him as someone in love with himself and you might have a movie that walks.And the script while containing some witty and daring yawn! bitchy one liners is insulting in its depiction of stereotypes. The plot strands are so ridiculous they become funnier than anything the comedy writer originally intended. The UK DVD has been deliberately gayed down in an attempt to shift copies with a cover claiming this is A modernday variant on a Shakesperean comedy. No  it's a diabolically bad amateur movie that will only be of interest to a gay crowd wanting to see some eye candy who would be better off spending their money on gay porn.

	schema:headline " Could have been so much better";
	schema:reviewBody "It could have been an interesting premise. But it was executed so horribly I was just in awe of what a mess this all turned into. For me the only reason to watch this film is to see Ryan Carnes for the bulk of 90 minutes. He is completely engaging and could probably have turned in a better performance had he been given a decent script and an experienced director. He is impossibly gorgeous and as a straight actor does a really good job of believably portraying a gay guy without resorting to overacting or being stereotypically gay.Jim Verraros in his role as Kyle is really pretty cute in his own right except he curls his lips and bobbles his head around in a sneering dismissive way almost whenever he talks and it's really unflattering and conveys completely the wrong message relative to what he's actually saying. In spite of being cute and all though the character of Kyle is utterly selfloathing and just a miserable bitchy queen. He was also campy to the point of distraction but again I blame that on the screenplay. Verraros is no amazing actor but I believe he could pull off an indie role reasonably well if given better tools.Apart from having a nice upper body I did not see the appeal of Caleb played by Scott Lunsford. He reminded me far too much of Ted from Queer As Folk.As for the rather abrupt ending I find it a bit of a stretch that the geeky selfhating boy would after one horrible dinner in which he basically pouted the whole time land the ferociously hot modelesquire party boy Marc who apparently instantly forgets all about his major crush on Caleb and acts as though he's been pining away for Kyle all this time. But it had to be a dream for Jim Verraros... an openly gay guy getting to totally make out with a gorgeous straight guy in a movie.The DVD itself was abysmal. There are only 4 chapter marks which is ridiculous for any movie the subtitles are utterly horrible they're wrong half the time omit words misspell words etc. and the commentary is among the worst I've ever been subjected to  I couldn't sit through more than about five cumulative minutes of it. I jumped around to see if it ever improved. Basically it was five people sitting in an echo chamber of a room with what was clearly one cheap microphone in the middle of the room all talking about whatever pops into their heads. Half the time it wasn't about the movie at all.The DVD I got from Netflix was obviously edited as there was no actual nudity in it whatsoever. So clearly there are at least two versions of this DVD out there which is really just pretty crappy.The cinematography is decent for the most part but another person on here said it looked like a lot of the scenes were filmed by a security camera and I agree. Wideangle lenses have their time and place but they're sorely misused and overused in this movie. It results in some very weird scenes that you feel like you're watching from afar... definitely doesn't help draw you into the movie and the inane dialogue certainly doesn't compel you to be drawn into the characters either.All in all it's not an absolutely horrible movie but it's sure not very good and I couldn't recommend it without some serious caveats. I'm not sure I understand the shirtless makeout scene between Kyle and Marc after the credits roll either. It just doesn't make any sense in the storyline and seems to have been added on for prurient reasons in which case it could have been much steamier. Moreover the picture just freezes at a random point while the counter keeps running then the disc ends cuts off rather a minute or so later. It's very amateurish and sadly fits in nicely with virtually every other technical aspect of the DVD.".

True it doesn't play to Wellman's strengths as a director as the awesome woefully underrated Safe in Hell had done a year earlier or to Irene Dunne's talents as a comedienne but her singing her own voice she was a fully trained operatic mezzosoprano and had auditioned for the Met before signing with RKO is gorgeous. Plotwise this seems like a beta version of a Jeanette MacDonaldNelson Eddy film  all it needed was a male star who could sing or a voice double for Richard Dix  and though the promise of the first reel that it was going to be Cimarron in Australia was not fulfilled it was still a lot of fun. Incidentally I wondered if any of it was inspired by the life of reallife diva Nellie Melba the first international opera star to come from Australia. There's been at least one other since Joan Sutherland.".

To start was an hour of cartoons the newsreel then two feature films and we could stay to see it all over again if we wanted to. Those were the days! It does seem that the subject of Nellie Melba could've had a strong influence on this story an unknown Australian singer who becomes famous worldwide. Irene Dunne is the servant girl Hilda who has dreams of a career and is given the chance to sing for the impresario Sir Julian. I had visions of Jeannette MacDonald in this role it's her style but Irene Dunne gives a more integrated performance and her singing is finer as it has somewhat more volume to project in my opinion.There ought to be a special medal created for Mary Boland she's quite something in all her films over the top hilarious showy a grand flurry of mannerisms delightful and absurd. She certainly adds wit to her films. Her amusing reference to protecting British womanhood's virginity brought back the quip Oh no my dear you mean chastity. Britain wouldn't have survived on women's virginity was quite a funny hint.Richard Dix has the role of Stingaree the thief who is being hunted but he does have a good heart and is determined to help Hilda get her chance to be heard by Sir Julian which succeeds and she's off to make her career although Stingaree unfortunately gets captured in the process and must put in his time in jail during her venture into the world.I'm always charmed by Una O'Connor who plays Annie the maid. She has such a distinctive presence in all her roles one can only wonder what it'd have been without her in so many great movies such as Robin Hood Errol Flynn and Witness For The Prosecution Ty Power.Henry Stephenson performs as the man of the house Mr Clarkson married to the Mrs. Mary Boland his is not a very large role but well done.Andy Devine is quite young in this film and he plays the 'sidekick' of Stingaree for their robbery excursions.One ought to be fair in judging the old movies after all the acting that was done in silent films is not what they did when talkies came along. So too we should consider the time period and settle into that when viewing the oldies. Each decade brought along its own styles and fashions and that needs to be taken into account when making a comment.All in all I enjoyed a first viewing of this adventure romance comedy film and I believe it's available to buy so that's good news too. Add it to your collection if you are a dedicated collector. Well worth it!".

	schema:reviewBody "TCM presented STINGAREE a film with Irene Dunne I had never seen 2 April 2008. The plot can be read elsewhere. I will discuss some of the music in the film and its relation to Irene Dunne.Although the famous Oscar winning composer Max Steiner is credited with the music for two of the songs in the film the nonSteiner song that is a vital part of the film is TONIGHT IS MINE words by Gus Kahn and music by Frank Harling. Recently I was given an original 1934 copy of the sheet music for this song. This lovely song first appears in the film as a 'music box' is opened by Stingaree about 11 minutes 53 seconds into the film.Irene first sings this song about 23 minutes 15 seconds into the film. The pitch is a minor third lower than the printed sheet music. The 'music box' is again opened at about 36 min. 46 sec. Irene again sings the song at about 44 min. 40 sec. this time a whole step higher than given in the printed sheet music. The 'music box' is again heard about 49 min. 50 sec.Irene sings THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER from the opera MARTHA at about 54 min. 10 sec. into the film. The 'music box' is heard for the last time about 59 min. 20. sec. into the film. But the consequence this time is that Irene's character decides NOT to marry Sir Julian Kent.The last operatic aria is the Jewel Song from FAUST by Charles Gounod. Irene transposes the aria down a half step from the original. Geraldine Farrar reportedly a major influence on Irene's life sings this aria a half step up from the original in my undated recording.TONIGHT IS MINE is sung by Irene for the last time about 108 min. 15 sec. into the film again a whole step up from the printed sheet music. Nowhere does Irene sing this lovely song at the pitch used in the sheet music although pictures of Irene and Richard Dix are on the cover and there is a statement that the music is as sung by Irene to Richard Dix! STINGAREE is a very touching movie in places and is so much more of a film than it would be because of this one song.".

On the other hand STINGAREE is not a formulaic musical so perhaps he knew what he was getting into.While Miss Dunne is one of my favorite actresses and I know she was chosen to play Magnolia in James Whale's SHOW BOAT she has never been one of my favorite sopranos and this film didn't change my mind at all. Indeed the film itself does nobody any great favor because the plodding script goes off in so many different directions you're never quite sure whether it's meant to be serious or comic. Only when ANDY DEVINE and MARY BOLAND give out with some nonsubtle comic relief in supporting roles can we be sure what the intentions are.Let's just say that not every film that turns up on TCM's lost and found package of RKO films deserves to be resurrectednor are they necessarily classics so to speak. STINGAREE is one of them best forgotten as an outmoded and lumbersome sort of film easily ignored unless you happen to be an ardent admirer of either Miss Dunne or Mr. Dix both of whom have done better work elsewhere.Dunne excelled in the '30s and '40s as a woman who was usually one step ahead of and smarter than the man a more feminine version of the characters Katharine Hepburn often played. As the ingenue of a mixed up western she's not exactly in her element and Richard Dix even with a mustache is just as hard to believe as a bandit as Nelson Eddy was in THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN WEST. At least he and Jeanette had some good songs to sing.For comic relief we have reliables like ANDY DEVINE MARY BOLAND a stridently overmannered performance HENRY STEPHENSON and UNA O'CONNOR on hand but nothing really helps.Summing up A curious misfire that must have had a target audience once upon a time in precode 1934 but that audience no longer exists outside a small clique who love anything made in the '30s whether good bad or indifferent as long as TCM presents it. The title song sounds suspiciously like a Rudolf Friml reject.Trivia note Dunne and Dix were both better received in CIMARRON made three years earlier and without music.".

Dunne has been taken in by the outrageously vain Mary Boland who keeps singing whether anybody wants to hear her or not presumably the latter. You soon realize that every time she starts chirping Yo Ho! Yo Ho! Yo Ho! she's really shouting out of frustration of her lack of discovery. Boland who played a nag better than anybody in the films of the 30's just ask Charlie Ruggles' characters who were paired with her in a dozen films emphasizes this female's phoniness her constant cheeriness as a total fraud. When Dunne finally has enough and starts imitating this fishwife you can see why producers started looking at her for screwball comedies rather than the soap opera she had been playing for several years.Dix as the titled character is a bit over the top his acting more out of a silent film with characteristics that most silent film stars still working in movies in 1934 had gotten rid of. He's also less romantic than the character should be. Andy Devine is always good for a laugh and there are some good moments for the British Henry Stephenson and Reginald Owen as well. As always Una O'Connor is a delightful screechy presence her Irish maid not afraid of putting the boorish Boland in her place.This isn't a film for purists but as entertainment it really shines brightly among a few newly discovered lost films that even diligent collectors had been searching for over decades.".

In addition the plot is pure 1930s corncompletely lacking in realism and full of silly clichs that make decent actors look really really bad.In addition to horrid operastyle singing the film was saddled with some weird miscasting. As for the Irene Dunne she was just fine. Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the timeafter all she could sing though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful my ears are still bleeding. But for the leading role Stingeree they poorly chose Richard Dix who was unable to effect any sort of an accent. It seemed very odd that although the film was set in Australia and he was supposed to be English he sounded exactly like an American! They should have instead given the part to cute old Snub Pollard an Australian who played a tiny bit part in the movie so you know he could effect a convincing accent of at least an Australian but who used to be an amazing comic with Keystone Studios.Now for the incredibly silly plot Irene wants to be a professional singer but the nasty old crow who took her in is jealous of Irene's talent so she is planning on keeping Ms. Dunne from meeting a famous English musician and producer. But quite by chance the famous bandit Stingeree hears Irene and does everything he can to make her dream come trueeven if it means him being caught. He is but she is discovered in the process. After traveling the world and gaining great fame Irene is determined to go back to Australia as she knows she loves him and must marry himeven though they barely know each other and he is currently on the run again. In the end just like in the campy MacDonaldEddy operettas they live happily ever after and the audience is thrilled that the singing is finally completed! They don't make movies like this any moreand for once I am quite happy about this! What a load of hooey!PSLate in the film Ms. Dunne is braiding her very long hair.

	schema:reviewBody "A film thought lost turned up a few months ago on TCM and I finally did get to see it. Stingaree is one curious and horribly miscast film which not even the presence of favorites of mine like Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland can save.Set in Australia in the 1870s specifically in Victoria we don't see as much as one kangaroo in Stingaree. The presence of a lot of sheep being herded is supposed to make us think we're in Australia. When I finally saw The Sundowners which was actually filmed in Australia I certainly saw the weakness of things like Stingaree made on the RKO back lot.But no Americans companies were location shooting that far in 1934 so I can be charitable there. But stolid Richard Dix is cast in a role that someone like Errol Flynn might have made believable. Or Douglas Fairbanks Jr. or Tyrone Power or Louis Hayward anyone with that swashbuckling lan. Dix just looks silly up there spouting those romantic nothings.Irene Dunne is the lonely ward of Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland who accompanies Boland because Boland fancies she can sing. And she's going to sing come hell or high water for visiting British composer Geoffrey Tearle. Dunne is told not to emote as much as low A from her range when Tearle's around. But when she mistakes the notorious bandit Stingaree for the composer they're taken with each other. He kidnaps Dunne and later forces a gunpoint addition for the real composer and it costs him his freedom. The rest of the film is too unbelievable to describe you have to see it to confirm but not to be entertained. Even Mary Boland who usually can save anything with her flighty portrayals doesn't go over well. It's not in her character to throw Dunne out of the house because she was upstaged. Boland is irresponsible and flighty but never a mean person on the screen.A lot of forgettable songs are included here and the whole film is best forgotten. Good thing none of the cast is still around to be embarrassed.".

	schema:reviewBody "LES GIRLS is the forgotten musical gem of the last great splurge of MGM musicals in the 1950s. It's reception judging from the other comments here is less than overly enthusiastic due to the script. LES GIRLS is possibly the most philosophical of the MGM musicals because it tackles an immortal issue of mankind What is truth?Gene Kelly had been leading a highly successful nightclub group around Europe for many years called LES GIRLS. But he has ceased doing so and disbanded the group. We learn that Kay Kendall has published her memoirs. She has married Leslie Phillips a wealthy British aristocrat. In her memoirs she describes what life on the road with the act was like and how she saved the life of fellow dancersinger Taina Eig when the latter tried to commit suicide with gas. Taina has married wealthy Frenchmen Jacques Bergerac and she is furious at this libel suggesting that she was mentally ill enough to try to kill herself. She brings an action in London against Kendall.This being a George Cukor film he will have many touches in it that are normal. One that I note is the justice in this trial is none other than the old Cukor favorite Henry Daniell. Daniell appeared in Cukor's films from CAMILLE as Baron De Warvell through THE PHILADELPHIA STORY as Sidney Kidd up to MY FAIR LADY as the Prince of Transylvania at the embassy ball  he only appears in one sequence as he died on the set. Here he is just determined to have an orderly libel trial in his court. In the end he is just as amazed and perplexed by what he hears as everyone else. Also to be noted is Patrick Macnee playing a titled barrister.The act being a song and dance one with Kelly leading the two ladies and Mitzi Gaynor the music is from none other than Cole Porter. It was the last complete music score that Porter made for a film. It is not a bad score but not up to the par of say SILK STOCKINGS or CANCAN both composed in the early to mid1950s. My favorite song is We're Ladies in Waiting sung by the three ladies in 18th Century costumes. The lyrics suggest King Louis has plans for them outside their normal duties.As the film continues Eig produces as her defense that she was not the woman who tried to kill herself. It was Kendall and she Eig rescued her. So now the court and the public have two versions of the story of the suicide attempt. The final witness is Kelly who gives his account of what really happened. I won't explain it see the film but in revealing what he claims happened he also reveals something of the lies told by him to the two woman and Mitzi Gaynor as well as some subterfuges he is working out with both Bergerac and Phillips regarding their personal interests in the matter. The results of his testimony settle the trial and all parties return to their lives. We even see Kelly going home with his wife Gaynor who was in the court but never questioned. But now she has questions about the validity of Kelly's testimony! As they yell at each other in the back of their car we see a man wearing a sandwich board with the eternal question What is truth? on it. And the film ends.It was only a handful of years before that Akiro Kurasowa's brilliant RASHOMON tackled the same problem again in relating a legal issue who was responsible for the death of an nobleman and how did the nobleman die. The screenwriters certainly picked up on this perennial problem of truth and it's limits and a courtroom happens to be the best place to show it. Who can tell if somebody has told the truth completely or partially and if partially why partially? In looking over the issue of telling the truth note that besides Kendall Eig and Kelly the behavior of Phillips and Bergerac get scrutinized. Gaynor is also pulled in we have Kelly's version of how and why she behaved  but we never even hear her explanations. The tactics of Macnee and his opposing counsel and all lawyers including his Lordship Daniell are based on playing out certain telltale facts that may hide other telltale facts. Who in the end can judge the truth?It is one of Kay Kendall's best performances with GENEVIEVE and THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE. She was aware in 1957 of physical problems that she revealed to her husband Rex Harrison. Before the end of the year he knew it was leukemia and that she was doomed. In his autobiography REX he tells how he made her last two years the happiest in her life. One would never think of the sudden end of such a funny vibrant actress being so close seeing her with Kelly doing a song and dance duet and a saucy one at that. For that alone I would recommend seeing the film to think of such a promising talent that was cut so tragically short.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a unique kind of elegance in Cukor's way to see the world. An elegance that is utterly personal. Witty warm enchanting. It could disguise transform and magnify the smallest thinnest trifle. I remember feeling my cheeks kind of numb after the film was over not from laughing but from smiling all the way through. Cukor's reputation as a women's director was no myth. Here the glorious Kay Kendall in a character written with a tired left hand shines all the same because Cukor knew and understood what made her so irresistible. She was in the history of the movies like a comet that flashed before us dazzling us and disappearing very fast but leaving behind a unique brand of magic. In Les Girls she even dances with Gene Kelly wears hats and sun glasses like no one ever had before or since. She's an impossibly perfect combination of Allison Janney and Greta Garbo. This is a film that more often than not people forget to remember. I think it's time to correct that. Rent it or buy it switch on the weather channel select a rainy winter Sunday invite a bunch of friends and have a ball.".

It could disguise transform and magnify the smallest thinnest trifle. I remember feeling my cheeks kind of numb after the film was over not from laughing but from smiling all the way through. Cukor's reputation as a women's director was no myth. Here the glorious Kay Kendall in a character written with a tired left hand shines all the same because Cukor knew and understood what made her so irresistible. She was in the history of the movies like a comet that flashed before us dazzling us and disappearing very fast but leaving behind a unique brand of magic. In Les Girls she even dances with Gene Kelly wears hats and sun glasses like no one ever had before or since. She's an impossibly perfect combination of Allison Janney and Greta Garbo. This is a film that more often than not people forget to remember. I think it's time to correct that. Rent it or buy it switch on the weather channel select a rainy winter Sunday invite a bunch of friends and have a ball.";

It's a musical comedy version of Rashomon a trial for libel where all the principals give wildly different versions of the same events.  Gene Kelly Taina Elg and even Mitzi Gaynor are all fun but it's Kendall who carries the show.  She is one of those rare performers who can make you laugh with just a look on her face but when given something like a drunk scene she can make you weep with laughter. Who cares if she could neither sing nor dance.  Good score too.Sadly Kendall made only two more films before her untimely death what a loss to the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cole Porter's final film score and next to last music written for any media is Les Girls. The same team producer Sol Seigal and writer John Patrick who produced and wrote the adaption of The Philadelphi Story for High Society worked with Porter again and this time George Cukor was directing. It's a good film but I've got the feeling that it could have been a whole lot better. One of the criticisms that Porter used to get annoyed with was the perennial 'it isn't up to Cole Porter's standard' and then you'd look in the score and see a lot of classics. CanCan is the best example of that. But in the case of Les Girls Porter admitted this to be true. According to the George Eells biography of Porter he was starting to suffer the decline in health that would eventually end his life in 1964. He did have surgery to bypass an ulcer and was not feeling up to par.Still the numbers are mostly for a vaudeville act Barry Nichols and Les Girls so they're serviceable to a bright Rashomon like plot. The members of the act are Gene Kelly and the girls are Mitzi Gaynor Taina Elg and Kay Kendall. Kay's written a memoir that includes an alleged suicide attempt by Elg and she's suing her in an English court. As we get testimony from Elg Kendall and Kelly they all give out with different versions. It's also clear he had his fling with all of them at one time despite his alleged no fraternization policy.Elg has the best ballad of the score Ca C'est L'Amour which sounds like something that might have been written for CanCan and discarded. Cole Porter discards are better than a lot of composer's best efforts. The sparkling Kay Kendall was never shown to better advantage on the screen than with You're Just Too Too in a duet with Kelly. And Cole Porter wickedly satirizes Marlon Brando and The Wild One in Why Am I So Gone About That Gal with Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor.In addition to this being Cole Porter's last film score this film also marks Gene Kelly's last full blown musical. He did do other musical numbers in films like What A Way To Go and Young Girls From Rochefort and Xanadu but this was the last musical he did. They were getting way too expensive to make something Kelly learned from behind the camera when he directed Hello Dolly.Even with a score that Cole Porter himself wasn't thrilled with Les Girls is still a fresh bit of film making. And since it's original to the screen the Porter wit is not edited severely. All in all four great musical performers three of them Les Girls.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gene Kelly was one of the most talented and charismatic performers in classic musicals some of his dance routines being among cinema's most jawdropping. And George Cukor was a fine director with a filmography that contained a number of favourites.Both have done better films than 'Les Girls' in fact everybody involved pretty much has but the film is definitely well worth watching and is entertaining in its own right. To me what came off least successfully is the story which is basically a musical version of Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' except that film handled its story structure much better. It is certainly intriguing and it is difficult to resist its often risqu and disarming nature but it does struggle at times to sustain momentum and material for a running time that feels overstretched making the latter half pedestrian narratively. And while interesting the flashback structure doesn't always feel as smooth as it could have been some of it clumsy and disorganised.Cole Porter's songs have been criticised for reasons that are understandable. None of the songs are bad Porter was too good a composersongwriter to write bad music and are reasonably pleasant but this is not one of Porter's better song scores. Pleasant enough but nowhere near as memorable or as inspired apart from some witty and naughty lyricwriting though there are instances where they are overshadowed by some distracting stage business in the choreography as they could have been disappointing for a great composersongwriter who should have gone out on a high note but didn't. Jacques Bergerac is also insipidly dull in a role with practically nothing to it basically the sort of role that's there for the sake of being a plot device but nothing more.Despite how this all sounds 'Les Girls' does have a number of merits that it is difficult to be too hard on it. The best assets are the production values and the performances of the ladies. 'Les Girls' is simply a stunninglooking film the colours are eyepoppingly ravishing the sets are lavish the costumes are beautifully chic and the cinematography often dazzles. The ladies manage to steal the show under those who most would naturally see the film for Kelly Cukor and Porter. Particularly noteworthy is the perfection that is Kay Kendall who is charming and hilarious and would have had a bigger career if it hadn't been cut short so early and tragically. Mitzi Gaynor also has fun with her role and makes the character sympathetic too while Taina Elg is suitably sultry.Kelly is always watchable and dances with charisma and his usual polish and technical meticulousness in routines that while not exactly career highlights do show off how incredible a dancer he was even if his character is one of his least endearing though he does bring wit and charm. Cukor makes the most of the production values and there is enough elegance and lightness of touch but it does seem in the early parts especially that he wasn't in complete control or entirely trust or was comfortable with the material. The script is wonderfully witty and also has a risqu boldness and sexiness.On the whole not a great film and doesn't see the enormously talented people in front of and behind the camera doing the best work of their careers but absolutely worth watching for the production values and Kendall. 710 Bethany Cox".

OrryKelly won a welldeserved Oscar for his color costume design with one gorgeous gown worn by Mitzi Gaynor that probably accounts for most of the votes cast in his favor.Finally mention must be made of Henry Daniell's drily witty incarnation of a judge whose patience is sorely tried by the frivolity of the case before him and of course Kay Kendall's terrifically funny romp as Lady Wren.

	schema:headline " Sophisticated Musical with Gene Kelly Kay Kendall and George Cukor's Skills";
	schema:reviewBody "The musical Les Girls 1957 is curious I suggest for many reasons. It has three leading ladies only a few very good musical numbers and a plot that is heavy on satirical comedy with four distinct sections. It is also embedded within a trial about libel and takes part very largely indoors yet it is arguably filled with clear 'action' from start to finish. John Patrick's screenplay I find clever and the dialog perhaps very good. Vera Casparay's story gave us three different versions of mostly the same events with a subtle shift forward in time each time. Director George Cukor used shots from heights and clever low angles to give an extra dimension to what otherwise might have been boring indoor shots in lesscapable hands. The film produced by Saul Chaplin and Sol Siegel looks lovely in Technicolor and seems sumptuous as well as convincing throughout I suggest. The cinematography by Robert Surtees acting as director of photography the vivid art direction by Gene Allen and William A. Horning and the set decorations by Richard Pefferle and the great Edwin Willis complement the wellmatched art direction very well indeed in my opinion. Among the film's musical numbers Ca C'est L'Amour You're Too Too and the rope ballet seemed the most memorable moments to me. OrryKelly's wardrobe and costumes and the musical department's contributions stand out Jack Cole and Alex Romero are credited with the choreography no doubt with ideas from the star Gene Kelly. In featured roles Jacques Bergerac Henry Daniell as the judge and Leslie Phillips and Patrick MacNee all make very strong impressions with little to work with. The three ladies in the act Barry Nichols and Les Girls are Kay Kendall Taina Elg and Mitzi Gaynor. Kendall deserves an Oscar for her range of comedy and dramatic moments in the film by my standards Mitzi Gaynor is a good dancer and delivers both a decent characterization and some fine oneliners without being vocally strong. Taina Elg is the surpriseby turns charming mischievous and intelligent her accent perhaps harmed her opportunity to play more comedies within a shrinking 50's movie industry. Kelly is believable throughout and perhaps has never danced better. This film that retails the interplay among four interesting people on the road in Europe in the 1950s is undoubtedly both beautifully directed and professionally mounted. It has I say as a writer discreet charm some nice comedic and emotional moments and a pace that director Cukor and the cast never allow to falter. It deserves more credit than it has ever been given and I believe awards for some of its finest achievers' work exhibited herein.".

	onyx:emotionText "The musical Les Girls 1957 is curious I suggest for many reasons. It has three leading ladies only a few very good musical numbers and a plot that is heavy on satirical comedy with four distinct sections. It is also embedded within a trial about libel and takes part very largely indoors yet it is arguably filled with clear 'action' from start to finish. John Patrick's screenplay I find clever and the dialog perhaps very good. Vera Casparay's story gave us three different versions of mostly the same events with a subtle shift forward in time each time. Director George Cukor used shots from heights and clever low angles to give an extra dimension to what otherwise might have been boring indoor shots in lesscapable hands. The film produced by Saul Chaplin and Sol Siegel looks lovely in Technicolor and seems sumptuous as well as convincing throughout I suggest. The cinematography by Robert Surtees acting as director of photography the vivid art direction by Gene Allen and William A. Horning and the set decorations by Richard Pefferle and the great Edwin Willis complement the wellmatched art direction very well indeed in my opinion. Among the film's musical numbers Ca C'est L'Amour You're Too Too and the rope ballet seemed the most memorable moments to me. OrryKelly's wardrobe and costumes and the musical department's contributions stand out Jack Cole and Alex Romero are credited with the choreography no doubt with ideas from the star Gene Kelly. In featured roles Jacques Bergerac Henry Daniell as the judge and Leslie Phillips and Patrick MacNee all make very strong impressions with little to work with. The three ladies in the act Barry Nichols and Les Girls are Kay Kendall Taina Elg and Mitzi Gaynor. Kendall deserves an Oscar for her range of comedy and dramatic moments in the film by my standards Mitzi Gaynor is a good dancer and delivers both a decent characterization and some fine oneliners without being vocally strong. Taina Elg is the surpriseby turns charming mischievous and intelligent her accent perhaps harmed her opportunity to play more comedies within a shrinking 50's movie industry. Kelly is believable throughout and perhaps has never danced better. This film that retails the interplay among four interesting people on the road in Europe in the 1950s is undoubtedly both beautifully directed and professionally mounted. It has I say as a writer discreet charm some nice comedic and emotional moments and a pace that director Cukor and the cast never allow to falter.

	schema:reviewBody "On the one hand it has Gene Kelly and direction by George Cukor and the smart smooth music of Cole Porter. But the structure of the plot is a bit bumpy and most of this bumpiness stems from the RASHOMONlike tale starting stopping and starting again over two hours. A lot of people seem to think that the Porter score was subpar I wholeheartedly disagree. An especially lovely sequence is a rowboat scene between Kelly and Taina Elg which segues into the love song Ca C'est L'amour. Also clever are the burlesque turn of Ladies In Waiting and the vaudevillelike You're Just Too Too which pairs Kelly with the rapturous Kay Kendall. Kendall is in many ways the real star of LG with her deft comedy drunkenly singing opera for five straight minutes! and her cool elegant beauty. Knowing that she died shortly after completing this film and so young makes one miss her charms all the more and also wish that the film had a larger following. It's particularly enigmatic nowadays when compared to Kelly's bigger and better known hits 'Singin' In The Rain' 'An American In Paris' 'Anchors Aweigh' etc. Still Mitzi Gaynor is a dish dancing with Kelly in a sexy black dress in a weird MarlonBrandoa'laTHEWILDONEsend up.

Sometimes there was no color at all which whets your appetite for later. Of course we also had Gene Allen working with us a very talented designer and now sometimes a writer.

Sometimes there was no color at all which whets your appetite for later. Of course we also had Gene Allen working with us a very talented designer and now sometimes a writer. Gene is credited with George for designing the main title but he actually did much much more than that.  George Cukor.";

Some like A Star Is Born 1954 and My Fair Lady 1964 were acclaimed others like Let's Make Love 1960 were disappointments.Les Girls both benefits from and suffers from his approach to musical comedy. It benefits as a comedy and suffers as a musical. Someone like Vincente Minnelli might have made a lighter more stylish film from the same material with more emphasis on the musical numbers. Cukor's approach seems more characterdriven and actorfocused.Les Girls has some wonderfully sophisticated witty adult things to say about relationships but it doesn't seem especially suited to the MGM musical form. The numbers are rather few and far between  and sometimes too brief. Granted there's an unusual depth to the characters. There's also a focus on the actors not as musical performers but truly as actors which is why we get one of Gene Kelly's very best performances and very good ones from Mitzi Gaynor and Taina Elg. Kay Kendall gets a superb showcase for her comedic charms even a drunk scene in which she sings opera which is a little lengthy  though funny.It's well directed the cast is great and the songs by Cole Porter are good. It's not bad to look at either with Cukor employing his A Star Is Born production team of designer Gene Allen and color consultant HoyningenHuene. It gets bogged down plotwise and you have to slog through it a bit towards the end but I would still recommend seeing Les Girls.".

The final product while pretty to look at it pretty dreadfuloverly long overly familiar and amazingly slight.The film begins with Angle Taina Elg suing Sybil Kay Kendall following the publication of Sybil's tellall book Barry Nichols and Les Girls. What follows is a Rashomonstyle plot where each of the particulars in the story tell their account of what happened back when they were a successful dance teamand each has a completely different idea of what has really occurredand each thinks they were Barry's one love. So why wasn't I in love with this film? The biggest problem is that the characters are generally unlikableespecially the very manipulative Barry Gene Kelly. As for the dancing I hated it but it all depends on what style music you like. If you like big production numbers and lots of very modern dance you'll probably like it. I prefer musicals where the singing and dancing are more integrated into the plot such as in the infinitely more successful film from this same period Gigi. Also the film just lacks originality as it did borrow so heavily from Rashomon. But most importantly I just found the film overly long and pretty dull. Pretty to look at...but dull.".

The film opens with Lady Sybil Wren the late great Kay Kendall an elegant British bombshell being taken to court for libel after the publication of a book she wrote about her experiences as the member of a song and dance troupe known as Les Girls. What we then get is a flashback where we meet Barry Nichols Gene Kellythe leader of the act and his girls the aforementioned Sybil a bubbly American named Joy Mitzi Gaynorand an exotic French beauty named Angele Taina Elg. According to Sybil Barry toyed with her affections making her think he loved her but Angele's version of the story reveals he made her feel the same way but Barry now married to Joy does finally take the stand and tells his version of what happened which is apparently what really happened. Stylish direction by George Cukor a surprisingly meaty screenplay for an MGM musical and some great musical sequences make for an offbeat but nonetheless richly entertaining film which if truth be told is effortlessly stolen by Kay Kendall whose luminous performance as Sybil lights up the screen especially in a riotous comic duet she performs with Kelly called You're Just Too Too.. Kendall was a supremely gifted actress taken from us much too soon and this film is ample proof of that. A nearly forgotten and underrated MGM classic.".

The story is told from three different pointofviews in a courtroom after each other. The storytelling is obviously inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Rashmon. Does this storytelling work out perfect in this movie? I have to say no. Although it works original it also tends to make the movie needlessly tiresome after a while. It's not always interesting or refreshing enough to follow the story from the three different viewpoints. Unlike Rashmon you as the viewer often feel cheated about what the real truth is. The three different stories too often make each other weaker instead of stronger and more intriguing even though it still makes the movie as a whole original and refreshing. So you can really say that the story and storytelling is one of the stronger as well as one of the weaker points of the movie.Gene Kelly is good in his role but really the main characters of the movie are the three girls.

I don't how the subtitles are because I watched it in Italian but there are enough Englishspeaking characters that add to the hilarious plot development of the film. It is well done and contains a mix of both languages that accurately portrays both the difficulties of Americans in Italy and Italians in America. Of course this leads to many many comic situations and the result is quite humourous.The only downside is the lack of an ending. That is to say there is no tying up of loose ends or anything like that at the end but that doesn't detract from the movie itself much at all. I am too used to American cinema in which everything wraps up nicely upon completion. The ending that this movie has is much more realistic than some fantasyfiction that Hollywood could toss together ... yet at the same time it is farfetched and and fantastic as well.Another slight detractor are the random flashback scenes that Tanino has during his fainting spells. Most of them remain unresolved and I have no idea what they were all about ... they didn't make a whole lot of sense. But at the same time the weren't awful and the movie seemed to flow uninterrupted afterwards. I suppose they were a good means of transition at certain points.If you have any slight interest in modern foreign films this is a great choice. It is bilingual enough to catch the drift of the film without subtitles but I'm sure if there is a DVD version it will have subtitles for those who can't grasp the Italian. It is enjoyable and a genuine good time so enjoy it with your friends.".

	schema:headline " The Duke Takes On The Barbary Coast";
	schema:reviewBody "Flame of Barbary Coast finds John Wayne as a visiting cowboy from Montana who makes and loses a fortune in a night and goes home busted. He also finds the love of his life in Ann Dvorak an entertainer at Joseph Schildkraut's place on the Barbary Coast.Schildkraut figures that Dvorak is his personal property. But the Dvorak romantic angle is a side issue because Wayne is figuring on not getting mad but getting even. He's learned a bit about gambling from an oldtimer at the trade in William Frawley. Of course Wayne and Schildkraut's rivalry is interrupted by the famous earthquake of 1906. As this is Republic Films and not MetroGoldwyn Mayer the special effects are nice but not near as good as those from MGM. As this was Republic's prestige film of the year I'm sure it was the best that miserly old Herbert J. Yates could afford.The most interesting member of the cast is Schildkraut a scion of the old Spanish aristocracy who's chosen to make his living on the Barbary Coast in the dens of iniquity there. He's as in love with Dvorak as Wayne is but likes his power and notoriety more.Yates took some liberties with San Francisco history in this one. The MGM San Francisco did not bother mentioning any of the local political figures of the day but Flame on Barbary Coast did and got it wrong. Wayne and Schildkraut square off in an election in 1906 that never took place between Mayor Eugene Schmitz and James D. Phelan.

	onyx:emotionText "Flame of Barbary Coast finds John Wayne as a visiting cowboy from Montana who makes and loses a fortune in a night and goes home busted. He also finds the love of his life in Ann Dvorak an entertainer at Joseph Schildkraut's place on the Barbary Coast.Schildkraut figures that Dvorak is his personal property. But the Dvorak romantic angle is a side issue because Wayne is figuring on not getting mad but getting even. He's learned a bit about gambling from an oldtimer at the trade in William Frawley. Of course Wayne and Schildkraut's rivalry is interrupted by the famous earthquake of 1906. As this is Republic Films and not MetroGoldwyn Mayer the special effects are nice but not near as good as those from MGM. As this was Republic's prestige film of the year I'm sure it was the best that miserly old Herbert J. Yates could afford.The most interesting member of the cast is Schildkraut a scion of the old Spanish aristocracy who's chosen to make his living on the Barbary Coast in the dens of iniquity there. He's as in love with Dvorak as Wayne is but likes his power and notoriety more.Yates took some liberties with San Francisco history in this one. The MGM San Francisco did not bother mentioning any of the local political figures of the day but Flame on Barbary Coast did and got it wrong. Wayne and Schildkraut square off in an election in 1906 that never took place between Mayor Eugene Schmitz and James D. Phelan. Phelan was in fact Schmitz's predecessor in office and Schmitz didn't lose an election. He got himself impeached for setting a standard of corruption that has had some urban historian calling him the worst big city mayor in American history. Now THAT would be an interesting film.

	schema:reviewBody "Flame of the Barbary Coast is a movie that I grew up watching in a movie theatre. It's easy to poke fun at a movie like this or any movie made in that era if you've only seen it on television. The power and quality of the performance of the film can only be seen on the big screen and not on the television screen. Actually the cast is quite good and anyone interested in directing or photographing a movie should learn from the film. This movie makes every second and minutes count on the screen and that's the reason the action never stops. Moving the camera in a certain way to make use of the drama and action with out two many cuts is genius but then these people knew what they were doing. Many repeats for good measure with eyes on an actor or actress moving side to side as if they are actually participating in the scene. The catty remarks between Virginia Gray and Ann Dvorak after Virginia Gray sings for an audition with Tito oh boy  meow indeed! Who cares if Ann Dvoraks singing was a little off and who cares if John Wayne tried his hand at singing on a horse? Who cares if Fred Mertz played a gambler before he was Ricky Ricardo's best friend? Who care's if Butterfly McQueen didn't get a chance to repeat Ah knows how to birth babies Miss Scahlett!? This movie is just good old fashioned campy entertainment with no foul words no nudity and in many ways the bad guy won when he said With Compliments of the House! Anybody who doesn't like this movie is an old grumpy!".

	schema:headline " Not really a western but John Wayne is still a cowboy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Before watching Flame Of Barbary Coast I never read the description on the back cover of the DVD case. It mentions the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Fortunately I was aware of some of the history of that earthquake so I was picking up the clues given throughout the movie. All I cared about before watching the movie was that it was a western with John Wayne in it. The movie is a late western in that it takes place as the wild west had been tamed and the 20th Century was becoming an entirely different reality.The plot was okay but a little thin. A Montana rancher goes to the big city finds himself played out as a sucker and returns to conquer the same people who made a fool out of him. Duke Fergus John Wayne takes lessons from his professional gambler friend Wolf Wylie William Frawley and ends up beating the professional gamblers in their own casinos. Even for John Wayne this is quite amazing. Added to that is his love interest in Flaxen Ann Dvorak known as the Flame of the Barbary Coast who apparently has teased virtually every powerful man in town. At the time of the story she is tied to Tito Morrell Joseph Schildkraut the most successful and notorious of the gambling house bosses.I liked the way Joseph Schildkraut played the classy but devious casino owner Tito Morrell. His character hinted at aristocratic old world lineage and his determination to maintain a level of sophistication despite his present reputation. Tito's criminal side is never shown only implied. John Wayne's character Duke never came across as simple. He loved his modest environment at his ranch in Montana but he had a business sense and some integrity. Ann Dvorak's Flaxen is the character that seems a bit odd. If she has such a reputation for being the unobtainable prize why do so many still want her? She really does smile her way through everything too. It would have been really nice if she got one of those famous John Wayne spankings.Establishing a specific time was done gradually and then deliberately. The house Tito provides for Flaxen is definitely built in an elaborate turn of the century Europeaninfluenced style that would not have existed thirty years earlier. Upon arriving in San Francisco there were many electric lights. A bathroom with running water is shown. Eventually a specific date in January of 1906 is mentioned and later it is mentioned that April of the same year has arrived. Although everyone is moving on foot or in a horse drawn carriage an automobile appears in one scene. The time placement was subtle in the beginning and made perfectly clear as it became more important to the plot.I expected the climax of the movie to be the famous San Francisco earthquake. There really were explosions and gas fires from ruptured natural gas lines. Firefighters are shown in the movie running out of water because of broken water mains just as the real firefighters did. It is even mentioned that looters would be shot as they really were. The catalyst that brought about changes in San Francisco set up the final scenes for the main characters. The true nature of everyone is shown in a final showdown between Duke Tito and Flaxen.I liked Flame Of Barbary Coast. My only complaint is that the movie makes the Barbary Coast seem to be the most important part of San Francisco and it is the only part of the city that is shown. The sets were elaborate and the actors were good. It cannot be called a gangster movie even though it has crime bosses. Over all it was more of a drama than a western but it was worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Average John Wayne Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "This turnofthecentury John Wayne adventure epic The Flame of the Barbary Coast amounts to little more than a thoroughly average but nevertheless entertaining saga about gambling in San Franciso and the rivalry between the hero and the villain for the affections of the eponymous heroine who towers about all else as the star singing attraction. No this isn't a standard western. Most of the action transpires inside buildings. Wayne wears a Stetson and plays a cattle rancher from Montana. The heroine Ann Dvorak of GMen is the girl that everybody yearns for and wants to see. She inserts herself between John Wayne and Joseph Schildraut and the Borden Chase screenplay depicts Wayne as a fishoutofwater or perhaps a steerofftherange who butts heads with an urbane satorially elegant casino owner. The Flame of the Barbary Coast could qualify as a romance because both the hero and the villain vye for her affection.

	onyx:emotionText "This turnofthecentury John Wayne adventure epic The Flame of the Barbary Coast amounts to little more than a thoroughly average but nevertheless entertaining saga about gambling in San Franciso and the rivalry between the hero and the villain for the affections of the eponymous heroine who towers about all else as the star singing attraction. No this isn't a standard western. Most of the action transpires inside buildings. Wayne wears a Stetson and plays a cattle rancher from Montana. The heroine Ann Dvorak of GMen is the girl that everybody yearns for and wants to see. She inserts herself between John Wayne and Joseph Schildraut and the Borden Chase screenplay depicts Wayne as a fishoutofwater or perhaps a steerofftherange who butts heads with an urbane satorially elegant casino owner. The Flame of the Barbary Coast could qualify as a romance because both the hero and the villain vye for her affection.

Frawley seems to be one of those actors that no matter what year he appeared in a picture he always looks the same as Ricky and Lucy's next door neighbor. It's like he was never young and never ages. At least that's the way it strikes me but I'm still looking to a capture an early flick in which he might have appeared youthful.

	schema:headline " The film wasn't hot. It was lukewarm pilgrim! So disappointing.";
	schema:reviewBody "I love old Hollywood films like this but this movie was flat and uneven. I was really hoping for a good mix between 1935's Barbary Coast  1936's San Francisco but I didn't get that. Directed by Joseph Kane Flame of the Barbary Coast tells the story of a Montana cowboy named Duke FergusJohn Wayne whom came to turnofthecentury San Francisco in hope of finding fame and fortune. He attempt this by trying to outsmart a crooked casino owner Tito Morell Joseph Schildkraut out of his money. Can 'the King of Luck' find a way to beat the house in cards or will Tito gain the upperhand and leave Duke to broke? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say the first half was very entertaining however after the scenes dealing with the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake the film really lost focus. It becomes less and less of Duke trying to make a name for himself and more and more on Duke just being an ass to Tito. Honestly I don't know why Duke has a huge problem with Tito. After all Tito did help Duke in the beginning getting place to place. Plus he did warn him about the dangers of getting into the casino business. Whatever happens to Duke is his fault. So why is Duke being a jerk to Tito and trying to drive him out of business!? It get really more confused by the third act when Duke out of the blue started to act all righteous and started to help a political campaign to clean up the streets of the Barbary Coast. The movie plays it off that he trying to help the people of San Francisco to reclaim their streets after years of corruption but it comes off as another way to seek vengeance on Tito. He doesn't even bother staying in the city after that affair. It's seem like Duke is just doing this to gain the heart of singerdancer 'Flaxen' Tarry Ann Dvorak. He care little about the city. It's very selfcenter for a hero. Not only that Duke made his money by cheating in gambling as well. Very hypocritical. Still John Wayne did alright in the role he was given. However I think the villain in the film Tito seem more like the good guy than Wayne's character. I love Joseph Schildkraut's acting in this. It's superior than anybody else in this cast. He clearly made the most of a script that allowed him to be anything but one dimensional bad guy. If anything the true bad guy in this film is Ann Dvorak's character who comes across as materialism greedy and seductive. What a Femme fatale! I do have to say the movie does have some funny clever dialogue. I love all the sexual innuendos that went below the censorship radar. However I didn't like the repetitive of the film trying to make certain words famous oneliners. I get it you want 'With Compliments of the House!  'We should had given him the works' to be as famous as the catchphrases from 1939's Gone of the Wind. Most of the best laughs came from William Frawley as 'Smooth' Wolf Wylie. He would later gain fame as Ricky Ricardo's best friend in the 1950's TV Show Classic 'I Love Lucy. Another thing that I like about the movie is the music and tunes. 'Baby BlueEyes Have a Heart' is pretty catchy. Though the other songs feature in the club aren't so much memorable. Still there were pretty entertaining. I just wish the singing from the main cast was a little better. Ann Dvorak's voice was really off. She sounds like a man with a cigarette problem most of the time. John Wayne sound like a drunk yokel when singing. The best has to be Virginia Gray as Rita Dane. She really looks stunning and her singing voice is amazing! I would replace Ann Dvorak with her anyday! One of the most disappointing parts of the film is the action. It's really out of character for a John Wayne's western to have little to no fistfights or gunplay. The recreation of the devastating 1906 earthquake was very dull featuring little of state of the art special effects of the day. You never get to see the scope of the damage with one full scale set falling down. The movie does have some good cinematography. Great use of shadows and fog gives it a film noir look. However I wish the movie would focus more money on making the disaster look epic in technicolored. You really don't get to see much of the city before and after the fact. I also didn't like how the movie didn't focus too much on the disaster. People go on their merry way minutes later as if the quake was a minor problem when in truth the whole city was on fire for days after the quake. The movie is far from being historic accuracy. There wasn't an election between Mayor Eugene Schmitz and Schmitz's predecessor James D. Phelan in the aftermath of the quake. Instead Schmitz got himself impeached for corruption in 1907 and the city board elected a new leader. If the movie did any research they would had known that the city didn't have politics in their mind but instead rebuilding from the flames. I hate that the great fire is mention in a throwaway text in the film rather than showing the true effects from it. Overall While there are some scratches white flecks and specks in the DVD but for the most part the images are rather decently crisp with good contrast and actually pretty commendable sharpness. Film is certainly worth a watch for any John Wayne's fan but has limited lasting appeal to anybody else.".

I do have to say the movie does have some funny clever dialogue. I love all the sexual innuendos that went below the censorship radar. However I didn't like the repetitive of the film trying to make certain words famous oneliners. I get it you want 'With Compliments of the House!  'We should had given him the works' to be as famous as the catchphrases from 1939's Gone of the Wind. Most of the best laughs came from William Frawley as 'Smooth' Wolf Wylie. He would later gain fame as Ricky Ricardo's best friend in the 1950's TV Show Classic 'I Love Lucy. Another thing that I like about the movie is the music and tunes. 'Baby BlueEyes Have a Heart' is pretty catchy. Though the other songs feature in the club aren't so much memorable. Still there were pretty entertaining. I just wish the singing from the main cast was a little better. Ann Dvorak's voice was really off. She sounds like a man with a cigarette problem most of the time. John Wayne sound like a drunk yokel when singing. The best has to be Virginia Gray as Rita Dane. She really looks stunning and her singing voice is amazing! I would replace Ann Dvorak with her anyday! One of the most disappointing parts of the film is the action. It's really out of character for a John Wayne's western to have little to no fistfights or gunplay. The recreation of the devastating 1906 earthquake was very dull featuring little of state of the art special effects of the day. You never get to see the scope of the damage with one full scale set falling down. The movie does have some good cinematography. Great use of shadows and fog gives it a film noir look. However I wish the movie would focus more money on making the disaster look epic in technicolored. You really don't get to see much of the city before and after the fact. I also didn't like how the movie didn't focus too much on the disaster. People go on their merry way minutes later as if the quake was a minor problem when in truth the whole city was on fire for days after the quake. The movie is far from being historic accuracy. There wasn't an election between Mayor Eugene Schmitz and Schmitz's predecessor James D. Phelan in the aftermath of the quake. Instead Schmitz got himself impeached for corruption in 1907 and the city board elected a new leader. If the movie did any research they would had known that the city didn't have politics in their mind but instead rebuilding from the flames. I hate that the great fire is mention in a throwaway text in the film rather than showing the true effects from it. Overall While there are some scratches white flecks and specks in the DVD but for the most part the images are rather decently crisp with good contrast and actually pretty commendable sharpness. Film is certainly worth a watch for any John Wayne's fan but has limited lasting appeal to anybody else.";

There are additional films with a very similar plot but without the catastrophic ending. These include Frisco Kid1935 Barbary Coast1935 Hello Frisco Hello1943  and Frisco Sal released the same year as the present film. Tito Morell in the present film is equivalent to Clark Gable's 'Blackie' in S.F both being self made men with greater ambitions than their present casino on the Barbary Coast. Ann Dvorak as Flaxen is equivalent to the role of Jeanette MacDonald in S.F. There is no exact equivalent for John Wayne's character in S.F. although the nob hill crowd who want to take Jeanette away from Blackie for their opera house is reminiscent of Wayne's role here in trying to lure Flaxen away from Tito's casino to his brand new casino. There is no equivalent in the present film for Spencer Tracy's character in S.F..As in the case of S.F. we can look at the screenplay as being a morality play. Wayne achieved his dream of building a lavish casino by a combination of skill and luck in gambling. But on opening night God destroyed his dream with a violent earthquake leaving him penniless. In contrast rival Tito's casino survived mostly intact. I think there is symbolic significance in this difference in fortune. It's saying that Tito and his casino belong here whereas Wayne belongs back on his Montana cattle ranch he misses so much. Fortunately for Wayne Flaxen was agreeable to give up her entertainment lifestyle to become a cattlewoman. She had seemingly vacillated between supporting Tito or Wayne it being difficult to tell which side she was on until near the end.

Aside from his early Bmovies and a few horrible mistakes The Green Beret and The Conqueror come to mind any John Wayne film is worth seeing. However Flame of the Barbary Coast is certainly among his lesser starring efforts. I think part of this is because Wayne's bigger than life persona really isn't fully evident in this filmin fact he seems like a bit of a chump in this one! The film begins with Wayne coming to the Barbary Coast a rough section of San Francisco from Montana to collect a debt. However he takes one look at 'Flaxen' Ann Dvorak and is instantly smittenand spends much of the rest of the film following her about like a lovesick puppy. As I said it's not the totally selfconfident and macho John Wayne that later would be solidified in his filmsthe later Wayne would have just grabbed the woman and planted a kiss on her or dumped her when she played hard to get! This one however spends most of the movie trying to oneup her unscrupulous boss Joseph Schildkraut and build an even bigger gambling casino where he wants the chanteuse Flaxen to perform. All this striving for one womana woman that often didn't seem worth it as she's whiny and demanding. Yet she is a walking clichthe woman EVERY man wants to possessyet not sexy enough to really pull it off well.Overall the film is worth seeing but easy to skip. The script is only fair and Wayne's support is sometimes weak Dvorak and Schildkrautwho came off as too wimpy to be a good foilthough William Frawley is very good in his role as Wayne's friend and mentor. If you are a HUGE Wayne fan then you must see it. If you aren't then it probably wont do much to impress you.By the way this is one of several films that portray the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. Considering the film was made by a lowbudget studio Republic its special effects were pretty good but not nearly as nice as films such as San Francisco by MGM or Frisco Jenny by Warner Brothers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anything you can tell me? Sure...he's deadThere is so much to like about this film that it makes me wonder how The Sleeping City isn't more famous. It's simply one of the best film noir pictures of the era...and that's saying a lot because I love noir and have seen many many of these pictures.The film begins with a vicious scene as a young hospital intern is shot in the face at point blank range. The cops however have no leads and the killing seems senseless...perhaps the work of a psycho. With no other real options the boss decides to call in three special agents. These men will obtain jobs at the hospital and see if there is anything that would lead them to understand why the man was murdered...as well as who did it.The main undercover agent is Fred Richard Conte. Because of his own background in medicine he'll pose as one of the interns. It's a tough job as he'll be around patients and it's pretty hard to fake it indefinitely! He's told to rely on his nurses as they'll help him figure out what to do. And if he has a case that's over his head he'll just have to break cover and get a real doctor to help. However when another intern soon ends up dead it sure looks as if some conspiracy is going on...but the viewer sure is surprised how deep this all goes and what it's all really about...and it sure isn't random!There is so much going for the film and most of it has to do with realism. Apart from Richard Conte most of the rest of the folks in the film don't look like actors and the cops especially seem like real cops. Additionally Conte was no pretty boy and was excellent in the film...tough but no smartalleck or unrealistic guy! But what also really helps is the story itself...it's hard to predict very intelligently written and amazingly good. See this film...you won't regret it and it doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer.".

I do wish they'd release it on DVD because while it's no masterpiece it's a nifty noir.Interns are being disappeared at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. What an ugly place then and now. Maybe all those missing interns just ran away and became artists in Bora Bora. The police department insinuates a mole Richard Conte as a new guy. He's actually spent a few years in medical school we're told. He digs into the internal dynamics of Bellevue running into characters played by the wizened and creepy Tabor and the supernally nubile Grey.It's a tense exciting and interesting flick. What I remember most is Conte the reallife halfbaked medical student parading around in whites ordering meds to be administered giving orders and looking authoritative.That's one of the features of this movie that make it interesting. It's relatively EASY to fake being an MD. It's been done dozens of times by sociopaths and is probably being done even now as we speak. Docs carry around such Aesculapian authority that ordinary mortals make many unspoken assumptions about the role.I'll give one example. A doc that I know  a close relative and lifelong friend  is late for meetings and appointments with the public from time to time just like the rest of us humans. We all oversleep or forget. When you and I are late we are castigated for our lack of organization and self discipline. When a doc rushes in late his audience APOLOGIZES to him for disrupting his busy schedule. The assumption is made that his duties in saving mankind prevented his being on time. Well  full disclosure I'm a sociologist.It's marvelous to see Conte doing such a sociopathic number in the interests of justice and social control. He's rarely challenged even when his orders are obviously a little screwy. Who's going to question the judgment of a confident young man in a white lab coat who has a stethoscope hanging around his neck and a pen light protruding from his breast pocket? These props are the equivalent of a police uniform and badge.Forgive these observations. I now step down from the podium and return to the movie. Where was I? Oh yes. It's a neat thriller and ends if I remember correctly with a chase through one of those soulless basements filled with laundries and pipes and fuse boxes and what appear to be steamproducing machines.It would be nice to see it available on DVD.".

George Kimball Rock is a malade imaginaire and Judy  Dorisis ... well blonde.  Tony Randall is at his considerable best as the nerdy neighbour Arnold who gets entangled in the Kimballs' misunderstandings with delicious comic consequences.  Paul Lynde turns in a marvellous cameo as Mister Akins of the funeral parlour and the annoyingly perfect Bert Power is played with breezy confidence by Clint Walker TV's Cheyenne the incidental music gives him a witty little cowboy theme.    My hypochondria has finally paid off announces George after hearing and misconstruing his doctor's talk of impending mortality.  Arnold prepares a eulogy which mentions George's 'unfailing good humour' a phrase which could stand as the movie's subtitle.  Hudson is masterly as the doomladen George showing how assured he can be when the material is strong.  This wellcrafted script is derived from a Broadway play and its quality shines through.  Doris wears a very prominent wig and in true Doris style keeps her bra on under her negligee.    Made in 1962 when television had clearly won the battle against the cinema the film uses TV's ascendancy in a very knowing way in the opening gag.    Verdict  Nearfaultless domestic comedy with great work by Hudson Day Randall and Lynde.".

And Doris Day despite wearing what looks to be the worst looking wig since Barbara Stanwyck's blonde hairdo in Double Indemnity uses her own comic flair with stylebut personally I've enjoyed her much more in her other roles with Hudson especially Pillow Talk. The focus here is on Hudson and he makes the most of a wellwritten comic role.Since one of the writers on the script is Julius J.

I had no idea what it was but when I saw Norman Jewison's name in the opening credits I made a point to keep it on the channel. So then it gets to the wildly creative opening scene with Rock Hudson in bed looking miserable. There's a voice over asking questions about his ailments and it comes off like a cough syrup commercial from 40 years ago. That one scene was creative enough to make me think I don't care if the word 'flowers' is in the title I'm going to watch this thing! The story is funny as well. Hudson plays a hypochrondriac who thinks he's going to die. He decides to try and set his wife up with a new man in the few weeks that he believes he has left to live. I had never seen a HudsonDayRandall movie before. I enjoyed the chemistry between the three of them a lot more than any pairings in romantic comedies of today. It was also interesting to see an earlier movie from Norman Jewison. It has nothing in common with his later movies but the always original Norman Jewison style still shines even in this a somewhat formula based movie of it's time. The dialogue was clever and the actors deliver it beautifully. My only complaint would be that occasionally the comedy gets kind of silly and sitcomlike. The rest of the movie is so smart and well written that the sillier scenes feel out of place. I since have also seen Pillow Book but I think I prefer Send Me No Flowers. I hope one day soon I catch this on TV at 100 in the morning again.".

Trying to set up his wife played by Doris Day for after he is gone he sets off one horrendous fight that looks like a comic version of War of the Roses. Tony Randall has the Danny DeVito role in this comedy that also stars Paul Lynde in one of his best roles next to Uncle Arthur on Bewitched and Edward Andrews a great actor of the Sixties whose first name is almost an anagram of his last.

	schema:headline " Mr.Mrs. Suburbia";
	schema:reviewBody "For the last film of Rock HudsonDoris DayTony Randall Rock and Doris are already married so it's not like Rock is in hot pursuit of our all American virginal goddess. Instead they seem like a typical suburban couple of the early sixties except for one problem Rock is an obsessive compulsive hypochondriac. Another visit to Edward Andrews the doctor and a big misunderstanding convince Rock he's a terminal case and he starts making preparations both to meet his Maker and make sure about Doris who he leaves behind. That causes all kinds of funny situations that Rock and Doris muddle through with the fumbling help of a lot of people.Hudson and Day did three films together and by rights they should be listed as a trio with Tony Randall because he was in all three of the films and added so much to them as Hudson's comic foil. Of course this was in the day much before he became TV's most famous fuss budget Felix Unger. Still you can see traces of Felix in all three of Randall's roles with Rock and Doris.Send Me No Flowers is the weakest of the three comedies I feel because the HudsonDay team works so much better with Rock trying to grab a little nookie from Doris and getting hooked for his troubles. Still the film has some really nice moments. All three of their films were well cast with some of the best supporting players around.My favorite in Send Me No Flowers is Paul Lynde as the cemetery director who just loves his job. He has two scenes one with Rock buying a cemetery plot and a second with Doris where he inadvertently solves the problems Rock's hypochondria works them into.Rock and Doris surely made one wonderful movie screen team.".

	onyx:emotionText "For the last film of Rock HudsonDoris DayTony Randall Rock and Doris are already married so it's not like Rock is in hot pursuit of our all American virginal goddess. Instead they seem like a typical suburban couple of the early sixties except for one problem Rock is an obsessive compulsive hypochondriac. Another visit to Edward Andrews the doctor and a big misunderstanding convince Rock he's a terminal case and he starts making preparations both to meet his Maker and make sure about Doris who he leaves behind. That causes all kinds of funny situations that Rock and Doris muddle through with the fumbling help of a lot of people.Hudson and Day did three films together and by rights they should be listed as a trio with Tony Randall because he was in all three of the films and added so much to them as Hudson's comic foil. Of course this was in the day much before he became TV's most famous fuss budget Felix Unger. Still you can see traces of Felix in all three of Randall's roles with Rock and Doris.Send Me No Flowers is the weakest of the three comedies I feel because the HudsonDay team works so much better with Rock trying to grab a little nookie from Doris and getting hooked for his troubles. Still the film has some really nice moments. All three of their films were well cast with some of the best supporting players around.My favorite in Send Me No Flowers is Paul Lynde as the cemetery director who just loves his job. He has two scenes one with Rock buying a cemetery plot and a second with Doris where he inadvertently solves the problems Rock's hypochondria works them into.Rock and Doris surely made one wonderful movie screen team.";

All films these days are predictable so its no different but the difference is actually the fact that they just manage to be funny without obviously being so and are able to make a very funny film without using extreme measures and ridiculous comments that are used so often in our modern day films. I put this film first before 'Pillow Talk' 2ndand 'Lover come back'3rd. Otherwise all of them are just really funny and refreshing!!! Where else would you find such nice simple films?!".

And Rock Hudson and his sidekick Tony Randall are first rate comic actors. Even director Norman Jewison is a solid force in 1960s and 70s Hollywood if not one of their inventive geniuses think Fiddler on the Roof and Moonstruck. So I understand that a lot of people have liked this movie for its lighthearted charm and the bright 1964 colors and sets.But at its it's a rotten movie. The script is one of the worst you can imaginesimplistic in its main idea with clumsy or even mindless dialog and a kind of televisionatitsworst tone. This is especially distressing because Julius Epstein wrote ithe's one of the Epstein twins who did the Casablanca screenplay. It might be actually a simple fact that Epstein was from a different generation than the movie's characters and he didn't have a feel for the Cold War let alone this flip side to the Cold War. Put all this another way? This ain't no Pillow Talk.That 1959 movie most of you know is the classic Doris DayRock Hudson comedy and it plays well into both of their personas and includes Randall too. It has some really funny writing a clever idea that lets Hudson work his acting chops a bit and a more neurotic and annoyinglovable Day. Here you have to get into a kind of loping cornball a series of interludes of comic anger and oneliner comebacks. It does have a fascinating aspect in the second half where Randall moves in with Hudson and there is a presaging prestaging? of The Odd Couple which Randall would later perform on television. They even are in bad together unhappily which you couldn't yet do in Hollywood due to the last vestiges of the Hays Code. Hudson was gay Randall was not if this matters much.Hudson rushes into the bright sunny kitchen and says When a man's wife thinks he's having an affair how can he convince her he's not?Randall titters He can't. This is right where there is an interesting early product placement Rice Krispies and Maxwell House. Randall a lawyer then suggests he confess he's having an affair as a way to break through the problem. Comic potentialand it gets a bit more silly than funny but it does lead to the most interesting parts of the movie. Stick it out that far if you can.Maybe it's wrong to expect too much from any Doris Day movie full disclosure I find her more annoying than lovable. It's a time in both America and in the movies where part of society wore its glibness as a kind of badge. I mean if you see Glass Bottomed Boat you'll see this maybe at it's clearest. Or here where there is so little to really think or care about except maybe enjoying the company of the three main characters as far as that can go. It is kind of gussied up sitcom television half hour stretched into a full 100 minutes.".

In this period of from 1945  1970 some of the best movies where made. We all remember films like Cacablanca Some like it hot The odd couple The African QueenFrom here to eternity Roman holiday The bridge over the river Kwai Ben Hur Spartacus Doctor Zhivago. And take then the must fantastic musical that also where made before the time of the computer animation took over.Just think about Singing in the rain or my favorite The sound of music and last The west side story. We domt make them any more. We don't know how to. People have chances and people have learn to demand more. Its just like drugs. The want more and bigger every time. I know that we later on has made bigger and more fantastic to watch for the eye and the ear movies. But where were those movies of our present if we didn't have all the computer animation. What was Titanic KIng Kong Star Wars The lord of the ring and many others of the big films of today. And how good are the actors of to day when you take all the fancy computer tecnic away from them. Its just like inside the music world. Just you have a good face and a attitude we give you the voice. Back in the old days they had to be good acting because there wasn't anything to save them. The makeup at the time was awful and the special affects wasen't effective. They had to rely on the actors Screenplayers and the director. And think about how we admire the old gone stars. Look at Marylin James Dean Marlon Brandon Frank Sinatra Cary Grant Katharina HepburnJohn Wayne and Steve Mcqueenand menu others. When we go into a poster shop there are all there on the wall. They have become legends of a time where it all seemed easier and not so complexed as it is today. But back to send me no flower. I get filled up with joy when i see movies like this. The plot is funny and the actors understand how to make it even better. Doris day is as she always were charming sweet and sexy as hell. All the female actors of today who are melasting there buddy to find the perfect sexy look should learn from Doris. Not a single time showed she her naked body or even one breast in the nude but we men still dream about her. Maybe because she still left somethings to imagine. She never sold out. Rock Hudson the perfect man plays as always with grace and man power. He has the perfect face and it was god who gave him the perfect match on the screen in Doris Day. But they where only that good because they had the perfect third wheel in Tony Randall. I have never seen a man play so perfectly a drunk as he dos in this movie. Those 3 together is still the best date for me on a rainy day.I hope you all will go back to the old days to pick of some of those old movies and give them a chance. They might give you the time of your life and then you might better understand why your parents or there parents always talk about that time in film history.All the best to you From Denmark.".

Of course this business is all done very innocently but now that we are all very aware of what Hudson's sexual preference was I take this dumb scene as being something of an injoke that clearly went right over the heads of the movieaudiences back in 1964.In my opinion Doris Day  Rock Hudson made for a totally unconvincing onscreen couple. There was no chemistry whatsoever happening between these 2. And I would never ever believe in a million years that a man of Hudson's good looks would ever find anything attractive or marriageworthy about the likes of that annoyinglystunned superflake Doris Day.

	schema:headline " The best of the three HudsonDay comedies";
	schema:reviewBody "While not terribly well received here on IMDb this is in my opinion the best of the three HudsonDayRandall teamings. While Pillow Talk remains fresh and sharp fifty years later with Lover Come Back being a rather unfortunate and less enjoyable recycling of the same script it is Send Me No Flowers that gets the most airplay of the three in our home video library.From the superb opening theme song performed by Doris Day we are transported into the beautiful suburbia of yesteryear. Rock Hudson's George Kimball is absolutely hilarious as the king of all hypochondriacs if you've ever known such a person you'll die laughing. And for 1964 it makes some rather amusing and insightful observations into the nature of medicinal advertising. Ms. Day plays wife Judy Kimball she is a delight as always and it's perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the screenplay that at last Hudson and Day are married and thus involved in a relationship that extends beyond neverrealized innuendo. Randall plays the usual rightnextdoor character attached to Hudson's Arnold Nash and again this is the best of the virtually identical characters he plays in the three movies they made together.Being the hypochondriac that he is Kimball misinterprets a conversation he overhears at the doctor's office and subsequently believes he is dying. Once he and his accomplice Arnold absorb the blow they set about to find a suitable replacement husband for Judy to marry once George is gone. It's really a rather touchingly honorable intention and also generates the bulk of the misunderstandings that constitute the remainder of the film.There are some negatives these are things we see through our 21st century eyes and were certainly never intended to be offensive at the time. These mainly revolve around Day's character Judy Kimball is a beautiful and intelligent woman but is given no other pastimes in the entire course of the film other than playing golf and preparing her husband's breakfast. And despite being beautiful and intelligent George apparently considers her to be too big of an idiot to ever possibly survive without him and thus he must find a man to take care of her once he is gone. She has no children no occupation doesn't understand a mortgage can't write a check to the gas station correctly her greatest interest is in the impending divorce of a neighbor she doesn't even know and she apparently doesn't even know what she pays for groceries. We are clearly shown George's greatest dread as he imagines a number of scenarios in which Judy evidently has no judgment whatsoever and is easy prey to any slick con artist that should come along once she is widowed. It might also be said that this is absolutely typical of the way virtually all women are depicted in movies and television of this era.Like all three of the HudsonDayRandall comedies this one is lush and colorful with exquisite sets and wardrobe. The supporting cast are excellent particularly Paul Lynde as the cemetery proprietor and Edward Andrews as Kimball's exasperated physician. This film carries a warm comfortable feel of a happier bygone era and packs lots of laughs. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "While not terribly well received here on IMDb this is in my opinion the best of the three HudsonDayRandall teamings. While Pillow Talk remains fresh and sharp fifty years later with Lover Come Back being a rather unfortunate and less enjoyable recycling of the same script it is Send Me No Flowers that gets the most airplay of the three in our home video library.From the superb opening theme song performed by Doris Day we are transported into the beautiful suburbia of yesteryear. Rock Hudson's George Kimball is absolutely hilarious as the king of all hypochondriacs if you've ever known such a person you'll die laughing. And for 1964 it makes some rather amusing and insightful observations into the nature of medicinal advertising. Ms. Day plays wife Judy Kimball she is a delight as always and it's perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the screenplay that at last Hudson and Day are married and thus involved in a relationship that extends beyond neverrealized innuendo. Randall plays the usual rightnextdoor character attached to Hudson's Arnold Nash and again this is the best of the virtually identical characters he plays in the three movies they made together.Being the hypochondriac that he is Kimball misinterprets a conversation he overhears at the doctor's office and subsequently believes he is dying. Once he and his accomplice Arnold absorb the blow they set about to find a suitable replacement husband for Judy to marry once George is gone. It's really a rather touchingly honorable intention and also generates the bulk of the misunderstandings that constitute the remainder of the film.There are some negatives these are things we see through our 21st century eyes and were certainly never intended to be offensive at the time. These mainly revolve around Day's character Judy Kimball is a beautiful and intelligent woman but is given no other pastimes in the entire course of the film other than playing golf and preparing her husband's breakfast. And despite being beautiful and intelligent George apparently considers her to be too big of an idiot to ever possibly survive without him and thus he must find a man to take care of her once he is gone. She has no children no occupation doesn't understand a mortgage can't write a check to the gas station correctly her greatest interest is in the impending divorce of a neighbor she doesn't even know and she apparently doesn't even know what she pays for groceries.

As George and Judy Kimball they are a happily married suburban couple hamstrung by his persistent hypochondria. Convinced that he is dying after a regular checkup George spends the rest of the story preparing for what he thinks will be his imminent death including setting up Judy with her next husband a former suitor whom they literally run into at their country club.Unlike the previous two films Hudson actually dominates this movie and he is in peak comic form with a dryly funny turn as George. With her glamour minimized in favor of her homespun likability Day is relegated to the role of the confused wife here though she has funny moments along the way. Randall steals practically all his scenes as devoted neighbor Arnold constantly in a drunken stupor in his premature bereavement over George's departure and Paul Lynde has a riotous scene as an overly zealous memorial park director. This one may lack the willshewon'tshe dilemma of the first two films 1959's Pillow Talk and 1961's Lover Come Back and is usually dismissed as a domestic comedy but I think the setup is genuinely clever and the laughs wellearned. The only extra on the 2005 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.

The real reason to catch this one however is Brando's performance which as noted by another reviewer is one of his better ones. I saw this movie when it was released and left the theater feeling exhaustion as well as an inner turmoil because the movie made me so mad! The fight scene at the sheriff's office was pretty violent for it's time and was quite upsetting. Great acting all around. Check it out.".

I too was astounded at James Fox's pretty darn good Southern accent it was so good that at first I couldn't place him and then all those British roles came back to me in surprise. The script is ok too and one would like to know more about the backstage fighting that went on over it between Hellman  company. The Panavision color is excellent far better than what we have today. The portrayal of smalltown bigotry duplicity jealousy betrayal and infidelity is welldone and the spectacular junkyard Gotterdamerung is a chilling finale. The flick is definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much sexual water has gone under the bridge since the 1960s and more than a few installments of The Playboy Philosophy. So now at the millennium's turning a tale in which the prejudices cynicism and sexual infidelities of a small southern town's dissolute ruling class figure prominently seems dated even quaint. Yet such is the terrifyingly plausible spiral into anarchy depicted in 1966's The Chase that Arthur Penn's controversial film remains a disturbing piece of cinema. A thinner but still imposing Marlon Brando plays Sherrif Calder a lone laconic voice of reason in a town rapidly going insane on a hot summer's night. E.G. Marshall is Val Rogers bank president and town monarch suitably surrounded by fawning lackeys such as Ed Stewart Robert Duvall uncharacteristically loathsome as a milquetoast cuckold aching for revenge. The spark for the climactic firestorm is the return of Bubba Reeves who has escaped from prison after being sent away for joyriding in a stolen airplane. Everyone assumes he is coming back to avenge himself on Rogers' son who has been keeping company with Reeves' wife Anna Jane Fonda. The film's weakest performance is arguably turned in by Robert Redford who is much too pretty and softspoken to be convincing as the fugitive hellion Bubba. Overall however The Chase features some memorable performances including those of Brando Duvall and Janice Rule as Duvall's slutty wife Emily. In addition to the fearsome inevitability of its violence The Chase is notable for the horrific realism of the beating inflicted on the sherrif by a couple of corporate good 'ol boys  almost certainly the most graphic beating Hollywood had ever dared to put on film and possibly unrivalled to this day for its sheer ferocity. Critics may have made much of the film's flaws but as a study of a dysfunctional society poised to explode The Chase still stands up as a sobering and powerful movie experience.".

Without a doubt it is the best movie I have seen in 2009 and one of the movies to remember.It does have some problems with editing and music at the outset and feels oddly paced in the first half hour but when it finds its tone and picks up the pace it's a true roller coaster ride of emotions.The characters are archetypes and the story aims more for dramatic effect than realism.Brando is fine as the honest Sheriff and Dickinson puts in excellent performance as his supportive wife. Redford is the outlaw on the run as an escape convict even though he seems to be one of the most decent people around. Jane Fonda is his wife who has fallen in love with the town's prince played by James Fox who is on his own parallel escape from his father's E.G. Marshall money and materialism. Robert Duvall also gives a nice little supporting performance.The villain is mob behavior corruption and a society that looks for pure pleasure instead of some sense and meaning. Honest and decent people are on the run from society's destructive tendencies and the only one to protect the innocence of society is a single Sheriff who does everything in his power to protect the law that nobody respects but himself.Perhaps I am giving The Chase such a high rating partly because I had never heard about it before and was completely blown away. It contains a lot of complex characters and feels in the opening more like a play than a movie but if you give it a chance you may be pleasantly surprised.I think it should belong to the Western genre even though it takes place in the 60's. It got guys in cowboy hats an outlaw a sheriff a rich man that is taking over everything some romance bystanders that aren't very innocent and a wild bunch that happens to hide within a very disturbed society.Highly recommended.".

It's a torrid soap opera overall which is a good thing because it is saved by its romanticized excesses. The title is odd in a way because the obvious chase here is the pursuit of the convict on the run played by Robert Redford and not his best performance. But in a way there are all kinds of other chases herewomen and men wanting each other with a whole network of adultery and wouldbe affairs at play.But never quite shown. This is a movie pushing the end of the censorship code but the code is still officially in place and so there are still some boundaries even for a director like Arthur Penn who would help New Hollywood blossom notably with Bonnie and Clyde the next year. But the steamy background as this small town wrestles with decency among other things is great stuff.Decency as a core idea is what the main character is all aboutthe sheriff played by Marlon Brando. Brando is great. He isn't quite the Texas sheriff intended of course he's Brando but he has nuance and strength and he helps his scenes a lot. But the movie is brimming with talent Robert Duvall for one. Two women do their partsJane Fonda and Angie Dickinsonthough neither is given enough to do besides support their male counterparts Fonda is a kind of loose woman and Dickinson is a girlfriend having affairs.But Penn is the biggest talent pulling together a very complicated story in two hours. Photographer Joseph LaShelle is great too one of the masters of early widescreen color in the US. Together they make this movie fluid beautiful and constantly demanding in the best way.What holds it back is a little of the superficiality that is so common in early 60s filmsit's about sensation and effect about drama for its own sake. You never quite care about Redford in his run he's a surprisingly small part of the movie until the end. And even all the other characters working out their prejudices are a bit on the surface.There is a welcome racial theme here and a generational one young people utterly selfish and party hungry in this version and older folk filled with prejudice and greed. I say see this film. There's a lot going on and I could watch it a second time just for everything I missed.".

Everyone has a different emotion behind it and a different reason for their feelings. The film focuses on this theme.Accusations are flown around. Affairs are being exposed. Plots are being revealed. Secrets are being unravelled. Families are turning on each other and people are trying to use their enemies for personal gain. What a sad and thoughtprovoking film.The characters and acting are wonderful. The dialogue is quick and witty. The settings are lovely and unique. The plot is riveting. The title describes the movie well. Despite the complexity of the plot the movie is easy to follow and easily understood due to its timing and how it slowly and gradually reveals important details. Full of drama and romance The Chase will have your eyes glued to your TV screen. Will Bubba get caught killed or find a way to be free? Will he be able to prove his innocence? Will Bubba ever get a normal life? I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves crime drama andor thriller movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the time of its initial release few of us knew of the behindthescenes problems that beset director Arthur Penn as he directed The Chase. I and many others attended the show and in 1966 its impact was really astounding. What some critics and viewers take as a rather slow meandering opening section of the film I found to be an engrossing study of life in a small Southern town somewhat lowkey and slowpaced but with a slowly emerging sense of its underlying tensions and conflicts. The news that a local boy has escaped from prison and is headed back to town serves as the catalyst that eventually brings everything to a boil. Issues such as racism class conflict and the effects of evil gossip come into play as a host of characters find themselves drawn into an ugly crescendo of hatred and fear. The manner in which it all ultimately explodes into a succession of violent scenes left me and many others I knew utterly blown away. The shock value and the way it caused us to ponder the meaning of it all long afterward can not be understated. See it now and various elements that reflect common shortcomings in the way big Hollywood productions of the era dealt with such material are far more obvious than they were then. Some dialog doesn't ring true some of the largerscale scenes seem overproduced. All the same it remains a remarkable film amazingly well acted.".

His companion kills a motorist and leaves Mr. Redford to make it home alone on foot. Before leading The Chase to his small Texas hometown Redford leaves a great set of fingerprints on the rock his fellow inmate used to kill the hapless motorist. It doesn't look good for Redford but Sheriff Marlon Brando as Calder thinks the young man is innocent. Town folk give Mr. Brando a hard time. People expect Redford will try to see his beautiful wife Jane Fonda as Anna which is to be expected. In best soap opera fashion Ms. Fonda has hooked up with Redford's former best friend James Fox as Jason Jake Rogers. His banker father E.G. Marshall as Val Rogers owns the town...Something better should have resulted from a motion picture produced by Sam Spiegel and directed by Arthur Penn. Lillian Hellman who rewrote The Chase from a play by Horton Foote disowned the screenplay. Reportedly it was rewritten by others. In the central performance Brando delivers it's likely you'll remember him mumbling Bubber after forgetting most of the film's details...Early on the director signals a creative ride by backing up and parking the camera like an automobile...The bloody fight scene with Richard Bradford as Damon Fuller besting Brando and Mr. Penn's imaginary cocktail party shootout are memorable. Several in the cast have good moments with Robert Duvall and Janice Rule as Edwin and Emily Stewart making the most of their supporting roles. Brando gets screen time with Mr. Duvall and Ms. Rule always seems ready to fall out of her dress...Everyone in town is anticipating the return of Redford's Bubber or Bubba and this is the film's main problem. Redford looks like he's auditioning for a shampoo or deodorant commercial when he's supposed to seem menacing. While less so Fonda is another excellent performer who appears not to be at her potential. They could have given Redford a prison haircut had him pocket a gun found on the dead motorist's body and ordered the makeup crew show a few scars. Of course they could have also recast the role. Making it worse we spend an inordinate amount of time cutting away from the trashy and more interesting townspeople to see Redford running jumping and swimming around the countryside. Instead of elevating tension these excessive scenes break the film down. The Chase 21766 Arthur Penn  Marlon Brando Robert Redford Jane Fonda James Fox".

Its too bad she didn't get her way.  Not only would she have beaten Oliver Stone to the punch by almost twenty years it would have made for great cheese.  As it is this film provides enough cheese of its own.My favorite cheesy scenes involve big Roger's party and the town partylynching at the junkyard.  The party scene is memorable because of the prevalent sixties atmosphere.  The clothing is magnificent right down to Sheriff Calder's ruffled tuxedo shirt.  Moreover the women are gorgeous. Angie Dickinson is a cinematic delight as Calder's wife.  In addition Elizabeth Rogers beautifully played by Diana Hyland appears with well coiffed hair and the looks to match.  All of this beauty mixed with a supposed East Texas birthday party equals a memorable mismatch.  GoGo dancers at a wealthy East Texan's party is simply too Hollywood to be believed.The second cheesy scene occurs late in the movie at the local junkyard. The town unexpectedly shows up and proceeds to burn the place down with a mixture of molotov cocktails flaming tires and wanton partying.To be sure this is not merely a film full of silly sequences.  In fact many scenes come off downright earnest.  Calder's fight at his office is probably the most riveting.Many scenes of lesser consequence occur in which we see the acting talents of a very young Jane Fonda and assorted cast.  Unfortunately Redford isn't believable as a felon the town should fear.  Many more malevolent characters exist in the film as law abiding folk which they are not.This is another sixties social commentary piece and should be taken as such.  There is a lot of hand wringing but little if any solutions bantered about.  Period audiences were probably meant to take their cues and adopt socialistic solutions to convoluted problems.  This reach by the makers is what makes this film campy for modern audiences.".

In this case The Chase is no exception but however it takes Penn's vision even further in depicting American culture on a more widely associative manner. To put it briefly the film tells a story about the collision of an escaped convict an oil tycoon a righteous sheriff and angry townspeople which results in tragic consequences. At its heart The Chase depicts an individual who tries to find justice in a hostile environment.I guess I don't have to convince you of Penn's  the man who was to make such films as Bonnie  Clyde 1967 and Little Big Man 1970  directional talent which can be well seen in this undeservedly overlooked gem. The film is genuinely structured on some enduring contrasts of the individual and the community freedom and imprisonment love and hate new and old. In fact its deliberately created dreary atmosphere is merely stemming from the world of racism violence and alcoholism all of whose themes Penn studies at least to some extent. Moreover he goes deeper in looking at the American society of the 1960's sexual liberalization existential agony and the vacancy of modern life.To my mind the milieu in which this desolation takes place is described with extreme talent as are the characters and although the film has a few weak scenes I think it is fair to call it quite a film. It portrays a world where people spend their time partying and trying to sink their worries to alcohol while the seeming almost idyllic guiltfree existence collapses. Through unfolding tensions and conflicts Penn attains to reveal truths of the characters and thus of humanity. I'm sure for many the film isn't necessarily anything special but for those to whom it works it really works. I myself was absolutely hooked as I observed the pressure erupt on the screen.

With a cast and crew like this how could THE CHASE not produce at least a few entertaining moments. Yes it's difficult to believe that all this talent is involved in what finally amounts to a pseudoGothic potboiler but it's still a good deal of fun. Brando in one his less showy '60s roles plays a smalltown sheriff trying to keep people from getting too riled up when its learned that one of their own has escaped from prison and may be heading home. Robert Redford is the convict and Jane Fonda is his girlfriend. The fact that Redford's character is named Bubber tells you that this movie is closer to Tennessee Williams than anything by Horton Foote.The supporting cast is huge with Angie Dickinson standing out as Brando's wife and Janice Rule is great as the town hussy. Brando is OK and so is Fonda but Redford is woefully miscast in a role crying out for the likes of Rip Torn or Steve McQueen. Director Arthur Penn got back on track a couple of years later with BONNIE AND CLYDE.".

Based on Horton Foote's play of the same name and adapted for the screen by no less than Lillian Helman Director Arthur Penn gives us nothing but an expensive soap opera where everyone is either loving thy neighbor a drunk or both.The story centers around the escape from prison of Bubber Reeves Robert Redford and the lives he affects as he makes his way back to his home town. His wife Anna Jane Fonda has taken up with rich man's son Jake Rogers James Fox. Rogers father Val E.G. Marshall is the town banker and the richest man in town. His two vice presidents the milquetoast Edwin Stewart Robert Duvall and flamboyant Damon Fuller Richard Bradford court his favor. Stewart's wife Emily Janice Rule is having an affair with Fuller while fuller's wife Mary Martha Hyer is a boozy flirt.On his birthday he and his ditsy wife Diana Hyland host a party.

Anna and Jake examine their own situation and agree to help Bubber escape if they can. Val Rogers tries to win his son back. Finally Bubber reaches town and....................................Brando mumbles his way through yet another role. Although he is beholding to Val Rogers we are never sure why. Dickenson in a colorless role is wasted as Brando's wife. Fonda and Redford were just hitting the big time and would star together in Barefoot in the Park the following year. Redford to me is just not convincing as a hardened criminal. Duvall as well was just emerging and would go on to appear with Brando in The Godfather 1972.Miriam Hopkins gives the best performance in the film as Bubber's guilt laden mother. She has a powerful scene with Brando where she begs him not to hurt her son. Others in the cast include Bruce Cabot as Sol Anna's stepfather and ex B cowboy star Monte Hale Grady Sutton Eduardo Cianelli and Ralph Moody in smaller roles. Jocelyn Brando was the sister of Marlon.This film could have been so much better.".

To Kill a Mockingbird Hud Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Heat of the Night or The Defiant Ones are a class above this film. Even Picnic catches the flavor of the south better and one genuinely cares about the characters even the ones that aren't always nice such as Rosalind Russell's aging schoolteacher.

	schema:reviewBody "I think the critics were right back in the sixties overall this film is a terrible disappointment.I admire Marlon Brando as most do as one of the finest actors who has ever lived equally Arthur Penn has directed some fine movies his most famous perhaps being Bonnie  Clyde 1967 a classic multichase movie. This film however does neither of them much credit because Brando was woefully underused and the story that Penn had to direct is just well let me tell you about it...In a small town somewhere in Texas there're whole bunch of people who are beholden to The Man Val Rogers E.G. Marshall who made the town what it is and who controls it  including the sheriff Calder Marlon Brando or so Rogers thinks. Calder has a lovely wife Ruby Angie Dickinson who does nothing much but look at Calder with adoring eyes and does just about everything he tells her to do which isn't much. But lookee here this is a swinging town beginning with Val's son Jake James Fox who is unhappily married to Elizabeth Diana Hyland while also having an affair with Anna Reeves Jane Fonda who is married to Bubber Robert Redford currently serving two years in a local pen.Milling around town carousing drinking and swinging we also meet Edwin Stewart Robert Duvall a nerdy executive a VP at Val Rogers's bank married to his nymphomaniacal wife Emily Janice Rule who only has eyes for  well actually any man but when we meet her she is fixated upon Damon Fuller Richard Bradford who is lashed by marriage to a lush Mary Martha Hyer who just can't figure out why Damon wants to get away from her. Cynically and quietly observing all of this human flotsam is Briggs Henry Hull the town realtor with the proverbial heart of stone who thinks nothing of gouging the poorest out of their last dollar to pay back a mortgage  especially if the sucker is black.And so as the movie starts one fine day that dumb schmuck Bubber with only two months to go  and like some cue ball at the start of a game of pool  decides to escape with a real badass con thus setting off a chain of events that carom around the town and which leave Sheriff Calder smack dab in the middle of prison break that progressively looks more like a long pool break as all these people bounce off each other throughout that long day and evening  and which funnily enough ends up in a pool of dirty water with Calder trying to stop some of them from killing Bubber.This movie I remind myself is called The Chase. Only God know why. It has nothing specific to do with a traditional escape narrative. For one thing Bubber is so stupid instead of escaping to Mexico he jumps onto a train that takes him back home! So who needs to chase him? Well what can you expect from a con who's conned by the other escapee into taking the rap for a murder? So nobody's chased en masse by the cops of the town  all two of them. And in this here town precious few are chaste anyway especially some of those swingers who while at a drunken party decide to help out sheriff Calder by chasing down Bubber's location at an auto dump on the outskirts of the town. Inevitably most of the town people follow to continue the party set off a few too many fireworks and generally dump on the dump  and Bubber hiding therein  and well proceed to burn it all. I'll leave you to savor the denouement if you can spare a dime's worth of your time.Technically the filming and setting are okay but nothing special being on a back lot in California. The kindest comment about the script is that it's understandable while the story has all the originality of a warmed up Peyton Place 1957. As to the controversial beating inflicted upon sheriff Calder by some of Texas' finest racist thugs I think Arthur Penn would have been better advised to shamelessly copy Kazan's take on beating up Brando in On the Waterfront 1954 keep the cameras mainly on the onlookers and use sound for better effect. The explicit take in this film is farcical and even comical at times.Reflecting upon all that mess I can understand why this film was panned. First it's no where near the best from Horton Foote and Lillian Hellman. Redford was just miscast plain and simple. The gorgeous Angie Dickinson was also wasted in her role plain and simple. E.G. Marshall does well in executive roles and as the worried father to Jake Rogers he did what he could. James Fox in turn put on a great American accent to hide his English background but was there no other American available? Jane Fonda is suitably pretty and pretty suitable as the wandering wife of Bubber while Janice Rule shows her measure of men with almost campy panache. Robert Duvall in his fourth movie is the consummate mealymouth. But the other male party swingers and thugs were way over the top turning what could have been a truly menacing drama into a disjointed melodrama with only some flashes of brilliance from Brando that make it all just watchable and only because Brando could always do more with a look than most could do with words. The only exception to that is Steve Ihnat as Archie a thug who speaks only with his eyes and Ihnat does it chillingly.As a Brando film I'd recommend this one for fans only. But for a classic chase movie see The Defiant Ones 1958 with Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. There you go...".

But lookee here this is a swinging town beginning with Val's son Jake James Fox who is unhappily married to Elizabeth Diana Hyland while also having an affair with Anna Reeves Jane Fonda who is married to Bubber Robert Redford currently serving two years in a local pen.Milling around town carousing drinking and swinging we also meet Edwin Stewart Robert Duvall a nerdy executive a VP at Val Rogers's bank married to his nymphomaniacal wife Emily Janice Rule who only has eyes for  well actually any man but when we meet her she is fixated upon Damon Fuller Richard Bradford who is lashed by marriage to a lush Mary Martha Hyer who just can't figure out why Damon wants to get away from her. Cynically and quietly observing all of this human flotsam is Briggs Henry Hull the town realtor with the proverbial heart of stone who thinks nothing of gouging the poorest out of their last dollar to pay back a mortgage  especially if the sucker is black.And so as the movie starts one fine day that dumb schmuck Bubber with only two months to go  and like some cue ball at the start of a game of pool  decides to escape with a real badass con thus setting off a chain of events that carom around the town and which leave Sheriff Calder smack dab in the middle of prison break that progressively looks more like a long pool break as all these people bounce off each other throughout that long day and evening  and which funnily enough ends up in a pool of dirty water with Calder trying to stop some of them from killing Bubber.This movie I remind myself is called The Chase. Only God know why. It has nothing specific to do with a traditional escape narrative. For one thing Bubber is so stupid instead of escaping to Mexico he jumps onto a train that takes him back home! So who needs to chase him? Well what can you expect from a con who's conned by the other escapee into taking the rap for a murder? So nobody's chased en masse by the cops of the town  all two of them. And in this here town precious few are chaste anyway especially some of those swingers who while at a drunken party decide to help out sheriff Calder by chasing down Bubber's location at an auto dump on the outskirts of the town. Inevitably most of the town people follow to continue the party set off a few too many fireworks and generally dump on the dump  and Bubber hiding therein  and well proceed to burn it all. I'll leave you to savor the denouement if you can spare a dime's worth of your time.Technically the filming and setting are okay but nothing special being on a back lot in California. The kindest comment about the script is that it's understandable while the story has all the originality of a warmed up Peyton Place 1957. As to the controversial beating inflicted upon sheriff Calder by some of Texas' finest racist thugs I think Arthur Penn would have been better advised to shamelessly copy Kazan's take on beating up Brando in On the Waterfront 1954 keep the cameras mainly on the onlookers and use sound for better effect. The explicit take in this film is farcical and even comical at times.Reflecting upon all that mess I can understand why this film was panned. First it's no where near the best from Horton Foote and Lillian Hellman. Redford was just miscast plain and simple. The gorgeous Angie Dickinson was also wasted in her role plain and simple. E.G. Marshall does well in executive roles and as the worried father to Jake Rogers he did what he could. James Fox in turn put on a great American accent to hide his English background but was there no other American available? Jane Fonda is suitably pretty and pretty suitable as the wandering wife of Bubber while Janice Rule shows her measure of men with almost campy panache. Robert Duvall in his fourth movie is the consummate mealymouth. But the other male party swingers and thugs were way over the top turning what could have been a truly menacing drama into a disjointed melodrama with only some flashes of brilliance from Brando that make it all just watchable and only because Brando could always do more with a look than most could do with words. The only exception to that is Steve Ihnat as Archie a thug who speaks only with his eyes and Ihnat does it chillingly.As a Brando film I'd recommend this one for fans only. But for a classic chase movie see The Defiant Ones 1958 with Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. There you go...";

	schema:headline " This is not a kungfu film";
	schema:reviewBody "THE SWORDSMAN is a movie very much in the style of the classicallyinfluenced Wuxia movies of the 1960s like DRAGON GATE INN 1966 and A TOUCH OF ZEN 1969 which was based in turn on a Qing Dynasty 17th Century story by Songling Pu. These sword movies were at their most popular in the years running up to the earliest kungfu movies like Chinese BOXER 1970 and THE BIG BOSS 1971 but are not to be confused with the more familiar martial arts movies as they have conventions and rules all their own.Wuxia movies are typified by the spectacular sword battles where antagonists fly through the air in prodigious leaps as they cross swords. This kind of spectacle may have reached its pinnacle in the stunning sword battles seen IN CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO but it can trace its roots back to the earliest swordplay movies of King Hu and the first New Wave movies like Tsui Hark's ZU WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN. But Wuxia films are also about honour and the code of the warrior and in this respect resemble Samurai movies more than kungfu films.In THE SWORDSMAN the students of the Hua Mountain style of sword fencing have developed their Chi internal power to such a high degree that they are able to quite literally float through the air during their sword battles. Most powerful of all the Hua Mountain practitioners is Sifu Ngok teacher to the young hero of the story Ling Wu Chung. Or so it seems. Early in the film Wu Chung meeting an elder of the Hua Mountain Clan Fung Ching Yeung who'd gone into hiding so his enemies wouldn't try to control him by harming his family. Fung recognises Wu Chung as one of his own clan and teaches him the deadly Nine Solitary Swordplays and it is these techniques he uses against his own traitorous sifu.As other reviewers have noted The Song does get a bit of a caning in this movie and I defy anyone who's heard it once to get it out of their heads in less than five days.And it should be pointed out that Celia Yip is fooling no one with that boy disguise. Though in all fairness this girl disguised badly as boy routine crops up a lot in Chinese stories. Anyone remember the equally gorgeous Kara Hui Hui YingHung in EIGHT DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER searching for brother Gordon Liu disguised as a man?Wuxia have to be accepted on their own terms. There is a prevailing belief in China that the Chi abilities of martial artists in historical times were far superior to what contemporary kungfu experts are capable of. This is no different to the belief in the West that ancient seers were able to predict the future. Neither set of beliefs have any real credibility but it makes for fun storytelling.THE SWORDSMAN is a pretty good example of the genre but to be honest the sequel SWORDSMAN II is the better movie.".

I do think Jet Li in 2 is far better than Sam Hui in this one. Jet copies Sam Hui's style and character well but is far more athletic and intense which really helps the action scenes in part 2.  Sam sings well at least which is important considering how much singing of Hero of heroes there is in part one!A note about the cast list above Michelle Reis and Rosamund Kwan are NOT in this film.  Kiddo is played by Cecilia Yip and Ying by Cheung Man.A classic pair of films then.  Too bad part 3 The East is Red was such a letdown.  The first two films stand on their own though so no real loss.One warning if you are new to wuxia or Hong Kong films in general you may find the action in these films often too fast and incomprehensible. Repeated viewing will accustom you to the pacing as well as allowing you to savor all the rich density of the storyline and its numerous characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Which brings us to Swordsman or as the novel titled The Smiling Proud Wanderer whom Chow YunFat took on the title Linghu Chong role in a TVB serial of old. Swordsman is part of a loose trilogy of sorts the sequels being Swordsman II starring an almost different cast in leading roles and Swordsman The East is Red made solely to capitalize on the popularity of actress Lin ChingHsia who made her memorable comeback role as The Invincible Dawn from the second movie. Amongst the three Swordsman is still my favourite even though Swordsman II had more fantastical fighting sequences no doubt made more exciting by the charismatic presence of pugilist Jet Li. Swordsman The East is Red was largely wasted and save for Lin none of the other cast members returned and had a totally unrelated story from the original medium.Not that Swordsman stuck closely to the intended Louis Cha version. As mentioned plot lines were compressed and characters sometimes appear and disappear with hardly a fight. What worked was how the movie managed to sample the spirit of the novel and translate it for the screen. The script and plot was kept tight and revolved around the intense search for a missing martial arts manual called Kui Hua Bao Dian which is known to give the practitioner extreme prowess as demonstrated in the sequel Swordsman II but with a price.Double crossings hidden intentions quest for power  these are familiar themes which are played to perfection by the characters save for one pair our heroes Linghu Chong and Kiddo who are caught in the web of intrigue. In short the movie pretty much summarized the battles and craftiness of the characters in their thirst for the book and ultimately we see the disillusionment of Linghu Chong in matters of jiang hu as sung in the song Xiao Ao Jiang Hu.And oh the song! If there's a song that maketh the movie Swordsman will immediately spring to mind. It's an infectious earworm but what elevated its status rather than being just another song played during the credits or relegated to background music was its involvement as a plot element in the bonding of friendship the expression of disillusionment and also being so integral to the development of the story in the form of revelation of true intentions.Naturally since the song is important the God of Songs of the time Sam Hui was casted as Linghu Chong. There were reported protests against the casting of Sam because of his lack of martial arts background but I would like to beg to differ. Yes he's not a natural pugilist but don't forget the characterization is key upon deciding who gets casted. His interpretation and portrayal of Linghu Chong in my opinion is spot on miles better than Jet Li bringing a dash of suave and impish slyness together with strong vocals and that devil may care attitude. Stuntmen were probably roped in to handle the complex fighting stances especially when Linghu Chong executes his Du Gu Jiu Jian Du Gu's Nine Swords a reputable and formidable swordsplay technique able to counter any attacks but hey more than half the martial arts movie out there have stunt folk fighting in the place of actors.The rest of the cast were also top notch like Yueh Wah Cecilia Yip Cheung Mun and even Jacky Cheung in a rare villainous role although it was a pity that for the sequel almost all of them were replaced yet by another strong lineup like Rosamund Kwan Michelle Reis Jet Li and of course Lin Chinghsia.With a rich strong story containing the essence adequate interesting fighting sequences awesome cast and memorable song it's hard to find what's not to like about Swordsman. Never mind the rumoured reports that director King Hu actually walked out of the project halfway and had folks like Ann Hui Ching TsuiTong and even Tsui Hark himself amongst others take over in a collaborative effort this movie delivers and will forever remain one of my favourites of the martial arts genre.".

The story is clear and you don't have to do guesswork on what's what and why like with some Asian movies with insufficient translation or constrained scenes. The adventure unfolds effortlessly and feels whole which has to be a miracle of sorts when considering the difficulties it faced while in production changing directors.The movie has such a good soundtrack that the themes are used in the latter movies too and features few music scenes which add to the story very nicely and let's you get a breather between all the adventuring.Sam Hui obviously isn't a martial arts kinda guy and comparisons between Jet Li and him are a bit silly but on his defence he doesn't shy away from jumping around and about. He displays his physical side more than adequately. He's a comedy actor and while Jet Li portrays a pretty solid and cheerful Ling too I prefer Hui's who is more human and softer around the edges.Because the action isn't anywhere as fierce and raw as in the sequels this first Swordman movie is much more viewer friendly.This is not an action movie!

	schema:headline " Slapdash suffers from muddled direction";
	schema:reviewBody "THE SWORDSMAN is one of those wireworkheavy Chinese fantasyaction films that were all the rage in the 1990s. I'm not a great fan of the subgenre give me the good oldfashioned kungfu comedies of the 1970s over these any day. This one is pretty typical of the genre as it has a hugely overcomplicated plot with silly story lines and a cast of far too many interchangeable characters many of whom could have been excised to give the movie greater clarity. Old Hong Kong film staples are thrown into the mix from cases of mistaken identity to women posing as men and mysterious mountaindwelling heroes but sadly it's all very uninteresting and there's nothing here I could get worked up about. And this is from a FAN of Chinese cinema.The cast is pretty meagre and seems to be made up of comedy actors attempting serious roles in the likes of Jacky Cheung and Sam Hui. Nobody stands out aside from Yuen Wah who has a ball as another overthetop villain and who dies after a killer bee attack this time around! The female characters are undeniably irritating Brigitte Lin and Cecilia Yip I'm talking about you and the only decent acting of note comes from a pair of cameos by oldtimers Lam ChingYing and Wu Ma who share a touching scene together on a boat. Even worse the fight scenes are nothing to write home about with poor direction and confusing choreography throughout. The whole film has a cheap slapdash feel and although it's regarded in some quarters as a classic  and was popular enough to spawn two sequels  I'd readily pick the likes of MOON WARRIORS over this tat any day.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE SWORDSMAN is one of those wireworkheavy Chinese fantasyaction films that were all the rage in the 1990s. I'm not a great fan of the subgenre give me the good oldfashioned kungfu comedies of the 1970s over these any day. This one is pretty typical of the genre as it has a hugely overcomplicated plot with silly story lines and a cast of far too many interchangeable characters many of whom could have been excised to give the movie greater clarity. Old Hong Kong film staples are thrown into the mix from cases of mistaken identity to women posing as men and mysterious mountaindwelling heroes but sadly it's all very uninteresting and there's nothing here I could get worked up about. And this is from a FAN of Chinese cinema.The cast is pretty meagre and seems to be made up of comedy actors attempting serious roles in the likes of Jacky Cheung and Sam Hui. Nobody stands out aside from Yuen Wah who has a ball as another overthetop villain and who dies after a killer bee attack this time around!

This it turns out is a martial arts manual giving details of a powerful secret technique. Now just about everybody appears to want the scroll. The scroll is hidden under a waterwheel and two students of the Mount Hua Sect Linghu Chong and Yue 'Skinny Boy' Lingshan are asked to inform the son of the man who took it. They will encounter many dangers including from some of the people they thought they could trust most.I would usually describe the plot in a bit more detail but to be honest I was a bit confused a fair amount of the time strangely this wasn't much of a problem as this film is all about the action and the action rarely stops. There is a lot of wireassisted martial arts fights involving mystical powers poisoning and even a fighter who produces snakes from her sleeves! In in brief lulls between the action scenes there are some amusing moments many involving the existence of a second scroll which merely contains the lyrics to a song the protagonists learn along the way. There is also the running gag that nobody apart from Linghu realises that 'Skinny Boy' is actually an attractive young woman! While this is mostly light hearted there is some spilt blood and in the film's most disturbing moment the sight or a recently removed eyeball! The cast do a solid job most notably Samuel Hui and Cecilia Yip as our two protagonists the rest are pretty impressive too and appeared to be having a good time. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Wuxia films it may be a little confusing at times but is still a lot of fun.These comments are based on watching the film in Cantonese with English subtitles.".

In true Wuxia fashion the emphasis is not on realism rather on aesthetic value and fights scenes become chaotic colourful whirlwinds of limbs smoke and clothing whilst this looks impressive it is also very hard to follow.Also rather hard to follow is the storyline at first I was doing OK but as more and more characters were introduced I became lost as to who was doing what and why. The basic premise is that there exists a scrollThe Prized Sunflower Volumethat promises supernatural powers to see through things and to let out power over great distances thus assuring its owner supreme martial arts powers. When the scroll is stolen a power hungry eunuch realises the importance of the document and employs his best men to try and retrieve it. It's at about this point I got a bit lost plotwise I partly blame this on watching the film whilst suffering from the flu and partly on the film just being plain confusing.Swordsman features a terrific cast Sam Hui Cecilia Yip Jacky Cheung Lam ChingYing and one of my personal favourites of HK cinema the great Yuen Wah. However their combined talents do little to improve the movie. Yuen Wah in particular is completely wasted his impressive martial arts skills are hardly used at all. Instead he is required to leap about on a wire a bit laugh maniacally and wave his hands at the good guys supposedly fighting with his 'chi'very disappointing! Its not that I disliked everything about Swordsmanany film which features killer bee kung fu two headed snake kung fu and an attack with a waterwheel can't be all badbut given its reputation and the great cast involved I was expecting the film to become an instant favourite of mine.I was about to give Swordsman 6 out of 10 until I remembered the awful theme song 'Proud Laughing World of Martial Arts' which was repeated time and time again throughout the movie ad nauseum.

	schema:headline " Slattern!! Vulcan detests you and I find you repulsive too!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I swear for divine beings sometimes these Greek gods act like they just stepped off the set of the Jerry Springer show.Well they were always a rowdy bunch and in this movie the reason du jour for all the hullabaloo is competition between Vulcan the god of fire and blacksmiths and Mars the god of War for the favors of the goddess of Love and apparently Floozies Venus.Venus as played by Annie Gorassini looks like a model for a 70's toothpaste ad and vamps around like the bimbos on any of the VH1 reality shows. She plays men like an Aeolian harp and wrecks homes as casually as popping the top on a can of soda. There's one scene where an overseer is whipping some slaves and she and Mars look on giggling and making out. Yeah the chick's got issues.When Jupiter King of the Gods declares he will decide who marries Venus she and Mars escape to Earth not only to protect their love but also to plot a revolt against Jupiter. They encounter a crazy warlord with a grudge against Jupes and convince him to build a siege tower that would reach to the top of Mount Olympus with which they will overthrow Jupiter.Vulcan in the meantime has been hurled down to Earth from the top of Olympus by Mars' ally Pluto. He crash lands onto a beach where happen to lounge a gaggle of harem girls. One girl in particular Etna takes quite a shine to the disoriented god and you can see right away that they're destined for romance. What a story they'll have to tell their kids No sooner does Vulcan regain consciousness than the entire coterie is attacked by a band of genuinely loony looking lizard men known only as The Monsters. What with having crashed to Earth from a mountain peak only minutes earlier Vulcan is understandably woozy enough to make easy pickings for the lizard men.Also imprisoned by the lizard men are a group of rebels of some sort and among their number is Classic Peplum Sidekick Mark IV the Wiley Dwarf. His name is Kayo and the prisoners free him so he can get a message to Vulcan's friend Neptune King of the Seas. Neptune is portrayed as a bit flaky although he's got a good look going on and he sends a posse of his hardcore Special Forces dudes to wipe out the lizard men in a quick brutal battle.Then there are some plot contrivances and Vulcan his Main Squeeze Etna and their band of rebels take on Venus Mars the warlord and their warriors in a Big Final Showdown.It's a great battle scene and features the rebels vs. the warriors Vulcan vs. Mars and Venus vs. Etna in what is probably the first ever babe on babe bullwhip brouhaha. Yup chicks with whips.Speaking of that scene which also features hair pulling and skirt tugging let me point out Bella Cortez who plays Etna. WOW! Let me repeat that for emphasis. WOW! She put the lure in alluring. Bella is a beautiful Cuban actress who performs the Best Veil Dance Ever. Why she didn't become a huge star is beyond me.Gordon Mitchell doesn't have a lot to do but he's still good as the villainous Pluto. He could teach Maniacal Cackling at USC film school. He always picks up a movie.Iloosh Khoshabe aka Rod Flash awesome fake name plays Vulcan as a bit of a Dudley DoRight type. His chin is strong and his love is chaste. Beefy yet athletic he's pretty convincing as a hero.Lacking in a Hercules or any of his Hercusurrogates this is another of director Emimmo Salvi nontraditional peplums which also include Ali Baba and the Seven Saracens and The Seven Tasks of Ali Baba. It's great light energetic fun. The personalities and looks for all the gods are distinct and unique which you don't always find in a peplum. If you're a Bmovie fan you'll get a big kick out of this movie.".

	schema:headline " A delightfully cheesy peplum adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "Possibly one of the cheapest peplums ever made this lowbudget epic is not totally without merit although it does get pretty bad at times. Thankfully instead of being sobadit'sboring this is a sobadit'sfunny kind of film which is pretty enjoyable to watch even if the film itself fails to hold up as an effective slice of escapism as many of the pepla were. The story which is simple and confusing at the same time intercuts footage of the gods in a dryice temple in heaven arguing and discussing things with more standard swordandsandal action down on earth.Our first introduction to Vulcan is when we see him banging away on his anvil. The sexist Vulcan is played by Rod Flash who never became a peplum star for obvious reasons. Physically he's very impressive however with an impossibly broad chest and a Steve Reevesstyle beard. Sadly Flash's acting is nonexistent and his acting style is the most wooden that I've ever witnessed in a peplum movie. It's so bad as to be cringeworthy. Flash fights people by beating them over the back or throwing them around unconvincingly so in the action scenes he's not too good either. Thankfully the supporting cast are more interesting.Vulcan's major opponent is Mars played by Roger Browne The Incredible Paris Incident. Browne in comparison is small and lithe making the protracted battle of the pair at the end of the film a bit unnecessary. Still he makes for a nice baddie pairing up with an angry bald warrior king who looks like a cross between Peter Lorre and Telly Savalas. The pair are fighting over the love of Venus an incredibly floozy who drapes herself over any man nearby obviously the Italian's idea of the Goddess of Love is as a flirty shallow blonde bimbo woman! Appearing as a special guest star is none other than peplum favourite Gordon Mitchell as the evil Pluto who is criminally underused in this film. Appearing in only a handful of scenes all he does is stand around laugh and occasionally act. In the end he gets banished back to his own kingdom by Jupiter  huh? Thankfully the love interest not Venus but Etna a slave girl is played by Bella Cortez whose incredible figure is highlighted in the number of skimpy costumes that she wears her exotic dancing is one of the film's highlights.From the moment a lightning bolt appears having been scratched manually on to the film you're made aware that the special effects aren't up to much. In fact the only other effects if you can call them such are of the lizard men obviously just greenpainted actors with bad rubber covers tied to their backs.

Other highlights include a scene where the delectable Cortez is attacked by primitives in a mountainous valley probably the film's only good bit of action and a cat fight between Venus and Etna with the pair whipping each other!! Sadly these scenes are countered by the presence of a very annoying dwarf character who acts as an unwanted comedy sidekick for Vulcan. He does things like disguise himself as a bush and push people over and is one of the most irritating characters in a peplum movie ever. So finally VULCAN SON OF JUPITER is worthwhile only for bad movie fans who may get a kick out of Flash's wimpish hero or undemanding movie viewers who may get a kick out of grown men hitting each other with lumps of wood.

	onyx:emotionText "Possibly one of the cheapest peplums ever made this lowbudget epic is not totally without merit although it does get pretty bad at times. Thankfully instead of being sobadit'sboring this is a sobadit'sfunny kind of film which is pretty enjoyable to watch even if the film itself fails to hold up as an effective slice of escapism as many of the pepla were. The story which is simple and confusing at the same time intercuts footage of the gods in a dryice temple in heaven arguing and discussing things with more standard swordandsandal action down on earth.Our first introduction to Vulcan is when we see him banging away on his anvil. The sexist Vulcan is played by Rod Flash who never became a peplum star for obvious reasons. Physically he's very impressive however with an impossibly broad chest and a Steve Reevesstyle beard. Sadly Flash's acting is nonexistent and his acting style is the most wooden that I've ever witnessed in a peplum movie. It's so bad as to be cringeworthy. Flash fights people by beating them over the back or throwing them around unconvincingly so in the action scenes he's not too good either. Thankfully the supporting cast are more interesting.Vulcan's major opponent is Mars played by Roger Browne The Incredible Paris Incident. Browne in comparison is small and lithe making the protracted battle of the pair at the end of the film a bit unnecessary. Still he makes for a nice baddie pairing up with an angry bald warrior king who looks like a cross between Peter Lorre and Telly Savalas. The pair are fighting over the love of Venus an incredibly floozy who drapes herself over any man nearby obviously the Italian's idea of the Goddess of Love is as a flirty shallow blonde bimbo woman! Appearing as a special guest star is none other than peplum favourite Gordon Mitchell as the evil Pluto who is criminally underused in this film. Appearing in only a handful of scenes all he does is stand around laugh and occasionally act. In the end he gets banished back to his own kingdom by Jupiter  huh? Thankfully the love interest not Venus but Etna a slave girl is played by Bella Cortez whose incredible figure is highlighted in the number of skimpy costumes that she wears her exotic dancing is one of the film's highlights.From the moment a lightning bolt appears having been scratched manually on to the film you're made aware that the special effects aren't up to much. In fact the only other effects if you can call them such are of the lizard men obviously just greenpainted actors with bad rubber covers tied to their backs. I mean no attempt has gone into them to make them even look halfway realistic and not like actors but there you go. What can you do when you don't have a budget?

Unfortunately it suffered greatly from being rather incoherent and confusing at times due to a lack of sufficient character development. It's also quite possible that the fact that this movie was originally produced in Italian and dubbed into English may not have helped either. Likewise a few of the costumes could have used some improvement as well. On the plus side I thought that both Annie Gorassini and Bella Cortez as the sea nymph Aetna were rather striking which certainly didn't hurt matters.

	schema:reviewBody "I rarely say this but this film would have been much much better if the very quickly spoken narration at the beginning of the film was removed or done better. In fact the first time I tried to watch this film I turned it off due to the horrid introduction. Likewise the ending narration and its amazing sappiness would also be best if it were removed altogether. These sickeningly preachy bookends to the movie really take what is a decent film and sink it.The film itself is actually based on real events. It seems that in the 1870s and 80s hydraulic mining was literally blowing hilltops off in order to extract gold. Using high pressure hoses the ground was washed awayoften flooding the farms in the valleys with sediment or water. For more about this do a Google searchI found it all moderately interesting. The famous Edwards Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company case decided the legality of a company basically destroying the surrounding area to extract gold or other precious metals.The first thing that you'll probably notice about the film other than the horrible opening narration is the garish color. The print shown on Turner Classic Movies is usually the best available so I assume no pristine prints survive. Instead the colors are very gaudy and rather gross. See the film and you'll know what I mean. Despite being made by Warner Brothers who also made amazingly beautiful color films during this era such as THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and THE SEA HAWK this Technicolor just looks yecchyprobably due to the ravages of time. It could use a restoration to sharpen the picture as well.The film is made up of two campsthe farmers represented by Claude Rains and his friends and the miners represented by the likes of Sidney Toler. Rains' side is obviously in the rightthe miners are creating an environmental disaster area and have no regard for the financial damages they are causing the farmers. However nice guy George Brent still works for the mine as he runs one of the three mines in the area. How he is able to justify the mine owners' actions AND try to be friends with Rains and his family including his practically perfect daughter who any man in the film or audience would adore Olivia de Havilland is sure tricky. However over time the mine owners' tactics get worse and ultimately it's all heading for a big showdowneither in the courts in allout war or both.The film has a really nice castwith lots of fine actors. In addition to Rains Toler Brent and de Havilland there is a long list of character actors who make the film worth seeing. George Hayes in an appearance just before he became known in the credits as Gabby Tim Holt Henry Davenport Barton MacLane Henry O'Neill Willie Best in a role that does not cast him as an idiot thank goodness and Russell Simpson among others may not be household names but for old movie nuts like myself they are familiar friends.Overall the film is educational and entertainingbut also a bit predictable and formulaic. But if you can somehow ignore the start and finish you may find like I did that the film IS worth seeing.".

See the film and you'll know what I mean. Despite being made by Warner Brothers who also made amazingly beautiful color films during this era such as THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and THE SEA HAWK this Technicolor just looks yecchyprobably due to the ravages of time. It could use a restoration to sharpen the picture as well.The film is made up of two campsthe farmers represented by Claude Rains and his friends and the miners represented by the likes of Sidney Toler. Rains' side is obviously in the rightthe miners are creating an environmental disaster area and have no regard for the financial damages they are causing the farmers. However nice guy George Brent still works for the mine as he runs one of the three mines in the area. How he is able to justify the mine owners' actions AND try to be friends with Rains and his family including his practically perfect daughter who any man in the film or audience would adore Olivia de Havilland is sure tricky. However over time the mine owners' tactics get worse and ultimately it's all heading for a big showdowneither in the courts in allout war or both.The film has a really nice castwith lots of fine actors. In addition to Rains Toler Brent and de Havilland there is a long list of character actors who make the film worth seeing. George Hayes in an appearance just before he became known in the credits as Gabby Tim Holt Henry Davenport Barton MacLane Henry O'Neill Willie Best in a role that does not cast him as an idiot thank goodness and Russell Simpson among others may not be household names but for old movie nuts like myself they are familiar friends.Overall the film is educational and entertainingbut also a bit predictable and formulaic. But if you can somehow ignore the start and finish you may find like I did that the film IS worth seeing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although she might admit to it now but not back in her salad days one of the reasons that Olivia DeHavilland's films are so well remembered from her days at Warner Brothers was the sheer expense of them. She did do her share of sound stage shooting but as often as not Warner Brothers would cast her as the heroine in their expensive period costume dramas. She certainly did them well though she wanted better parts. Even films like Anthony Adverse and Gone With The Wind added to her reputation. But these films and Captain Blood Dodge City The Private Lives Of Elizabeth And Essex and The Adventures Of Robin Hood are what we remember of her early period and one of the reasons she's better known than a lot of her contemporaries today.One that was less known and I suspect because she did not have Errol Flynn as her leading man is Gold Is Where You Find It. This is a western feud story set in 1879 in California thirty years after the Gold Rush. It's not hard rock Fortyniners panning for gold out of the stream any more. Huge mining concerns are using hydraulics to create mudslides that are ruining the crops of landowners large and small. The biggest of these is Claude Rains whose grain crops like everyone else's is threatened by the mine owned by Sidney Toler whose foreman is Barton MacLane. Into the lives of all of them comes mining engineer George Brent from the east and he makes an impression on all on MacLane's skull and on the lives of Rains's children Olivia DeHavilland and Tim Holt. He gets caught right in the middle of the feud coming to a boil. Do we doubt where he's going to end up?Michael Curtiz directed Gold Is Where You Find It with the usual Curtiz supply of action. There's a climax involving a battle between the miners and the farmers that's exciting and well done. The costumes and sets reflect a good eye for the period. In fact Curtiz probably decided all this needed was Errol Flynn and he got him next year for Dodge City.Though she hated making the costume epics these films have survived and part of the reason they have survived is Olivia DeHavilland is so darn good in them. Sadly this film is not out so one has to wait until TCM broadcasts it. It's worth the wait.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem you're probably going to experience with this film is the poor condition it's in. And it's a bit surprising that it hasn't been restored. In 1937 producer Hal Wallis selected this film to be shot in Technicolor as a dry run for upcoming The Adventures of Robin Hood. It was the first Western shot in Technicolor and only the second movie to be shot in new Technicolor. And the cast is decent  Olivia deHavilland George Brent and Claude Rains.Perhaps the issue is that is the same old story in many Westerns except this time instead of being cattlemen versus sheep herders it's farmers versus gold miners. Otherwise it's fairly predictable and relatively historically accurate. It is interesting particularly because you can learn a lot about the kind of surface mining which was quite prevalent in California in the early days  hydraulic mining which really scarred the environment.This was clearly a bigbudget picture and it made a quartermillion dollars at the box office. So again why not a restoration? Perhaps it is because over the years George Brent's star has fallen quite a bit.George Brent although without his mustache is very good here. As is Olivia deHavilland. Claude Rains' hair makes him almost unrecognizable but he's always good.And there are a rash of recognizable character actors in support of the main cast. John Litel Barton MacLane very little screen time Tim Holt not very impressive here Sidney Toler I ask again what did the studios see in this actor? Henry O'Neill Willie Best very short screen time irrelevant to the film Russell Simpson a small role but strong performance Harry Davenport an all too short appearance for this classic character actor Clarence Kolb Moroni Olsen as senator and father of William Randolph Hearst and with a short screen time  Gabby Hayes! The story is good production values mostly appeared to be high and since it takes place in California much was shot on location and the Great Valley and Sierra Nevada Mountains are there to see. This was a neargreat film that somehow didn't quite live up to its potential. I'm glad to have seen it it's well worth watching but it won't end up on my DVD shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.2018 REVISIONWhen I initially saw this movie about 10 years ago I was put off by the rather poor quality of this early 3strip Technicolor. Several other reviewers also mentioned this. In contrast when I recently rewatched this on TCM the color was just as vibrant as that of The Adventures of Robin Hood released later the same year! Thus I assume it has undergone some enhancement process or a better copy was found. It's actually quite a good and unorthodox western for the most part although the first half is a bit talky. Claude Rains is very good as the leader of the victimized farmers. Olivia de Haviland is as sweet as in her next film with Errol Flynn although she doesn't have a lot to do other than drool over George Brent the cast hero. He has affinities with both the farmers and miners thus would seem to be in the best position to try to settle their differences. He played a pivotal role in diffusing the warapparent between a large bunch of farmers and miners. However realistically his solution was draconian Using dynamite he blew up the log dam above the mining camp destroying the camp and drowning some miners including straw boss Barton MacLane as well as some farmers. Not considered is the probability that the resulting flood swamped some farms downstream. I just wonder how that segment was staged? Several reviewers complain about Brent's blandness for his role. pining for Errol Flynn. Yes Flynn would have made a more colorful hero but Brent was adequate........ Finally there is the matter of the inane title. Surely Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. Gold or Grain is short and to the point. Incidentally I understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills' waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.".

It takes place in the 1870s and has a narration at the beginning and end that tells us this was meant to be an important little epic for the Warner studio. Despite some solid scenes of mining operations and an agreeable enough cast that includes Tim Holt as de Havilland's brother Margaret Lindsay and Sidney Toler before his Charlie Chan days the story itself is a weakness guaranteed to produce yawns long before the rambling tale reaches an actionfilled finish. But by then you're not likely to be paying too much attention. Of all of the early ingenue roles de Havilland had at Warner Bros. this is definitely one of her weakest. It seems that when she wasn't playing opposite Flynn she had no real leading man. Charisma between her and Brent is sorely lacking.".

	schema:headline " One of Warner Bros. first Technicolor films it's definitely worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Michael Curtiz with a screenplay by Warren Duff and Robert Buckner this historical drama Western was one of Warner Bros.'s first Technicolor films. Not only does it cover a subject I had not seen previously discussed the harmful practice of using hoses to wash away entire hillsides to find gold but it's delightful to see so many known actors in color for the very first time. It also offers a change of pace from the cattlemen vs. the farmers stories! I'm not sure why this epic isn't as well known as some other later films like Duel in the Sun 1946 and How the West Was Won 1962 but it's certainly worth a look for anyone who hasn't seen it. There is quite a bit of narration at the beginning and some at the end which setup the story of California and explains the film's title.George Brent plays an engineer from the east who has come to California to help his employers mine gold from the hills. He's tough enough to hold his own against the gruff mine foreman Slag Martin Barton MacLane. Unfortunately because of the way the gold is mined the water used and the resulting mud from the process run down into the valley destroying the wheat crops of those who had previously cleared and tamed the land there. Chris Ferris Claude Rains owns one such plantation and is perhaps the wealthiest man around. Willie Best is inserted in some scenes obviously cast as one of the farm workers. His almost 17 year old daughter Serena the lovely Olivia de Havilland has begun growing fruit trees on her 50 acres. His older son Lance Tim Holt doesn't like working in the fields and instead wants to find a quicker way to riches. Enter Jared Whitney Brent who because he's tolerated by their gentleman father becomes Lance's best friend actually saves him his life in a barroom fight and Serena's boyfriend Jared teaches her irrigation!Later Chris will regret the growing relationship between her daughter and Jared and he works to stop it. Chris's brother Ralph John Litel sees the writing on the wall and decides to sell his land to Chris. His wife Rosanne's Margaret Lindsay father happens to be the man that owns the San Franciscobased mining firm that employs Whitney Harrison McCooey Sidney Toler. Later Lance goes to San Francisco himself to make his fortune. One of the most technicolorful scenes in the film is a tracking shot down a long bar filled with multicolored drinks. When Jared has an idea to improve production he travels to San Francisco where Rosanne tells her friend Molly Marcia Ralston hands off the attractive newcomer. Later Serena travels to San Francisco where she and Jared pick up where they left off much to the chagrin of the married Rosanne.When one of the wheat farmer's Russell Simpson home collapses because of a mudslide killing his wife  child the farmers gather together to discuss taking matters into their own hands and marching on the mines. Chris is able to calm the crowd at least temporarily saying that they should trust him the lawyers they've hired and the courts who are sure to decide that what the miners are doing much be stopped. Sure enough despite the miners' lawyer Robert McWade the judge order an injunction to stop the miners' activities until the California Supreme Court can review the issue. Jared who had expressed his concerns about what his employers were doing is fired and replaced with Slag Martin who issues rifles to his men and orders them to barricade the mine to keep the injunction from being issued. Lance volunteers to deliver the injunction but is killed by Slag's men in the process. Jared carries Lance's body back to the Ferris home where Chris is told that Jared had tried to stop the shooting. Despite Doc Parsons's Harry Davenport efforts Lance dies this prompts Chris's call to arms.Just before the farmers many veterans of the Civil War advance on the mine Jared pleads to Chris that there is another way. He convinces them to wait so that he can sneak into the mine steal some dynamite and blow up the dam he'd convinced his former bosses to build to improve efficiency. Slag sees what he's doing and tries to stop him. Even though Jared is wounded he succeeds in destroying the dam causing a massive flood that somehow doesn't destroy all the farmland below. Slag is killed in the process Jared rescues Chris. In the CA Supreme Court the judge Henry O'Neill delivers the verdict the miners don't want to hear  that their actions must cease because they're harming the farmers. Jared and Serena are shown together as the narrator explains that fruit exports will now become the gold of California.George 'Gabby' Hayes Clarence Kolb and Moroni Olsen also appear the latter two as Senators as does Charles Halton uncredited as one of Jared's employees an accountant I think.".

These experiences we claim to cherish but in reality we take them for granted forgetting that we are all mortals and that all love risks coming to an end in the most horrifying  yet inevitable  way  with the death of those we love.Filmed as something of a nightmare without ever getting flashy crisply directed with some wonderful performances  probably the most mature performance I've seen from Qi Shu.Excellent drama  but not a horror film. If you want your heart wrenched this does a good job of it If you want to be scared looked elsewhere.NOTE 2009 It took me a year and 11 months after the death of my own mother to get up the gumption to see this film again it is that strong. Now it has entered my top20 list of best films of all time. These images will haunt you for all time. And if you've ever wondered why you should pay respect to the woman who gave you birth see this film. It's like saying you don't like mom and having Gloria Steinem slam a fist in your jaw for saying so  and that's not bad. A feminist Phantom of the Opera one of the strongest scripts to be written in China over the past 30 years perhaps the strongest drama to come out of China in its decade. Powerful. Not a thriller sorry just a strong script and strong performances all around.".

When he is abducted the family bonds are pushed to the limits. And with a tragic past such as the one lurking in the ventilation shafts it quickly becomes a race of life and death.Storywise then The Monster is adequate but nothing overly memorable. But what makes the movie great is the extraordinary performances put on by Shu Qi playing the mother and Karena Lam playing 'the monster'. I am not overly familiar with the Work of Karena Lam despite having watched Hong Kong movies for close to 2530 years already. She really put on an amazing performance as a crazy woman.There are no super spectacular CGI effects in the movie but it doesn't need such to be interesting. The makeup on Karena Lam was quite good and served its purpose quite well.If you haven't already seen Cheang Poi Soi's movie The Monster then you should take the time to do so.I will say that the movie's DVD cover really doesn't do the movie any justice at all.".

The guy turns out to be a member of The HighRiders car and bike gang and after he takes off without paying the couple seek him out straight to the gang's hangout.Fortunately for them the HiRiders leader is a nice reasonable guy who suggests one final drag race for the cash. Mark wins and after some heated discussion Mark and Lynn join the HighRiders for some beers while Mark becomes good buds with the gang's leader.From then on the couple hang with the gang and the gang get into some big trouble when the tough guy who lost to Mark in the beginning races the son of the most powerful man in town and both die in a big crash. Then the man's father is out to get his revenge on the gang.There's a lot of action and never a dull moment. The direction is great and really keeps up the pace. And of course you see some great cars all over the place cruising drag races and car chases and even a chicken run with the gang leader's wild Dodge Charger! If your video store rents older releases look for this one because it's a Bflick that definitely never lets up. One of the best of it's kind!".

	schema:reviewBody "Just received the new DVD release of this Greydon Clark drivein movie goodie. I've been reading reviews of these type of Bmovies and actually watching videos of the movies for over 20 years now and believe me this number was rather obscure. I never heard of it until recently. But now it's available and fans of 70's action flicks are the better for it.This movie is very similar to the biker movies of around 196672 and I have seen almost all of them. Except here the biker gang is a hot rod gang. Because none of the cars are newer than 1971 and all the gang members are dressed the same as bikers this has a real 1972 vibe to it. I was very surprised to find out on the commentary track on the DVD that this film was actually lensed in the summer of 1977. The Farrah Fawcett hairdo on Lynn the lead female character should have tipped me off.The hot rodders race for pink slips with a local boy. The race gets out of hand and both parties blow up after hitting a handy dynamite shack at the side of the road. Great gag but come on! Did Wile E. Coyote live nearby? This is just a little too right out of a cartoon. Such cheesy elements only add to the fun to be had here actually.Anyway the local boy turns out to be the son of a local bigwig a scary dude who is retired from back East. Supposed to be Mafia? I'm not sure. But anyway the scary dude vows revenge. His wellpaid henchmen SPOILER ALERT! wipe out most of the car gang with only the two leads and their girlfriends left behind to go on the run and be shot at by justasscary rednecks in beatup pickup trucks. Our heroes regroup for a psychotically dangerous assault on Scary Dude at his house. Will they take him out and get revenge for wasting the brothers?? Anyway this is not Bergman. You folks know the drill by now. What you want from a movie like this is car chases gunplay and fist fights. And the occasional cute chick. And this movie delivers! Great stunts silly plot twists cool Seventies tunes awesome muscle cars and hokey dialog. I love it! If you liked Smokey and The Bandit or the original Gone in Sixty Seconds or Macon County Line or other car chase flicks from the 1970's then this is your cup of motor oil. And if you like those Sixties biker movies then this is a worthy addition to that canon. Silly fun.".

Then again his character is genuinely unpleasant. He seeks revenge on the gang for the death of his son which was pretty much an accident. Then again the film is probably just trying to show that rich guys like Lewis are all scum. A bit preachy considering our heroes drink and drive. Even so the cars are excellent. There's a Firebird a Dodge Charger and a Mercury Cougar all on display.Darby Hinton is good as Mark the latest member of the HiRiders and so is Wm J. Beaudine as HiRider leader T.J. according to IMDb this was the only film Beaudine ever did. If that's true it's a shame because he's very good here. I know Neville Brand was a big star in the 40s and 50s so I think it's a shame that he has a part here that could have been mailed in.The ending of the film is very abrupt though as the surviving HiRiders get revenge on Mr. Lewis for killing their friends but it just ends there. That said HIRIDERS is a very enjoyable picture and I'm glad to have seen it at long last. And I'm glad that a fellow IMDb user feels the same way about it as I do.".

But the way it was shot is well done and it shows Dean Cundey was camera man here and he moved further to the classic Halloween 1978. There are also a few common faces to recognise. Just watch the sheriff Mel Ferrer and his deputy Ralph Meeker but not only that the bartender is played by Neville Brand.But what made this flick notorious was that around the end of shooting a terrible accident occurred with Vic Rivers the stunt man. He died while driving a truck that was meant to fly off an embankment. But Vic undershot the distance and the truck flipped and crashed near the bank of the river.

It's got the lot Dudes burning rubber chicks taking their tops off teens getting blind drunk fat guys dancing cops being blown up.. and all in the space of 90 slammin' minutes!! This is totally the best film ever!! Rent it today!! It's bodacious peeps..COUTH COUGH oops sorry.. I lost control of my senses there for a minute I don't know what came over me. Anyway what I REALLY wanted to say was this movie sucks the big one. Every performance bar none is dire the muchhyped race sequences are rendered boring thanks to sloppy camerawork and the soundtrack is so loud and obtrusive it will have the climbing the wall in seconds.But what really puts the final nail in the coffin is the 'moral' which seems to be no matter how many people die in this little group as long as the survivors stick together.. nothing else matters because its all about 'street cred'. What a sad excuse for conformity and if the government wants to know why there are so many individuals out there who can't think for themselves and can only function as a unit my answer would be take a look at this screenplay and draw your own conclusions. 210".

This is totally the best film ever!! Rent it today!! It's bodacious peeps..COUTH COUGH oops sorry.. I lost control of my senses there for a minute I don't know what came over me. Anyway what I REALLY wanted to say was this movie sucks the big one. Every performance bar none is dire the muchhyped race sequences are rendered boring thanks to sloppy camerawork and the soundtrack is so loud and obtrusive it will have the climbing the wall in seconds.But what really puts the final nail in the coffin is the 'moral' which seems to be no matter how many people die in this little group as long as the survivors stick together.. nothing else matters because its all about 'street cred'. What a sad excuse for conformity and if the government wants to know why there are so many individuals out there who can't think for themselves and can only function as a unit my answer would be take a look at this screenplay and draw your own conclusions. 210";

It doesn't help that the quality of the print in existence is extremely substandard. The direction of the drag racing scenes of which there are many is awful and they look like stock footage. In fact I'm surprised they're so mishandled when director Greydon Clark went on to make the above average scifi chiller WITHOUT WARNING.The cast is eminently forgettable and the characters onedimensional. A few wearylooking faces show up in supporting roles Mel Ferrer Ralph Meeker and Neville Brand but fail to register. The plotting is lifeless and dull and the running time seems to drag on interminably until the blessed moment when the credits finally roll.".

It's the kind of film that would be difficult to make today as would for example Dial M For Murder.

And here we have finally exposed what the f.f. Is thinking and it's... not much. After 19 years of married life she concludes she never loved her husband and goes to find the men who swore they'd love her forever and find out what she's been missing.In other words it's another soap opera of the type that does not appeal to me. Mlle Bell has gotten everything she had bargained for and being unhappy feels no need to give up anything in the exchange for happiness.I suspect Duvivier felt the same way as I. He rarely seemed to like any of the women in his movies.Despite that I found this a very enjoyable movie because of the men she goes to visit. While some of them have depressing stories some of them have gotten on with their lives like Raimu Harry Baur and in a beautiful performance Louis Jouvet. The best of them have learned to compromise with their ambitions and have some satisfaction. The others not so much.".

Mlle Bell has gotten everything she had bargained for and being unhappy feels no need to give up anything in the exchange for happiness.I suspect Duvivier felt the same way as I. He rarely seemed to like any of the women in his movies.Despite that I found this a very enjoyable movie because of the men she goes to visit. While some of them have depressing stories some of them have gotten on with their lives like Raimu Harry Baur and in a beautiful performance Louis Jouvet. The best of them have learned to compromise with their ambitions and have some satisfaction. The others not so much.";

While trying to point some problems like terror and the social pressure the choices were too far from each other. If the story was focusing only on the migrating family it could have been much better. The gay issue didn't fit the whole movie at all and it looks like a patch trying to gain sympathy. So for the plot it is over exaggerated tragedy. Acting is good especially the main characters did a pretty good job. I am afraid I can't be that positive for the directing and technical aspects. The fighting scene was very clumsy. Overall camera usage was pathetic. This movie is an Oscar candidate by now. I don't think it has the slightest chance.

	schema:reviewBody "I Saw the Sun is a film of an ongoing tragedy that has claimed the lives of more than 50000 people which has left upwards of 22000 bodies gravely injured. While taking a stand against discrimination and othering of all sorts this film bravely tells the shattered story of the past 25 years pointing out warring fighting and despising what is different as the problem. The story told in I Saw the Sun was inspired by true stories and was shot in 6 different countries. Director Mahsun Krmzgl dedicated the film to hope peace and children. It was the greatest tragedy for Turkish and Kurdish brothers living in Turkey to kill each other after living together peacefully for 2000 years. Voicing his thoughts on the matter director Mahsun Krmzgl embarked on a journey to write the story of the ongoing reality of war. When he began writing the screenplay he wanted to tell all that people turned a blind eye to. The true story of a 100 year problem a 25 year war over 50000 dead 22000 critically injured 800 billion dollars spent Krmzgl's courage to voice opinions that no one else has dared did perhaps stem from his sensitivity. Writing and filming such a story was thorny at best in consideration of the current situation of the country. Born and raised in the East privy to the culture and the trials and tribulations of the area he began writing the screenplay drawing from his own experiences and weaving true life stories together. He drew attention to the 2.5 million dislocated people forced into obscurity to be ground in the cogwheels of large cities as the result of the mandatory relocation policy and shed light on their troubled lives. In his screenplay he deconstructed a Kurdish family in minute detail putting the lives of the Southeastern people on display. Creating the parent characters with one son in the military one a terrorist and another who lost a leg because of a landmine pretty much laid it all out there about the conjuncture of Turkey. The crux of the story where the tragedy laid was the parents who were caught in between sons who were a guerrilla and a soldier. Two Kurdish brothers that lived in Turkey have each gone to be warring parties. The despair of the father was the reflection of Turkey's quarter century despair. When writing about this family living in the East of Turkey the director also pointed out the poverty and the lack of education while emphasizing the naivety and sentimentality of those people their familial devotion and their respect for each other. The peaceful and joyful lives of the village people were disrupted and transformed from heaven into hell. Mahsun Krmzgl hasn't shied away from severe discourse against the state and the system and told his story through a critical eye. The character of transvestite Kadri is one of the most significant characters as far as storytelling goes. To conceive of such a character in such a conservative culture is in a way a proclamation of the elimination of prejudices and a call for liberty for all. This screenplay tackled the issue of homosexuality through a perspective that viewed it not as a choice but a way of creation. Kadri's story was also drawn from real life making an impact on the audience with its astounding final. The story of the Kurdish family going to Norway is also a tragic one where people find the solution of their problems in leaving their country after being repressed under unsolvable problems for a long time. The deal the family makes with human traffickers to go to Norway also offers the audience memorable cinematic pictures.Turkey is the crossroads for refugees and illegal travelers alike. Only 10 of the 2.65 million illegal travelers passing through Turkey en route to hope can be detected. In 2008 243 thousand people were caught in the process. Each year Asian and African refugees use this country to go somewhere else. In the film the Altun family calls for democracy by way of comparison between the democratized nations' standards of living and theirs. Mamo the main character in the film is a doting father. His interaction with his children makes for sentimental scenes. As the stories and characters come together and flow harmoniously toward the final the screenwriter reinforces his screenplay with statistical data and draws the audience in on the enormous dimensions of the situation thus taking the he impact to the highest level.".

	onyx:emotionText "Popular Turkish arabesque singersongwriter turned actordirector Mahsun Krmzgl The White Angel followed this sceptically received freshman melodrama with this equally sceptically received sophomore melodrama which topped the Turkish box office and took an unappreciated trip to the Academy Awards selection committee.Davut Altan Erkekli and Ramo Mahsun Krmzgl head two wings of an extended Kurdish family forced from their village by the conflict in Turkey's southeastern region with one resettling in Istanbul and the other attempting to illegally enter Norway as the driving force of this epic melodrama of interwoven story lines.Mahsun Krmzgl remains true to his arabesque roots with a demagogic central performance whilst more stoic support comes from veteran character actor Altan Erkekli O... ocuklari  Waiting for Heaven stunning starlet Demet Evgar Shattered Soul  Banyo and Yeilam awardwinning upandcomer Cemal Tokta Black Dogs Barking.The emerging director still suffers from the excess of sentimentality that lead his debut film to boxoffice success and critical drubbing but here he has a wealth of story lines worthy of his didactic style as his cardboard characters espouse messages of tolerance to a sweeping musical score that even the most cynical can't help but be moved by.You rarely ever see the sun here.";

	schema:headline " A Film About Duality";
	schema:reviewBody "This beautiful and touching film is about duality on so many levels. First there is the dilemma faced by a family that has one son in the army and another in the guerrilla movement... pitting brother against brother. I see this as analogy for the country as a whole the Kurds and Turks being brothers who are fighting each other. A third son has lost his leg as a result of the violence that their village is subject to on a daily basis. Even those who don't take sides end up suffering. Then there is the contrast between the father with five daughters for whom nothing is more important than having a son... and his wife and young daughters being very aware of his wishes which expresses with little tact or sensitivity... with the neighbor or relative who is more accepting of what life has given him and would welcome a daughter. When the villagers are forced to evacuate we see the juxtaposition of the family who goes to Norway with the one that goes to Istanbul. The migr family endures some hardships at the hands of the traffickers but ultimately makes their destination and finds asylum and hope for a comfortable who is to say what is better? life. The family in Istanbul experiences culture shock in a much more tragic way.. I won't reveal it here. Finally there is the issue of the transvestite son. I disagree with the person who said that it detracted from the film. It is in fact a major issue of the film and inspired the title. Although this does not become apparent until later in the film the seeds are planted early on. We see how this son had to keep his true character under wraps in the village and how even though still not accepted by his family he finds acceptance elsewhere ultimately learning to accept himself. Unfortunately this selfacceptance cannot survive his family's attitude.".

I also live in Europe and we all know that Norway is not paradise and has other maybe not financial or material issues but definitely social and pertaining to the Norwegian behaviour to foreigners problems.About its Oscarcandidacy Well the West does like topics like homosexuality political instabilities in a nonWestern country Oscar is quite political sometimes and especially the wellknown sunsymbolism. I don't know if Mahsun Kirmizigul also became part of the socalled Hollywoodinitiation but it can hardly be a coincidence that the sun is so emphasized in the movie.

Most people just wish to get on with their lives and have no time for nationalisms or 'isms' of other sorts. Indeed ask the transvestite character in the film and it's clear most of us have many of our own problems without taking on the burdens of others onto our own shoulders. Nonetheless humans cannot be divorced from the realities around them. Hence the individual who joins a political movement infused with the idealism of youth. Pitted against him is his brother who believes in the power and strength of the state to deliver services e.g. education and healthcare. As these two fight innocent farmers and shepherds who happen to live in villages in the battleground suffer. To suffer means economic destruction and even death. This is the story of one such family caught up in Turkey's Kurdish insurgency. Simultaneously the movie reveals the conservative and male dominated nature of rural Turkish society. It's a sad movie  prepared to shed tears. But 'I Saw the Sun' is a social statement which provides powerful insights for any student of Turkish society. The movie provides few answers but forces us to ask the right questions. A must watch for anyone interested in Turkish society. In Turkish with English subtitles.".

Turkey's resources must be used to improve people's lives and not to be used for more destruction.Finally a big thank you for Mahsun Kirmizigul and everyone who helped to make this movie especially the beautiful children for this eye opening experience.";

	schema:reviewBody "The film's title is suggestive as the sun alongside the fire is an ancient Kurdish symbol of the Yazidi religion also illustrated on the Kurdish national flag and thus symbolising freedom and enlightenment for the Kurds today. Thus seeing the sun means in other words liberating Kurdistan from the Turkish regime among the others. But interestingly the one character who literally sees the sun the homosexual boy is being killed. This I believe is a message to the Kurds and the core idea of the film that only in death will they get their freedom reminding us of the Turkish racism of a good Kurd is a dead Kurd. This Turkish association of Kurdish freedom and death was also used in the film Eskiya 1996. It is worth noting that the film was released in a time when the Turkish aggression towards Iraqi Kurdistan was at its peak. Some months earlier had the Turkish army walked in that part of Kurdistan under the pretext of fighting the PKK calling it Operation the Sun.Since the time of the creation of the Turkish republic in 1920s and the selling of Ataturk as a moderniser Kurdish culture has been portrayed as primitive and nogood hence happy is that is a Turk. In other words all will be done to make you unhappy if you insist on your Kurdishness and this film plays that part well. The Kurdish characters and families in the film are not unhappy because of the Turkish state in Kurdistan but because of their own culture illustrated among others by the fathers wish to have a son as opposed to a daughter and of their own people the PKK. Despite all the reports of human rights organisations on the contrary the Turkish army is portrayed as loving and caring with no option but to ask them to leave. This film makes no contribution whatsoever to the understanding and thus resolution of the complex issue of the Kurdish Question. On the contrary by dealing with it through the traditional Turkish racism and antiKurdism the film helps to prolong the Turkish colonialism in Kurdistan doing noone any good.".

In the Netherlands where it had it's premiere yesterday the rating is for over 5 year olds so that says enough for whom this movie really is. I was at first a little disappointed to find out that this is not a historical movie but a slapstick comedy but I loved the settings Venice and Vicenzawhere they made a scene in the famous Teatro Olimpico which is supposed to be a Venice University in the movie and the music which is mostly baroque Vivaldi Albinoni Hndel Rameau Paisiello and a few more and as a baroque music lover I thoroughly enjoyed the movie just only for the music alone. This must be one of the firstever costume farce movies but if you forget all the movies like Shakespeare in love or Pride and Prejudice and take this movie for it's own merits it is a thoroughly rewarding experience. There was a lot of laughing by the audience and I found myself laughing more than in any movie I remember. It is thoroughly entertaining from first to last minute but devout Catholics will find it insulting as it makes fun of the Catholic Church but it should be quite evident to everyone also devout catholics that the story is not to be taken too seriously so why being bothered by it? The movie can actually be considered as a modern version of an opera buffa. Obviously there is a romantic plot and by all the farce and hilariousness I would say that the romantic element gets snowed under but as said you have to accept this movie for what it is and concentrate on the lavish settings costumes music the fun and you will want to see it many more times like me.".

He establishes from the opening that this is just fun opera buffo with frequent sight gags and commedia dell'arte troupes and Punch and Judytype puppet shows broadly commenting on the action though it took four writers to stitch together the broad double entendres and winks at Shakespeare from appropriately Merchant of Venice to The Merry Wives of Windsor to Taming of the Shrew.Heath Ledger has grown up since he first demonstrated he had the light touch for romantic comedy in the teen version of Shrew 10 Things I Hate About You and he's much more confident now. One of the cute conceits of the film is that the women are the aggressors especially the virgins and novices. As the title character he modestly claims that his success is solely due to his ability to submit. While he's not particularly leonine in the frequent shots of him lounging on a divan he is dashing as he runs around Venice taking on several different mistaken identities. If his clinch with Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain wouldn't already qualify him for an MTV Best Kiss this year the big one with Sienna Miller could earn a nomination.Miller is a bit young for her role as a Portialike transvestite philosopher defending the rights of women but her youth makes her brash earnestness seem more charmingly nave. As her lively mother Lena Olin provides the older woman ballast without the usual sexstarved widow stereotypes.Oliver Platt should be signed immediately to do a major production of Falstaff as he deftly and physically plays that character type here a lard mogul representative of mercantile Genoa even more deliciously and sympathetically than he has in Ice Harvest and Huff.Jeremy Irons has fun playing the Inquisitor representing religious Rome whose purple robes fit right in at a carnivale masquerade ball.The look of the film helps enormously with the best use of Venice as a sensuously unique setting since Dangerous Beauty not just for the usual gondolas and canals but the steps plazas architecture roofs narrow streets alleys and the light. The wigs and costumes are wonderfully colorful.The marvelous stitching together of Baroque music keeps the mood merry with overtures and dances from eight JeanPhilippe Rameau operas six Italian composers including of course Vivaldi as well as snatches of Handel and Telemann added at appropriate water and fireworks moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't had this good a time at the movies sincesinceoh heck I can't remember when I've had this good of a time at the movies! This film opens with a touching surprise ends with a glorious twist and is filled in between with intrigue passion and some of the most beautiful scenery ever put to screen. Oh and did I mention humor  ranging from witty inside jokes to bawdy physical comedy.The screenplay walks a thin line between complexity and confusion but director Lasse Hallstrom never loses sight of the difference and is able to wring subtleties out of what could have been an overly broad farce.The story focuses on one aspect of Lord Jacomo Casanova's lavish life his reputation as a great seducer of women. Lots of women. Caught one too many times in the act with the wrong woman Casanova is told he must either leave Venice which he is loathe to do or marry a woman of good character. He is soon betrothed to one of the few remaining virgins in Venice but just as quickly falls for Francesca Bruni an auburnhaired feminist who wouldn't give Casanova the time of day. So to win her affections he proceeds to become several other people using false names to reveal his true feelings.Heath Ledger has no trouble living in Casanova's skin although for the first 20 minutes it was hard to see Casanova and not Heath Ledger in a rather large wig. However I blame that on my having seen too many behindthescenes specials and not on Ledger's performance. By the time he meets Francesca played by Sienna Miller I had settled into the story and never gave the wig another thought. Although there was not as obvious a chemistry between Ledger and Miller as he has had with other female costars most notably Julia Stiles 10 Things I Hate About You and Kate Hudson The Four Feathers I was quite convinced of their undying love for one another by film's end.The supporting cast is marvelous especially Omid Djalili who plays Lupo Casanova's manservant and Oliver Platt who plays Genoan lard merchant Lord Papprizzio Francesca's fianc. Lena Olin as Francesca's mother and Jeremy Irons as Bishop Pucci the Inquisitor give fine performances as well rising above their lessthanthreedimensional characters. Irons and Platt have an especially hilarious scene in of all places an Inquisition torture chamber which is only outdone by Platt's bravery in revealing his true size while lying halfnaked covered in lard mint jelly and coffee grounds.I had a blast at this movie and I can't wait to see it again.".

I came into the theater expecting a good movie and left the theater with my expectations having been surpassed.It was funnier than I thought but the humor was not all that made this movie excellent. Heath Ledger played the ladycharmer Casanova wonderfully showing insight into why so many women would fall for this man and how he escaped being caught before.This movie is rated R but with barely any reason for it  don't feel unable to bring your preteens to this film because there is no nudity only hints of sex scenes and really that is not the focus of this film. This film focuses on a man who had a superficial idea of love and how he discovers what true love is  and the adventures and trials he goes through in the discovery.All the actors did a great job in this movie in my opinion. The costumes are lovely the scenery lavish Venice and the dialog so enchanting the movie would not have been at all as delightful without such witty dialog.There is suspense in this movie as again and again you think that Casanova will be caught in his tricks and wonder at his ability to not be caught. The chase scenes are original the epiphanies and romance grininducing and the ending is absolutely superb.Go to this movie if you are not a historical nitpick and simply want to have a good time seeing a good movie. It's a fun one!".

	schema:reviewBody "The life of Giacomo Casanova has been chronicled before. This new take on the rake from Venice is best to enjoy when no comparisons with the real Casanova are made because this is clearly a comedy that has nothing to do with that man who was considered the best lover of all times.Lasse Hallstrom has directed a film with great sense of visual style. What seems to work best is the screen play by Jeffrey Hatcher and Kimberly Simi. We are taken to Venice at the time of the Inquisition but this movie being a comedy has nothing to do with the terror it caused on heretics and sinners.Casanova who has had his share of women is intrigued by the lovely and intelligent Francesca Bruni a young lady of not great wealth who wants to be a writer to be reckoned with. Francesca loves to disguise herself as man who is a scholar in order to participate in all things where she is not welcomed. Casanova discovers her secret and he casts his net in order to snare the beautiful Francesca.Things get complicated because Casanova has asked the hand of the blonde beauty Victoria the daughter of Donato a wealthy Venetian. To complicate things Giovanni Francesca's brother lusts after the beautiful Victoria from his window across the street. To make matters worst Francesca has a fianc who is coming into town for the winter carnival. Paprizzio the king of lard making in Italy is a rotund figure to boot. Since Casanova gets to him as he arrives he starts his own plan in disguising himself as Paprizzio in order to get to Francesca who detests Casanova.When the man in charge of the Inquisition Pucci arrives in Venice he makes it his priority to get Casanova who is too clever to get himself caught by the cardinal. Later though when everything is revealed Casanova redeems himself for taking the blame for having written the books that Pucci has deemed to be a heresy. At all ends well in a turn of events that save Casanova and Francesca from a sure death.Granted Heath Ledger doesn't make us believe he is the great lover Casanova but when we accept his pranks and schemes we don't mind he is not that Venetian rogue of history. Part of the blame seems to be that physically Mr. Ledger appears to be too young for the part. He does a good job under the director's orders. Sienna Miller makes a good contribution as Francesca Bruni.The surprise of Casanova is Oliver Platt. His take on the vain fat man Paprizzio is one of the funniest roles he has played on the screen in quite some time. Jeremy Irons is also excellent as Pucci the evil man that sees heresy and sin everywhere. Natalie Dormer and Charlie Cox do also good work as Victoria and Giovanni. Omid Djalili is fun to watch as Lupo Casanova's loyal servant.Casanova has a great musical score by Alexander Desplat who interlaced some of the beautiful music of the period with his own and it's a joy to hear it in the background. Oliver Stapleton's cinematography does wonders in creating the illusion of the Venice of the period. Jenny Beavan's costumes reflect the era in which the action takes place.While Casanova has not found the audience it deserves. That was clear from a recent viewing. Lasse Hallstrom deserves better.".

And please note that when I refer to Shakespeare I'm talking about the original plays not some stupid Kenneth Brannaugh romp.The plot weaves a wonderfully tangled web of lies misunderstandings and mistaken identities. The characters are just plain fun to watch. And director Lasse Hallstrm pulls off what so few people are able to do make a comedy that doesn't offend anyone. Well actually I think some Catholics may be offended at the uncomplimentary portrayal of the 18th century papacy but from what I know of history it's well deserved.But this leads me to another point. Don't expect history OK? A few reviewers seem to be upset by the poetic license Hallstrm takes. C'mon people it's a fantasy. It's no different from the film AMADEUS which trounces all over historical fact but gives us a fantastic dramatic fiction in return. I admire creative writers who can turn history on its ear.So yes this isn't the erotic decadent Casanova you may be expecting. In my opinion that portrayal is hackneyed anyway. This is a much fresher approach. So put down your history books and enjoy the picture already.".

The art direction deserves credit. Even though the sets look theatrical it fits with the presentation. The whimsical score adds energy. The editing is mostly good but the film does drag a little in the middle. In terms of story there isn't anything new which is the usual case with romantic comedies and I would have liked to see the love blossom between Casanova and Francesca after they find out each other's identity and also how Casanova resists his 'urge' to be with other women in order to be faithful to Francesca. The dialogues are witty and amusing. Heath Ledger fits the part and effectively pulls off the title role. Sienna Miller is unrecognizable but still pretty. She may arguably be a little too young for the part but is still vivacious and her youth adds to the stubbornness of the character. Lena Olin has a graceful presence. Oliver Platt is hilarious. The romantic track between Paprizzio and Andrea is among the most endearing and funniest moments. Omid Djalili is great as the sidekick. Jeremy Irons is good too. 'Casanova' isn't pathbreaking cinema but it would make for a good date movie or a Sunday nightrainy day film. It's colorfully vibrant. It's funny. It's nice to look at.".

It is just assumed that the moral or philosophical superior will win out and that will be the female. The man may win the woman but it is the woman who wins the battle of the sexes or at least this one skirmish. Well it is primarily a woman's genre. Anyway the feminism is all too apparent in CASANOVA it isn't sprinkled on but ladled on in big gooey globs and heavyhanded chunks. The fact that the story takes place in 18th century Venice in a predominantly Catholic country doesn't seem to bother the filmmakers who have given us a heroine Sienna Miller whose radical feminism would even give most modern day liberals a reason to pause. She doesn't just want women to have the right to go to the university she wants it known that men are a totally useless and unnecessary breed  then again maybe that is the universal female point of view. Hammering inappropriate contemporary politicalsexual radicalism into a period piece is nothing new heroines are almost always ahead of their times women who reflect the true mores of their era are almost always found in tragedies never comedies. But even accepting this the overt political ramblings in CASANOVA are just a little too much to bear. This story of the infamous lover is about how he loses his heart and his freedom not how he persuades young ladies to lose their virginity. A bit Shakespearean comedy a bit screwball farce CASANOVA is blessed with an intricate plot involving fake identities and ridiculous schemes. A loves B from afar but she loves Casanova who will marry her though he has fallen in love with D who is engaged to E but he is better suited for F etc. etc. It is all just silly and contrived enough to be raucous fun  or it would be if the screenplay hadn't fallen into the hands of Lasse Hallstrm a director with no notable history for rollicking comedy. What starts out to be naughty fun in the vein of Tony Richardson's TOM JONES or Richard Lester's THREE MUSKETEERS lumbers along with little sense of gaiety  let alone eroticism or naughty nudity. As Casanova himself Heath Ledger seems surprisingly bored with no trace of the legendary randy scalawag of the title on view. Ledger showed more roguish charm in the teen comedy 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU aptly a teen update of The Taming of the Shrew the play this film most wants to be. Indeed Bob Hope impersonating Casanova in 1954's CASANOVA'S BIG NIGHT managed to be not only funnier but sexier. Of the rest of the cast only Oliver Platt seems to be aware of the comedy potential of his character and just as he steals shamelessly from Charles Laughton he also steals the show.".

Dir Russell MulcahyRush and Davis give bold performances in this truelife account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.Athletic biographies and films about sports in general seem to keep audiences enthralled as they line up to see them rooting for the underdog and living vicariously through their triumphs as well as viscerally feeling their emotional and physical scars they accumulate in the long and winding road to success. In the latest truelife account the sport is swimming and the athlete is Australia's national champion Tony Fingleton circa the 1950searly 1960s beginning with his humble beginnings as the middle child of a family of five and clearly not his father's favorite as the story proceeds to illustrate just how blunt that fact is with some heartbreaking moments of just how difficult it can be to be a perfect athletic specimen but an absolute zero in the eyes of a loved one.Tony's bluecollar working class dad Harold a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer  tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winningistheonlythingthatmatters view in life has to face his failures every day he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young and regretting every moment thereafter in spite of his loving family and longsuffering wife Dora the ethereally haggard Davis equally topnotch in a semilowkey performance. His main cause of bitterness is apparently his son Tony's goodnatured loving self that only may mirror the phantoms of what Harold may have been or could have been and his reflection is only refracted back with disappointment until one day the young boy and his sibling John announce they can swim very well much to his surprise. Harold sees this magical moment as his ticket by coaching his lads gruelingly to stardom and becomes obsessed in their times by carrying his ubiquitous stopwatch at all times and having the boys go at the crack of dawn every day until they are young men equally scrabbling to make names of themselves and eventually to disembark their trappings for the real world.Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony as does Dellevergin as his younger version attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl and his younger counterpoint Davidson as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be. The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their preconceived stereotypes  alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife. Veteran director Mulcahy HIGHLANDER has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and splitscreens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through. Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton  based on his biography with his younger sister Diane  keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame. What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected sympathy for a loser and newfound respect for a winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "This true story of Australian swimmer Tony Fingleton is not your typical inspirational tale of rising above the odds to become a champion it is rather a tale about the real meaning of success.  Success is about realising yourself not the deeds you do or the medals you win.  For Tony this was a tough lesson to learn.The film is brilliantly directed by Russell Mulcahy who shows unusual restraint without losing his dynamic and unique style.  Some of his direction here reminded me of his work on Queer As Folk as he manages to stylise the action without sacrificing the emotional integrity of the screenplay which was written by Fingleton himself.  Although the film is set in the 1950s and 1960s Mulcahy refuses to become a slave to the period instead he utilises 21st century editing styles including the truly thrilling use of splitscreens for the race sequences and a terrific electronic music score to make this period tale utterly contemporary.The performances are nothing short of spectacular.  Jesse Spencer who plays Tony seems set for international stardom.  With the face of an angel and the body of a god he can hardly fail to make an impression  but he can really act as well!  He is ably supported by two of the greatest actors in the world today and they're both Aussies  Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush who play Tony's parents.  The story focuses on Tony's relationship with his father a very strained and complex relationship.  Rush's performance is probably his best screen work to date yes even better than Shine! as he creates a multidimensional being out of what could have been a cliched villain.  And Davis just keeps getting better and better as an actress. As the longsuffering mother she completely avoids cliche and invests the character with zest warmth love and anger.  She is dynamite!  Tim Draxl is also impressive as Tony's brother John  at once jealous and proud and Mitchell Dellevergin is perfect as the young Tony.  All the performances are excellent although I could have done without the comic cameo by Dawn Fraser which harms the emotional intensity of one very important scene.Perhaps the film hammers its themes a little too relentlessly but it's easy to forgive a film that has this much heart.  Given the right distribution I think this film will go on to great international acclaim and strong boxoffice.  Another Aussie classic to treasure!".

Both Rush and Davis deliver wonderful portrayals. According to the author who was on hand for the opening Geoffrey Rush did an eerily accurate job in his role as Tony Fingleton's father. All in all an excellent film that should be distributed more widely than it currently is.".

A packed house and an excellent QA session made this moving film a perfect choice to start the festival.As previously stated the casting was perfect with the distressed family members being portrayed in believable and engrossing ways. Both Rush and Davis deliver wonderful portrayals. According to the author who was on hand for the opening Geoffrey Rush did an eerily accurate job in his role as Tony Fingleton's father. All in all an excellent film that should be distributed more widely than it currently is.";

And yet through the violence and strife emerges the eventual best Olympic swimmer from Australia in his event. The movie was about the life story of Tony Fingleton whom I was fortunate to meet in person after the film. What an outstanding individual as he fielded audience questions with complete honesty and panache.His story is testament to the tenacity of the human spirit in the face of a troubled and abusive father. Yet despite it all emerges a positive and intelligent force. There was still a drive to improve one's mind despite a relentlessly critical father in the protagonist's formative years. The emotional family confrontations are not for the squeamish however it is a tribute to human optimism and accomplishment. I wish it were revealed a bit more about Tony's drive for education early on i.e. who inspired that aspect of his development? Geoffrey Rush's acting as the father is stark and striking. The images and messages of this film will stay with you for a very long time!".

This certainly had me and my wife talking mainly about the relationships issues that it generates particularly those between parents and their kids. I won't be recommending this to every friend but for those that I know that appreciate a movie that makes you think it gets my vote of confidence. My final comment regards Tony Fingleton himself.

So I bought the DVD of Swimming upstream and was really impressed by his actingskills. The story lacks a little tempo at times but the characters played by Jesse Spencer and Judy Davis are really coming to life very well. And the way I dislike Geoffrey Rushs character is proof of his good job either. Contrary to a previous review I read I liked the use of the editing machine during the swimming sequences just fine. The only thing that struck me was the music during those sequences that just was dramatic all right but way to modern for the time that movie played in. With a little more tempo this might have been a topleague drama but it still deserves to be better known and I will certainly recommend it to friends of dramamovies.I hope for Jesse Spencer to find more roles that bring out his talent and make him even better known worldwide. Its not often that good looks and talent go together Kevin Zegers is another fine actor that deserves to be better known....I still wonder why Tonys father disliked his own son that much...I wish no kid would have to live through something like that.

	schema:reviewBody "Swimming Upstream a satisfying Australian movie was shown on cable recently. Directed by Russell Mulcahy and based on a biography by Anthony Fingleton the film has a lot to admire in that even if it deals with sports in this case swimming but is basically a family drama.Harold Fingleton the brutish head of the family is a longshoreman struggling to maintain his wife and five children in Brisbane in the mid 1950s. Harold has a drinking problem. When he gets drunk he takes it on his wife or his children. Dora the wife gets her share of the abuse mainly because she sees in her son Tony a kind soul who she wants to succeed. Dora who attempted to take her own life is rescued by the children. That in turn makes Harold be meaner toward Tony who in his mind might be showing signs of homosexuality. As it is Harold was abused by his own mother's clients.When Harold watches the boys at the local pool he is amazed by the talent he sees in John and in Tony. He embarks in a quest to make both boys successful champions but he prefers John to be the one with all the honors after all he couldn't care less what happens to Tony. Ironically Tony is the one that is successful. When having the option to choose between going to the Olympics or taking a full scholarship at Harvard Tony chooses the latter.It's sad to see how Harold's own drinking affected the family. In spite of what one would have expected all the children turned out good especially Tony. Harold who eventually sobered up was never warm toward a son that really loved him and try to win all the contests he entered to gain his father's love.Russell Mulcahy delivered a great film that juxtaposes the successes of the Fingletons with the miserable life at home. Geoffrey Rush got one of the best roles of his career. He does incredible work in portraying the tormented Harold and making the monster that he was totally dominated by alcohol and hatred. Of course he had been scarred for life at an early age and took it on the innocent people that were most vulnerable his family.Judy Davis is also excellent as Dora. Although she doesn't have as much screen time as Mr. Rush Ms. Davis is always an interesting actress to watch. Jesse Spencer is fine as Tony as a grown man and Tim Draxl also excels as John. Kain O'Keefe impressed us as the bully Harold Jr. at the beginning of the film.An inspirational film made better by Russell Mulcahy.".

Based on a true story of one of Australia's many championship athletes this story is not merely another biopic although it was autobiographically written by Anthony Fingleton the subject of the film this is a story about large families of poverty about the tragedies that befall families husbanded by an alcoholic abusive father and about the ultimate triumph of the individual soul rising out of such conditions.Harold Fingleton Geoffrey Rush is a drunk a blue collar worker who has sired five children by a strong but enabling wife Dora Judy Davis a man whose focus on sports finds a possible escape from his joblessness when he discovers that his two middle sons Tony Jesse Spencer and the younger John Tim Draxl are able swimmers. For reasons unclear Harold focuses on John and while he relentlessly coaches both of the boys at the town pool every day he decides John is going to be the champion swimmer in Australia. Tony excels in the backstroke and eventually surpasses his beloved brother John's times and proceeds to win the honors Harold expected of John.Throughout this tale of competition in swimming we are privy to the competition within the home. Harold Jr David Hoflin is initially the bully yet gradually succumbs to his father's alcoholic lifestyle. Dora is beaten and abused yet is always there for her children eking out a living and soothing the flareup tantrums during Harold's drunken states. Tony and John cycle through periods of mutual adulation and the alternative fierce competition into which they are thrown by their father their evolving bond is unforgettably touching. When Tony at last reaches the peak of his swimming potential winning medals and applause form his countrymen he still tries to grasp the love of a father whose is so consumed by his own demons that he is unable to acknowledge Tony's success. Tony's eventual choice of leaving Australia for either the Olympics or for a scholarship to Harvard in the USA provides some of the most touching moments between the various members of this longsuffering family.The direction by Russell Mulcahy is keenly paced making excellent use of flashbacks to the significant moments in the family's history and electing to use the split screen technique to underline the tension of the swimming meets while focusing on the faces of the family. As Tony Jesse Spencer is both wonderful to watch he does his own swimming and he is a perfect physical specimen! and reveals acting gifts that are usually those of more seasoned performers. Indeed Rush Davis and Draxl also give spellbinding performances that are born of nuance and understatement. In a family where there could be polarization of response from the audience each of the actors is so fine that we are able to find the complete personas of these disparate people and find warmth and understanding for all of them.One wonders why this film was not heralded in the theatrical release as it is one of the finer movies to come out in years. Both Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis give outstanding award deserving performances. The DVD includes all of the 'deleted scenes' and it is highly recommended to view these important inexplicably cut moments as they truly enhance the film. Very Highly Recommended! Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " A Searing Look at What Can Push An Athlete To Succeed";
	schema:reviewBody "Swimming Upstream reveals an intense dysfunctional psycho drama behind a competitive sport. It is as moving about a macho male athletic culture here focused on swimming as Friday Night Lights was about football particularly as dysfunctionally fueled by alcohol.Geoffrey Rush gives a searing performance as an alcoholic patriarch who arbitrarily plays his sons against each other for his attention and approval.Judy Davis who usually masters powerful women here is memorable as a buffeted mother drained by caring for five children poverty and her occasionally violent husband.Claustrophobic family dynamics are wellcaptured particularly in showing how childhood experiences shape adults emotionally forever and what was once a refuge becomes torture.When the sons reach adolescence the screen is filled by blueeyed Jesse Spencer he's in a crewcut with rippling muscles in the pool so much that I didn't recognize him as the very clothed longish haired doctor in TV's House and the young men in small bathing trunks playing his brothers in heightened scenes of very physical sibling rivalry and closeness.The visuals and production design well communicate the bloke culture of Brisbane in the 1950's and early 1960's from the fading docks to the pubs to the locker rooms to the union halls that is brutally carried into the family.The shocked smile on Spencer's face as Tony Fingleton discovers a wider culture through his swimming heck with admiring women in it is heart warming as I thought that if someone doesn't give that guy a hug already I'll reach through the movie screen and do it myself.Russell Mulcahy's directing however frequently undercuts the power with unnecessary narration and gimmicky camera moves during intense scenes.The timetable as years go by is a bit confusing especially as annual tournaments repeat.".

	onyx:emotionText "Swimming Upstream reveals an intense dysfunctional psycho drama behind a competitive sport. It is as moving about a macho male athletic culture here focused on swimming as Friday Night Lights was about football particularly as dysfunctionally fueled by alcohol.Geoffrey Rush gives a searing performance as an alcoholic patriarch who arbitrarily plays his sons against each other for his attention and approval.Judy Davis who usually masters powerful women here is memorable as a buffeted mother drained by caring for five children poverty and her occasionally violent husband.Claustrophobic family dynamics are wellcaptured particularly in showing how childhood experiences shape adults emotionally forever and what was once a refuge becomes torture.When the sons reach adolescence the screen is filled by blueeyed Jesse Spencer he's in a crewcut with rippling muscles in the pool so much that I didn't recognize him as the very clothed longish haired doctor in TV's House and the young men in small bathing trunks playing his brothers in heightened scenes of very physical sibling rivalry and closeness.The visuals and production design well communicate the bloke culture of Brisbane in the 1950's and early 1960's from the fading docks to the pubs to the locker rooms to the union halls that is brutally carried into the family.The shocked smile on Spencer's face as Tony Fingleton discovers a wider culture through his swimming heck with admiring women in it is heart warming as I thought that if someone doesn't give that guy a hug already I'll reach through the movie screen and do it myself.Russell Mulcahy's directing however frequently undercuts the power with unnecessary narration and gimmicky camera moves during intense scenes.The timetable as years go by is a bit confusing especially as annual tournaments repeat.";

Brilliant performances by Judy Davis Geoffrey Rush and Jesse Spencer from Neighbours.Set in Brisbane this movie accurately captures life in Brisbane in the 50s. Unfortunately for us Brisbanites there's not many obvious  landmarks except for the very obvious Sydney Harbour Bridge when they are in Sydney. However the Fingleton home is a true Queenslander home and is very familiar.Unfortunately this movie did not do very well in Australia though it is good to see that it will be released in New Zealand next month.  Hopefuly it will also be released in the UK.It is very probable that in 6 months time the DVD release of this might do a little better than the cinema release in Australia.  That is of course if they make a DVD which I guess cannot be guaranteed given the lack of interest thus far.Although I'm not usually a fan of Dramas I try to see most Australian movies and this one is up there with the best of them.".

Of course much of the movie centers on the harsh reality of domestic violence  how this affects a family  in particular a son who didn't have the true support of his father. But the lasting message is one of victory over circumstances. The main character's mother once said to her son Are you as strong as I think you are? In the head. She got it right. He didn't need to be strong physically. But he had to have the inner strength to overcome all that he faced by having a selfish and sometimes cruel father.Some of my favorite lines in this movie...It's funny how the stumbling blocks of life can help make us better people. I never had the support of my father. But in the end that's what gave me the strength to seek something more than I could have ever imagined. You were always a fighter. Only you can make something of yourself. Not your father not me. Are you as strong as I think you are? In the head. You are my hero. Said to his mother".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1980's there was a long series of Australian films shown on British television  BBC2. After a long diet of Hollywood rubbish it was simply marvellous to see one excellent film after another. The films were mainly funded by public money and i suspect that there are few other countries were the public funding of a film industry has produced such a rich output of world standard. Certainly not in the UK where our native film industry is almost constantly swamped by Hollywood formula movies that dumb down the intelligence of audiences worldwide. in the UK just an occasional Brit's funded classic emerges from the mire. Swimming Upstream is a worthy successor to the Australian films of that early period and i commend it for your viewing without exception.It is the finest performance amongst many for Judy Davis. Geoffrey Rush is utterly convincing as the hard drinking hard thinking Australian father of two sons both with swimming ability. It is an open indictment of the traditional hard edged primeval machismo of Australian male society yet not without understanding and sympathy of that dog breeds dog condition. male brutality breeding male brutality goes hand in hand with indications of the impact of job insecurity and the poverty of families that result from such circumstances. This movie is an inspirational beacon of how sport and in this case swimming in particular can provide a release from such pressures. For some perhaps even a road to freedom and a sense of personal worth thus helping to breech the cycle of brutality associated with traditional male behaviour in Australia. Australia is still a world class producer of thinking mans cinema.".

It is an open indictment of the traditional hard edged primeval machismo of Australian male society yet not without understanding and sympathy of that dog breeds dog condition. male brutality breeding male brutality goes hand in hand with indications of the impact of job insecurity and the poverty of families that result from such circumstances. This movie is an inspirational beacon of how sport and in this case swimming in particular can provide a release from such pressures. For some perhaps even a road to freedom and a sense of personal worth thus helping to breech the cycle of brutality associated with traditional male behaviour in Australia. Australia is still a world class producer of thinking mans cinema.";

The traditionally emotional uninvolved alcoholic fatherthis movie took me back to my own childhood and I am sure many Aussies and New Zealanders can relate. Not only does this film reflect the life of an otherwise ordinary family who fought against extraordinary overwhelming odds. This film shows that dreams can become reality even for those of us needing to overcome extremely difficult situations.

Kevin Spacey is brilliant in one of his early roles. Mastrontonio and Kline are also very appealing. You like the characters and you care about them. However the second half of the film the thriller portion is so lame and unrealistic that I completely lost interest. It's as if the writers simply gave up on how to finish this film off. They created very interesting characters set up a nice story but the story didn't have anyplace interesting to go. I'd love for someone to try a rewrite of this thing.

Kevin Kline and Kevin Spacey play suburban neighbors who become unlikely friends then slowly descend into episodes of criminal mischief and debauchery.The picture starts off well enough. We're introduced to Kline and his wife Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and their musically gifted daughter. He's a composer of commercial jingles who appears to be placid and content in his boring uppermiddleclass ways. Then Spacey and his stunning wife Rebecca Miller move in next door and Kline's character is suddenly awakened Spacey is a real schmoozer a financial adviser with a sharp mind and an engaging personality Miss Miller is a bombshell and one can sense that Kline wants a piece of her. The tension and complications build until Spacey suggests to Kline a onenight stand of wipeswapping each man accosting the other's wife halfasleep in bed so they are unaware of the identity of the lover in theory anyway. Kline refuses but Spacey and the idea keep gnawing at him and eventually craving a scrap of excitement in his dull life he gives in. The final consummation between Kline and Miller is a lovely shot his bare body caught in shadows in front of a glittering windowdressing partially lit by street lamps. Unfortunately that's where the movie ends.A few hours later Miss Miller turns up dead bashed with a baseball bat and Kline having had sex with her is cast as the murderer. From this point nothing in the story appears to make much sense its as though the screenplay was flowcharted by a computer programmer. This happens then this then this. Human emotions are never considered and the movie becomes an actedout cartoon each actor assuming a caricature of something that fits a framework any chance for texture in the performances is completely destroyed.The plot is full of holes and sometimes in a truly suspenseful picture the audience is willing to overlook it. Not this time. It's all so bythenumbers you can virtually guess what will happen next even though you don't understand why. If the dead girl wasn't Spacey's wife then who was she? Why didn't Kline recognize her as a different girl when he rushed into the bedroom? Do all vapid blondes look that much alike? Why does Mastantonio immediately discount her husband's plea of innocence? so much for 14 years of marriage If she's so much happier with Spacey why does she agree to play the tape? I considered that she might toss it in the lake they were standing by but I knew she wouldn't. Then the computer program wouldn't run.There's not much to like about the performances in this thing. Kevin Kline it's been my longheld opinion is only good when he's acting up a storm. When he plays a regular person he's just boring he radiates very little presence to the audience. He's not a convincing Everyman as Jimmy Stewart was he's just dismal and you don't really care whether he clears his name or not. The boringness is not so evident in the first part of the film in fact it fits but once his life is on the line and he has reach to down deep for some reserve of passion it isn't there. He's not compelling enough to be The Man Caught in the Web he'd be lost in a Hitchcock picture. Kevin Spacey is superb in the early scenes as the sleazo Eddie and he gives the picture its only zing he has the right admixture of charm and smarm to draw you in and make you wary at the same time. But by the end he's just another psychotic killer and his eyes gleam freakishly like Nicholson's in The Shining. If there's such a thing as a cardboard cutout of a deviant this is it. Audiences may like Forest Whitaker's subdued performance as a polite southern gentleman sniffing out the scam he's like the Lovie Smith of insurance investigators but it belongs in another movie.A good movie could have been made from this material. From the crucial point of the wipe swap it could have been a character study on how lives are destroyed by this kind of selfindulgent behavior or at least a better thriller with Spacey leading Kline into deeper and more diabolical adventures. But Consenting Adults is straight from the textbook and a cursorylevel high school textbook at that.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHI've seen this movie a couple of times and have to admit I moderately enjoyed it even though it's got a lot of flaws. I think the all around premise is intriguing enough and the cast is great but somehow the movie loses it's way and doesn't make the impact it could though it always stays watchable.The movie had several really good ways it could have gone. It could have kept away from the whole thriller thing and just been a relationship movie concentrating on the couple swapping issue. It could have also gone in the Noir direction but as a halfway believable one. The problem with this movie is there are to many plot holes to count AND it plays sometimes like a horror film with all the try to scare tactics numerous plot holes and it just becomes to out there. It's disappointing because the central premise is really interesting.The cast is good with Spacey stealing the film and being the standout. But ultimately the movie is disappointing because it starts out so interesting with such a strong hook that it ultimately becomes a bit of a letdown just when it reaches the pinnacle of being at it's most interesting.The focus shifts from the multiple relationships of the characters and becomes just another thriller with plot twists and plot holes that make no sense. There's a point when one thinks they can actually start counting the plot holes because there are so many of them. I'm not saying the twistsor some of them aren't clever but things needed to actually make some sense to make this movie go beyond entertaining which it is into being a really good movie and that never happens.I could go into some of the plot holes but that would make this review way to long. I will use one example though and that's when a certain woman is supposedly murdered. Then a man is arrested for the murder. He begins to suspect she wasn't killed and eventually finds out she's alive a lookalike is killed. He goes to see this woman. They speak. Then she really IS killed. The same man is suspected of the second murder. But how come the police don't express any surprise that the second murder is the murder of someone who is supposed to be have already been murdered way earlier? Wouldn't the police react to that? Especially because the first woman who was murdered was identified by her own husband? Is this making sense to anyone? That's my Point. It still doesn't make sense to me. I actually did kind of like this movie. After all I've seen it more then once. But I couldn't help being disappointed overall. I would rather have watched a movie about the four characters and how they interact rather then just another thriller. Consenting Adults is absorbing though keeps one watching has a great cast and can even be watched more then once without losing the element of intrigue. Spacey and the rest of the cast in general elevate this and the writing with all it's implausibilities is clever. Ultimately my vote is 6.5 and if one likes psychological thrillers and doesn't mind implausibility this is your movie! 6.5 out of 10.".

Surprised at the two KevinsKline and Spaceywhom I usually enjoybeing in this dud. The story line was highly implausible the acting was terrible the cinematography so unfocused that I can't believe this boring little blunder was even made. Even the singing was terrible. Kevin Kline's character in it's own way was almost as low as Spacey's especially with the sneaky wife swapping part. After he has his way with the supposed Rebecca Miller character he sits at his kitchen table next morning and tells his wife he loves her! Yeah right! Mastrantonio's character left a lot to be desired in the way of integrity such as the way she leaped at accepting the fraudulently acquired insurance money and then acted selfrighteous defending Eddie for having the nerve to fight to get the cash. She did look very pretty however. If the Rebecca Miller character was a bombshell why was she shot usually at fuzzy distances never in a sharp closeup except in the end in the dark when her face is mostly concealed by a ridiculous red wig? Her bathtub scene was hilarious especially when she rose from the water with her butt to the camera and put on her robe just standing there. Her attempts to look sizzling in Kline's voyeuristic eyes only made her look like she had cramps. Her performance was moribund and Kline's ran a close second for morbidity. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and only the wellgrounded talent of Spacey and Kline saved their careers in its aftermath. Spacey does get good marks for the diabolical expression on his face when Mastrantonio is trying to flee the beach house flings up the door thinking he is gone and there he is in all his evil glory hiding in the closet. That's about the only good thing I can say about this flick.".

That's what blows me away. Eddy is charismatic and he's supposed to be charming and with Kevin Spacey in the role he comes damn close. But he comes off as loud obnoxious and overbearing. I know guys like Eddy. I don't let them anywhere near my fiance because I know they're going to hit on her and I don't make them my friends because I know that they'll stick a knife in my back the moment it suits them. I suppose the fact that I recognize the guy is a testament to Spacey's acting which is not surprising but if we're supposed to believe that Richard fell for his nonsense it's help if he were a little less of a jerk. Kevin Kline dozes his way through playing Richard as a spineless schmuck dealing with a midlife crisis which unfortunately just happens to involve Uzis and bloodied baseball bats. I've never seen him look so bored. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is a shrill henpecking banshee as Priscilla. And Rebecca Miller is essentially playing a battered wife.Y'know I take it back. I don't just know guys like Eddy Otis I think I actually know Eddy Otis. And his poor wife. I just hope they don't turn on me.

The thing is neither Kevin the actor or Richard the character seem to know that Richard is stupid and the people around him including the film's director don't know it either. You want to pull for Richard because of what's happening to him but he just keeps reacting in such an inane way and digging his hole so much deeper that it's hard to care.As far as Kevin Spacey goes didn't his SEVEN character present himself as less of a psycho at least on the surface? Apparently Priscilla isn't much smarter than her husband and the local police don't have much more going on than either of them.This climax tries hard to create the mood of suspense in PLAY MISTY FOR ME or FATAL ATTRACTION but by that point after ninety minutes of watching these annoying people create their own hellish situations why would it matter? Of course the villain is even more annoying than the would be heroes so you probably won't want to root for him either.It's difficult to remember when any of the three leads played less charismatic characters. If this film had been made in 1945 I might have cast Lou Costello Bela Lugosi and and a leading lady more inept and annoying than any that I can think of off the top Jean Stapleton wasn't working yet at that point was she?. Better casting choices today might be George W. Bush Dick Cheney and Theresa Heinz Kerry. You can figure out who would play which character based on everything I said.".

She knows Spaceys alibi is fake therefore she must also know he is the real killer. Why else would he lie to the police? There's no other reason. I can't understand why Kline tries to win her back in the last half of the movie nor how they could have been married for years. She is a woman who doesn't give a damn about him when he's thrown in jail she turns her back on him she is more loyal to a complete stranger and she leaves him for the closest guy around. Why would you want such a woman back? And what exactly is the evidence that proves kline killed that woman? That he had had sex with her? That is another thing I don't understand about this movie. If they could see that he had had sex with her before the killing that must mean that he slept with the real wife the wife he never got to know since spacey introduced him to olivia kamen instead.  So then either he is so stupid that he doesn't notice that he is having sex with a woman he never met  the woman is equally stupid for not being surprised by a total stranger surprising her in bed.  I guess I have to watch the movie again to find that out or maybe someone here have written something intelligent about that.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Consenting Adults will teach you two essential things about sex thrillers.1. They need to have some sex in them.2. The hero can't be by a country mile the least interesting character on screen.Richard and Priscilla Parker Kevin Klein and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are a married couple living in one of those suburban heavens of the early 1990s. Richard composes commercial jingles while Priscilla handles the family finances. They've got a huge house on a cul de sac and a daughter who spends most of her time away at school. Everything seems fine until Eddie and Kay Otis Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Miller move in next door. Eddie is a big talking hustler and Kay is a lovely but wistful wannabe lounge singer. The two couples become fast friends until Eddie gets a little too insistent on wanting to do a little wife swapping with Richard.That ends the relationship but the story suddenly informs us that Richard and Priscilla aren't the relatively happy couple they've appeared to be so far. We're supposed to accept that they are desperately unhappy and in need of the spark provided by their next door neighbors. That leads Richard to assent to Eddie's idea and they slip into each other's home one night to have halfasleep sex with the other man's wife without her realizing it. The next day Kay turns up beaten to death with a baseball bat and Richard finds himself framed for the crime. He's thrown into jail Priscilla leaves him and he's stuck with an irascible lawyer E. G. Marshall who thinks he's guilty. Richard gets out on bail meets an insurance investigator Forrest Whitaker who's the only other person to suspect Eddie of misdeeds and sets out to uncover Eddie's plan and get his family back.Everything about this movie says it's supposed to be a sex thriller. The title the DVD cover the first 30 minutes of the film they all make you think that. I even remember the TV ads for this movie when it was in theaters and those made you think it was a sex thriller. But aside from three naked butt shots including a sideways look at Kevin Klein's ass there is no sex in this movie. In fact the only genuinely sexy aspect of Consenting Adults is the real estate porn it shows off. There are a lot of great looking homes and property put on display but if you're looking for any arousal involving human beingsyou'll be out of luck.Compounding that weirdly fundamental flaw Richard Parker is not just the least interesting character in this film he's one of the least interesting characters in any film I've ever seen. Anyone who's seen him in other work knows Kevin Klein is very talented but Richard Parker is just a flat block of wood. Every other actor in the story is allowed to inject a little or a lot of personality into their roles but for some reason the director didn't let Klein do a damn thing with his performance. What makes it worse is that after the murder occurs Richard becomes the only character the story really focuses on. You cannot build any tension in a thriller if the hero constantly facing danger could get killed and no one in the audience would care.If the collapse of the housing market has left you anxious for some real estate porn or you'd like to take a gander at Kevin Klein's behind this is a movie for you. If you're looking for something to excite and thrill you instead of bore and frustrate you don't consent to renting Consenting Adults.".

	schema:reviewBody "To those who say this is Hitchcokian...then you're that familiar with a Hitchcock film. Hitchcock would have had MUCH better pacing. The set up here was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. I had thought this was just about wifeswapping so I'm glad I stuck with it...but the only reason I stuck with the long first half was that I really like Kevin Kline and Kevin Spacey.And that's just for starters. Too many machinations to be plausible. That's where the too clever for its own good comes in.Is there a saving grace? Yes. Stellar acting from Kline and Spacey. It was still a couple of years before Spacey hit his stride with The Usual Suspects but he deliciously evil in this film. Never trust a man who wears white shoes! Did Kline ever hit his stride? I think not. Instead he had a nice steady career. But he's great here. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is very good as Kline's wife.Do I recommend this film? With strong reservations. If you don't generally enjoy Kline and Spacey I'd skip it. But if you're a fan you'll probably like it. Just don't really expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat. It's not that suspenseful.".

The set up here was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. I had thought this was just about wifeswapping so I'm glad I stuck with it...but the only reason I stuck with the long first half was that I really like Kevin Kline and Kevin Spacey.And that's just for starters. Too many machinations to be plausible. That's where the too clever for its own good comes in.Is there a saving grace? Yes. Stellar acting from Kline and Spacey. It was still a couple of years before Spacey hit his stride with The Usual Suspects but he deliciously evil in this film. Never trust a man who wears white shoes! Did Kline ever hit his stride? I think not. Instead he had a nice steady career. But he's great here. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is very good as Kline's wife.Do I recommend this film? With strong reservations. If you don't generally enjoy Kline and Spacey I'd skip it. But if you're a fan you'll probably like it. Just don't really expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat. It's not that suspenseful.";

Kevin Kine is supposedly in a happy relationship with his wife played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio but all hell breaks loose when Kevin Spacey's character sets his new friend up for the murder of his wife so he can collect on a heft insurance policy. Does the criminal justice system in America really let a man who is about to stand trial for a brutal murder out on bail? Do they then let him wander unsupervised wherever he pleases? This movie started out great the way it established the growing friendship between two very different couples and then moved into a murder mystery. The acting was firstrate with the exception of Rebecca Miller can we say boring? but then the plot defied logic. Further it is completely unrealistic that a shattered Kevin Kline's wife would have so immediately taken up with Kevin Spacey. By the time the film ended it felt like a comedy it was so ridiculous! Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Alternately hilarious and frightening Streisand is always mesmerizing as she delves so far into character.Richard Dreyfess is nothing less than Streisand's equal as her public defender.

The supporting cast is a topnotch ensemble of professional character actors Maureen Stapleton Eli Wallach Robert Webber James Whitmore and Karl Malden all of whom work their craft flawlessly. NUTS' screenplay does indulge in the predictability of some of the typical courtroomplot conventions a little too often but Toplor's absorbing script still deserves high praise for it's fascinating exploration of what constitutes as normality and whether or not the insane should be required to receive treatment. NUTS isn't going to win over any fans of 3cutspersecond action films but it will leave lovers of thoughtprovoking expertlyacted dramas fascinated.".

The only problem with the casting is Leslie Nielsen as a crazy client. Nielsen became so associated with spoofs like Airplane and The Naked Gun one almost laughs automatically when he's on the screen no matter how serious the scene is. Stars Richard Dreyfus and Barbara Streisand are at the top of their form and work well off each other.The one criticism of this movie that is valid is Streisand's age. She is a bit too old at 45 for the character who is supposed to be in her late 20's. It is a minor irritation and we should remember that male actors in their 40's also frequently play such roles. For example Brad Pitt was 41 when he played Achilles and Sylvester Stallone was 60 when he played in his last Rocky movie.This is Barbara Streisand's grittiest movie with rape incest and madness being key themes yet it still has a lot of witty lines and funny moments. It is just well balanced and well done. The DVD contains some fascinating commentary by Ms. Streisand.".

The story is developed practically in one location but the performances are awesome highlighting Barbra Streisand. This actress deserved at least a nomination to the Oscar. The conclusion has a corny moment when Claudia hugs her mother. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Querem me Enlouquecer They Want to Drive me CrazyNote On 12 Nov 2018 I saw this film again.";

	schema:reviewBody "After viewing this superior film a viewer might wonder where in blazes the original idea came from The Twilight Zone or ripped from todays headlines. This film is laden with so much talent I'm surprised it didn't establish itself as a mega movie. The premise is that of a talented lawyer Aaron Levinsky ably played by Richard Dreyfuss who is forcibly thrust into a competency case which he does not want. His adversary is a formidably D.A Francis MacMillan Robert Webber who has spent a considerable amount of time putting unwanted criminals and mental undesirables behind bars. Thus he sees no reason why he should spend more time than necessary on a simple case of mental incompetency. Unfortunately for him the woman in question is spirited independent Claudia Draper Barbra Streisand who is desperate to have her day in court. Arrayed against her aside from the D.A. are her loving parents Karl Malden as Arthur Kirk and Maureen Stapleton as Rose Kirk who guard a terrible family secret. In addition there is formidable Eli Wallach as Dr. Herbert A. Morrison a psychiatrist who is convinced that Draper is insane. In Claudia's eyes everyone seems hell bent on having her locked up in insane asylum. The courtroom drama is superior as Judge Stanley Murdoch James Whitmore  tries to discover why the authorities want Draper incarcerated. A most convincing performance by all to create a memorable film. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most issues in life the question of sanity vs. insanity isn't nearly as cut and dried as it might seem on the surface. And Nuts is a film which definitely dives beneath the surface and brings up some intriguing issues.Nuts is based on the true story of Claudia Draper Barbra Streisand a high priced call girl who killed a john Leslie Nielsen in self defense. The facts leading up to the murder are told in flashbacks that leave little question as to the nature of the killing. It's the aftermath that is both surprising and disconcerting. Claudia's mother Maureen Stapleton and step father Karl Malden wishing to cover up any embarrassment over the crime decide to have Claudia declared criminally insane. While Claudia doesn't wish to have this happen her general paranoia and lack of cooperation don't help her case much. When she breaks her attorney's nose for not doing what she wishes she is indeed institutionalized pending further evaluation and another hearing. Her court appointed attorney Aaron Levinsky Richard Dreyfuss also finds her less than cooperative but ultimately comes to agree that she shouldn't be declared insane. However with Claudia as a client Levinsky has his work cut out for him as they try to convince Judge Stanley Murdoch James Whitmore that Claudia shouldn't be institutionalized for the rest of her life.This is a fascinating story told with a great deal of skill. While Claudia does seem insane at first  violently so  as the film delves into her background and the events leading up to the murder the audience discovers a very intelligent very disillusioned woman. Her disillusionment has turned her both cynical and abrasive. She trusts no one because those she has trusted have repeatedly let her down or even abused her. Nonetheless in order for Claudia to win her freedom she must learn to trust both Levinsky and Murdoch. Her growth as she begins to do so is most satisfying to watch.Streisand turns in another excellent performance showing both her skill and her range as an actress. Her portrayal of Claudia shows the many facets of the character with astonishing skill. Dreyfuss also turns in his usual skilled performance as a lawyer who becomes more passionate about the case the longer he is involved with it. His eventual concern for Claudia is touching. Stapleton does a nice job of showing a woman who blinds herself to what she doesn't want to see only to be forced to face it and realize the damage she has done. Her regret is skillfully portrayed. Malden gives off a smarmy arrogance that is perfectly appropriate to his character only to reveal a pitiful sort of vulnerability when the mask is stripped away. Whitmore does a wonderful job maintaining control in a situation that frequently threatens to get out of control. And Elizabeth Hoffman's cameo is amusing and skillfully done.This is a disturbing film and not one that is for the faint of heart  or even not a Streisand fan. Strangely there was also a great deal of criticism for the fact that Claudia is not a nice character. But the point the film makes is that Claudia's only reward for being nice was to be mistreated. It's small wonder that she's not nice. Still this movie is a skillful portrayal of her story and she does become a sympathetic character by the end of the movie.Overall a thought provoking film and one that gets better with repeated viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERSA top notch cast Barbara Streisand Richard Dreyfuss Eli Wallach James Whitmore Maureen Stapleton and Karl Malden star in this excellent courtroom drama about a high priced prostitute who is declared mentally ill and unfit to stand trial for manslaughter.Claudia Draper Streisand lives in a plush condo on 66th Ave. in NYC. She dresses in elegant apparel wears minimal but lovely makeup and meets nice looking businessmen in fancy restaurants. She's not your typical hooker. She doesn't have sleazy tattoos she doesn't wear cheap miniskirts and KMart boots like Julia Roberts did in PRETTY WOMAN. She doesn't shoot up with heroin. She doesn't hang out on corners and drink malt liquor and try to wave down cars. You'd never know she was a hooker because she doesn't fit the traditional description. Her MO is different. She had no pimps telling her what to do. She chooses who she will have sex with preferring soft candlelight and sexy piano music and champagne to a smelly alley littered with needles or diesel trucks smelling of sweat and dead chickens. Believing herself to be of the highest quality among sex workers she charges big money for her time and that is how she lives how she pays the rent and bills. She didn't run away from home at age 14 and fall prey to deviants she divorced her husband and went into the age old profession by CHOICE.For these very reasons I have a bizzare facination with Claudia Draper. I admired her for being who she wanted to be and not giving a damn what anyone thought about it. She doesn't seem to have a problem with it morally and she's a grown woman anyway. And she's not had any serious problems with clients...until one night when a client steps over the line and tries to treat Claudia like she's his wife acting proprietary then menacing.Claudia ends up facing manslaughter charges and because her profession is such a scandal and disgrace to her parents Stapleton and Malden she finds herself fighting with everyone about whether or not she is able to stand trial. She's a prostitute so surely she's crazy. What sane respectable woman would choose to do what she does for her living??? Her parents who don't want her destroyed in an open trial demand that she be locked up in a mental ward. They insist she's mentally sick and her psychiatrist Wallach agrees and wants her deemed insane and hospitalized. Claudia passionately disagrees with everyone's opinion of her mental status and would rather go to trial and even to prison. Her dignity and choice to not take an easy way out was another feature I admired. She admits she killed someone and that it was in self defense. She didn't kill someone because she had been slowly breaking down because she was a call girl. Her lawyer Aaron Levenski Dreyfuss is the only one who seems to listen to her and hear what she has to say. Everyone else ignores her and talks to her as if they are talking to a dog who won't do tricks on command. Family dysfuntion thrives in this woman's history  but as Claudia asserts It's not relevant to what's going on here. And she's right. She's had some bad things happen to her but she doesn't want a pity party she doesn't want to be tucked neatly away so that people don't have to look at her and accept her and realize that some people lead lives different from ours. Everyone is so busy hating her because she's a whore call girl hooker that they WANT her out of their sight so she won't BOTHER them anymore. Sometimes the most benevolent looking people are the worst of all and like many families Claudia's hides its secrets. If they can deny it long enough maybe it will go away. If they put Claudia away maybe their own guilt will go away.Stapleton had a line that made me think really hard A divorced woman is an easy target. She's vulnerable to any polite man who comes along. Hmmmm....A very well executed psychological legal drama with good writing and great acting by all. A!!!".

It hits all the right PC notes a stepfather who is a sexual predator an alcoholic mother who maybe unwittingly pimps out her daughter for security a physically abusive husband not to mention the lawyer who wants to get rid of her quickly the other lawyer who risks everything for justice the uncaring hospital administratorpsychiatrist who ... well I'm sure you're getting the picture.  The most egregious is when the WASPy lawyer and psychiatrist get their panties in a bunch when she starts talking about sex and prostitution as if they've never dealt with it before.  All we're missing here is a learning disorder.All of this is mere prologue for Streisand to strike a blow for feminists by declaring that her life choices are her responsibility true and that they want to label her as crazy and lock her up forever because she's dared to do things that men don't like and they're afraid of her power huh?.  Maybe it's symbolism but it's laid on very very thick and Streisand's tendency to overact doesn't help.The result of all this contrivance is that the story feels false the characters feel false and a good deal of what goes on in the courtroom isn't at all realistic.  James Whitmore as the judge gives the most realistic performance but it's not the actors  it's the script itself. People contradict themselves in ways inconsistent to their characters.  For instance Karl Malden as the stepfather makes a very incriminating contradiction on the witness stand.  Would a man who had successfully hidden his abuse of his stepdaughter for 20odd years suddenly crack under 5 minutes of unremarkable questioning?  Not likely.  Would a psychiatrist who had testified in hundreds of hearings admit any personal bias by accident as shown here?  Not likely.However there are some good performances that definitely lend tension to the movie and even though this has very obviously been adapted from a stage play it avoids that flat almostvideo look that so many movies from the 80s tend to have.  It's watchable but not remarkable  I gave it a 6.".

As this movie portrays it just as many other politically astute movies have done in the past the depiction of psychologically inappropriate behavior will appear like behavior which merely lacks a little decorum.. Comprehension of knowing the drill so to speak is a charade of devising clever little euphemisms for sweeping everything under the rug!! The omnipotent ye old faithful American twenty dollar bill became the proverbial picture that speaks more than 1000 words.. Also it does a heinously effective job of concealing virtually everything!! This whole covert arsenal for cognitive dissonance was the convoluted perspective that the film Nuts presented to the movie audience!! Nuts portrays the mental ward that Claudia Draper was facilitated in as a domicile for derelicts with sexual obsessions and deliberately violent mannerisms!! When somebody tells you to grow up and just act like an adult frequently these are platitudes for telling you that you should avoid telling the truth!! Such an articulation of this poignant characteristic of human behavior puts this film in an auspicious category all by itself!! Barbara Streisand played Claudia Draper and her home life was relegated to a precariously comfortable arrangement.. The haunting scene encompassing a deliberation hearing with relation to a trial for a capital crime became a stilted side show for unearthing all of Claudia Draper's domestic intricacies!! Reveille with the prevailing situation in Claudia's home life brought out a few major skeletons in the closet! The only unrealistic aspect to this movie is that no public defense attorney is going to engage in complex guessing games to vindicate his client in the manner that Richard Dreyfuss' character did!!! In evaluating the trial in this movie it was a case of insolence and temerity trying to run roughshod over a vulnerable spawn of an emotionally neglected household!! Cannon fodder for the prosecution included the exploitation of Claudia's very sordid occupation!! The prosecution also pinpointed many corroborating nuances of Claudia's which wound up compounding her overall predicament!! In particular they The prosecution and her psychiatrist dwelled on her extremely non conventional actions!! The indelible impact a tragedy will have on an innocent teenager can definitely devastate her!! Depraved sexual fixations which are motivated by relentless testosterone driven theatrics became a perpetual culprit for violence and lewd debauchery in this movie!!! Orchestrating a cerebral quagmire as a subterfuge for the nonegalitarian justification of your basic carnal desires translated to the step father's self serving interests!! These interests manifested themselves as a gargantuan debacle which became an egregious societal burden!! What that means is that thousands and thousands of tax dollars were squandered on the burden of proof for coping with the end result of some lecherous curmudgeon's obstinate recreational activities!! These activities delved into the lustfully demented aspects of the taboo!! Circumstantial evidence seemed to habitually solicit more social acceptability than did exculpatory facts!! This was the summon substance of Claudia Draper's dilemma!! To say that Claudia Draper suffered from cerebral inhibitions and a lethal taciturnity would be a masterpiece of understatement!! If everything were just a case of black or white whereby a professional psychiatric evaluation becomes the final decree Claudia Draper would have been dead in the water from the offset!!This movie has an amazing amount of top notch acting talent!! It stars Barbara Streisand Richard Dreyfuss James Whitmore Eli Wallach Lesile Nielson Karl Malden and Maureen Stapleton!! The intensity of emotions and agitated responses in this movie was utterly spellbinding!! By 1987 it was time to bring out a film which was intellectually riveting!! The happy go lucky disposition of the 1980's was fine however on occasion a film should elaborate on real life instances of trauma regardless of the way the wind is blowing in the American Cinema's mindset during a given era!! I found this film to be excellent with regards to it's portrayal of mental disillusionment!! When someone is barraged with questions there is nothing wrong with deluging the curious party with a bunch of candid answers!! This is my basic interpretation of the film Nuts. My assessment of Nuts is that it is AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS MOVIE!!!!".

Orchestrating a cerebral quagmire as a subterfuge for the nonegalitarian justification of your basic carnal desires translated to the step father's self serving interests!! These interests manifested themselves as a gargantuan debacle which became an egregious societal burden!! What that means is that thousands and thousands of tax dollars were squandered on the burden of proof for coping with the end result of some lecherous curmudgeon's obstinate recreational activities!! These activities delved into the lustfully demented aspects of the taboo!! Circumstantial evidence seemed to habitually solicit more social acceptability than did exculpatory facts!! This was the summon substance of Claudia Draper's dilemma!! To say that Claudia Draper suffered from cerebral inhibitions and a lethal taciturnity would be a masterpiece of understatement!! If everything were just a case of black or white whereby a professional psychiatric evaluation becomes the final decree Claudia Draper would have been dead in the water from the offset!!This movie has an amazing amount of top notch acting talent!! It stars Barbara Streisand Richard Dreyfuss James Whitmore Eli Wallach Lesile Nielson Karl Malden and Maureen Stapleton!! The intensity of emotions and agitated responses in this movie was utterly spellbinding!! By 1987 it was time to bring out a film which was intellectually riveting!! The happy go lucky disposition of the 1980's was fine however on occasion a film should elaborate on real life instances of trauma regardless of the way the wind is blowing in the American Cinema's mindset during a given era!! I found this film to be excellent with regards to it's portrayal of mental disillusionment!! When someone is barraged with questions there is nothing wrong with deluging the curious party with a bunch of candid answers!! This is my basic interpretation of the film Nuts. My assessment of Nuts is that it is AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS MOVIE!!!!";

It's the household psychodrama between patient and shrink except here a lawyer does the evaluating. Dreyfuss plays this intersection between Perry Mason and Sigmund Freud Aaron Levinsky courtappointed to represent Claudia Draper a call girl who killed a john. The exhaustingly hostile Claudia longs to be tried but the court is about to pronounce her mentally incompetent to stand trial. The judge played with truthful and temperate keenness by James Whitmore certainly merits that available seat on the Supreme Court. Seasoned and resolute as he is the judge questions how this smart wellheeled girl came to this. Her mother and stepfather Maureen Stapleton and Karl Malden seem to be ideal parents and Claudia the indulged child gone strangely nutty. Levinsky the intellect detective prods for resolutions for this catch22 that's quickly wearing his patience thin when he needs it most dealing with her.In another firstrate performance Richard Dreyfuss plays the stunningly durable Levinsky. With infectious charm he unearths some bleak skeletons from her cupboard and in turn from those of Claudia's stepfather her mother and her psychiatrist. This credentially surefire film for awhile seems like a plucky movie with an unpleasant lead who intractably defies bowing to the agendas neuroses or desires of anybody else. But by the end of Nuts when the case has been decided there's an unshakable sentiment of tackiness that the antagonists were trumpedup sitting ducks the script contrives to be taken lying down. If all of psychiatry had been this undemanding Freud wouldn't have been needed to invent it. The Brothers Grimm would've already taken care it for us.But regardless the unraveling of those details is executed so well. At the helm of such masterpieces of delicate subtlety and sensitivity like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold Pete 'n' Tillie and The Front Martin Ritt is efficient with the technique of the flashback that expands step by step showing but an instant of a past event then a little more then ultimately the entire event. Two distinct bathroom sequences are divulged in this manner one surrounding Claudia as a little girl the other her brutal confrontation with her victim. Nuts culminates like a Broadway musical but otherwise it's an absorbing character study cadenced like a fine thriller. Ritt has always undoubtedly been a performer's director with a predilection towards oppressed female protagonists. Sally Field's Norma Rae Patricia Neal in Hud.Supported by a dignified cast Streisand and Dreyfuss pair for the first time but they work together like practiced dancers. He spins her and she laps up the ovation. And that's not uncommon for the controlling Streisand who characteristically holds the fort on all her projects but whether it's Streisand or Stallone supremacy on a movie set only achieves either profundity or chaos. Eli Wallach is entertaining arcane as the psychiatrist. Stapleton is deeply felt if way too broad as the feeble mother with Malden fluently overtaking his Am Ex stamp as Claudia's stepfather. Leslie Nielsen is every prostitute's dread as the client who insists upon and gets more than has been agreed to.In the opening scenes we are submerged in the darklight worlds of the robotizing singlefile lines and pencilpushing procedures of the womens' prison and the crowded busy courtroom. Director of photography Andrzej Bartkowiak's camerawork begins us in a stark rhythm and atmosphere. But unfortunately Nuts is below the summation of its memorable parts. Regardless of all its strong suits it's ultimately ineffective and vain inside. No matter their cred Ritt Bartkowiak screenwriter Alvin Sargent never entirely follow through with their ultimate intent setting inner integrity against social facades to compel us to determine what it truly means to be crazy.".

Nuts presents a dilemma for director Martin Ritt and his screenwriters Tom Topor Darryl Ponicsan and Alvin Sargent working from Topor's play how do you get an audience to sympathize with the heroine of your story one who has a short fuse a nasty disposition and who rubs everybody else the wrong way? It probably wasn't possible and protagonist Claudia Draper is an exasperating meddling infernal creation. Barbra Streisand obviously saw in the material a meaty dramatic role for herself as an actress and although perhaps a bit too old for the part of Claudia Draper she tackles the project with relish. Unfortunately Nuts opens with such a flurry of manic energy that it's predictable the film won't be able to sustain or match that intensity for the rest of its length. Once the introductions are out of the way the film settles into a talky stagy formula one complete with showboating solo moments for Streisand and most of her costars with the exception of Richard Dreyfuss as her legal representative who makes a bigger impact simply by keeping a lower profile. Streisand's abrasive Claudia is really the whole picture and Barbra chews up so much scenery in the course of two hours I'd be surprised if she didn't hit the gym afterward. Still a piece like this needs an electric personality in the lead if it's going to work at all and Streisand does more for the role than a lessdynamic actress might have. Not a great picture by any means and with an amusingpuzzling final shot of Streisand at the end but one that is wellproduced interestingly edited and full of top talent and style. 12 from ".

	schema:reviewBody "NUTS was a play that was turned into this film that has a first rate cast headed by Barbara Streisand including Richard Dreyfus Maureen Stapleton Karl Malden Eli Wallach Robert Webber James Whitmore and Leslie Nielson and a top director Martin Ritt. But it has not gotten the notice it's deserved among Streisand's top performances. I will get to that in a moment.Streisand is a hooker who has been arrested for the murder of a John she picked up. Nielson is the John and his performance here is a type of throwback to the usually villainous parts he played in the early half of his career before he demonstrated his mastery of deadpan comedy. He tries to get rough with Streisand and in the process of defending herself she causes him to get stabbed. Taken to court for arraignment she finds her mother and stepfather Stapleton and Malden have arranged for her attorney William Prince to plead guilty on account of insanity. She gets quite upset about this and manages to punch Prince in the mouth breaking some teeth and making him decide to drop this client. Dreyfus a struggling defense attorney is picked by the arraignment judge to handle the defense.Slowly Dreyfus and Streisand find a way of working together  and find it is an uphill battle. Streisand insists that she is sane and that it was an accident not murder. Dreyfus believes her but has to fight a top flight assistant district attorney Webber who has an accredited psychiatric expert Wallach ready to testify to Streisand's insanity. Fortunately the Judge Whitmore is pretty fair minded.I notice that parts of the resolution of the story appear on the other comments on this board so I will refrain. Suffice to say that Streisand not only discredits Wallach quite well but she also manages to trace her choice of profession to a damaged childhood.NUTS as I said before did not get the exposure of THE WAY WE WERE or WHAT'S UP DOC? or THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES or YENTL as a key performance in the Streisand legend and yet it bears comparison to them or her two appearances as Fanny Brice. Why was it ignored? I suspect it was that it came at the point where Streisand began making movies every couple of years instead of year after year and that it was also made just before the change in Streisand film career when she turned director as well as actor. YENTL THE PRINCE OF TIDES and THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES were far more personal films than NUTS was. Then again it was not the first time Streisand handled the role of a hooker. She played a similar role in THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT opposite George Segal although that was a comedy not a drama. So it fell into a hole in the Streisand career  and was unfairly forgotten. It should not be for it was well made well acted and thoughtful about the causes of the choices in lifestyles we make. I give it 10 out of 10.".

Although it is emotionally brutal in some scenes over all the movie makes you feel good without being one of those sappy films.  I believe that it would be enjoyed by any age adult. It's on my very short list of movies to recommend.";

	schema:reviewBody "She came out of the box running winning an Oscar for her film debut and has been struggling for respect as an actress ever since having been unable to capitalize on FUNNY GIRL. She came close with THE WAY WE WERE but continued to allude the respect her talent merited. Barbra Streisand finally found a plum role hired a talented director surrounded herself with a superb supporting cast and handed in the best performance of her career in NUTS an intense and riveting drama definitely not for all tastes but a bold viewing choice for fans of the performer and notquitesold film goers who are willing to have an open mind and give her a chance. Streisand wisely put a portion of her ego in check and had the sense to hire the gifted Martin Ritt HUD NORMA RAEto guide her in this intense drama about a prostitute named Claudia Draper whose explosive temper and outrageous personality are misinterpreted as mental illness and finds herself committed and deemed incapable of standing trial when she is arrested for murdering one of her johns Leslie Nielsen. What I love about this film is that it presents the audience with evidence to support both sides and then allows the filmgoer to make their own decision as to whether or not Claudia is crazy. As the details of Claudia's life unfold before us evidence definitely supports mental defect but Claudia says she is perfectly sane and wants her day in court because she killed the john in selfdefense. Though Streisand has allowed Ritt to direct Streisand the producer's presence is definitely felt especially during Claudia's final monologue in court shot in loving closeup. Streisand is backed up by a first rate cast including Richard Dreyfuss as her defense attorney Maureen Stapleton as her mother and Karl Malden as her stepfather but this Streisand's show all the way a searing and extraordinary performance that permeates the screen and scratches at your heart. For Streisand fans a must.".

If you want to wear my panties that's another hundred and Don't judge my blow jobs they were sane. All makes for a rather unintentionally campy movie and this camp factor is only ratcheted up by the serious way the film was made.Streisand admittedly is entertaining in the role even if the constant muttering to herself gets a little old after 30 minutes and becomes a little too theatrical in a look at me I'm acting kind of way. Nuts was based on a play originally produced in the 1970s and this film version directed by the great Martin Ritt is unable to overcome its original theatrical limitations. The film is unendingly claustrophobic for example. There is only one scene that takes place outdoors  the final one. Moreover the premise is awfully limited and despite Streisand's star power and the over the top concept of a nutty hooker killing one of her clients this film at its core is just a standard TV courtroom drama.".

The entire premise of the movie just revolves around her arguing with her lawyer and defense attourneys of the state weather she has the mental capacity to stand trial. And while the movie fails to deliver the goods on how the trial is all played out we will never see the real court case the movie just simply demands the yes or no question. Does it work? In a word yes! This isn't a typical court room movie where we find out if she's guilty or innocent Nuts just simply asks the question...can a woman deemed crazy be qualified to be her own lawyer at trial. While she does seem a bit off in her thinking at times she can be powerfully witty which adds plenty of humor to the film. I also liked the realism of the use of the courtroom its very believable unlike some other cheesy attempts made in other films.  What was it with those vibrant colors used in all those 80's movies anyway? All in all Nuts is a winner almost clocked in at two hours but does not bore you even for a minute.

	schema:reviewBody "Barbra Streisand herself must have seen the potential of the play Nuts for a big screen drama. In Nuts she fulfilled the ambition of every player I know to get a courtroom drama. In fact a whole bunch of players got their turn to strut their stuff in Nuts.The play by Tom Topor only ran 96 performances on Broadway but the producers were wise enough to retain Topor to expand his work so it is not just confined to a courtroom in the same way A Few Good Men was adapted to the big screen. The issue is whether the lawyer hired by Streisand's parents is acting in her best interests in getting her declared not mentally competent enough to stand trial. Streisand insists she's perfectly sane. But assaulting her own high priced mouthpiece William Prince in open court might not have been the best way to go in proving it. Needing an attorney real fast she gets a legal aid attorney in Richard Dreyfuss who gets dragged unwillingly into the case.After that we get to James Whitmore's court where the issue will be joined. To some degree Whitmore prosecutor Robert Webber court psychiatrist Eli Wallach and Dreyfuss is defending the system and their role in it.Barbra's a high class hooker who gets 500.00 a night and she is accused of killing client Leslie Nielsen who's a brutish sort of lout and we see what really went down in flashback. But speaking of vested interests it's clear that Streisand's wealthy parents Maureen Stapleton and Karl Malden have clear vested interests in getting her confined to a mental institution instead of a public trial.Like A Few Good Men a great ensemble cast brings this story to life and it's riveting. In fact one of the things you'll question is whether Streisand herself is acting in her own best interests.Nuts is a great drama asking questions with deep implications about our mental health system as it applies to criminal justice. We often hear of people trying to 'get off' from criminal responsibility by pleading temporary insanity. That is a course that has its own pitfalls as Nuts clearly demonstrates.The viewer because of the flashbacks knows the real story. One of the great strengths of Nuts is that anyone might draw different conclusions as to whether Streisand is acting in her own best interests.I'm astounded that Nuts did not merit any Oscar consideration. That to me is Nuts.".

For the most part it's a by the numbers 'chick flick' but makes no pretensions to be more than that and in fact is very good for what it is.The easy thing to do would be to take potshots at this film throw out things like 'Fresh Prince' 'getting jiggy with it' and even throw around the whole 'black dude making a white dude cool' angle but that's too easy isn't it? Like shooting fish in a barrel.No this isn't a Wes Anderson film. The humor is rather broad though much it very funny. Of course you won't see it up for an Oscar what a tired joke that is nor does it contain Quientin Tarantionesquire dialogue or groundbreaking visuals.But taken for what it is a romantic comedy it really is very good. Great chemistry between all the leads. Eve Mendes is gorgeous. And Kevin James steals nearly every scene he's in. It gets a bit sappy towards the end don't all mainstream romantic comedies though? but if you're looking for a above average date movie with more than a few belly laughs this is your film.A solid B.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie screened last night and you know what? I liked it. For the most part it's a by the numbers 'chick flick' but makes no pretensions to be more than that and in fact is very good for what it is.The easy thing to do would be to take potshots at this film throw out things like 'Fresh Prince' 'getting jiggy with it' and even throw around the whole 'black dude making a white dude cool' angle but that's too easy isn't it? Like shooting fish in a barrel.No this isn't a Wes Anderson film. The humor is rather broad though much it very funny. Of course you won't see it up for an Oscar what a tired joke that is nor does it contain Quientin Tarantionesquire dialogue or groundbreaking visuals.But taken for what it is a romantic comedy it really is very good. Great chemistry between all the leads. Eve Mendes is gorgeous. And Kevin James steals nearly every scene he's in. It gets a bit sappy towards the end don't all mainstream romantic comedies though? but if you're looking for a above average date movie with more than a few belly laughs this is your film.A solid B.";

I hate spending around 20 not including babysitting  for my husband and myself to have that It was OK feeling.I think I like Will Smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. He was well cast in this. His character was very likable as was Kevin James'. There were several laugh out loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this. Women will like it as much as any chickflick but I wouldn't categorize this as one. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don't usually like slapstick that much but it wasn't overdone and I can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs.I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was I want to see it again!".

I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film  it wasn't groundbreaking in any sort of way  but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the hutzpah of Hitch. Sure there are barstuds but not ones that can get any chick at any time  excluding those raking in seven figures of course. The thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things not just on the comedy. It was a funny two hours no doubt.

	schema:reviewBody "Hitch is about a man who knows what works with women and teaches the guys who do not do well with them some tricks of the trade. Actually he more or less walks them through it. Hitch guarantees success up until the dreaded 3rd date kiss. After that they are on their own. Of course Hitch finds a girl who he falls for and everything that he thinks he knows does not work out for himself when following the same guidelines. The movie was a wellwritten romantic comedy which both guys and girls could have a fun time watching. Perfect for Valentine's Day which I'm sure was no marketing coincidence it was released on Valentine's Day weekend.Will Smith is perfect as Hitch. His performance here reminded me of a more mature possibly grown up Fresh Prince Of Bel Air. He was the smooth talker and was able to read any situation for himself or his clients to make a memorable impression then have a memorable date with the women his clients are affectionate towards. Sounds a little sleazy but Hitch has his own rules. He does not help out the guys who want to Hit it and quit it so to speak only those who really seem to like or love the woman they are after. One thing the film never gets into is what Hitch makes for a job like this as I wonder how much something like that could be worth in monetary value.Eva Mendes plays Sara Hitch's love interest. She does quite a good job in her role here. Sara is the type of girl who is always on the defense when approached by men therefore is leery of any advances. Hitch reads her well and makes his way in until she discovers what is is he actually does. For some reason women tend to take offense to his job.Kevin James is also perfect as Albert a man who is in love with a rich woman named Allegra Cole but she does not know he exists. His expressions of nervousness and fright are hilarious. Heck the movie is just a darn good one. Nothing too offensive a bad word here or there but nothing major. I do not think it warrants it's PG13 rating but a plain old PG would be fine for me. Regardless of it's rating I can honestly recommend Hitch to just about anyone and Will Smith rarely disappoints. 9.510".

He is currently helping a shapely clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful famous and rich woman called Allegra. At the same time Hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist Sara  Eva Mendes  who has been assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation This film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of malebashing and both subtle and blatant malehating. There are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot. Hitch and Sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex Hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But of course Sara is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of men want to have sex with anything that walks. Shes selfobsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no 'real men' out there. What annoyed me most of all was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless 'victim' and even after being turned down physically by Hitch receives as blow to the pills from Sara after which she says Now I'm satisfied. Add to that the women are still oppressed vibes you get from Allegra not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men. In spite of all the rubbish assumptions and generalisations  Women can always tell when you ain't being straight with them?  this movie does have the correct point that in America love simply doesn't exist. There are some funny parts in this film such as Albert and his dancing habits but this film overall only beats the dreadful film Honey by a marginal amount.".

Basically the story is about Hitch Will Smith a man who knows all of the ropes when it comes to dating women taking Albert Kevin James under his wing. Normally the guy would have as much chance of getting together with the apple of his eye Amber Valletta as Allegra as a skyscraper has of surviving a Godzilla attack but Hitch is a real pro so love might just be in the air.I never thought I'd say this but Kevin James is actually good in this movie. Will Smith is charming as usual but the both of them really work together. There's chemistry between the actors and there are ample touching funny and even romantic moments well not between James and Smith. When the two male leads are doing their comedic parts the film is enjoyable and when it's being truthful it feels genuine. What really hurts the movie is the last third of the running time. The story was deliberately avoiding the usual tropes that romantic comedies always have to labor through and then it flatout turns into a generic romance plot. Why was it necessary to include the big misunderstanding the chase the earth shattering revelations and the dramatic resolution all because no one can just sit down talk and explain themselves to the other people? This is a movie that contains one of my alltime pet peeves because just like in every bad horror movie where the dumb teenagers get themselves killed because either they've never seen a horror movie in their entire lives or horror movies just don't exist in this film the people of Hitch suddenly all lose their brains and make the same dumb mistakes we've seen over and over. For its good parts Hitch is worth seeing but unfortunately it fumbles the ball right before the end and falls just short of being a truly great original romantic comedy. On DVD October 30 2012".

He proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always like him on The King of Queens but this role really brought him into the light more and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy romance and drama left me feeling complete. It's nothing like most chick flicks in the sense of tears and sadness but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. I encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from Hitch. TWO WAY BIG THUMBS UP!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "In this romantic comedy Alex 'Hitch' Hitchins Will Smith is a  legendary but anonymous date doctor in New York City. Hitch advises  klutzy male wallflower clients on ways to make good first impressions  on the women of their dreams. To contact Hitch a man must have a  referral from one of his former clients. Once Hitch accepts you as a  client he will coach you on your first three dates after that you're  on your own. Hitch's newest client is Albert Brennaman Kevin James a  fat tax accountant in love with a celebrity client Allegra Cole Amber  Valetta. Allegra doesn't know that Albert exists so Albert contacts  Hitch to make his dream come true. Hitch decides to make Albert a  client even though he knows this is going to be tough. While working  on this job Hitch meets Sara Melas Eva Mendes a gossip reporter for  a daily tabloid who is following Allegra's every move. Sara has given  up on men and Hitch wants to cut through that layer because he is the  master of love so he thinks. With Valentine's Day around the corner  this is a good date movie. Women will love it and men may pick up a  few pointers. The movie is hilarious and filled with verbal and  slapstick comedy from beginning to end. There are several scenes that  may make you bust a gut laughing. Columbia Run time 155 Rated  PG13810".

	schema:headline " Often Very Funny and Worth Watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Will Smith is Alex Hitch Hitchens a longtime bachelor who has become known as the New York City date doctor who charges to help men get the women of their dreams. Although he helps all these other men he somehow is not able to have nearly as much success with Sara Eva Mendes the woman he himself loves.Hitch is a safe yet funny and entertaining romantic comedy. The premise sounds pretty good and the execution is also pretty good. Yes it is very predictable and kind of cheesy. However that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I think Hitch is better than most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year because the characters are likable and Smith  Mendes have enough chemistry together to make the film work. Will Smith is very charming as Hitch. He plays the role well and he never gets annoying. It's also nice to see him in a film that doesn't involve a bunch of things blowing up. Eva Mendes also gives a pretty good performance and she is also very pretty.Surprisingly the best thing about Hitch is Kevin James. His performance is funny and also pretty realistic. The only problem is that most of his scenes appear in the trailer and this lessens the effect. I never really liked him before but now I hope he makes more movie appearances. Out of the four main actors Amber Valletta is the weakest. She gives an average performance and she just doesn't fit well with the other three. The rest of the supporting actors are also pretty funny especially the customers that ask Hitch for help.The only problem I really have with Hitch is that it plays it too safe. If it was a little more edgier than the film could have been really good but it still stands an enjoyable romantic comedy. It's not really surprising that the film is safe since Andy Tennant is the director. He directed It Takes Two and Sweet Home Alabama. He's like the king of harmless fluff films and Hitch is his best work to date. Another thing that bothered me was the running time. 118 minutes is too long for a predictable story and it does take a toll on the audience. I think it's bad since the story is bythenumbers and the film takes awhile to reach obvious places. If it was a little shorter than it would have been fine. In the end Hitch is an enjoyable romantic comedy and one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Rating 810".

I didn't believe in the melt down of Eva Mendes for a minute. The happy ending made me think and predict a Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? in their near future. There is an element of hardness and of selfishness that the cuteness couldn't mask. I couldn't help longing for Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond for a moment of truth no matter how ugly. Real comedies have that from Lubitch farces to Rock HudsonDoris Day pastiches. None of that is present here.

Although Hitch has never truly recovered from having his heart broken back in college he suddenly finds himself wearing it back on his sleeve when he meets Sara Melas Eva Mendes a gossip reporter for the New York Standard tabloid who makes a living covering and uncovering the love affairs of the rich and famous but has yet to find her own Mr. Right. Somehow the date doctor's patented prescription for love and happiness doesn't work quite as well when he's required to do the selfmedicating and he has to learn the tricky art of just being himself rather than the person he thinks women want to see.The problem I have with this movie is that it is BS and a BS that crosses the line. It is like a movie where a psychologist tells the patient to act in a way that is harmful and that many chumps in the audience both male and female will take a valid reflection of the real world when in effect that advice has the opposite effect.My biggest problem is the script and of the characters. Will Smith is charming and charismatic by comparison to the other characters yet the dialog falls way below all standards and into the short bus. I wasn't able to sit through this one when it came on TV nor did I even have the stomach leaving it on the TV as I cleaned the living room. Most repugnant character was Smith's love interest Sara who was a total hypocritical Reactor and Moralizer who severely betrayed Smiths trust and compromised his confidential relationship with his clients.It was nauseating seeing a so called Dr. of Love who doesn't have the integrity to drop or get payback on a target who clearly crosses the line and fks him over.What is really disappointing is that with this premise it could have been a very good fun and informative movie. If it was it would probably have not been the blockbuster it was. Sigh! This theme was done 100x better in the very good but slightly flawed The Tao of Steve".

Enter Hitch to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome and even though Albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces he conquers us because he is a real in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in Manhattan.The basic mistake most production designers make when preparing locales for Hollywood films is how out of touch with reality they are. The apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. Evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie though is Kevin James who as the overweight Albert not only win us over but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as the main interest of Hitch. In minor roles we see Adam Arkin Amber Valletta Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco among others.Hitch is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by Andy Tenant.".

I can't say I expected better from Will Smith but I definitely did from Kevin James of The King of Queens but hey I'm getting used to saying that a lot lately. This film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy but it never hits the bull'seye. In fact it never hits anywhere within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing the fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody offguard and is therefore in a movie like this not funny. This movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time. Some parts are okay but I'm searching my brain for examples but I really think this movie should be avoided.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird keeps making movies that have men acting like women and women acting like men. The idiotic male director and writer of this movie need to have their heads examined. The main problem with this film is its extremely feminist portrayal of genders which is fused with almost macabre conceptions of both sexes and this disastrous combination is meant to be jocular.In the scenes of the bar Eva Mendez and her friend are swigging from the beer bottles like you may find sailors on an oil tanker doing so at a bar in Reykjavik. Mendez continually touches every girl she sees after that and dresses provocatively in every scene yet curses like a guy. She also gets very emotional when she fights with Will Smith while 'defending' women from bad guys everywhere.The men are no better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything they can to obtain a relation. They are concerned with obtaining lewd favours or unable to speak clearly when face to face with a woman. Normal men in real life do not behave this way.What we see in this movie is a product of culture gone awry. Everything is flipflopped. Guys act like girls girls act like guys. All this is done while keeping the extreme predilections of the sexes very much a part of the story. Men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in licentiousness most of the time while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as a veneer for their emotional insecurities.Some of this movie's ideas would be at the most watchable if they weren't presented obnoxiously to the audience. However this movie is not even watchable let alone enjoyable!".

	schema:reviewBody "Call me a romantic comedy loving sap if you want to but I enjoyed Hitch. There I said it. I enjoyed yet ANOTHER romantic comedy. I guess I'm just a sucker for hot babes and some good laughs. It's a powerful combination that helps me overlook a movie's shortcomings of which Hitch has a few it gets too sappy at the end it's predictable it's formulaic. You've pretty much seen it all before Unlikely couple meets.  Unlikely couple dances around a relationship.  Unlikely couple finally gets together.  Unlikely couple experiences a major misunderstanding that splits them up.  Unlikely couple finally realizes the misunderstanding and reconciles.Not once did I find myself teetering on the edge of my seat wringing my hands in despair because I was fearful of a disastrous outcome. But who cares? What I did find myself doing was laughing out loud quite a bit while also trying to conceal the drool that would escape on the right side of my mouth whenever Eva Mendes would appear on screen. Woo baby!There are several things that helped me brush aside the familiarity and just enjoy the movie. You've got Eva who is hot and has a great personality. And Amber Valletta is pretty cute herself. Then there's Will Smith who is both charming and funny. He exhibits good chemistry with both Mendes and Kevin James who is pretty funny in his own right. Come on fat guy dancing! That's always good for a few laughs. Some people might find the overthetop dancing a bit silly but I'm one of those guys who can always find humor in watching white people try to dance like black people but doing a horrible job of it.I laughed pretty consistently throughout the movie until they cued the sappy You are the wind beneath my wingsesquire dialogue near the end. I sincerely suggest that you pop the top on the Maalox or Pepto Bismal take a good couple of swigs as Will Smith begins his extremely gay speech about love falling flying taking leaps blah blah blah and your stomach should settle enough to let you enjoy a little more silly dancing at the end. Eva Mendes. Tight dress. Dancing. Thumbs up.Sure things got a little too gay at times but I appreciated the handful of moments where the movie poked fun at what initially looks like a sappy scene. I loved the bit with Eva watching Jerry Maguire and crying during the You complete me scene which is one of the most gaginducing lines of all time. Yeah and you just completed my digestion cycle Tom because my food's coming back up. That's one line that simply can't be made fun of enough.My recommendation is that you grab your sweetie accept that you're not gonna see any new ground being broken make sure you have your yellow bucket handy for Will's big speech at the end and enjoy a funny cutesy fairly safe romantic comedy for Valentine's.THE GISTHitch has enough laughs for the guys and well enough Eva for the guys and enough romance for the ladies for me to recommend it to those of you looking for a cute romantic comedy to help you celebrate Valentine's. There are a few moments that will gag you with sugary sweetness but strong performances by Will Smith Eva Mendes and Kevin James help you overlook it. Rating 3.5 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "FANNY is the second film of a trilogy based upon a play by Marcel Pagnol from which all three works are taken featuring most of the cast of excellent actors which made the stage original a great artistic and popular success including Raimu Charpin Pierre Fresnay and Orane Demazis as Fanny an assemblage which remains faithful to the heart of the original. By repudiating the normal placement of concurrent French films made in Parisian studios and producing the work in his native Marseilles in Provence Pagnol achieves a finelyhewn naturalism which is very congenial to the scenario dealing as it does with a hardworking bourgeoisie whose lives are in concert with rhythms of a major seaport. Fanny's passionate attention to Marius Fresnay results in her pregnancy from their farewell coupling at the denouement of the first of the trilogy MARIUS with her lover falling prey to the lure of a seafaring life and she abandoned accepts a proposal of marriage from a much older M. Panisse Charpin in order to save the reputation of her family. The love of Panisse for the child of Fanny is the moving force in what must be the inevitable fulfillment of the storyline i.e. the return of Marius to claim his erstwhile fiance and his true child in a scene which brings the best from Demazis Fresnay and Raimu as Cesar the father of Marius and lifelong friend of Panisse. Pagnol directed only the finale of the trio and selects for FANNY Marc Allegret who leads the cast with distinction displaying particular skill when allowing Pagnol's magnificent dialogue to be developed in what is essentially a filmed work for the stage with few sets and who allows liberal emphasis upon the plastic Raimu who is after all the most important presence in this romantic masterpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "FANNY is the second film of a trilogy based upon a play by Marcel Pagnol from which all three works are taken featuring most of the cast of excellent actors which made the stage original a great artistic and popular success including Raimu Charpin Pierre Fresnay and Orane Demazis as Fanny an assemblage which remains faithful to the heart of the original. By repudiating the normal placement of concurrent French films made in Parisian studios and producing the work in his native Marseilles in Provence Pagnol achieves a finelyhewn naturalism which is very congenial to the scenario dealing as it does with a hardworking bourgeoisie whose lives are in concert with rhythms of a major seaport. Fanny's passionate attention to Marius Fresnay results in her pregnancy from their farewell coupling at the denouement of the first of the trilogy MARIUS with her lover falling prey to the lure of a seafaring life and she abandoned accepts a proposal of marriage from a much older M. Panisse Charpin in order to save the reputation of her family. The love of Panisse for the child of Fanny is the moving force in what must be the inevitable fulfillment of the storyline i.e. the return of Marius to claim his erstwhile fiance and his true child in a scene which brings the best from Demazis Fresnay and Raimu as Cesar the father of Marius and lifelong friend of Panisse. Pagnol directed only the finale of the trio and selects for FANNY Marc Allegret who leads the cast with distinction displaying particular skill when allowing Pagnol's magnificent dialogue to be developed in what is essentially a filmed work for the stage with few sets and who allows liberal emphasis upon the plastic Raimu who is after all the most important presence in this romantic masterpiece.";

Originally they were a stage play then a movie and then many years later in 1961 the three movies were combined to make one movie named FANNY. I've always loved the 1961 movie so I was thrilled to see the original three moviesall part of a 4 disk set by Kino Video.Throughout much of the 1932 movie the lines were identical or very close to the 1961 film. Of the three movies I think this one is closest to the 1961 film except that this one is in French with subtitles and is black and white. The 1961 version is simply a lot prettierwith great music lighting and acting. The earlier version though wonderful is a little more flat. Not badin fact very good...just kind of flat in comparison. If you only have the patience see the 1961 combined film. If you are a cinephile then see all of the filmsthe writing by Pagnol is amazing.".

Today of course it is practically an honor to fall pregnant with no father material in sight and a State standing by to cosset the resulting infant from cradle to grave but in 1932 the resulting 'shame' embraced not only the mothertobe but also her family she manages to elicit our compassion and keep our humor at bay. Pedants will have a field day with the dodgy arithmetic  Marius has supposedly signed up for a fiveyear voyage yet on his return Fanny's son is a mere 10 months old  but what matters is the actingplusbelievability factor and here thanks as always to the great Raimu aided and abetted by Fernand Charpin Alida Rouffe and Milly Mathis they bring it off to a faretheewell.  Pierre Fresnay as Marius does little more than play the flyintheointment in the closing quarter of the movie and may well have been looking ahead one full decade to 'Le Corbeau'.

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched this movie several times now each time hoping I will like it more than the time before. But that doesn't happen. The first movie in the socalled Marseilles Trilogy Marius 1931 is one of the masterpieces of world cinema and not surprisingly one of the most beloved of French movies by the French. This movie based on Pagnol's sequel play of the same name has much more melodrama and much less humor than Marius and frankly the melodrama is not good melodrama whatever that would be. The scene between Panisse and Fanny when he explains why he will marry her even though she is pregnant by another man Marius is moving and funny. The final scene is interesting for the definition of fatherhood that it puts forward. There are interesting moments here and there throughout the movie. But the whole falls far short of Marius and too often comes off as just another 1930s movie melodrama. If you liked Marius  and how could you not?  you would want to see this but don't get your expectations up too high. More's the shame.".

All early sound movies feel setlocked as people talk and deliver within the range of the camera. Therefore to hold the interest to the modern viewer the dialogue and acting must be believable and engaging. The film fails to achieve it for the most part because the performance of the actress playing Fanny is a total success even though she was reprising her role from the stage. First time director Pagnol adapting his own stage works suffers from a nonvisual eye. The delight is French star Raimu who delivers a performance still worthy to the eye even today. There is a reason Orson Welles called him a genius. The melodramatic plot of a scorned maybe that is too strong a word even abandoned is too strong because she never lets on to her man that she does not want him to leave woman who is pregnant is pass though common in the literature of the period. I remember a tracking shot that impressed me as the camera follows Fanny through the streets as she suspects she is pregnant. In the way it is handled and executed it is cinematic authorship at its finest. It is a film in the middle of the trilogy therefore there are loose ends left to be resolved.

There's no summary no flashbacks no flash forward either it's just as if the director Marc Allegret trusted the good memory of his audience and I guess in these times cinema was still such a new thing that an experience like the first Marius would have left unforgettable memories.Marius Pierre Fresnay the idealistic and romantic son of colorful barkeeper Csar the one and only Raimu has just sailed to the seven seas following both his lifelong dream and the guidance of his beloved Fanny Orane Demazis. We left Csar delighted after hearing that his son and Fanny would marry and give him grandchildren in the years to come. But Fanny starts with Marius' departure. And you can see the light of joy vanish from Csar's face he welcomes the news like a knife in his heart and sinks into melancholy like an ice cube in a Pastis drink. The first act shows both Csar and Fanny trying to deal with Marius' absence their deep and inconsolable sorrow makes Marius the most present character despite his absence.But the worst is yet to come Fanny is pregnant and Marius is the father. Her mother Honorine throws a tantrum and was about to disown her when she passed out that's the kind of blow to their honor they don't need in the family. The situation seems unsolvable but there's a gateway brave old Panisse Henri Charpin who's still maintaining his offer to marry Fanny. What I liked about the film is that you kind of secrecy to run in the narrative but it doesn't for one simple reason this is a film with fully developed characters. Their personality are not reliant on the plot they make the plot. Fanny is not a bad woman when Panisse proposes her she can't hide her pregnancy because lying would be more dishonorable. And I loved Panisse's response he's aware that their age gap will inspire a lot of gossipy talks but he's always wanted to be a father so his marriage with Fanny is benefiting for both it's a winwin situation.Any ounce of guilt or discomfort is dissipated by marrying Fanny Panisse keeps her honor and his selfesteem.. It is a marriage of convenience but Panisse makes good points what's more he's rich so Fanny doesn't have much a choice between a bastard and a rich heir. But here 's how the film teases your expectations again just when you're wondering how they'll keep the secret Csar does his best keeping Fanny's spirit up confident that Marius will come back and does his best keeping Panisse away from her dismissing his idea of marrying her. In a lesser movie Fanny would have held the truth and Csar would have called her as a whore or a venal woman but Fanny can't stand the insult and asks Panisse to reveal their secret. It takes a few minutes but Csar realizes they do have a point and waiting for Marius would bring dishonor for poor Fanny. But he also looks at the bright side of things he'll still have a grandson and a heir the name doesn't matter he'd be twice wealthier.There's a poignant scene where the older man of Panisse family thanks Fanny for the baby and at this point there's no way you'd believe they did something wrong. It is a winwin indeed and a fragile equilibrium is reached until Marius comes back. And again Fanny tells him the truth Panisse can let Fanny go back to Marius but he won't abandon his child and even Csar Csar who had always put his son above any other man who had a nasty quarrel with Panisse defended him. What a climax! You have plenty of characters with desires and dreams colliding together Marius' love for Fanny Fanny's honor Panisse needing a child Csar for a grandson to play with each one is right but they can't all be satisfied even Fanny can't abandon Panisse despite the fact that she loves Marius. It's pure Cornelian dilemmas and it works on a very emotional and realistic level not resorting to the clichs or idiot script formula where it's more convenient to keep a mystery the film doesn't care for mysteries it cares about people who're so passionate so involved that they end up knowing what the others were about to hide. Like life I guess you can't have secrets for too long.The film was directed by another director but the continuity with the first film is so welldone you'd think it was made by the same person. Well the film is based on Marcel Pagnol's play and he's the real director and the actors are so into their characters that they make any directorial stunt unnecessary it's a characterstudy a story of people driven to the most extreme compromises by their morals feelings and duties to keep the appearances. The film ends with its bleak note leaving us eager to look forward to a suitable conclusion this time named Csar and directed by Marcel Pagnol himself.Needless to say I'm looking forward to discovering it".

	schema:headline " Part Two of the magnificent Marseilles Trilogy of Marcel Pagnol";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film of Pagnol's famous trilogy set on the quay of the Old Port of Marseilles. It follows immediately upon Part One MARIUS 1931 see my review and is succeeded by CSAR 1936 see my review in which the action takes place many years later. These films were made over a period of at least six years with a total running time of 375 minutes with the same actors playing the same characters. Whereas Part One largely dealt with the character Marius played by Pierre Fresnay this film concentrates on the girl Fanny who is deeply in love with him. Fanny is wonderfully played by Orane Demazis with haunting emotional depth. In Part One after a night of love with Fanny Marius then abandons his plans to marry her and instead follows his dream and goes to sea on a long fiveyear voyage on a sailing ship bearing scientists who want to measure the bottom of the Indian Ocean. He does not tell his father Csar played by Raimu that he is leaving because he knows he will try to stop him. This film commences immediately after the departure of Marius on the sailing ship. Csar and Fanny are both left desolate. Csar knows that Fanny and Marius have spent a night together which at that time was considered deeply shocking and 'a loss of honour'. He had wanted them to marry but now Marius has gone to sea and will not be back for years. Then Fanny discovers that she is pregnant. At that time such a social disgrace could not be endured if a girl remained single. If Marius were still there they would have married and the problem would have been solved. But he does not even know about the pregnancy and cannot return in any case. What is Fanny to do? She is desperate and so are her mother and Marius's father Csar. They all live on the same quay together with the wealthy sailmaker Honor Panisse eloquently played by Fernand Charpin sometimes known simply as Charpin. Panisse is made aware of the problem and renews his offer to marry Fanny and does not mind that the child is not his. So the wedding takes place and Fanny's honour is saved and the child does not have to be given away but can be brought up as the son and heir of Panisse. After the marriage Marius returns unexpectedly and is horrified at what has happened. He wants to reclaim 'my wife and child' but is persuaded to go away and leave things as they are. So he and Fanny both heartbroken at their fate part again. All of this may sound like a trite story but it is far from that as presented on the screen. This second film is directed by Marc Allgret who does an excellent job just as Alexander Korda had done with the preceding film. Marcel Pagnol himself would direct the third and final film CSAR 1936 see my review. The earnestness and passion of the remarkable actors in these three films is so intense and real that one feels that one is really there on the quay with these people. Daniel Auteil is doing remakes of these three films and has completed MARIUS and FANNY both 2013 but the production of the final one CSAR has apparently not yet commenced although it has long been announced. Auteil is directing the films and plays the part of Csar. The first two Auteil versions have been released and are readily available on DVD but have not yet been released with English subtitles. One even wonders whether CSAR will really be made by Auteil as perhaps some funding problem has arisen. Auteil's public association with filmed Marcel Pagnol stories began in 1986 when he played the role of Ugolin in JEAN DE FLORETTE and MANON DES SOURCES which were hugely successful around the world. In 2011 he appeared in and directed Pagnol's story THE WELL DIGGER'S DAUGHTER see my review which was a superb film. Certainly Auteil's obvious love of the Pagnol stories is a most endearing characteristic of his. He himself is not from Provence but was born in Algiers. After this film finishes many years elapse in the story before the episodes of the final film CSAR 1936 see my review which brings the intensely emotional saga to its conclusion.".

Pryor portrays Eddie Dash a con man who has just been released from prison but still has to serve time for community service. He is assigned to be a public escort for a pathological liar Wilder who has just been released from a mental hospital. What Pryor doesn't initially know about Wilder is that he is the pawn in a scam to claim a brewery inheritance. The two of them eventually wind up running for their lives when some greedy businessmen decide that they want to cash in on the fortune.

	schema:headline " Amusingly bittersweet comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Gene Wilder is one of my favorite people in the biz. He has a fanatical side which instantly makes you embarrassed for him while at the same time he has an open honesty which makes you feel for him every little thing which his characters go through. He was one of the best of the best before his beloved Gilda died in 1989. And has slowly let the sadness permeate to his very soul every day since. To look upon Gene Wilder today you don't see the nervous little fussbudget of a man he once was. You don't see the carefully happy and deeply devoted husband he was to Gilda during those years anymore either. What you see now is a sad sorrowfilled Gene who is struggling to maintain the grip he has on his bootstraps that makes you love him all the more for his courage.He has worked little since his 1990 comedy Funny About Love having already been filmed at the time of his wife's demise was the last of the greats to be released by Wilder. His 1991 comedy Another You bore the brunt of Wilder's grief and it showed in his performance complete with a death skit worked into the plot line where the beloved deceased rose triumphantly from the grave and was not the hit Wilder desperately needed at that time.His defunct TV series was another tremendous let down for the star but that did not destroy his spirit. Wilder has made several Made 4 TV movies over these last few years keeping himself busy amidst struggling with his grief and is now some sixteen years later heading once again to the big screen. This newest endeavor Instant Karma  2005 is also centered around death and the reincarnation factor and carries several big names. It is unclear which of these superstars will be the lead but the list of cast members includes Pierce Brosnan Dom DeLuise William Katt Eartha Kitt Billy Preston Burt Reynolds The Rock Mira Sorvino and Gene Wilder among others! This film has had NO press even with the allstar cast. New Line Cinema appears to have little faith in the project or they would be hardspinning it by now.If I could say one thing to Gene Wilder it would be this...We never get over losing the ones we love dearly. But somehow we do get past it. I hope your heart heals one day Mr. Wilder for as things are we not only lost Gilda that fateful day. We lost you too.I care not for what other people have to say about this movie. I have loved the WilderPryor comedy team since the very beginning and this movie is no exception. They haven't done a single movie together which I would dog and this is no exception.Another You is about George a habitual liar who has spent the last three years in an institution to try to help him stop lying. Eddie Dash is a washedup con artist who somehow qualifies for unemployment. His case worker finds him a position as a sittercaretaker for George who is about to be released. Eddie starts out trying to con George but soon learns that there are bigger fish to fry.When confronted on the street by Abe Fielding's bookie who owes Abe a ton of money the bookie mistakes George for Abe in front of Eddie and the con is on.Before you know it George IS Abe living in Abe's house boffing Abe's wife and Eddie has moved into the small mansion as an exfighter who needs a little recovery time.This is a wonderful premise and the movie is both touching and hilarious. While it lacks the epic feel of Silver Streak it is every bit as good as Stir Crazy and at least 2 notches above See No Evil Hear No Evil. This is a wonderful movie.It rates a 7.610 from...the Fiend .".

	onyx:emotionText "Gene Wilder is one of my favorite people in the biz. He has a fanatical side which instantly makes you embarrassed for him while at the same time he has an open honesty which makes you feel for him every little thing which his characters go through. He was one of the best of the best before his beloved Gilda died in 1989. And has slowly let the sadness permeate to his very soul every day since. To look upon Gene Wilder today you don't see the nervous little fussbudget of a man he once was. You don't see the carefully happy and deeply devoted husband he was to Gilda during those years anymore either. What you see now is a sad sorrowfilled Gene who is struggling to maintain the grip he has on his bootstraps that makes you love him all the more for his courage.He has worked little since his 1990 comedy Funny About Love having already been filmed at the time of his wife's demise was the last of the greats to be released by Wilder. His 1991 comedy Another You bore the brunt of Wilder's grief and it showed in his performance complete with a death skit worked into the plot line where the beloved deceased rose triumphantly from the grave and was not the hit Wilder desperately needed at that time.His defunct TV series was another tremendous let down for the star but that did not destroy his spirit. Wilder has made several Made 4 TV movies over these last few years keeping himself busy amidst struggling with his grief and is now some sixteen years later heading once again to the big screen. This newest endeavor Instant Karma  2005 is also centered around death and the reincarnation factor and carries several big names. It is unclear which of these superstars will be the lead but the list of cast members includes Pierce Brosnan Dom DeLuise William Katt Eartha Kitt Billy Preston Burt Reynolds The Rock Mira Sorvino and Gene Wilder among others! This film has had NO press even with the allstar cast.

All this aside Wilder is actually very funny in the movie his timing is excellentespecially the restaurant scene and he carries the film well. Pryor is still funny at times but understandably has more of a supporting role.

	schema:reviewBody "Another You is considered the last of both worlds in terms of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. Pryor appeared in a few movies as a cameo after this but not many and Wilder just quit after this and started doing few TV films but never did another theatrical film after this. Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder were accused of not giving it their all in this film. Pryor can be excused because of his illness during this which is noticeable. I really cant see how neither actor was good because they seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a blast.Another You revolves around a man named Eddie Dash Pryor who is sent to take care of a mental patient named George who is mistaken for a man named Abe Fielding. Encouraged to play along by Eddie George is now in the mix of a bookie and his wife who thought he was dead now believing he is Abe Fielding. Eddie keeps encouraging George to lay along so he can get money and take expensive items from their house.Pryor and Wilder play a hilarious duo who both cant be denied as one of the best comedy duos of 1980s. They worked on four movies together Silver Streak Stir Crazy See No Evil Hear No Evil and Another You. Its a shock that they like many duos most notably McManhon and Carso did not get along. Wilder wrote in a book that Pryor was a big pain on set of Stir Crazy demanding nice treatment and even claiming racism for one thing. Its a surprise because their chemistry on camera is rare to find in a duo in Comedy.I will watch Stir Crazy and Silver Streak soon but it saddens me that both ended on a bad note. This was a flop and it really wasn't a bad film. Many critics hate this movie which isn't a surprise. Though this film is loaded with slapstick and has some cute oneliners its amusing and the chemistry like stated it great. This wasn't as funny as See No Evil Hear No Evil since its hard to beat that but its still amusing. So to conclude this Another You is another Comedy you should check out. Plus both Stephen Lang and Vanessa Williams give a good performance.Starring Richard Pryor Gene Wilder Mercedes Ruehl Stephen Lang and Vanessa Williams. Directed by Maurice Phillips.".

With all of that being said I think time has been quite friendly to the fourth and final teaming of Pryor and Wilder.That's not to say that ANOTHER YOU is some sort of masterpiece because it isn't. You can call it the worst film that the duo made but that's just because they made three very good movies together and this one here it at least very funny in spots. There are many hilarious moments scattered throughout the film but the highlight from me happens early on when Wilder's character finally breaks and begins to lie. This long sequence inside a restaurant has Wilder at his very best as he goes from one personality to the next and it's very funny.As you'd expect Wilder and Pryor have some wonderful chemistry together and they just bounce off one another so perfectly that it's bound to get some laughs. You can tell Pryor was in the early stages of his Multiple Sclerosis but he still offers up a good performance. The film clearly belongs to Wilder who gets the better of the two roles and does a fine job with it. Mercedes Ruehl is also a lot of fun in her role and we get a nice supporting cast including Stephen Lang Vanessa Williams Peter Michael Geotz Kevin Pollack and an uncredited Michael J. Pollard who also appeared in BONNIE AND CLYDE with Wilder.The problem with ANOTHER YOU is that the last fortyminutes are pretty much dead. There's a twist in the story and the entire film changes which is really too bad because this twist does nothing but add extra characters that weren't needed. What was working so well between Wilder and Pryor is pretty much thrown out the window and sadly the film does end on a sour note.

Of their four double act collaborations my personal favourite is 'Silver Streak' while also really enjoying 'Stir Crazy' mostly where the partnership between the two is more equal and even more inspired if not as even with a second half that doesn't fare as well as the first half. 'See No Evil Hear No Evil' a critical failure but unlike 'Another You' a box office success was uneven and not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but was also not as bad as reputed.There are good things about 'Another You'. It looks pretty good really liked the rustic costume and set design and the photography doesn't look too cheap. Charles Gross' music is a good sometimes quirky never overbearing and rarely mismatched fit.Wilder and Pryor work very well together and show what a great double act and comedy duo they were. Wilder does give the better performance here being full of energy and sometimes very funny. Pryor is hampered by the multiple sclerosis that he was suffering from at the time which makes him look ill and stiff and he is a little underused and for Pryor fairly subdued this said he still provides enough entertaining moments and is very much watchable.Some of the dialogue and jokes are fun and witty too. That quality doesn't come through consistently enough but 'Another You' is one of those films that has its good moments and elements and hardly irredeemably bad. The supporting cast do well with what they're given what 'Another You' has over 'See No Evil Hear No Evil' is that the supporting cast are better here.However the story mostly is nondescript and what there is of it is jumbled and disjointed. It also has erratic pacing sometimes rushed at other times with a few dull stretches and it could have done with being 1015 minutes longer to tie things up more tightly. Despite a decent premise the laughs don't come consistently. Parts of the dialogue are lacklustre there are some tasteless and less than subtle jokes about the mentally ill which is one of the reasons why 'Another You' is Wilder and Pryor's weakest because despite a lack of subtlety in places 'See No Evil Hear No Evil' handled its premise nowhere near as distastefully as it potentially could have done and the yodelling scene agreed is an embarrassment and should have been left on the editing room floor.Overall Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor's weakest film but not as bad as reputed. 510 Bethany Cox".

The two definitely did not save the best for last in this story of mistaken identity. Maybe it was a case of wearing out a good thing or poor directing or something else entirely whatever it was Another You didn't work. After being in a mental hospital for 3 years for his pathological lying it is believed that George Gene Wilder is ready to be re introduced to the world again. Eddie Dash Richard Pryor is a con man trying to stay on the rehabilitated side of life when he is assigned to community service for the remainder of his probation. He is assigned to spend time with George helping him find an apartment and aid him on his reintroduction to life outside of the mental hospital. On the way to the museum George bumps into a man who mistakenly believes he is a millionaire to whom he owes a lot of money. George is wholeheartedly against going on with this lie as he is trying to rehabilitate himself from lying. Eddie however has no interest in becoming a better person and leaving the con game behind. Seeing this as a great opportunity for getting a lot of money Eddie urges George to go along with the charade. George then meets the real Abe Fielding's wife and sees the beautiful mansion that he is supposed to live in. Going along with the charade proves difficult when it is revealed that the real Abe Fielding is missing and believed to be murdered. Everything about this film was disjointed. It's hard to believe by watching this film alone that there were 3 other film collaborations of the two principles. Another You is completely missable likewise miserable. A flat storyline that never fully develops or works enough to engage the audience even my intense love of Gene Wilder's work wasn't enough to save this picture for me.".

I'd rate it 8 out of 10 but most people will view it as a 5 or an average showing and it didn't do well in the box office upon release. I think this is because it's got an unusual plot and very simple humour.It's not Wilder or Pryor's best film but it has some amusing moments and show cases their comic double act and the fact they loved working together. Some of the scenes are very good and clearly has the Wilder and Pryor improvised touch. The best scene for me is at the end of the movie where the two characters hold up a partner's forever sign is a fitting tribute to their wonderful comedy partnership. May they both RIP as a comic duo who perhaps don't get as much reward or recognition as they deserve.See No Evil Hear No Evil Stir Crazy and Blazing Saddles are better films but I consider Another You to be a film that is very under rated... most will rate it average though. The story is a little jumbled but the whole plot idea and some of the jokes are very 80searly 90s.The idea of a con man teaming up with a pathological liar just released from a looney bin is a great plot but I think it suffers because the film is only 1 hour and 20 minutes long the actors try and do well but it needed another 15 minutes or so to expand the plot and explain things.This is a simple film that you might watch when you want a some humour and nothing as intense as Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.

Clearly Wilder found that the fey youthful character he had created no longer suited him. Nonetheless there are enough funny routines here enough good lines and visual action to make this quite a pleasant diversion.Sadly Pryor's medical condition escalates and is visible in the movie.

While the Toxic Avenger Toxie is trapped in Amortville Tromaville comes under the control of Toxie's evil doppelganger the Noxious Offender Noxie. Will Toxie return to Tromaville in time to stop Noxie's rampage or is he doomed to remain a secondclass citizen in Amortville forever?

The movie is overloaded with gore sex breasts political incorrectness breasts sex lesbians transsexuals mutant superheroes... and did I mention sex breasts and gore?Yes it has no socially redeeming value whatsoever.  Its Troma.  It's not supposed to.  If you're a Troma fan see it.  If you're not you probably won't like it.  Unless you do.The screening I saw was just this past weekend at the Renegade Film Festival in St. Petersburg FL.  The copy was an advanced screening and according to the festival promoters the editing on the film was completed just in time for the festival so I don't know how people were seeing this months ago or why the date listed is 1999 on here...".

Kabukiman NYPDI wont say why youll have to see the movie.The gist of it is While saving the Tromaville school for the very special Toxie accidently gets sent to Amortvillethe exact opposite of Tromaville and NoxieToxies oppisote gets sent to Tromaville. Thats just the tip of the iceberg as many many more things happen including a cameo by the original Melvin Mark Torgl.Now onto my review. This movie is awesome Terror Firmer was kick ass but this movie is funnier in every area then Terror Firmer wasthough Terror Firmer was grosser. One of the things you can always count on Troma to do is to have social messages hidden in there filmsyes its true they do. From Abortion to violence in the media this movie has a lot of hidden social messages. David Mattey does very good as both Toxie and his evil doppleganger Noxie I hope he's asked back for Toxie part 5if there is one heres hoping this movie is also filled with many spoofs of recent movies as well as real life situations. From Star Wars Episode 1 to the Matrix and covering real life. The Columbine massacre and the dragging of the black man in Texasthose latter two instances may offend a few. Of course a Troma film is't complete without lots and lots of gore and Citizen Toxie does not disapoint either although the copy I was watching is not quite finished so the sound was not quite up to par but that will be fixed once it comes out. Also that really kickass Toxic Avenger song from the trailer was absent from the film so I hope that gets put in as well. Also Corey Feldman does appear in a rather humorous scene as Sarah's personal Doctor.".

Lloyd Kaufman and the Troma team managed to make a sequel to a twenty year old movie that is not only more succesful than the original but has a lesser budget to boot.  The Toxic Avenger has never looked better on screen the acting while often intentionally corny fits the movie perfectly and the script is comedic genius.  Now to see all this it is imperative to not be off put by the gallons of gore extreme sexuality  and the lengths at which the makers go out of their way to be politically incorrect.Which brings us to a very controversial subject.  Many people have bashed this movie aside from given remarks such as idiotic lowbrow and tasteless.  Many people claim this film to be racist  and they are serious when they say this.  To see someone brand this offensive but harmless piece of art racist truly makes me sad.  If anybody took the time to learn anything about the production of this movie or the people involved making it such claims would never be vocalized or even thought.  The scene in question involves an africanamerican gentlemen being dragged behind a pickup truck and is also based upon an actual event.  The villain of the picture is the one commiting this act against humanity as villains in most movies do.  Who saves him?  Toxie the hero of the film who fights crime and is eternally trying to end violence.Citizen Toxie The Toxic Avenger 4 is a landmark in independant films. Anyone who takes movies too seriously may not get it though so it is advised to know what you're getting into This film is crude  revolting offensive politcally incorrect violent and nothing short of amazing. However that last one would not apply if the first Toxic Avenger another minor masterpiece did not exist.  If none of the above descriptions bother you rent or better yet BUY the original Toxic Avenger and Citizen Toxie.  You'll have a great time guaranteed.".

And i had heard that this was one of the bloodiest films ever made. I was puzzled. Then my friend bought the unrated directors cut. I watched it and I absolutely loved it. It was hilarious and was definitely one of the bloodiest films i've seen right up there with Dead Alive. There was also lots more nudity and sex including a couple of lesbian sex scenes. The movie starts of with the diaper mafia holding the Tromaville school for the very special hostage. Toxie then gruesomely kills them all but a bomb goes of and he is taken to another dimension which is the exact opposite of Tromaville. Toxies evil opposite the Noxious Offender is then taken to tromaville and begins killing all the citizens. The characters are all hilarious my favorite being Tito the Retarded Rebel. Watch for the two Toxie fetuses fighting the womb with mops and also the scene in which Toxie is in heaven. Hilarious. 910".

But Citizen Toxie The Toxic Avenger IV is actually an amazingly entertaining and creative movie that nonTroma fanscould enjoy.As usual this film is not for the squeamish with all of its creative gore. The gore isn't realistic by any means. It is quite obvious that you are seeing a melon with a mask and wig being smashed etc. And anyone could take offense tosomething in the film if they actually believed Kaufman was serious but he isn't. I have the unrated directors edition so I don't know what the difference is from the R version but I wouldn't invite my fellow members from church over to watch it.This film doesn't drag on. The story is even kind of clever not just Toxie going around and saving the day. Lots of good gags creative gore scenes and theusual nudity sprinkled throughout. The porn Godfather Ron Jeremy playsTroma's mayor as well. Unfortunately it is rare to find any Troma DVDs new or old in Blockbuster or Hollywood Video stores. So your best bet is to either find a privately owned business that carries lots of independent titles or cough up a few extra bucks to buy it. The DVD is a 2 disc collector's edition and is the director's cut unrated. There is lots of goodies on the DVD including a 95minute documentary called Apocalypse Soon The Making of Citizen Toxie.".

There's a bit more the saltandpepper casting of Fabrice Lucchini and Roschdy Zem is at least meant to be sly the use of newcomer Louise Bourgoin an amusing experiment. Since this is Anne Fontaine the comedydrama is also a study of unexpected sexual attractions. It's a somewhat bizarre threesome a famous lawyer Bertrand the soft mercurial witty Lucchini his assigned and initially unwanted security guard Christophe the chiseled tightlipped Zim and an airheaded but voluptuous TV weather bunny Audrey Bourgoin a mteo presenter and TV personality in real life. But if the approach and the thinking are individual the result is still pretty bland and generic.Bertrand is a crack trial lawyerand that's an excellent role for the ultraarticulate Lucchini. He's engaged in a highprofile trial in Monaco in which he is defending a posh lady dith Lassalle a rather wasted Stephane Audran who murdered by stabbing her younger Russian boyfriend a gigolo characterized in court as having been spectacularly well hung. The family's rich the case is high profile and the boyfriend was a a sleazy possibly mafioso Russian so dith's son Louis Gilles Cohen has engaged a fulltime bodyguard for Bertrand.He Christophe maintains his distance but the clich happens Bertrand notices him and not to be bothered by his hovering invites him to dinner. There not being any real physical danger anyway Chirstophe soon becomes simply Bertrand's girl wrangler disposing of an annoying exgirlfriend of the lawyer Jeanne Balibar by bedding her then keeping Audrey at bay when she begins seducing the lawyer in the middle of the trial. The surprise but isn't it another comedy clich? is Christophe and Audrey have a history. Why not? She's screwed everyone on 'The Rock.' He pretends to be the strong silent type but the new BertrandAudrey story complicates the buddypicture aspect of things by making Christophe both more personally protective of Bertrand and dangerously jealous of him when this strong silent type turns out not to have gotten that girl out of his system. Christophe reacts with repressed rage toward Audrey and the film turns strangely serious. But not serious enough to make an impression. And the comedy wasn't funny enough to be memorable either. The screenplay might have worked better if Fontaine had chosen one direction or the other and flown with it.Sure this is a good cast and the colorful free Monagasque atmosphere is made integral to the action. But truth to tell Bourgoin is just a tasty bauble who's not dropdead gorgeous or soulful enough to have a great future ahead of her. Whatever they may have thought Bardot she's not. Fontaine's strict directing of Lucchini who is far wittier and funnier on TV and probably in his stage performances and Zem whose role remains relatively servile here holding both back from doing much or being fully themselves fails to make the most of either. Lucchini is always fun to watch and to hear talk but he's more fun to watch when he's just being himself. It's obvious that a Chabrol treatment of this theme would be better and his recent 'Girl Cut in Two' has more depthwithout having much depth.Ultimately and alas well before the last scene this is a movie that disappoints. Will Sloan wasn't far from the mark when he commented that this illustrates Matt Groening's notion of cinema's greatest paradox that the French are funny sex is funny and comedies are funny yet no French sex comedies are funny. It's true of this one at least. A perusal of 'How I Killed My Father' and the less often mentioned but intriguing 'Dry Cleaning' will show how far this piece of frippery is from Anne Fontaine's best work.'La fille de Monaco' debuted in Paris August 20 2008 to satisfactory reviews. Shown as part of the RendezVous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center March 2009. It has been bought for distribution by Magnolia Pictures for an early July US release. with US release planned for early July. 2009".

A perusal of 'How I Killed My Father' and the less often mentioned but intriguing 'Dry Cleaning' will show how far this piece of frippery is from Anne Fontaine's best work.'La fille de Monaco' debuted in Paris August 20 2008 to satisfactory reviews. Shown as part of the RendezVous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center March 2009. It has been bought for distribution by Magnolia Pictures for an early July US release. with US release planned for early July. 2009";

	schema:reviewBody "This film screened at the 2009 Palm Springs Film Fest to a large mostly receptive audience. The plot involves a Parisian attorney who travels to Monaco to defend a woman accused of murder. On arriving he finds that he's been assigned a bodyguard who becomes a major part of the story. He also rather quickly finds himself becoming involved with locals among them an aggressive young female who does the weather on a local TV channel but has much higher aspirations. Without giving away too much of the story this film seems to go deeper than it appears on the surface. It seemed to me to be an allegory to the state of affairs in France and many other places in the world. The loss of common decency and higher standards is a threat to our existence. The lawyer is a straight arrow old school fellow with high ethics who becomes seduced by a woman with all the trappings of modern society. She and her friends have little regard for what's right or wrong and just live for the moment with little thought about the consequences. The movie is enjoyable to watch even if you're not interested in subplots or extra meaning but this one is full of room for discussion after you leave the theater.".

Unfortunately the end result feels awkward and we are left unable to connect with the movie or the characters.Fabrice Luchini plays Bertrand Beauvois an elite lawyer coming to Monaco to work a high profile case. He is assigned a bodyguard Christophe Roschdy Zem and while in Monaco develops a relationship with a quirky weather girl Louise Bourgoin who was formerly romantically involved with the man assigned to protect him. Audrey our weather forecast girl is considerably younger than Beauvois and her behaviour will remind many viewers of traditional movies where a usually stuck up guy sees his life turned a little upside down by a wild woman. It helps that Louise Bourgoin is absolutely stunning. The classic European look you would expect in a Bond Girl. Unfortunately her acting is not as great as her looks which makes this Love Triangle of a sort rather inefficient. Luchini and Zem have slightly more chemistry and the bound they form as protector and protected is potentially interesting but never fully realized. The contrasts between the two social class education outlook on life still provides for the only interesting bits in the film. Unfortunately the film suddenly and unexpectedly slides into very dramatic territory. I do love when a movie elegantly does this but because of lack of character development it is difficult to buy the turn of events experienced here. I would be curious to see more of Fontaine's work because I love the general direction and tone this movie was going for but it failed in the execution. Better casting and more work on the script could have led to a balanced movie that would have been haunting and powerful. But in its actual state it just ends up being a forgettable movie because it fails to engage us enough to care about the events unfolding.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those with multiple personalities The Girl from Monaco La Fille de Monaco directed by Anne Fontaine could possibly do more good than therapy. Is it a light romantic comedy of a middleaged lawyer's ego and the uninhibited sexual spirit of a ditzy television weather girl combined with a trial for murder and hints of the Russian mafia? Is it a male melodrama of irony and rue where a middleaged lawyer's gonads lead him into humiliating situations that are at once humorous and embarrassing and where an erotic and selfish female weather reader is manipulating his hormones? Is it a sad set of experiences where lust and manipulation lead to unexpected but justifiable justice only leavened by the sense that certain actions were wellserved and that the protagonists understand finally their behavior? In other words The Girl from Monaco is a movie with at times great charm and amusement but which falls on its face because the director cannot make up her mind what she wants her movie to be about. With each shift into the next line of the story we can't help but finally realize that the line we just left is something we'd rather stay with. Fontaine isn't deliberately leading us on in my opinion but she seems to keep changing her idea of the house she's building after construction has started. Bertrand Beauvois Fabrice Luchini has traveled from Paris to Monaco to defend a woman charged with murdering a man she may or may not have been having an affair with. Beauvois is a top lawyer who wins his cases but seems to have less luck with women. He's a whiz with words though. Because the murdered man was a Russian with Russian mafia connections Beauvois is assigned protection Christophe Abadi Roschdy Zem. He's a tall lean taciturn man who insists on doing his job. When Beauvois a pale unimpressivelooking man with a modest sense of humor along with a sense of his own importance meets Audrey Varelia Louise Bourgoin the ditzy uninhibited weather reader we can see speculation move to lust with all the singleminded drive of a teenager looking at a Playboy centerfold. What we also see is Christophe's disapproval...and we see Audrey's uninhibited freespirited ways with her body that completely capture this little lawyer. Trust me this all is played for amusement centering on the fragile egos of middleaged men who actually believe gorgeous young women may fall for them. When we see what a collection of partying freeloaders Audrey runs with the movie starts making us uneasy. When we see how casually manipulative Audrey can be using her erotic charms to capture poor Bertrand by his hormones it's hard not to smile...and be uneasy. All the while the silent and serious Christophe tries to keep Bertrand ready for the trial each day. As Christophe does his job it turns out he might have a bit of history with Audrey. She seems to have known in exactly the Biblical sense just about every man she's ever met. What can I say? Bertrand gets his. Christophe gets his. Audrey gets hers. I'm not talking death. Necessarily. And I'm not talking about grim irony. It's just that a movie even one with all the finely nuanced amusement of the first third of this one that ends with the audience likely giving a shrug hasn't in my opinion been able to hold itself together. Fabrice Luchini is excellent. Roschdy Zem is impressive. And blond built Louise Bourgoin in her first movie managed to keep me lusting after her even when the last thing I knew I'd want would be to find myself in Bertrand Beauvois's shoes. The movie isn't a mess by any means. It just doesn't know what it wants to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a title like The Girl from Monaco a picture of a bodacious babe on the cover and a description about a neurotic lawyer defending a gangster's mother charged with the murder of a gigolo I figured this would be a crazy comedy... something between Legally Blonde and My Cousin Vinny but in French. Boy was I wrong.Certain filmgoers react negatively when they don't get what they expect. Me I don't care as long as it's good. And this movie is definitely good. It begins with enough lighthearted comedy to draw you in at the opening scene. Other good laughs are peppered throughout the first half. But you soon realize that it's all a clever candycoating masking a dark winding story beneath. In that respect I'd compare it to Art School Confidential 2006 or Jeux d'enfants 2003 or even Good Morning Vietnam 1987 which begin as comedies but soon trick us down a different path.If you go into this film with zero expectations or better yet expecting to be led to an unknown destination I can't imagine you not liking this film. The acting is top notch creating believable characters who are instantly likable despite their personality quirks. Even the Girl who is basically a slut of the highest magnitude comes across as cute charming and breezy. It's hard not to see elements of the legendary Brigitte Bardot in her unapologetic sexuality.And that's what this movie is really about expression vs repression openness vs modesty freedom vs selfcontrol. And we see the crazy results of people attempting to bridge between the two worlds. This movie is every bit as compelling as the Bardot films that first explored these sexuallycharged themes almost 50 years ago. We see that they're still topical today.A quick note about content... Even though this is a very sexual story it's not too explicit and I think there's only 1 brief nude scene the girl topless in bed. Most of the steamy stuff is implied through dialogue.Watch this backtoback with the Bardot classics And God Created Woman Night Heaven Fell Love is My Profession and so on. Maybe you'll agree it's been a while since a director has been able to capture that same spirit. This movie is so much more than a comedy. Soooo much more.".

The movie is lightly entertaining with the comedic elements and with the amazing looks of the girl who flaunts her body and looks in every scene she's in.SPOILER Then the movie decides to get serious and it lost me completely. the two men in the film can't resist her but they both think she's dangerous  a witch. I won't tell you what happens but you could easily see this film as a caution against female sexual freedom with the two men punishing her in the end.

The plot outline reads like a thriller but it says its supposed to be a comedy and it plays out more like a romantic drama. I can see the comedy elements and it is light in its nature but it's not laughoutloud funny. It's too strange to be romantic and nothing interesting develops to make this a thriller. Perhaps it really is a comedy as it claims just a not very funny one.It has high production value it's shot well and The Girl from Monaco is definitely beautiful but there's nothing in the story to recommend it.".

He is unaware of the fact that this innocuous action is being watched in detail by a bodyguard whose services have been provided to him without his knowledge. This is just the commencement of a series of zany adventures involving unusual people namely a fun loving lawyer a dedicated bodyguard and a promiscuous yet charmingly nubile weather woman. Although the title mentions the word 'Monaco' there is not much description of Monaco and its casinos. The film runs at a normal pace but gains momentum within second half when innocence is replaced by cunning. It is at that point some surprising elements are introduced to make the film appear interesting. Director Anne Fontaine has made quirky films in the past but 'The Girl From Monaco' is completely different from all her films. It tries hard to be a serious film but remains a comedy in essence.

Billy Wilder has a lot to answer for on several counts but not least for his masterpiece or one of them The Apartment which is a laughoutloud comedy for the first hour then switches effortlessly to drama and because it was Wilder he made it look so easy that everybody and his uncle Max thinks he can do it too.

If this isn't quite topdrawer Fontaine it'll do until another topdrawer Fontaine comes along. Fabrice Luchini that most quirky of French actors both on stage and screen and rumored to be engaged to Fontaine who may herself still be married or may not have been married as the case may be  and you think THIS film is ambiguous is at the head of proceedings as a top avocat shipped to Monaco to defend the mother of a gangster Stephane Audran wasted on a charge of murdering a gigolo because of the delicate nature of the case the gangster supplies Luchini with a bodyguard who may or may not develop a sexual attraction to Luchini the third element is a local weather girl with a moral compass that makes Sadie Thompson look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. Inevitably the uptight lawyer allows himself to be seduced by the bimbo half his age and equally inevitably it ends in tears.

	schema:reviewBody "In most of his films Fabrice Luchini plays very ordinary looking little guysnice but far from a ladykiller. Here he plays pretty much the same sort of nice safe guy...and inexplicably a gorgeous young freespirited lady seems to want him! What gives?!When the film begins Bertrand Luchini has been hired to defend a rich lady in a murder case in Monaco. She apparently killed her gigolo boyfriend...a man with mob ties! Bertrand seems like a good choicehe's a well respected lawyer and his image is squeaky clean. However because of the mob involvement his client orders a bodyguard Christophe Roschdy Zem to stick to Bertrand and protect him...just in case. While Bertrand isn't comfortable with this at first he comes to like the very laconic Christophe.Early on his time in Monaco Bertrand meets Audrey Louise Bourgoin at the local news station. She is a VERY chipper and full of life...and oddly seems very interested in Bertrand. In fact she soon begins to throw herself at him...and you wonder why. Perhaps she's turned on by how successful he is....perhaps she's an evil assassin...perhaps she's just had a head injury! All you know is that she not only wants to be with him...she WANTS him and is more than willing to put out for him! And at the same time Christophe who knows Audrey is NOT happy about all this and advises Bertrand to keep his distance from her. So what is going to come of all this? See this movie.Generally I would say that you should watch ANY Luchini film. He is a delightful actor and has a habit of picking really interesting projects and he's one of my favorite Frecnh actors. Even in his less than great films he is never boring and plays the sort of character the viewer can't help but like. This is THE reason I watched this movie in the first place...Luchini.So is this a really good Luchini film? No. His acting is great and I enjoyed the film BUT the ending is a real downer. Worth seeing yes....but the ending really left me frustrated.".

Here instead we got tomatoes that look exactly like people. But when you buy an attack of the killer tomatoes movie that shows a giant killer tomato attacking on the cover you expect to see a giant killer tomato attacking in the movie! John Astin as Gangreen was funny but I like the original movie's reason for tomato attacks. In the original man altered tomatoes to make them better but accidently gave them the ability to grow and attack people.In this movie that is all ignored and now the killer tomatoes were made by a evil professor in his basement.I think the original plot AND movie are much better but this films is still very funny in it's own way. And I am surprised it got away with many of the raunchy jokes while staying PG.Recommended if you want to laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "Return of the Killer Tomatoes! starts as it means to go on with a silly filmwithinafilm gag about it being the one dollar movie of the week on a cheap cable TV station. Once the film begins proper it seems that Professor Gangreen John Astin is experimenting with splicing human  tomato genes  has created tomato people or at least I think that's what's happening. One such tomato person is his good looking assistant Tara Karen Mistal who dislikes the way he treats her fellow tomatoes  runs away she ends up at pizza delivery guy Chad Finletter's Anthony Starke shop because he is the only other person she knows. They become romantically involved but the sinister Professor Gangreen sends his tomato person servant Igor Steve Lundquist to find capture  return her. Oh a young looking George Clooney is here as Matt Chad's best friend just to make the film even more bizarre.Coedited costarring cowritten  directed by John De Bello I thought Return of the Killer Tomatoes! was an OK comedy spoof that you simply can't take seriously. The script by De Bello Stephen F. Andrich Costa Dillon  J. Stephen Peace moves along at a fair pace  has plenty of cheap gags the best of which are centred around some tacky  blindingly obvious product placement a trend that was becoming popular in films at the time this was made the fact that tomatoes are now illegal  have to be smuggled into the country like drugs  the shortest car chase in cinema history. A lot of it is pretty much hit  miss you'll either end up in stitches rolling around on the floor or you'll be sat there stoney faced. Personally I found a few scenes mildly amusing but I thought much of the comedy here was far to predictable silly  juvenile to be effective. Also forget about any literal killer tomatoes because there aren't any as the film focuses on Tara  her adventures in the real world of which she had no knowledge of before at heart it's a fish out of water tale with the hapless Chad bailing her out of trouble. At the end of the day I found it an acceptable way to pass the time nothing more.Director De Bello doesn't do much  as a whole Return of the Killer Tomatoes! is a rather bland  forgettable film throughout.

Watchable if your in the right mood.

	onyx:emotionText "Return of the Killer Tomatoes! starts as it means to go on with a silly filmwithinafilm gag about it being the one dollar movie of the week on a cheap cable TV station. Once the film begins proper it seems that Professor Gangreen John Astin is experimenting with splicing human  tomato genes  has created tomato people or at least I think that's what's happening. One such tomato person is his good looking assistant Tara Karen Mistal who dislikes the way he treats her fellow tomatoes  runs away she ends up at pizza delivery guy Chad Finletter's Anthony Starke shop because he is the only other person she knows. They become romantically involved but the sinister Professor Gangreen sends his tomato person servant Igor Steve Lundquist to find capture  return her. Oh a young looking George Clooney is here as Matt Chad's best friend just to make the film even more bizarre.Coedited costarring cowritten  directed by John De Bello I thought Return of the Killer Tomatoes! was an OK comedy spoof that you simply can't take seriously. The script by De Bello Stephen F. Andrich Costa Dillon  J. Stephen Peace moves along at a fair pace  has plenty of cheap gags the best of which are centred around some tacky  blindingly obvious product placement a trend that was becoming popular in films at the time this was made the fact that tomatoes are now illegal  have to be smuggled into the country like drugs  the shortest car chase in cinema history. A lot of it is pretty much hit  miss you'll either end up in stitches rolling around on the floor or you'll be sat there stoney faced. Personally I found a few scenes mildly amusing but I thought much of the comedy here was far to predictable silly  juvenile to be effective. Also forget about any literal killer tomatoes because there aren't any as the film focuses on Tara  her adventures in the real world of which she had no knowledge of before at heart it's a fish out of water tale with the hapless Chad bailing her out of trouble. At the end of the day I found it an acceptable way to pass the time nothing more.Director De Bello doesn't do much  as a whole Return of the Killer Tomatoes! is a rather bland  forgettable film throughout. There are flashbacks to the original Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! 1978 to save money while he goes for zany comedy rather than bother with unimportant things like a story.Technically Return of the Killer Tomatoes! is OK at best but nothing spectacular. It's competent but nothing more.

But lets be fair the actor or actress in this movie who I think is the real star is Karen Mistal. She was hired for her obvious incredible beauty but frankly she really shines in this film as an actress. She plays the roll as a creation of the 'mad scientist' and brings real mystery in a lighthearted wayto the roll. I think it is a real pity that she never developed into a better known actress in any other movies.If you like kneeslapping nonsophisticated in your face humor this is the movie for you sort of like 'Airplane' or the 'Naked Gun' series type humor. If you want sophisticated humor I guess there is still WoodyAllen right? I liked it so much it was one of the first comedy VHS movies I bought and that was saying a lot back when I was a poor graduate student.And watchout for those veggies! PS.

	schema:reviewBody "Years after the original batch of evil tomatoes was destroyed by the song Puberty Love a new batch has been created  a batch that can be transformed into a humanoid appearance to blend in with the human population. Wilbur Finletter the original hero returns as his nephew unknowingly falls in love with Tara a tomato and the girlfriend of the evil Dr. Gangreen.While there's something to be said about sequels not being able to surpass the originals I find this to be an exception. The humor is campier and the jokes are lamer. But for some reason I really appreciate it. The visual gags are stepped up to the level of Airplane! or some Mel Brooks movie and I do not think this one should be neglected. Even in the beginning when clips are shown from the first movie the clips are well chosen to really bring out the funniest and most important parts adding something to the new saga.The original film was actually a student film at UCDavis and was redone in 1977 as what we know today. That could have been the end of the series but by early 1980s home video came around and gave the original a new lease on life and a sequel was inevitable... this time even produced by New World who had no input. The bar was set higher or lower and they succeeded.George Clooney appears. Actually he more than appears  he is on screen more than just about anyone. This is before he was big and he has a longhaired look as though he was auditioning for the part of Jesse on Full House but I guess he lost to John Stamos. Clooney is very lovable in this film pulling a Charlie Sheen act of womenchasing that suits him well. There is something funny in retrospect about him running a Meet Rob Lowe contest to meet women when now 2016 the women would much rather meet Clooney than Rob Lowe though Lowe has come back in the last few years.Some of the jokes are more subtle at least as subtle as a film like Killer Tomatoes can be. Take for example the Oliver North Federal Prison. At the time this was probably pretty funny. Today the audience who gets it will be much smaller they'll say Isn't he a commentator for Fox News?. And there are plenty of sex jokes but despite their prominence I never felt the film crossed into the childish realm of grossout humor. Even the nudity was more or less tastefully done I expected much more.For me the scene or scenes with the product placement running joke are among the funniest. We get the characters to break the fourth wall we get some slight jabs at low budget film and consumerism... and just in general the whole concept is funny. Some have pointed out that the gag was stolen by Wayne's World... how much this film or Wayne's World were actually paid by the companies they use in the joke remains unclear.If you liked the first film I cannot see why you would not love this. And if you grew up with the cartoon you will want to see this film since this is the one the series was based off of. I have yet to see Killer Tomatoes Eat France but I think it is safe to say that Return is the high point in the movie series.As always the best way to see this film is on the bluray released from Arrow Video. Besides the priceless audio commentary with creatorwriterdirector John DeBello there are also TV spots and other promotional items. Anthony Starke provides a nice interview concerning how he got involved and the use of product placement. Clooney unfortunately is not interviewed but that is not really a surprise. Stephen Peace a series regular is also not interviewed most likely because he went on to be a notable California politician of all things.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Killer Tomantoes are back and honestly this is one of my favorite stupid movies. I think this was honestly better than the Original movie 1978's Attack of the Killer Tomantoes. It's works as a parody of the real threat of Communism. It also spoofs old monster movies such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956. The running gags are just over the top fun. I like the silly product placements the secret word game show and everybody liking Full Contact America's Cup Yacht Racing. The sight gags sound gags satire and clever humor all works here. There is a lot of catchy quotes in this film. There is only a few jokes that hit rock bottom for me. Director John De Bello made the sequel to a campy cultclassic better than ever. De Bello even pokes fun at the movie themselves as he breaks the fourth wall to reveal the cheapness of the production on several occasions. The lowbudget can be a bit disappointing like showing old footage from the first film way too much. Not only did De Bello renew the inane humor of the original but also bring in new kooky characters to work with some of the original cast. The hilariously offbeat performances of all those actors account for much of the film's success. Professor Gangreen John Astin and his weatherman wannabe dumb hunky assistant Igor Steve Lundquist are just some of the new characters in the film. Their goal is to transformed simple tomatoes into vicious Rambo look alike tomatomen in another evil attempt at world domination! It is up to a new group of heroes to stop Professor Gangreen before the streets run red with the Red Meance. That group is a group of pizza makers Matt George Clooney and Chad Anthony Starke who works for their Uncle Lt. Finletter's notomatoes pizza parlor Steven Rock Peace reprising his role from the original movie.This was George Clooney's first full length film and compared to the first killer tomato movie the acting is pretty darn good throughout. Still I kinda get confused if I'm watching George Clooney here or John Stamos. They look very similar to each other at the time. They uncovered Gangreen's scheme when Chad meets Professer Gangreen's assistant Tara Karen Mistel who escape from his hide out with a fuzzy tomato or FT for short. Karen Mistal is very hot and stunning. She gives off some pretty good humor parts as well. He soon find out that there is something about her that doesn't add up. Can the group save the world from Professer Gangreen and his armies of tomatomen? If you didn't like this movie well I feel sorry for you. It's just fun mindless comedy horror flick. The point of the film is be off the wall stupid film. So it's hard to criticize a film for that. It's suppose to be cheap dumb and cheesy. If you don't like it maybe BigBreasted Girls Go to the Beach and Take Their Tops Off will be your type of film. If you do like this movie make sure to watch the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes The Animated Series. If you haven't saw this movie. Go watch it and make some toast eggs bacon toast waffles and toast with it.".

In addition to these tomato men warriors he has also created a beautiful assistant named Tara Boumdeay Karen Mistal who obeys his every command. But that changes one day when she discovers Professor Gangreen attempting to destroy one of his tomato projects. Because of this she runs away to be with a young man by the name of Chad Finletter Anthony Starke who works in a pizzeria for his uncle Wilbur Finletter J. Stephen Peace who happens to be the hero of the previous Tomato Wars. And then the action really begins. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was much better than its predecessor due in large part to the improved humor and somewhat imaginative plot. Likewise having an attractive actress like Karen Mistal certainly didn't hurt either. Unfortunately the lowproduction values inhibited this film to a certain degree and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.".

I'm not sure if it played many theaters then again it could have hit the midnight movie circuit. In any event it was hilarious by being intentionally low budget and glorying in that format. It became popular enough that a sequel was bound to happen. Who would have thought that it would have George Clooney in the second lead role though? Mad Professor Gangreen John Astin is planning a produce protest an herbal uprising a tomato tornadoin short he is planning on having the tomatoes once again attack the world. Using music he can change tomatoes into various human forms. One of those is Tara Karen Mistal a ripe tomato turned into a gorgeous human who isn't pleased with the way Gangreen treats her fellow veggies. She runs off only to meet our hero Chad Anthony Starke and fall in love.After Gangreen sends his assistant out to capture Tara and bring her home Chad and his best friend Matt Clooney attempt to thwart the plans of Gangreen. Discovering that certain songs change the tomatoes back and forth he's heartbroken when one song turns Tara back into a tomato. Finding the right song to change her back he and Matt do their best to stop Gangreen and his 'mato minions.The movie not only uses its cheesiness to its advantage it grasps it with both hands and strangles every single joke possible out of it. It basks in the glory of being a grade B movie and relishes in that format playing on words and situations that mingle vegetables and humor for some decent laughs and a lot of fun. This isn't Oscar material and all involved know that. Instead it embraces the genre it is a part of a goes for all it can.The acting isn't amazing but well done by all involved. I'm not sure this is one that Clooney is proud to have on his resume but he should be. It displays his ability for comedy long before he was able to put it out there for fans to enjoy much later. The rest of the cast might not have achieved near the stardom but they all put forth a great effort here. Astin most famously known for playing Gomez Addams in the TV series THE ADDAMS FAMILY does a great job here as the mad scientist intent on overtaking the world. He would continue to play the character in the next sequel as well as the animated series based on the films.Even though this film is not the type to receive a ton of respect it gets it in spades here from Arrow Video. Like all of their other releases their offering it in the best presentation possible with a 1080p bluray copy. The extras aren't abundant but the odds of those even being available are small. Included are brand new audio commentary with writerdirector John De Bello a brand new interview with Stark the original theatrical trailer a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin and a fully illustrated collector's booklet featuring writing by critic James Oliver.If you remember the films from your days at the video store or maybe from the animated series then odds are you'll enjoy this one. Fans of Clooney looking to make their collection complete will want this one as well. It's a fun time that has been given a new life thanks to Arrow Video.".

	schema:reviewBody "Part Two of the infamous comedy horror series is the best one insofar as it's the least bad. It was made in 1988 ten years after the ultralow budget original. Anthony Starke is very game in the role of Chad Finletter nephew of Wilbur Steve Peace hero of the Great Tomato War of '78. Chad works in his uncle's pizzeria  where tomato coverings are now outlawed because they're evil  along with his buddy Matt a magnificently mulleted George Clooney. Meanwhile genesplicing Professor Gangreen John Astin is creating an army of tomato people hoping to conquer the world. One day one of his creations Tara Karen Mistal escapes and seeks sanctuary in the arms of Chad. Gangreen sends his henchman Igor Steve Lundquist to retrieve her. Chad and Tara fall hopelessly in love but Gangreen will stop at nothing to retrieve his test tube babe. Chad Tara and Matt must band together along with Chad's uncle and his troop of weirdos to defeat Gangreen and save the world from the red menace. You might as well skip the dreadful first movie because we get a full recap here. Return is far more watchable thanks to a vaguely coherent script and less of a chaotic sketch show structure. Most of the best stuff happens early on where there's a ton of fun in Tara's fishoutofwater flailing bumping up against Chad's bumbling charm. And there's great brochemistry between Starke and Clooney. The film is pure spoof falling somewhere between the Mel Brooks and Zucker brothers camps the fourth wallbreaking elements of the former and the cringeworthy puns of the latter. At one point a character opens a China closet and finds the Great Wall of China inside. It's not upper Zucker by any means but somewhere around the Top Secret range in terms of gag hit rate. There are also countless references to horror film contemporaries. We get a bit of Weird Science the mad lab of Reanimator the genemashing horror of The Fly and the deadeyed hottieontheloose of Frankenhooker. It's all powered by some fantastic synthrock music which doubles down on the echosnare. Plus a Bacharachstyled ballad as the lovers prance on the beach whilst being bothered by a creepy mime. Eminently good natured and low on gore Return emphasises the comedy over the horror making it more accessible than its title suggests. There really isn't much killing at all. The problem is that beyond the first act it's not consistently funny either so as far as cultdom goes it is niche. Set expectations to moderate though and it's a fun screwy ride.".

The jet flying overhead was a mystery where did it come from who was in it and what was it doing?The scientific devices were fun to watch especially the ray weapon. Being unable to grasp the concept of sabotage I didn't appreciate why the device was not operating as designed. But what had the biggest effect on me was the action of the robots. Their running amok in the lab scared me to death. Maybe I picked up on the terror of the lab's occupants.The combination of confusion and fear made watching the movie on TV unpleasant but fascinating.

In GOG Tors brings in then brand new inventions such as jets computers robots high frequency sound cryogenics sunlight as a weapon electronic surveillance atomic power and even manmade satellites which would not become reality for 3 more years. To an audience unfamiliar with such things it was exiting and scary. Especially scary when you were made to think such super weapons were under the control of a foreign power.

The unseen enemy behind it all is clearly the old Soviet Union setting the film apart from so many films which depict the science itself as evil or suspect. Director Herbert Strock was there along with Joe Dante and Leonard Maltin. Dante interviewed Strock who was still spry and proud of his film. Ironically Strock like Andre De Toth has monocular vision and couldn't guage the 3D effects himself.

Frozen so cold in fact that their bodies shatter when they fall over which because of budgetary constraints they do offscreen. For act two the security officer and his undercover girlfriend security agent take us on a guided tour of the base meeting a mixed bag of identical scientist types who lecture at great length their experiments show us short clips of stock footage by way of illustration and then explain and why they could not have been the mysterious killer and to tell you the truth the film almost grinds to a halt with tedium. This procession of not too outlandishideas may have been pure Goshwow! The future is going to be so Cooool! at the time it was made but it all looks dated and plodding now.Act Three. Action!  slowly segueing into hilarious ineptitude. More people get bumped off! The chemist who was analysing some mysterious 'atomic powder' found in a suspect device is poisoned by a pot plant so radioactive that simply putting a glass dome over it cuts most of the clicking of the hero's Geiger counter. The acrobats in their antigravity vests made of a 'new alloy of aluminium' are spun to death in their spacesuits. The head of base security is somethinged to death by sound waves Get out! Sound waves at this intensity can kill! Actually I'm not really sure WHAT happens to him his shirt sort of explodes while he is trying to cut the cables to a set of electric tuning forks and then he falls over.Just why he is trying to cut the cables to a set of electric tuning forks is not really clear either but as he was such a terrible actor I was just willing him to die by this point so I wouldn't have to look at him any more and didn't care about the details. More action! A robot goes on the rampage in the computer room. Can you use a flame thrower? asks its creator in an impenetrably thick German accent while keeping it at bay with a short stick Yes! cries our hero. Melt him down! It'z the only vay to stop him! Then in the heat of the moment the scientist's accent goes into hyperdrive and I have absolutely NO idea what he says next. I have played that section of the movie over and over again and it still sounds like Time bext zoim  in demzoim down ze hall  hurry up! but whatever he does say our hero understands and he rushes off  that or he'd figured the odds had just turned against him. Killer robot AND insane babbling German scientist? Stuff it I'm off. But no! He returns with the flame thrower. Unfortunately the mad German scientist has tripped over a claw hammer lying in the middle off the floor and been strungled to death by the robot. Suddenly the alarm sounds! The reactor! The other killer berserk robot is in the reactor room removing the control rod. That's right. THE control rod. This atomic pile has a control room with a little lidded wooden box mounted on the wall. Open the lid and you can pull out THE control rod which starts a carbon arc like you used to find in old projectors and throws the hilariously inept 'Atomic Indicator' dangerously into the dark beige. Our heroes arrive set fire to the robot and replace the rod. Whew! Saved! But! What's this? Coming through the door is killer robot number one who has busted out of the other lab!!!  and the heroes' flame thrower is out of gas! But just when things look really bad... for the heroes I mean the movie has been looking really bad for ages ...in through the doors bursts aged venerable head scientist Herbert Marshall waving ANOTHER flame thrower every nuclear power plant should have at least two. Unfortunately his flame thrower doesn't work so well. Just when... etc. The stock footage of USAF planes we saw taking off earlier shoot down a mysterious fibreglass aircraft which has been flying about overhead eavesdropping on the supercomputer and hijacking it to commit the murders.Now there's a really daft idea.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say the title of my review is not for the film itself but for the excellent bluray 3D edition that has returned the film its brightness. Superb colors amazing 3d deepness quality. This IS true 3d and one of the best 3d restorations I have ever seen that is a joy for the viewer. This does not mean the film has other interests apart from the visual one. Filmed in George air force base near California it has an interesting  and atypical for a scifi movie plot. In fact the opening scene in the cryogenic research lab. is one of the best frightening ones I have seen in movies. Do not expect monsters or aliens here but a more subliminal whodunit mistery story that frightens in a more subtle permanent way. I also like the fact that many scientific artifacts and tests done in the base are shown and briefly explained although some of them are not too accuracy real like radiation travelling straight like being in a sort of scientific tour. That probably will defraud viewers who expect a terror film which is not at least in its typical form here terror flows underneath. Ivan Tors who wrote the script was a scifi fan and avid reader of Scientific American so he did not want to do a monster film but one scientifically accurated and with a realistic futuristic basis. The secret base where the action takes place is a sort Nasa precedent four years before it was created in 1958 developing a space station that enables man to live in space. And by the way it does not takes place in outer space as both opening and ending titles may suggest but in an underground base in the New Mexico desert. Nice job by Richard Egan as a security expert who comes to investigate several murders and sabotage in the base Herbert Marshall as chief scientist and the rest of the cast taking their roles seriously.If you have the chance to watch this film in a big 3D tv screen you will really enjoy it and I do strongly recommend it. Also not to miss the bluray 3D extras that include interesting interviews with director Herbert L. Strock explaining how he could film a 3D movie having monocular vision like Andr de Toth who also directed 3D movie House of wax or finding Tors script too documentary toned and with master 3D cameraman Lothrop Worth and a blink of the highly interesting restoration process where not only the bright colors and deepness can be seen but also the editing process of removing film marks and stains or cutting unaccurate angle views such as hanging microphones seen by mistake and the difficulties finding left side negative print that had been missing for yearsand the hard process to manage matching it properly with the remaining right eye negative since it was very deteriorated. You can see in NOVAC computer a precedent of Hal 2001. Not for everyone you will enjoy this film if you prefer feeling frightened more than watching it. If you like this film you will probably enjoy Forbidden planet as well. As bonus a rarely seen tandemrotor McCulloch MC4C helicopter appears in the film. One of the first movis with an helicoper in it. And finally for those who are interested in ancient mithology and history Gog and Magog the land of Gog are respectively the names of the governor and the region linked in the genesis to the apochalipsis and final judgement. So you may have an idea of the roles they play in the film. Final note in the original trailer added as an extra in the 3D bluray edition we can see an aparently deleted scene chemist scientist fiance approaching her stealthily. By the way guess who put the atomic powder in the device?".

	schema:reviewBody "3D movies really took off in the early 1950s from House of Wax to Dial M for Murder to uh CatWomen of the Moon. By the time Gog 1954  was released to theaters though the craze had subsided quite a bit. So much so in fact that although it was filmed in 3D most theaters had rid themselves of their 3D projectors and Gog was instead released in 2D to an underwhelmed audience. It apparently was shown in 3D just a small handful of times mainly in California. And then after Gog's theatrical run the 3D prints were damaged. 3D movies at the time were put together using a twocamera setup left side of a scene right side of a scene the resulting films were then combined. The left side of the film was deemed beyond repair for decades until new technology came along. When I saw it recently at the American Film Institute's Silver Theater during its inaugural Fantastic Film Showcase it was apparently the first time the movie had been screened in 3D in Maryland. Cool! In the movie a military investigator played by Richard Egan arrives at a remote desert base to look into the death of a scientist and his assistant. There are plenty of researchers at the base and Egan learns that they're all working toward one goal  a space station! This is well before any humans had even made it to space of course so to the contemporary audience this must have seemed fantastical. Egan meets the various researchers in turn including Dr. Van Ness Herbert Marshall who's in charge of the whole shebang and his assistant Joanna Constance Dowling. But most intriguing aren't the humans at the base it's these two 600pound robots named Gog and Magog. Don't ask me why they're so named. Obviously since the name of the movie is Gog these two will factor into the plot somehow.For a 60yearold movie the 3D effects are pretty good. Sure sometimes their use is a bit over the top  that is there are scenes that appear to exist solely because of the 3D feature  but there's no sense of overuse. The viewer isn't bludgeoned with 3D and instead 3D sort of assimilated into the movie.This being a 50s scifi movie don't expect much in the way of scientific accuracy. There's an unintentionally funny scene where one snooty scientist scoffs that man is never meant to be in outer space. Never! Here we are 62 years later and we've been to the moon and sent robots to Mars and spacecraft out of the solar system. So there! If you get a chance to watch Gog in 3D please do. It's not as if it won't make sense in good old 2D but the threadbare plot and the strained acting will bother you much less if you can enjoy the nowantiquated extra dimension.".

Other similar disasters begin to occur and it becomes obvious that some outside force is causing all of these situations to occur. Some of the situations are rather scary with one experiment involving potential astronauts on a rotating machine failing when they are unable to stop it. Another situation involving loud sound decimals has one of the scientists literally risking his life to save the others. Another even scarier scene has large mirrors literally able to start fires by spreading its radioactive light on various parts of the lab causing one of the female scientists to run around the laboratory in panic. But this will be known for the large robots with four large arms that seem to come to life because of the outside influence becoming violent and dangerous and seemingly unstoppable. Pretty Constance Dowling and veteran actor Herbert Marshall offer Egan fine support and while the situation itself seems rather farfetched considering the time politically in which it was made the cold war and certain issues of internet hacking today there are some timely elements of it that are very thought provoking. The film seems rather cramped in its underground lab setting and the color is rather garishly faded. But there is a final scene that shows a truth about humanity we haven't faced that we don't seem to learn from disasters and will continue to venture to places in science and into space where some believe we should not go.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though some claim that either HORSE FEATHERS OR DUCK SOUP was the greatest Marx Brothers opus A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has to be Marxdom's signature film.

After OPERA the Marx Brothers' scripts always revolved around either an attempt to get a romantic couple together or became an effort to save an institution from going under i.e. THE BIG STORE A DAY AT THE RACES HORSE FEATHERS THE BIG CIRCUS.Margaret Dumont is established once and for all as Groucho's perfect romantic staple and a Marx Bros. movie just doesn't seem right without her. Sig Rumond appears to have been created in a Marx Brothers comedy factory and serves sensationally as the urbane Marx antagonist vying for Dumont's favors though upended time and time again by Groucho. A young Kitty Carlisle and Allen Jones provide the romance and musicthough many audiences never realize how fine an operatic voice Carlisle had in those days.So many hilarious and classic routines fill A NIGHT AT THE OPERA that the movie offers itself as a study in Komedy 101 the unforgettable contract bit between Chico and Groucho Chico can't read. As they try to sign an agreement about the rights to manage singer Allen Jones they tear clause after clause off the paper until Chico finally asks What's this? Oh replies Groucho that's just a sanity clause. Chico bursts out laughing. Oh you canna' fool me there ain't' no sanity Klaus!... The crowded state room scene where Groucho Chico and Hapro stowaway in a tiny cubicle and the shoebox crams with more and more people until Mrs. Claypool Dumont opens the door and everyone spills out...The hotel scene where Detective Henderson tries to nail the brothers for stowingaway and everyone races back and forth between suites furniture is switched and Henderson is left wondering if he's nuts...But it is the film's finale during a live performance at the New York opera house that is perhaps the comedy team's grandest movie climax. The police still after Harpo for stowing away try to arrest him during a live performance. He breaks through the theater's backstage swings over the proscenium like a trapeze artist and at one point tears off the dress of one of the singers. Well now we're finally getting somewhere! Groucho opines from the audience.What a shame A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is not on television more often. Young people should be treated to comedy as it once was when laughter depended upon uproarious wit and a brand of physical comedy perfected by comedians through years of refining their craft in vaudeville. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is nothing less than an American comedy classic.Trivia Maragaret Dumont appeared with Groucho on THE Hollywood PALACE television show in 1965 and the couple did a brief repartee from GROUCHO's famous Captain Spaulding routine. The next day Dumont passed away...Her last film was in 1964 in the starstudded WHAT A WAY TO GO...Always playing a haughty spinstress with money Dumont was in fact a millionairess in real life and commuted between Hollywood and London....Few realize what a fine operatic singer Kitty Carlisle was in the 1930's. In the 1950's and '60's she was a regular panelist on television quiz shows such as I'VE GOT A SECRET...She was also married to playwright Moss Hart who collaborated with George Kaufman on YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER and many other plays. YOU CAN'T won the Pulitzer Prize...Allen Jones was the father of popular singer Jack Jones...Groucho said that it was while hanging out of an airplane in A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA 1946 that he finally realized the brothers had pretty much reached the end of the line in movies...The last picture in which all three brothers appeared was THE STORY OF MANKIND in 1957. Groucho played the part of Sir Isaac Newton...Groucho wrote many books MEMOIRS OF A MANGY LOVER and LETTERS FROM GROUCHO...Harpo Marx also wrote his own autobiography HARPO SPEAKSa fine expose of the brothers' early years and the many stage shows they did perfecting their mayhem...When the stock market crashed in 1929 Groucho lost every dime he had about 250000...In the 1950's Groucho hosted his own television quiz showYOU BET YOUR LIFE and both Harpo and Chico made surprise appearances...Chico was a lifetime gambler and would bet on anything...MINNIE'S BOYS a stage play about the influence of Marx mother Minnie was pretty much a flop in the 1970's...One of the alltime great quotations about the Marx Brothers came from playwright George Kaufman who after watching the comedy team tear apart his script on stage in the early years observed I could have sworn I just heard one of the original lines from the play....Groucho was selfconscious about his lack of formal education and once had the chance to meet poet T.S. Eliot. He read many of Eliot's works and boned up on literature. When the two men did finally meet all Eliot wanted to talk about was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA...One of Groucho's final performances just before he died was at Carnegie Hall in New York and it was a smashing success. He was accompanied by pianist Marvin Hamlisch...Film critic James Agee once said that the worst thing the Marx Brothers ever did was still better than everybody else...Dennis Caracciolo".

The stateroom scene is of course a classic and my favorite part is when Groucho tells the housekeeper I want two pillows on that bed and Harpo sound asleep and being moved everywhere including onto a tray of food.But nothing beats the last half hour  the performance of Il Trovatore with Harpo using the stage ropes like Tarzan and Chico playing baseball in the orchestra while Groucho sells peanuts.

Why they cast the blond Jones as a tenor named Baroni  well there you go. He sings very well and is quite handsome. Kitty Carlisle is the diva waiting petite and pretty and singing music out of her vocal type with the exception of Alone. Stridono lassu and Leonora in Trovatore were both much too heavy for her. She does sing well and what a woman  she's still alive and recently performed at a New York supper club recently at the age of 95.The only problem with any Marx Brothers film is that when they aren't in front of the camera suddenly their films become very slow. Because I was trained in opera and have some interest in it this was less the case than with some of their other films.

Some Marxpurists complain ANatO is when the brothers started to grow soft and their quality started to decline. For one thing instead of ridiculing romantic couples the love story subplot plays a big part they support them. Also it's not as surreal or satirical as their past films. To those purists I say Lighten up! ANatO is just as funny as anything the Marx Bros did in the past heck I think it's funnier than Monkey Business and it's withstood the test of time perfectly. In fact ANatO is said to be Groucho's favorite he even called his previous films duds! The film is filled with jabs at the upper class and double entendres courtesy of Groucho. SampleMrs. Claypool Do you have everything Otis?Otis I haven't had any complaints yet!The love story subplot isn't as nauseating as 1937's A Day at the Races. Allan Jones may be a bit too mushy but Kitty Carlisle the love interest is cool and calm enough to help it go down easily that's really her singing by the way. Chico and Harpo have some inspired moments such as their gleeful butchering of Il Travotore sp?. The hapless villains are the funniest Marx foils ever and the finale is just uproarious. ANatO is a wonderfully silly romp and it's rather harmless so kids can probably watch and enjoy it. The famous stateroom scene is nothing short of brilliant and you'll find yourself humming along to Cosi Cosa I just wish the ballad Alone had been left well alone. Don't miss this hilarious masterpiece. And now on with the opera!!".

It also brings forth their most popular comic foil of all Margaret Dumont from their Broadway to Paramount days and the return to a formula story and time out for musical interludes either by the brothers or the romantic lovers originally done in their initial films of THE COCOANUTS 1929 and ANIMAL CRACKERS 1930. Aside from now being The Three Marx Brothers Zeppo who has since retired their characters have been toned down a bit which helps. However at MGM with this their best film for the studio Groucho and Harpo become victims instead of instigators with such notable scenes as Harpo employed as a dresser for an abusive opera tenor Walter Wolfe King who slaps hits and uses a whip on him at one point off camera whenever getting out of line with his buffoonery and Groucho who always wins out in every situation physically and verbally getting kicked down four flights of stairs which indicates they are not always indestructible yet remain in character from the old days whenever possible. Chico retains his wiseacre Italian character remaining notably the same from his previous efforts however things will start to change not for the better for him and his brothers in the movies to follow.Plot summary Introduction takes place in Milan Italy where Otis B. Driftwood Groucho agrees to represent dowager Mrs. Claypool Margaret Dumont into society by arranging for her to invest 200000 to Herman Gottlieb Sig Ruman director of the opera company so that he can afford to bring opera singers Rudolpho Lassparri Walter King and Rosa Castaldi Kitty Carlisle to New York City. Rudolpho loves Rosa but she is more interested in Ricardo Baroni Allan Jones an unknown singer working as a chorusman but with the help of Fiorelli Chico acting as his manager and his partner Tomasso Harpo the trio head for America by becoming stowaways on the S.S. Americus hiding out in Driftwood's tiny stateroom in order for Ricardo to get his big chance as a singer. After Driftwood and his cronies arrive in at the Metropolitan Opera House thanks to them in disrupting Rudolpho's performance that the art of opera will never be the same again.The musical program Alone sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed CosiCosa sung by Allan Jones by Bronislau Kaper Walter Jurmann and Ned Washington All I Do is Dream of You by Brown and Freedpiano solo by Chico Marx Alone harp solo by Harpo Marx and selections from Il Trovatore by Guiseppi Verdi Di quella pira Miserere Anvil Chorus Stride la Vampa Strido lassu and Miserere. Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle doing their duet Alone him on the pear and she from the boat dock Chico's fast finger piano playing and Harpo's harp solo in a serious manner as he performs to a little old lady facial shadow front only who looks on approvingly may not be highlights but are truly memorable moments.Highlights Whenever anyone goes into discussion regarding A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the first thing that comes immediately to mind is that famous state room scene involving Groucho Chico and the sleeping Harpo with various others involved crammed together until the door opens having them all falling out like dominoes. This hilarious bit is one that's remembered best with fondness and admiration. However there are others worth noting The opening where Dumont awaits for Groucho at a restaurant for an hour only to find him at the table behind her eating with another lady is priceless Groucho and Chico contract exchanges that becomes a sanity clause arrested stowaway Harpo's attempt in escaping his detention cabin by crawling out of a porthole and hanging onto a rope outside only to be dumped into the ocean Jones Chico and Harpo in bearded disguises posing as celebrity aviators to give speeches on coasttocoast radio with the silent Harpo covering up his muteness by constantly drinking glasses of water the disappearance of beds in Groucho's hotel room while the plainclothesman detective Robert Emmett O'Connor investigates and of course the climactic opera chaos by the Marxes with one great bit with the orchestra playing the overture to Take Me Out to the Ball Game after coming to the page with the planted song sheets with Groucho acting as a vendor yelling Peanuts! Peanuts! to the patrons. A classic with Callas.The supporting players Newcomer Allan Jones steps in for the role that might have been offered to Zeppo. He is a likable actor with a fine singing voice who performs well opposite Kitty Carlisle another recruit from Paramount and rare screen appearance being best known as the TV panelist in the long running quiz show To Tell the Truth.Footnote It is quite evident that prints that have been circulating since commercial television days isn't complete. Missing footage is quite evident during the opening minutes of the story where the movie originally began with a musical number prior to the restaurant scene involving Groucho and Dumont. At present this along with other cut footage no longer exists. Timed at 96minutes the 90 minute version is the one available on Turner Classic Movies VHS and DVD formats. Maybe one of these years a completely restored print of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA will suffice but for now this will have to do.In closing Get out those opera glasses and have yourself a grand night at the opera. 12".

Peanuts! to the patrons. A classic with Callas.The supporting players Newcomer Allan Jones steps in for the role that might have been offered to Zeppo. He is a likable actor with a fine singing voice who performs well opposite Kitty Carlisle another recruit from Paramount and rare screen appearance being best known as the TV panelist in the long running quiz show To Tell the Truth.Footnote It is quite evident that prints that have been circulating since commercial television days isn't complete. Missing footage is quite evident during the opening minutes of the story where the movie originally began with a musical number prior to the restaurant scene involving Groucho and Dumont. At present this along with other cut footage no longer exists. Timed at 96minutes the 90 minute version is the one available on Turner Classic Movies VHS and DVD formats. Maybe one of these years a completely restored print of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA will suffice but for now this will have to do.In closing Get out those opera glasses and have yourself a grand night at the opera. 12";

There's comedy there's music there's musical numbers there's action there's drama there's romance there's even fake beards and Take me out the Ballgame performed in an opera house by accident of course. It also gives a showcase for its main three jovial anarchists Groucho Harpo and Chico as smashing as its production it's a million dollars well spent and when you aren't laughing you're at least smiling or enjoying a melodic tune or some good opera melodies. Whether or not it hits so strongly that it might top the quintessential Marx flick Duck Soup can be arguable for as long as one can type keys or stretch vocal chords. There's good arguments on either side and while I myself might be inclined to say that Duck Soup is the best film of the Marxs Night at the Opera might be as if not more plain fun.And it's so unforgettable with scene after moment after continuous gag that goes so far along that it becomes funny just seeing how long these guys can keep going. There's a scene midway through A Night at the Opera that might be just about perfect Groucho has his tiny room. At first the gag is simply that the room is almost too small to even fit the luggage case he has also fitting inside Chico Harpo and the conventional leadingman opera singer stowaway. Groucho orders breakfast an amazing and wonderfully long gag involving an order of hardboiled eggs and then the maids come in and then others come in and then more come in and lines like You know I had a premonition you were going to show up. The engineers right there in the corner. You can chop your way right through. Harpo is still asleep of course trying to cure his insomnia by sleeping on top of everybody else shuffling around... it all builds so much that it's like its own piece of frantic combustible music and it's one of those pure scenes in movies that one can never really top only try and imitate and get OK in their own right.There are others that strike up such strong laughs exchanges of dialog that go on like verbal assaults in the form of an argument over a contract between Groucho and Chico Sanity clause I don't believe in it! or just the continuous string of syncopated insults and throwaway lines from Groucho that cut right to the matter and even find some new twists one would never think of outside of his mind. But it's not all just raucous and crazy behavior from the stars there's also the opera itself that big long sequence where the plan is unfolded and WAR is unleashed upon the production my favorite is the bit where the various set pieces on stage keep falling down behind the singer at one point falling right in front him and a kind of sweetness that pops up often that keeps it from being too uh... insane like say Duck Soup could arguably be called.Insanity of course is what the Marx's excel at an organized chaos of comedy that is so seamless because of how energized and random some of the things happen with but there is logic as warped as it can be like the other classic number when the brothers and opera singer carry out the beds one by one around the window or through the door evading the totally perplexed eyes of the officer. There's such a kind of graceful choreography to this that is slipped under the veneer or complete WHAT! moments that keep these movies so fresh so very long after. And it's a sweet movie too a movie may be criticized for taking an extended break from the story however loose it may be and Night at the Opera can have that against it. But the break it takes with the big musical number and dance and Chico and Harpo's playing on the piano and latter on the harp is so touching and fun and inventive. You'll be smiling and just wrapped up in the childlike awe of these moments as opposed to grumbling and wondering where's the story? Story? Marx don't need no stinking story! Between the three brothers and on occasion even the slightly weaker but still crucial normal plot line with the love between the talented amateur singer and the star played by Carlisle there's enough material at times for two movies. The real joy of Night at the Opera and it happens often is seeing these three guys go to work at the best of what they do Groucho's remarks and verbal intelligence or just damn bravery Chico's slightly dim but wellmeaning immigrant type and Harpo as... Harpo damn it he doesn't need to be explained well maybe the water bit is a little strange but par for the course. It's joyful and hilarious cinema on parade even better on a big screen albeit the noticeable random jump cuts are annoying in any format.".

	schema:headline " Ironically the most memorable film about opera ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Brothers were set adrift by Paramount in 1933 after making arguably their best satiric comedy DUCK SOUP. For two years they rarely worked together an exception was a briefly heard radio show called FLYWHEEL SHYSTER AND FLYWHEEL about crooked lawyers which had Groucho and Chico  unfortunately like their silent film HUMORISK the recordings of the show no longer exist. Zeppo left the team to pursue a career as a movie agent. Chico and Harpo did some band touring.The scrips have survived and been published. Then Chico made a valuable contact  he played cards with Irving Thalberg who was almost as powerful a figure at MGM as Louis B. Mayer. Thalberg decided to sign the brothers to a contract where he'd be their producer. The contract was a unique one  it promised the brothers a percentage of the gross of the first two films which was a rarity in Hollywood acting contracts. The contract also enabled the brothers to perform their material from the film live on stage. This enabled them to hone material as they did in vaudeville and on Broadway. They were lucky in the writers for this first film George S. Kaufman Morris Ryskine and Al Boasberg. And they had a good cast including their old female Marx Brother Margaret Dumont.A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has since it appeared in 1935 been accepted as one of the best Marx vehicles and ties with DUCK SOUP as their supreme work. It's detractors say that it had too many points that would bring down the Brothers later films after A DAY AT THE RACES such as the love story that is tied to the plot and the fact that the brothers are frequently brought to a low point from which to rise with all their power against their opponents.

Ruman is willing to have Dumont finance the season of the Met and is trying to sign up one Rodolfo Lasspari Walter Woolf King as his new tenor. King is a good tenor but an egotist and bully constantly beating his servant Tomasso Harpo. He has been trying to get his soprano Rosa Castaldi Kitty Carlisle to take an interest in him on a social basis. But Rosa is in love with a junior tenor in the chorus Ricardo Baroni Allan Jones. Ricardo's friend Fiorello Chico is his agent and manages to hoodwink Driftwood into contracting to get Ricardo to be the lead tenor at the Met while Gottlieb manages to get a contract with Lasspari. The plot follows how the characters get to America by ocean liner Ricardo Fiorello and Tomasso as stowaways how the stowaways and Driftwood run afoul of the law by a public hoax how Driftwood and Rosa both lose their positions at the Opera and how the Marxes get their revenge on Gottlieb the New York Police and Lasspari in the concluding twenty minutes of the film. Pauline Kael once described the conclusion as The Brothers do to IL TROVATORI what should be done to Il TROVATORI. It is a worthy target as far as popular operas go.

It's improbable plot involving stolen children and gypsies is shown for what it is when in demolishing the production Harpo causes various backdrops to rise and fall including a pushcart on an American street and a battleship's gun turret to fall behind the gypsy woman's campfire! You just cannot take it seriously.The conclusion is wonderful but so is the double talk of the contract negotiations between Groucho and Chico later repeated with Ruman the great stateroom sequence written by Al Boasberg the City Hall greeting by the Mayor to the three Russian aviators and the wonderful almost surreal sequence where Police Sgt.

The singing by all three leads King also had a decent voice is fine with Jones and Carlisle given a first rate tune Alone for their duet in the departure sequence. Jones has a decent followup with Cosi Cosa turned into a major production with Harpo Chico and the immigrant passengers singing and dancing to it. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA remains a first rate comic masterpiece and a fine addition to the Marx Brothers' work in general.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Marx Brothers were set adrift by Paramount in 1933 after making arguably their best satiric comedy DUCK SOUP. For two years they rarely worked together an exception was a briefly heard radio show called FLYWHEEL SHYSTER AND FLYWHEEL about crooked lawyers which had Groucho and Chico  unfortunately like their silent film HUMORISK the recordings of the show no longer exist. Zeppo left the team to pursue a career as a movie agent. Chico and Harpo did some band touring.The scrips have survived and been published. Then Chico made a valuable contact  he played cards with Irving Thalberg who was almost as powerful a figure at MGM as Louis B. Mayer. Thalberg decided to sign the brothers to a contract where he'd be their producer. The contract was a unique one  it promised the brothers a percentage of the gross of the first two films which was a rarity in Hollywood acting contracts. The contract also enabled the brothers to perform their material from the film live on stage. This enabled them to hone material as they did in vaudeville and on Broadway. They were lucky in the writers for this first film George S. Kaufman Morris Ryskine and Al Boasberg. And they had a good cast including their old female Marx Brother Margaret Dumont.A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has since it appeared in 1935 been accepted as one of the best Marx vehicles and ties with DUCK SOUP as their supreme work. It's detractors say that it had too many points that would bring down the Brothers later films after A DAY AT THE RACES such as the love story that is tied to the plot and the fact that the brothers are frequently brought to a low point from which to rise with all their power against their opponents. The latter seemed to humanize them too much. Actually the love stories had been part of their movies since THE COCONUTS and in HORSE FEATHERS and DUCK SOUP the villains did momentarily trounce the brothers.

The puns and jabs are almost nonstop and they are so quick they might not even sink in until moments later. Some might be dated like a reference to the Canadian quintuplets but for the most part this film stands firm. I loved the sanity clause remark and many others.The most notable scene involves a large number of people packed into a small room and was partially written by Buster Keaton. I do not know how much Keaton and the Marxes worked together over all but if this was any indication they should have continued. Keaton's physical comedy is evident and Groucho's running commentary is wonderful.One of the most mysterious influences this film had on others is probably with Rob Zombie. He has written characters named Otis B. Driftwood and Captain Spaulding in homage to the Marx Brothers and has other references as well. It's pretty bizarre to connect this fun sarcastic comedy to a bloodbath... but then stranger things have happened.I recommend this film to anyone. As far as early comedies go Chaplin and Keaton are good but I think the Marx Brothers really take the cake.

From Animal Crackers to Duck Soup the Marx's years at Paramount seemed more about just being zany and ridiculous and goofy. And while they all were funny in their own right I thought only Animal Crackers and Duck Soup could be called truly great. The others just weren't as cohesive as they could have been thus making the humor not as consistent.To be frank this has to be the funniest the Marx Brothers ever were. Groucho plays his most sublime and offensive character yet with some of the best oneliners written for him yet. Harpo and Chico also are very good as two stowaways trying to help a young man become a famous singer and reunite with his opera lover. The only complaint I have is that there are some parts with too much singing that could have been cut out. More Groucho never hurt a movie but this is still very funny all the time.

Although Allen Jones and Kitty Carlisle are really a cut above most of the cute cuddly distractions. Nearly every scene is a gem Groucho and Chico haggling over the world's greatest tenor's contract the stateroom overflow the ring around the rosie as Hennesy the cop tries to find the other brothers in Groucho's hotel room and the climactic opera featuring Groucho's welcoming speech Take Me Out to the Ball Game Harpo's journey through the stage and scenery and the authorities clumsy attempts to catch the brothers. Still hilarious featuring the usual hectoring of the long suffering but still dignified Margaret Dumont the popping of the pompous Gottlieb Sig Ruman and the final comeuppance of the snooty Lassparri Walter Wolf.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Night At The Opera is my personal favorite Marx Brothers flick barely edging Duck Soup and Horsefeathers. It's so good that not even the obligatory romantic couple can ruin it. Although Allen Jones and Kitty Carlisle are really a cut above most of the cute cuddly distractions. Nearly every scene is a gem Groucho and Chico haggling over the world's greatest tenor's contract the stateroom overflow the ring around the rosie as Hennesy the cop tries to find the other brothers in Groucho's hotel room and the climactic opera featuring Groucho's welcoming speech Take Me Out to the Ball Game Harpo's journey through the stage and scenery and the authorities clumsy attempts to catch the brothers. Still hilarious featuring the usual hectoring of the long suffering but still dignified Margaret Dumont the popping of the pompous Gottlieb Sig Ruman and the final comeuppance of the snooty Lassparri Walter Wolf.";

Groucho's witty humor gets me every time and Chico and Harpo make the perfect team for humor. The music is breathtaking and unlike another reviewer I believe plays a crucial part of the movie since they are dealing with an opera. Another note that same reviewer stated that many bits were reused jokes from their earlier film Monkey Business. This is true but A Night at the Opera was made through MGM where as Monkey Business was created at Paramount I believe. This movie in its release had a much broader viewing audience. On a more personal note I have heard statements that the humor doesn't transcend generations and that is comepletely false. I am 19 and have grown up watching the Marx Brothers and had worries showing the DVD of A Night at the Opera Which I swear was the first person in Minnesota to buybut they caught the humor and have borrowed it numerous times.".

This film is often hilarious especially at its beginning but it suffers from long dry spells some boring musical numbers unlike the fantastic ones in Duck Soup and a couple of set pieces which I just did not find as funny as the Marx Brothers may have wanted me to. Specifically the hotel sequence. Harpo's breakfast was funny but the whole avoiding the police officer thing I disliked. Also the end setpiece with all three brothers being pursued around a stage while an opera was occurring was funny at first but grew old in its persistence. I still liked the film but I'm only giving it a 710.".

The Marx Brothers created an entire method for delivering screen comedy they created the rules and the logic and you either accept that logic or you don't.I have to base my opinion on A Night at the Opera therefore on whether or not I laughed and I didn't much. I smiled and chuckled here and there but I just didn't think this movie was that funny. I had a phalanx of film scholars on one of the DVD's special features telling me how funny certain classic bits in this movie are the sanity clause routine the stateroom scene etc. But as actually played out these scenes are moderately amusing but not much more. They have the feel of those Saturday Night Live skits that would be funnier if they were only about 5 minutes shorter. Supposedly A Night at the Opera was the first of a new kind of Marx Brothers movie more structured and with more dramatic conflict. The only other movie I've seen by them to compare this to is Duck Soup and I say give me the anarchic Brothers any day and dramatic structure be damned.There is one sequence in this movie that I loved and that's when Chico and Harpo step out of character and display their skill on the piano and harp respectively. These musical interludes are a muchneeded respite from the atrocious warbly songs performed by the film's male and female love interests.I would recommend any Marx Brothers movie for the same reason I would recommend Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton or AstaireRogers films. They're part of cinematic history and they played a large role in defining the art form at a specific point in its development. But that's not to say you will necessarily enjoy them as much as audiences at the time did.Grade B".

Driftwood who spends his time playing up to arts patron Mrs. Claypool classic Marx Bros. foil Margaret Dumont. When he sees that she's willing to pony up 1000 a night to have pompous Lassparri Walter Woolf King sing he wants a piece of the action. Circumstance soon throws him together with equally sly Fiorello Chico and goofy Tomasso Harpo as they become determined to help out young lovers  aspiring opera stars Rosa Kitty Carlisle and Ricardo Allan Jones.Even if one is not a fan of the opera they shouldn't let that dissuade them from checking out the Marx Bros. in their glory. Some buffs consider this their best film and it certainly shows off their talents to memorable effect. Musical interludes do go on a bit long but the quality of the comedy when it occurs is top notch. There are some truly great bits in here like the party of the first part contract the overcrowded to say the least stateroom sequence and the frantic farcical efforts of Otis Fiorello Tomasso and Ricardo to pull the wool over the eyes of a suspicious inspector Robert Emmett O'Connor by moving beds from one room to another.Groucho is hilarious as always. Very few entertainers in film history can fire off a oneliner as snappily as he does. Chico and Harpo have their wonderful moments as well. It's such a hoot when Harpo does a SpiderMan routine near the end. Carlisle and Jones are extremely appealing Dumont is once again a fine straight woman King is an appropriately snooty villain Sig Ruman is superb as eternally frustrated Gottlieb and O'Connor is likewise good as the antics of Otis and company take a toll on him.The pace isn't always consistent but there is some enjoyable action and first rate stunt work. Overall this is a solid comedy  musical that will appeal to any lover of this era in cinema.Eight out of 10.".
