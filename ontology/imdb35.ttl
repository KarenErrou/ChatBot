	schema:reviewBody "I saw a soldout opening night screening of Across the Universe last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed while in the critical world Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated and a number of people have asked me how I liked it I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.It's a bizarre and beautiful movie musical almost a music video at times that uses thirty three of The Beatles' songs and director Julie Taymor's unique visual style to illustrate both a personal love story and the overall conflict in the sixties. The movie is incredibly original and ambitious and therefore its failings are as dramatic as its successes. Both stem from the same source Julie Taymor's selfindulgence. That's nothing new to her movies Frida and Titus have the same problem but in a movie stripped of traditional narrative it's glaringly obvious. Some songs are impeccably chosen and staged with great creativity but others are too obvious or thematically forced so Taymor can cram in another song and stunning visual sequence.For the first half of the movie I was frequently divided. One innovative sequence would really pull me into the style then a forced number or awkward staging would distance me again. When an obvious recognizable number began I was torn between a cynical impulse to roll my eyes and an almost exhilarated impulse to laugh and applaud.Across the Universe is a mess. There's no denying that. It is poorly paced and badly structured and at times its featherlight plot and contrived or obligatory numbers become tedious. But at one point about halfway through I decided just to go along for the ride. I delighted in every brash bold choice whether it worked or not. I let the poignant moments move me whether or not I intellectually felt that they were contrived.The Beatles' music had a huge effect on me from the fateful day that my friend accidentally copied the first three tracks of Revolver onto my computer a love affair was born. Their songs are inexorably tied to memories beautiful and horrible scattered all over my life and as I grow older I'm constantly discovering new deeper resonances in their familiar refrains. Even when the context was vague or stretched the film's reinterpreting and revealing new facets of these songs seemed to serve as a tribute to their breadth and greatness. Taymor's damning depiction of the horrors of war and lyrical portrait of young idealistic love are both painfully expressive and unique and simply took my breath away. By the film's shamelessly corny close I realized that I had just had a genuine cinematic experience. For all the movies that I watch that's incredibly rare.In his review in the New York Times Stephen Holden writes I realized that falling in love with a movie is like falling in love with another person. Imperfections however glaring become endearing quirks once you've tumbled. I could laughingly list this movie's flaws from now till next week but I sort of fell in love with its sheer audacity. You might not. It's extremely nave and thematically simple and you could find that endearing or irritating. You may love it or you may hate it but you're going to feel something. This movie will not change your life don't expect it to. But if you let your criticism fade to the background and abandon yourself to Taymor's passionate fervor you may have a pretty amazing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "After an intensely screened screening featuring nervous suits delivered in limousines and gentle but firm gentlemen controlling the ticket flow to assure a certain target group would be tested for their age predilections and proclivities and wand wielding security guards frisking patrons for any signs of recording devices  including cellphones  I entered what we were told was the firsteverin theworld test market screening of the TaymorBeatles extravaganza Across the Universe.Thoughts of Peter Frampton in Sergeant Peppers' haunted me but my admiration of Taymor and well I was actually a kid IN the audience of the Sullivan Show on February 9 1964. I was even in a band that appeared on MTV in their first hour Robin Lane  the Chartbusters! Iattended my share of protests worked with Reverend Daniel Berrigan got psychedelic and ... well... enough about my qualifications to review the movie  it seems I still don't fit the intended demographic  it's the first time I ever lied my age downward! So despite that the studio may change some things  here's what I saw at this stage of tweaking the film.Without quibbling over loose plot points and misguided scenes as they seem to be still tinkering with those things and there are there are several out of place and unexplained scenes  I've rarely seen such a feverish work of persistent video art in the service of great music. These are NOT small music videos wrapped around a questionable plot. Taymor's vision as a director seems to borrow from everything. Her story ideally wants to conjure up the not just the frolic but the frenzy and passion of the 60's. There is what looks like Jan Svankmajer in a stunning industrial dance scene in a draft board as civilians are turned into soldiers. Another scene has giant puppet pageantry straight out of Peter Schumman's Bread and Puppet Theater and Resurrection Circus. There are joyous location street dancing scenes and breathtaking Technicolor composites. One such scene is a dreamlike vision done entirely in the psychedelic solarised colors of Richard Avedon's Beatle portraits. Her set designs are at times so clever and colorful you laugh at the unrestrained joy and daring. She begins with a glorious reinvention of the fifties musical and careens into pure psychedelic delirium. The cinematography is rich and varied to the purpose of each scene and dance sequences explode into place. The film moves from the innocence of small town uppermiddle class America to the nascent hippy scene in the village to a sort of hallucinatory Garden of Eden with too much but amusing Bono as a Ken Kesey Merry Prankster guru type. It moves to romance and onto the dangers and volatility of the anti war 60's. All this is rendered through a constant flow Beatles songs delivered amidst magnificent set designs and video composites.For the most part the music is respectfully and tastefully rearranged. and without the Pavlovian shamelessness of the Beatles as they were used in I Am Sam A ballad version of I Want to Hold Your Hand movingly reinvents the song. I don't know if the actors actually sing but you could have fooled me. It is all carefully synched up. Even the drummers and strummers are always in synch. The actors are charming but once again as she has done in Digging To China to Down In the Valley Evan Rachael Wood rivets the film. It would too much to believe she could also sing like the angel  but darn if her throat isn't in sych! The voice is beautiful. At times songs and sounds collide like the Beatles in Number Nine. The collision of a war protest at Columbia University with Helter Skelter over Dear Prudence is brilliant. Taymor has edginess that matches the sixties zeitgeist and avoids the vacuous cotton candy fluff of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge.I think it would be wise to address Taymor's strength which is the darker political vision. The film's intented audience ought to be as angry as they were in the 60s marching in the streets and standing up to an arrogant and corrupt administration with their trillion dollar war. The parallels to today are obvious. The time is right for such a film with such politics. It shouldn't get comprised by too much gooey and gratuitous romance.I overheard two young girls afterward say I don't know why they have to redo those great songs?  whereas a much older couple were saying This was great  very artistic fun  it really caught the feeling of the era. I hope the handlers in their infinite wisdom don't sell out the ability of this film to be politically relevant as well as beautiful.Characters and situations that obviously echo Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix the Weathermen the Weather Underground Abbie Hoffmann Ken Kesey draft card burning 60's clubs in the East Village Caf Wha? becomes Caf Huh? and other sly references are fun to pick out though I assume details are undergoing revision for clarity. I don't think this is just a film for 20 somethings. The kids I sat with remarked This is important stuff for our generation to remember. Taymor's darker sensibilities are what the film really needs to keep it from being perceived as so much razzle dazzle and romance. There's a subversive edge to this story.Visually it is unquestionably a masterpiece of video art. Its final judgment may be that it can speak across generations.".

The soundtrack is stuck in my head as I write this the new versions not even the original songs All corny jokes and references and lapses in plot are forgiven because Ms. Taymor manages to take a movie chock full of things that have been done a million times before and makes it as fresh and exciting as if it were all done for the first time.

What's more though they did record the songs in studio first as part of the rehearsal process most of the song performances used in the film were recorded live as they played out the scenes. Perhaps that's why  for me  the songs worked so well it actually felt like the characters were just moved to sing. Amazing performances from  mainly  unknown actors.And I felt the story had a strong narrative line aided  supported by the songs. It used the background of history not just as a painted backdrop but to add meaning and depth to the characters and the story they were living. Made me wish I'd been there born in '65 too young to remember the 60's I'll have to content myself with living vicariously through Jude and Lucy and the others.Add to everything else Julie Taymor's glorious visuals and I was truly swept away. I saw 36 films at the festival but this was head and shoulders my favourite.I fell in love with this film and look forward to sharing it with friends and family who didn't have the luck to see it as I did. It's a film that will I'm sure reward repeated viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been anticipating this movie ever since I saw the trailer on IMDb like everyone else. When I first saw the trailer I said to myself I'm either going to consider this my favorite movies of alltime or it's going to be trash. Being a huge Beatles fan and owning all their albums on CD I had huge expectations about the covers of the songs. I saw it with my friend who is also a huge Beatles fan but not a huge musical fan. Both of us saw it on opening night to the public and to our surprise it was really good! The covers of the songs were actually really good! Now don't get me wrong the original Beatles songs will always be the best versions but for what they did they did a pretty decent job. One of my favorite scenes was the I've Just Seen a Face bowling alley scene. So creative and fun! Also the I Want You She So Heavy scene wasinterestingbut fun to watch. Eddie Izzard's scene as Mr. Kite was hilarious! Both me and my friend where on the floor laughing. Also Bono's scene singing I Am the Walrus was great. Don't listen to the critics that say that it doesn't do the Beatles justice. Actually it's the opposite. Any hardcore Beatles fan will appreciate all the jokes that were thrown in there. Even if you're not a hardcore Beatles fan you will appreciate the fantastic love story.Just one word of advice go to this with an open mind. Don't expect Oscarworthy script and dialogue expect clichs not a whole lot of character development from the supporting cast but don't let that ruin the movie for you. Appreciate the artistic mind of the director. I mean who cares if they threw in a character like Prudence just to sing Dear Prudence? It's a great song! For all you I hate every movie that comes out critics don't see this. It's too artsy for you. Go see this with an open mind not expecting it to win Best Picture for the Oscar. This is one of the best experiences you will have watching a movie. I'm buying the DVD as soon as it comes out. See this movie Beatles fans!!! It does them justice!!! Please email me with any comments you have.".

Every song adaptation interpretation and setting is spot on fans of the Beatles will recognize that every detail in Taymor's images recall an instance a photograph a line or a quote from the band. Even the girl that comes in through the bathroom window. Nothing is left to chance everything is on purpose. Amazing. Easily the best film of the year.

It's not set up so that there's a scene then a song then a scene again everything just flows seamlessly. Wonderful acting from all of the castwith some great improv from Bono and Eddie Izzard. Definitely standout performances from Dana Fuchs who has the most AMAZING voice Martin Luther and TV Carpio. Also a nice cameo by Salma Hayek who apparently asked Julie Taymor if there was a part for her in the movie and when Julie told her that she could be one of the nurses Salma replied ONE of the nurses Julie? Overall an excellent film. Taymor fans will definitely appreciate it it has a lot of her traditional colorful imagery masks and puppets. I'm planning on seeing it a few more times just to take it all in. It's certainly going to be a film you have to see more than once to really appreciate.".

Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor passion and idealism that made up the midlate 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor! I also feel so very very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what it all this means or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness cynicism or despair or have just simply soldout or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of the adventure creativity experimentation excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many great cultural icons organizations and events of the period Walter Cronkite the greatest broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji the Nigerian Drummer and social activist his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets a living breathing direct link to 1960's radicalism warmed my heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover Vermont to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS Students for a Democratic Society which did not advocate violence and the much smaller splintergroup that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute which cost him his life. The historic occupation of the Ivy League Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school. Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix  Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity and a passion for music. And of course the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind! I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe! The only film I intend to purchase on DVD that has been released this year!".

The movie also traces a small group of friends and musicians who are swept up into the emerging antiwar and counterculture movements along with the starcrossed lovers Jude and Lucy.Interesting versions of more than 30 Beatles songs preformed by the cast complete with cool cameos Bono Joe Cocker and musical numbers with amazingly trippy choreographed dance routines. This was just so good. A couple numbers stood out for me Come Together with Joe Cocker just wow the business people dancing and shuffling on the busy New York street and I want You? with the brother getting inducted into the army was downright scary with a very Pink Floyd Another Brick In The Wall feel to it.

	schema:reviewBody "This was by far one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Also I discuss the ending but it is not a spoiler since it's a completely obvious and predictable finish to the film.The characters were shallow the plot was disjointed the visuals were overstimulating the actors were wooden and there seemed to be a heavy dependence on subtle Beatles injokes. Case in point The character of Prudence seems to exist for no other reason than as an excuse for the other characters to sing Dear Prudence. She's introduced in a visually silly scene with the football players the leads sing her out of the closet and then she disappears. It seems to me that this movie's facile clichd lovestory plot was written around the need for Julie Taymor to jam THIRTY ONE Beatles tunes in a movie instead of writing the story and adding songs later. Many of the songs seemed superfluous adding nothing to the story or character development such as Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite and Because. I especially have problems with Evan Rachel Wood whose lovely voice was completely overshadowed by her total lack of acting ability. Because of it's lack of substance the film actually conveyed the feeling of the Vietnam War very well I thought we'd never get out of the theatre it was so long. Finally the movie ended in the sappiest kitschiest way possible with the police stopping through the power of love and Jude and Lucy finding each other again and falling head over heels in blissful ecstasy. If Taymor had really wanted to capture the essence of the sixties the ending would have been somber. There was nothing happy about the way that decade ended with our country still embroiled in war our President assassinated and the death of the Flower Generation. This film was very ambitious but a film can't get by on ambition alone. The only song I thought was perfectly executed was the surreal and terrifying draft scene brilliantly set to I Want You She's So Heavy. Other than that the treatment of the source material was magnificently disappointing. It also loses points for include such a self righteous pompous ass as Bono Who for some reason all of my friends agreed looked strangely like Robin Williams. All in all I'd say this movie made a much better trailer than an actual film. I'd recommend that the twelve dollars of ticket money that would be wasted on this movie be put to good use by being used to purchase Abbey Road Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or the White Album actually titled The Beatles and really enjoying the music of the The Beatles like they intended on an album not in some ridiculous parody of the Sixties.".

I cringed every time they blasphemed another Beatle song with Taymore's insipidly sophomoric MTV vision of the sixties.

I also was of the feeling that it would be quite a stretch for any performer to make a Beatles sound bad. Heck I didn't think the 'I am Sam' soundtrack was that bad and I kind of dig the Fiona Apple version of 'ATU'. I don't even mind 'HelloGoodbye' featured on the Target commercials. But the renditions of the songs in this film were so terrible I wanted to call Sir Paul and Ringo to apologize profusely for my girlfriend and I spending money to watch as people who should know better slowly killed their songs.I never thought I'd write this but if you're thinking about going to see 'Across the Universe' don't. Just go out and rent 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band'. As bad as that picture is it's ten times the movie 'Across the Universe'.Ugh.".

Besides the codification of the 60s into convenient chewy clusters one character drafted another one black a girl too involved in the antiwar protest movement  another in the club scene trying to sing like Janis Joplin... in this movie it appears they tried to build an entire plot around the 60s and most of the dialog out of sung Beatles songs. To me as soon as you start naming characters Jude Maxwell Prudence Sadie Lucy you're already losin' me kid. When half of those characters are ONLY there to support an occurrence of one person or another breaking into song i.e. Prudence's whole raisinbran d'etre in the ENTIRE movie was to have a scene where she's shut herself in a closet pouting and everyone outside the closet sings Dear Prudence now THAT's just stupid. They shoehorned songs into the plot and plot lines into songops. The one English guy always sings with a smile on his face and everyone has these pure clear let's call it plear voices fresh out of Fame they were born after THAT too I think. WAY too many telegraphed references to wellknown Beatles and 60s trivia like the use of apples and strawberries and the comment to Max about killing grandma with a hammer. There are a few cool animation bits well one really but ALL of that might not be too bad but they ALSO had to bring my man Jimi into it! Now they're making me mad. The characters are zerodimensional. The acting is out of Junior High rising only occasionally to Sophomore level. The writing is just execrable.

They included random and stupid things just so they could use a few more songs and why do people buy into this crap? Because they're too distracted by the music to care.The cutting edge graphics as Ebert called them were among some of the worst I've seen in years. They were quite obviously fake and cheesy and you could argue that it's meant to be as such because it's a hallucination or whatever BS you want to throw at me but if it really was a hallucination it should at least be believable!

I am embarrassed for Ms Taymor who  on the evidence of 'Titus' and 'Frida'  is a hugely talented filmmaker.But here the director's talents are only intermittently diverting and cannot save what is an utterly pointless project.As 'versions' of the originals the songs are often attractively delivered though too often with a bland professionalism that entirely lacks any edge. The Gospel choir and perhaps some of 'Sadie''s numbers are quite powerful in themselves but even these positive examples hardly rate a notice in the context of what heights cinema musicals have already hit. The songanddance routines  though fanatically well disciplined as if that would subdue all opposition!  are uniformly appalling and would have instantly bombed on the stage of any professional theatre. They are all manic energy without real engagement.It does not help that all the characters are annoyingly and rather dishonestly tangential to historical reality  like a reminiscence of the great originals 'Jude'  'Paul Macartney' 'Sadie'  'Janis Joplin' for instance or merely inserted as an incarnation of a song the otherwise pointless 'Prudence' or of something wildly trippy in a cartoonish way a brilliant Eddie Izzard completely wasted in a misfiring farrago entirely bereft of any identification with the hippy ethos  to call it 'pastiche' would be to wildly overpraise it.Even the more 'downtoearth' scenes back in Liverpool lack any substance at all Even the Albert Docks location looks as gentrified here as it has become in reality at the hands of the property developers. One would have expected the wellknown team of British writers to have got this right at least. In fact the whole picture suffers from a total failure to identify with the time and culture it is feverishly and showily pursuing.And the more it pursues the further off is that authentic psychedelic rainbow.Perhaps Julie Taymor is in pursuit of her own lost girlhood which would explain the selfindulgence in the unspeakably trite American family clichs ... But surely better in such a case that she should have created or commissioned a more focused screenplay This one seems hopelessly hungup on squeezing in the absolute max. of Beatles songs.And we don't even get a decent pastiche of Dick Lester's witty style of early Beatles' musicvideo for God's sake! Humour is indeed direly lacking  how the team of Clement and la Frenais the writers of the gloriously funny and characterful 'Auf Wiedersehen Pet' saga could ever agree to pen this flat bland pofaced Americanisation of a major part of their own popular cultural heritage from the industrial North of England is beyond me! And the hyperHollywood style of 'musical number' sits very ill with the naivety at the heart of the subject. The truth is I am afraid that the film is ludicrously overambitious in terms of mere personal grandstanding by the director at her most showy 'Look at me isn't this brilliant?' Actually 'No Ms Taymor.' As director she neither reveals nor evokes any love for her subject. It is indeed a really stupid movie whose ambition is all for the perfection of the surfaces but which possesses not one spark of inspiration whatsoever.But the biggest mistake of all was to portray the whole era as some kind of alternative reality existing 'Across the Universe' which actually lacks inspiration and magic in direct proportion to its distance from the original milieu that inspired the songs a kind of AntiOz one might say. Crucially since the film's entire mise en scene is set neither in any convincing 'then' nor in any engaging 'now' it is difficult to see what possible relevance or attraction it possesses for any audience.Taymor has been lost in this NoMan'sLand which is the result of exposing the inadequate simplicities of the sketchy plot to the whole industrial panoply of Hollywood She wanders through a scene of artistic devastation amongst groves of burntout and songless trees. And were that or something like a defining image of her own creation we might at least have had a halfdecent antiwar movie! As it is even Cliff Richard's safe old 'Summer Holiday' vehicle seems more relevant and punchy.And what sublime madness could a Ken Russell in his reprobate heyday have wrought with such a subject ....! But we torment ourselves with such 'mighthavebeens.' Or rather these things have been before and far better done and there was absolutely no reason for this film to exist in the first place. It is a completely misbegotten enterprise and will be utterly forgotten by next week if not sooner.".

Jude travels from London to meet his father. He befriends Max who is a free spirit threatened with the prospects of being drafted. Jude falls for Max's sister Lucy whose boyfriend dies in the war and she starts an antiwar protest. Other characters include Sadie a promising singer who becomes involved with her guitarist. Directed by Julie Taymor and highlighted with revised Beatles songs that are given a brand new approach. These musical numbers are accompanied by striking visual images to express the emotion within each scene. A highlight regards a cheerleader walking across an aggressive football field while singing I Wanna Hold Your Hand. Jim Sturgess as Jude is a free spirit and artist who never intended to fall in love but he does. He is illegally a citizen who fights his way back to his desired love. Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy voices her protests and political agendas before finding freedom in an artist. Joe Anderson as Max is her brother whose reckless lifestyles leads to the serious nature of war where the reality of death and violence leaves wounds both physical and mental. Dana Fuchs as Sadie finds her place in music. The musical numbers express the era that encase our memory. Score 10  10".

I grew up on the classics like Camelot and Show Boat My Fair Lady and Oliver so the musical aspect of this film is what intrigued despite my lack of affection for The Beatles. Across the Universe blew my mind! The way the story is woven around the themes of Beatles songs borrowing not only lyrics for dialog but characters from the songs was pure genius.Aside from the clever and multilayered story line this film delivers exquisite scene after exquisite scene particularly once we head in the more psychedelic segments of the film. The cinematography impressed and enthralled me throughout  the strawberry fields sequence is particularly noteworthy! The guest stars featured in certain sequences were also a great treat and lent the film that little something extra.The performances here blew me away. I've liked Evan Rachel Wood since I saw her in Thirteen but I never imagined she could sing and sing well. Another surprise was Joe Anderson who had little to no voice training prior to doing this film. Jim Sturgess though steals the show as scruffy Jude. His voice is raw and honest and just right for the style of music. Sure some of the plot was contrived and tropes abounded but ultimately this film captured the essence of the Beatles as well as the spirit of the era in a movie that dazzles the eyes as it ensorcells the ears. This is one movie I will never get tired of watching.".

I'm a bit surprised it wasn't a blockbuster hit as I think most of the movie is pure genius with an unforgettable talented young cast!

This film attempts to encapsulate the 60s the Vietnam war drugs draftees sexual liberation hippies and other topical issues by splicing karaoke versions of the Beatles songs onto a fairly clichd love story.2. The Beatles weren't about topicality. Why use them? They were a safe band compared to many of the other musicians of the era.3. Neil Jordan's Breakfast on Pluto which uses pop music to interpret Irish history did this stuff in a much more personal manner. See also Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine and Ken Russell's Tommy.4. The film uses various codes of the 1960s  passion activism idealism disenfranchisement and rebellion  as a kind of operatic Iraq War allegory the hopelessness of the Vietnam War seeping into the Middle East four decades later precisely because the psychedelic landscape of the film has been bulldozed and replaced with not only disinterest and apathy but why not? bubble gum pop.5. The film's cast is made up to subtly resemble famous figures of the era Hendrix Joplin McCartney. Other references the Beatles' rooftop concert Hendrix's formation of The Experience Joplin's break up from Big Brother and the Holding Company are far more esoteric and will likely go over the heads of most audience members.6. Why does a film that celebrates rebellion stick so faithfully to the standard boy meets girl boy loses girl boy wins girl storyline? 7. The songs are mostly flat lacking any sort of magic. And yet..Across the Universe is such a visually audacious film director Julie Taylor exstatic at being given this budget treating us to an orgy of zany camera work and super choreographed sequences. Almost every shot positions our eye in an interesting place exploiting space and architecture in a variety of clever ways. The film's love story is also fairly sweet and a bit unorthodox in the way it focuses on the beauty of the male lead most of these romances are directed by men.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

There is an amazing fight aboard a ship and a fight in a  restaurant in the beginning of the movie. Also see Jackie fight the amazing Benny Urquidez.

This movie has the most amazing fight scenes and stunts there is. And this is the funniest Jackie Chan movie there is. There is an amazing fight aboard a ship and a fight in a  restaurant in the beginning of the movie. Also see Jackie fight the amazing Benny Urquidez. That fight is ranked among the best Jackie's fight scenes ever filmed and I agree. So go rent buy doesn't matter as long as you see this film.";

A great deal of time is given to Hung's and Chan's romancesand there is one really touching if over the top scene involving Hung with a megaphone trying to get his potential girl to trust him in front of loads of people.Some of the film's slapstick perhaps goes on a bitbut there are some terrific scenes where the three heroes keep comedically fighting each othersometimes all at one time. Don't worry action fansamidst all this romance and slapstick is some superb fighting. The fights are not that many in number and some are quite briefbut Chan looks near his best and Hung and Baio also shine. Chan's running battle with a gang of heavies on a ship and his duel with Benny Urquidez a thrilling battle and not at all like the ChanUrquidez match in Wheels On Meals are amongst his best fights ever. Just try and keep a a note of all the stunt men who do extremely dangerous falls during the climax! As often with a Hungdirected filmthe violence is a bit stronger than the usual Chan film.As usual there is the odd scene which doesn't worksuch as when Hung apologizes to his girlfriend and she......smashes him in the face with an iron bar!after which they make up!

	schema:reviewBody "The legendary Sammo Hung directs and costars in this the last of his collaborations with both Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. However it is clear that the best was indeed saved for last at least in terms of pure martial arts action managing to outdo even Project A Wheels on meals and all of the lucky stars series. The storyline is pure simplicity with our heroes out to stop a criminal from polluting a fishpond whilst at the same time attempting to woo their female costars. No one ever watched a Hong Kong action movie for its storyline but it is nice to have some semblance of a plot. What saves this film is the characters most notably the three main leads and the villains including Yuen Wah Billy Chow Dick Wei and Benny Urquidez. The characters played by Jackie Sammo and Yuen are generally against the type they normally found themselves playing. Jackie is still given the most screen time due to his higher marketability and he still plays the hero but this time he is a lawyer and not a policeman as he is so often cast. Sammo still plays the fat and lovable criminal but this time he is not quite so pathetic in that he also gets a girl. Yuen Biao takes the biggest departure from his normal character playing a rather disturbed young man with parental issues. It is the action that simply sets this movie apart however. There are plenty of smaller fights that keep the viewer hooked until the final battles. Sammo Hung pummels his way through about a dozen men and shows that he is one of the most powerful fighters in screen history. He is waylaid for the last ten minutes however giving more time to Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. Yuen Biao impresses again with effortless acrobatics and grace but it is Jackie's fight with Benny Urquidez that really leaves a mark as it is every bit as good as their encounter in Wheels on meals though much more serious. All in all this is a highly recommended movie for fans of action cinema at its very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another crazy comedyaction flick to combine the star talents of Jackie Chan Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao this is their last production together but by no means their least. Once again the familiar formula of the tale involves our heroes getting up to all kinds of shenanigans when they become involved in the legal case between a woman who claims her lake is being polluted by a factory and the factory owner. Chan stars as a rather unlikely lawyer who ends up falling in love with the beautiful witness on the other side whilst Sammo Hung turns up as an arms dealer who also falls in love with the woman's sister or friend it doesn't really matter. Best of all is Yuen Biao as Chan's friend an eccentric burglar who has frequent visits to the shrink to try and cure him of his insanity. Lots of comedy antics ensue between the threesome especially Biao and Hung who take an instant dislike to each other and always seem to be fighting at inopportune times.The film offers plenty of comedy and also a double romance which is focused on a great deal. I'm pleased to say that the romances are handled sensitively and with great passion and its enjoyable to watch the martial artists doing something other than fighting all of the time. The comic interplay and slapstick humour is handled superbly and mixes well with the action. As for the fights well once again they're phenomenal and have a real edge to them. Watch out for a meal on a boat which is interrupted by hired thugs watching Chan wipe them all out is a delight and wonderful stuff. The three stars are on top form especially Yuen Biao who stars in what may be his greatest role as the consistently funny and not to mention crazy thief. Chan is solid in the leading part although has less screen time than usual whilst Hung is excellent throughout especially in the scarily realistic scenes in which he gets injected by heroin which gave the film an 18 certificate here in the UK. His direction is abovepar too.As usual for these collaborations the finale is the most memorable thing about the film this time offering an extended action sequence set in a factory full of railings poles and bubbling pools of evil. The acrobatic martial arts which take place amid the glasssmashing bonesnapping mayhem are truly incredible and a wonder to behold. The chief villain played by the inimitable Yuen Wah is an amusing cigarchomping caricature who gets his just desserts. But the best thing about the film is the reappearance of Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez who turns up as a thug to fight Chan at the end just like he did in WHEELS ON MEALS. Complete with heavy eyeliner and a ponytail Benny has never looked scarier than he does here and he proves to be a mean menace. The fight sequence is phenomenal and a fitting end to a quality production. Use of slowmotion in the various stunts also heightens the enjoyment helping to make this one of the best actioncomedies out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jackie Lung is a hotshot lawyer working for those that can afford him. He is used to less than savoury cases so he thinks nothing when he is hired by a criminalrun factory that has been challenged by a local fishfarm that is being badly polluted. Jackie hires his two associates themselves less than savoury characters to spy on the owners of the fishfarm and find out whatever they can about it. However when Jackie falls for one of the women in question he finds himself with a conflict of interest and decides instead to look into the factory.I've been using my DVD subscription service to dip into older films of late and a couple of good experiences made me seek out more older Jackie Chan films to see him in his prime. This film caught my eye as it had Chan Sammo and Yuen together not to mention several other recognisable names and faces in Urquidez and Yuen. I had recently seen some of Chan's films where the action was mostly left to one big sequence at the very end and the rest of the film was focused on more comedic sequences. This film is similar in the light entertainment mould but it succeeds by having regular and consistent action throughout. These are mostly very good and each of the three stars gets a chance to show off their abilities on the way to a final fight between Chan and Urquidez that is as skilled and exciting as those names would suggest.What this leaves though is the plot which is as simple as the genre requires but not actually that engaging. A lot of it rests on the romantic part of the film to work and this doesn't really do much other than happen. It didn't really interest me or provide anything beyond the odd chuckle that justified the time given to it. I suppose in the context of the film it is a necessary evil simply because the romantic interest between the characters is what drives the plot and puts people where they need to be for the action to occur. It still doesn't work that well though but never to the point where it hurts the total film  all it does is produce weaker bits that are a bit hard to care about.The cast are mostly excellent in terms of delivering what we came here for action but also the main people are solid in the comedy stakes as well. Chan is charming and quite amusing while Sammo is his usual clowning sort of character. Yuen is a bit drier but still it is his agility that makes him watchable. I enjoyed the amusing villain from Wah Yuen and the fightwork from Urquidez just about makes up for the terrible makeup they have stuck him in. The women in the cast have a thankless job of mostly being important within the romantic threads of the film  they are cute enough but not much in the way of performances thanks to the material I think.Dragons Forever will draw viewers because of the three main actors and what they can do physically. With this as the motivator the film wins by having consistent and engaging fight sequences that are impressive and fun. The downside is that the plot used to frame these sequences is pretty weak at times even if ti does produce some funny moments here and there. Martial arts fans will enjoy it no doubt.".

All those who know and like HK cinema style will watch it with great pleasure.Do not think too much about the meaning of the title  it is there because a film must have some title. When you see the film you will forget about it for it has not much to do with what is happening .Dragon number 1 and the source of all complications  Jackie Chan. It's a lawyer who has obviously never imagined that you can simply do what you have to do. And if finally he fails it's precisely because he was manipulating too much. He has another two dragons to help him with this task I mean losing the case. Dragon number 2 following the order of appearance in the film is Sammo Hung  not too scrupulous man selling illegally false guns. Dragon number 3 is Yuen Biao  a little bit crazy but sincere guy too sincere to have such a cunning friend!. As usual his acting and acrobatic skills are simply amazing. As far as the smart lawyer is not smart enough to warn his aides that they are two working for the same case they meet of course and successfully ruins each others plans and the whole Jackie's strategy. And all this does not mean that they are losers. Not at all! In fact they win... but not where they thought they would.I do not recommend you to eat or drink while watching this film because it is full of funny episodes which come unexpectedly. It might be dangerous if you have your mouth full of food! I especially appreciate the funny fighting moments. I do not mean only fighting in a funny situation but the fighting itself its choreography. When you are told that three men are fighting you probably think one against two? WRONG! Each of the three against the other two. I told you it's complicated.The most boring part is the final fight. In fact it is excellent. Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao are demonstrating their wonderful skills and their opponents are not worse while Sammo Hung is looking half dead with his face painted in white. I say it's boring because there are so many films that end in the same way general fighting  all bad guys vs all good guys the good ones winning by miracle for in fact the enemy was stronger.The film has also its lyric moment which make it so cute and human... and gives you some rest for nobody can laugh without stopping during one hour and half!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched Dragons Forever for the first time in 1998 I was in awe about the fight scenes and the comedy. I had just become a fan of Jackie Chan's movies and the TV showing of Dragons Forever really got me hooked. I bought the movie on VHS but found it hard to read the English subtitles because they were below the Chinese so most of it was unreadable.Two years ago I bought a Hong Kong DVD and watched it for 7 times in one week  I LOVE this movie it is so unique in Jackie's oeuvre. Not only is it one of the few movies in which the Brothers Jackie Chan Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao are acting together it was also the last time they did. And most of all the ONLY movie in which the Brothers are not only fighting the criminals together but also each other! The fight scenes are hilarious and every step is choreographed although it looks like a spontaneous fight. Alls the fights are both funny and breath taking.Jackie Chan as a slick lawyer a true Romeo when it comes to women finds himself in a somewhat difficult position where love and work collide Sammo Hung in a non typecasted role as romantic fortune seeker btw I love the way he gets her to have dinner with him and Yuen Biao is absolutely the most lovable lunatic I have ever seen.The scenes where Sammo and Biao encounter each other in Jackie's apartment are sequences I watch over and over again.The boat fight and the factory fight with Benny Urquidez are really something! And I am certainly in awe of Yuen Biao's agility in the factory fight where he is on his back and flips himself over in a way I would never have imagined possible.Just today I got a newer DVD which includes bloopers and 2 deleted scenes with Yuen Biao. One where he is seeing his psychiatrist and another one where he believes he is talking to his psychiatrist over the intercom but in fact is talking to the guy that is ROBBING the psychiatrist!!!One other funny thing about the movie in the kitchen scene Jackie is juggling with a knife and then later with both the knife and a wooden kitchen utensil. But if you look closely the wooden utensil is NOT in from of him and a second later as by magic it is.Yuen Wah makes a terrific BAD guy!!!!!! We see Dick Wei as one of the thugs he was also the pirate leader in Project A Even though today I am the proud owner of some 55 Jackie Chan movies I feel that Dragons Forver is still one of my most favorites!!!!! Tip If you want to see the other 3 Sammo Hung Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah in action again DO try Eastern Condors also.".

All the characters are fantastic and the story is excellent plus Jackie Chan Sammo Hung and Biao Yuen are all simply amazing in this. The fight choreography is outstanding and the stunts are simply brilliant plus it's extremely well written and made as well. Jackie Sammo and Yuen all have fantastic chemistry together and Wah Yuen and Benny Urquidez are great as the main villains plus the most hilarious scenes in the movie are definitely when Jackie invites Nancy over for dinner at his house as it's filled with hilarious slapstick!. All the characters are extremely likable and I can see why this is regarded as one of Jackie's best films plus I also liked the ending as well as it was quite funny. Pauline Yeung and Deannie Yip are great as the female leads and I love the music during the romance scenes plus The finale is especially exciting. This is one of Jackie's absolute best in my opinion it's got the perfect mix of Action Romance and Comedy and I say go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Sammo HungCorey Yuen do a fantastic! job here with great camera work awesome angles and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Jackie Chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious very charming kicks that ass had fantastic chemistry with Sammo and Biao Yuen and brought all of the qualities he usually brings! Jackie Rules!!!!!!!. Sammo Hung KamBo is brilliant here he is funny kicks that ass and really surprised me with his agility one again for a man his size! Sammo Rules!!. Biao Yuen is hilarious here he is totally unpredictable and I loved it he is also an amazing martial artistand played a wonderfully quirky character! Biao Rules!!. Pauline Yeung is very cute and does great as Jackie's love interest I liked her lots. Deannie Yip does well as Sammo's love interest I liked her too. Wah Yuen played a very effective villain here and was menacing especially with that cigar!.

Besides that like the case of the dubbed version of Dragons Forever the voices are ridiculous.  Thank goodness someone loaned me this terrible versionThe subtitled DVD is the only way to go.";

He decides to do this by hiring the help of couple of his criminal friends Biao and Hung and also by seducing the environmental scientist aiding the fishery Pauline Yeung.As you can see not exactly a typical movie for any of these actors mainly because their characters are more than a touch shady. Their nefarious deeds are played mostly for laughs but it still means that there will be more than a few viewers who will have their expectations ruined because they're not used to seeing Jackie Chan and the others playing antiheroes if not outright villains. Personally I found their roles refreshing although I have to admit that their mannerisms and routines are more suited for heroic roles. In this film you don't really buy their acting.The other big problem is that the plot is rather dull. It's mainly there to allow for humorous situations and fight scenes both of which are very good though all three of them have done better in other films but the story itself wanders around aimlessly and is not all that interesting.All in all I'd say that this film was a slight disappointment.

The plot and the humor this time around is actually clever and witty on how it comes around. Jackie Chan during his prime played these trouble making mischievous characters that are still likable. This time he somewhat plays a despicable one that as the plot unfolds becomes likable. It was also nice to see the middle aged Deannie Yipwho I think of as a amazing Chinese actress who's talents shine more as she gets older as the target. This one seemed like a sequel or a spin off of Wheels on Meals. Although I personally like this film better and found it more humorous and enjoyable. There is a second round of Jackie vs. Benny The Jet Urquidez. But the main highlight of this film is the constant fights between the trio. And how they fight each other all at once. And it's one of Jackie's and Sammo Hung's most entertaining fight sequences plus Jackie's trademark getaway scenes. This the fights the getaways and slapstick humor all work superbly in this for the most part. If you enjoy Jackie Chan Sammo Hung and even Yuen Biao movies this one is satisfying. And is a very good finish for the trio that gives off a lasting impression.7.910".

	schema:headline " Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie And That's a Good Thing";
	schema:reviewBody "Zodiac may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hairraising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and compared to the rest of the film disorienting because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith a cartoonist working for the San Francisco Chronicle at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based and according to his accounts he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the Chronicle who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's putupon wife who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie many of the characters remain undeveloped but not for once to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga once they've served their purpose Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of Zodiac are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other wellknown films like Seven and Fight Club. But Zodiac is much more grown up than those films and for an audience to enjoy it it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples recreating the scenes of murders digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the preCSI era when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion but the reallife end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination and what a journey it is.Grade A".

Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's putupon wife who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie many of the characters remain undeveloped but not for once to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga once they've served their purpose Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of Zodiac are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other wellknown films like Seven and Fight Club. But Zodiac is much more grown up than those films and for an audience to enjoy it it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples recreating the scenes of murders digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the preCSI era when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion but the reallife end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination and what a journey it is.Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say without doubt that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along you think it's someone then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.The film is beautifully shot on VIPER digital cameras and once again Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.The only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long. At roughly 2 12 hours I can see how many would think that is long but you have to realize that this is an intricate story with deep characters who need to be examined and understood. A standard 90 minute film or even a two hour cut would not have been able to tell the story as well. Character motivation and important details would have been left on the cutting room floor.If you have followed the Zodiac case you will be happy to see how well done this movie is. If you don't know anything about the case you will be given an excellent story that will make you want to learn more about it. Regardless you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. If nothing else it's better than Wild Hogs.".

But let's face it this is not a film that can be wrapped up in an hour and a half. There's an awful lot of detail involved in this case. David Fincher was very thorough in his research and full marks to him. This is an excellent compelling film for anyone interested in true crime and general detective work.I saw this film a few hours ago and was completely absorbed by it. The opening 4th of July sequence is worthy of the ticket price alone. And I challenge anyone to listen to Hurdy Gurdy Man by Donovan without a cold chill running down their spine after watching this...The main performances are excellent  Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal in particular are a standout. Any feminists out there won't be happy with the rather onedimensional women's roles and I happen to be female but this is not what this film is about. It's about a handful of men's obsessive involvement with one case. And these men ARE utterly obsessed. And after so much taunting by the Zodiac with his letters and cyphers who can blame them for their obsession? As for the depiction of the murders they are quite shocking in their brief brutality with absolutely no glamorous or excessive lingering shots of the aftermath. This makes them infinitely more real and much more disturbing...Combine this with utterly believable dialogue a superb soundtrack and marvellous production design and you have one classy movie.

Zodiac is not a film that uses or relies on suspended disbelief to succeed and does not attempt to compress five years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested. Instead it relies heavily on the facts and uses all of its 158 minutes to present them in almost linear form and staccato fashion.Set primarily in San Francisco in the late 1960's and 70's and eventually the 80's Fincher's Zodiac takes no artistic license by adding the obligatory car chase scene down Russian Hill drug enhanced evening in HaightAshbury or conspiracy oriented behind the scenes moves by City Hall.

Chronicle Editorial Cartoonist Robert Graysmith Jake Gyllenhall and S.F. Chronicle reporter Paul Avery Robert Downey Jr.. Each of these people as well as those surrounding them are operating well within the confines of every day life and the establishment. Fincher does not let Zodiac wander outside its central story and therefore no editorial comment about the Vietnam War or similar events of the day are offered. Insights about the impact on the victims who survive or their families are only touched upon if they remain central to the story.The initial scenes of the movie depict the killer in operation and they are not sugar coated. However viewers wanting to see a film in the style of Fincher's Alien 3 Se7en or even Fight Club i.e. blood and gore to almost surreal levels should look elsewhere.Zodiac is a well crafted production on all fronts. In addition to Fincher the lead actors and extensive and well known supporting cast Zodiac producer's assembled a credible team. James Vanderbilt Screenplay David Shire Score Donald Burt Production Design Keith Cunningham Art Direction Victor Zolfo Set Direction and Casey Storm Costume Design all deliver quality work in their respective areas.

	schema:headline " The Stranger Urban Americans Fear A Killer Playing the Most Dangerous Game";
	schema:reviewBody "The era in which Zodiac takes place bridges two eras in urban America. The Zodiac appeared on the tail end of a crimespree that rampaged across the US in the late 1960's. His settling in the SF Bay Area may be one of a number of social phenomenons that pushed America's view of itself out of an innocent 1950's sensibility and into a harder and darker view that became more prevalent starting in the 1970's and into the 1980's. People even in urban areas used to be far more trusting of one another friendly and civil. Many of the events of the 1960's gave urban Americans a much more cynical and cautious attitude toward people they didn't know. Don't trust or talk to strangers. Better to sacrifice helpfulness than to wind up dead. People are out to take advantage. At least in urban areas nowadays it seems people are much less willing to take the risk to meeting someone they don't know largely out of fear.The film Zodiac chronicles the strange unknowable and faceless figure that emerged as a serial killer in Northern California in the late 1960's and early 1970's. He sent letters to the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers outlining his last and future kills and he revealed he was inspired by the 1930's cult classic The Most Dangerous Game. The point of view is largely from the side of the press with a character from SF Homicide that is also tracking the case. One character Robert Graysmith Jake Gyllenhaal is an SF Chronicle cartoonist who at first takes an amateur's interest in the case often bothering fellow beat journalist Paul Avery played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr. Only later does the cartoonist engage on his own investigation to reveal the identity of the Zodiac. When Graysmith begins receiving anonymous phone calls with nothing but heavy breathing you can't help but wonder if he's also playing the same game and if he may also become one of the hunted.One of the most brilliant aspects of the film is its pacing. It never lets up and the suspense is always there which becomes unsettling when you realize that these events actually took place instead of purely in the imagination of a modern suspense novelist. There is an eeriness which pervades the entire film. A car stopping unexpectedly in a nearlydeserted area is more frightening than most scenes in your average lowbudget slasher flicks.I do have a couple of shortcomings to this film. There are a couple of scenes where the cruelty and brutality of the violence is such that not all viewers will be able to handle this movie. I found I did have to turn away at a couple of scenes. Also there are a couple of moments when the state of the investigation is not made clear. However even given these shortcoming Zodiac is a brilliant movie that tackles a subjectmatter that probably could not have been brought to the screen during the period it depicts.The Zodiac came to personify one of the constant fears of living in urban America a faceless emotionless killer that comes out of the shadows of a dark alley to commit heinous violence. In the end we fear strangers because of this but we end up sacrificing love. It is an ironic aspect of human nature that people can do to strangers what would be almost unthinkable to do to people that we know. In addition to the poor innocent people that were brutally murdered the Zodiac committed another crime against humanity. He compromised our sense of trust civility and in many ways love for our fellow human beings even when we might not know them.".

However even given these shortcoming Zodiac is a brilliant movie that tackles a subjectmatter that probably could not have been brought to the screen during the period it depicts.The Zodiac came to personify one of the constant fears of living in urban America a faceless emotionless killer that comes out of the shadows of a dark alley to commit heinous violence. In the end we fear strangers because of this but we end up sacrificing love. It is an ironic aspect of human nature that people can do to strangers what would be almost unthinkable to do to people that we know. In addition to the poor innocent people that were brutally murdered the Zodiac committed another crime against humanity. He compromised our sense of trust civility and in many ways love for our fellow human beings even when we might not know them.";

He should have received an Oscar nomination along with Fincher supporting actor Mark Ruffalo portraying Inspector Dave Toschi and of course Zodiac itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20 of them even saw it! As author James Ellroy says on a commentary track this film is respectful of the victims. The intensity of a murder investigation has rarely been recreated more impressively than here. To compare modern 21st century technology with what these folks had to work with in the late 60's70's is to realize Zodiac whoever he was had to be one of the dumb luckiest criminals of all time. His ideas were not original to put it politely and the fact he probably was a child molester really makes him a predator that treated society in general like a little innocent he abused for his own perverse reasons. Men who feel powerless and then get a big gun are the most dangerous fools of all because they're ticked off and want somebody anybody to pay!".

	schema:headline " Fincher's best? No. But still very good";
	schema:reviewBody "I am tired of people writing comments like this Not Fincher's best. Honestly who cares. We all agree that Fincher's best is either Seven or Fight Club two outstanding masterpieces. There is a big margin between a film like one of those and a terrible film and people don't seem to realize that. These people even do this with other filmmakers like Spielberg or Scorsese the fact that these filmmakers don't reproduce Schindler's List or Raging Bull doesn't mean that their new stuff isn't good or worth seeing. I think it is a stupid way to comment on a film eliminating the critic's credibility. I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of Zodiac last night and I must say that at first I was discouraged by two things some of the comments I have read and the running time. However I am glad to say that I enjoyed this film very much. It is a solid suspense thriller that pins you to your seat. Being a true story adds quite a lot to the experience and besides Fincher did a wonderful job is staying loyal to the story and at the same time adding his unique flavor to it. The cinematography like every Fincher film is great the darkness and griddiness of the story are perfectly portrayed in the film's visual elements. I was surprised by the picture quality of the Viper the digital camera with which this film was shot. Many people have been criticizing this choice but I respect it he is embracing a new technology and making it work. Of course its still not a match to 35 mm but if quality filmmakers don't start experimenting with it it will never be. Now the reason why this film falls behind Seven and Fight Club I think is because of a problem with the characters. They seem to be a little weak at times. The performances were great especially Robert Downey Jr. but I think that this film falls short when it comes to a true exploration of complex characters which is the key to Fincher's previous films.So... my advice to everyone is to ignore most of the negative comments and see the film yourself. I found it to be a great story told in a remarkable way very entertaining with great performances and wonderful direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just a few days ago my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing even if you knew the whole story.In the small towns of California there are several brutal murders eventually going onto San Fransisco. These murders are extremely violent and very random and every time it happens there is a message or sign that is left by the killer that calls himself the Zodiac. He sends letters to the press on how and where he killed his victims and teases the police that they will never catch him. But Robert one of the newspaper cartoonist starts to obsess about the killer who he is and how they can capture him.With an all star cast we had absolutely no problem with acting because it was terrific. Jake and Mark held their own very well. The whole story is very chilling and kept you going. The Zodiac Killer is a case that forever will remain a mystery and it was a great idea for a film Fincher added a Se7en type of feel to this film. It's so funny how I knew the story and how it ended already but I was actually just waiting to see what would happen in the next scene. I would highly recommend this film to any thriller fan I'm sure you'll enjoy it it's a great one for 2007.810".

Then the film's first murder happens and we are at the San Francisco chronicle with Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. just recognizable enough under their period garb.We see three other murders or almostmurders within the first 1 12 hours of this 2 12 hour movie and they are terrifying in a way that few movie murders are this is one of the only movies that succeeds at making you identify with the victims and the murder scenes contain enough gore to be convincing but not so much gore that it becomes its own aesthetic as in other Fincher films.But ZODIAC is so long that eventually the murders fail to keep our attention. The movie makes so many leaps through time and recounts so many investigations that lead nowhere it is easy to forget that it began as an exciting movie.One could easily argue that the movie has a right to be so uneventful because it is a realistic reflection of police procedure and of well reality. It is but one can't help but think With all the timelapsing that goes on it constantly jumps months ahead in the late '60s and early '70s and then jumps from '73 to '77 to '83 to '91 why couldn't it skip more boring parts? The movie manages to be both too truncated and too thorough.On a positive note the digital cinematography by Harris Savides gives the film a consistently interesting look which is something that many better movies don't have. He gives the film the signature Fincher look saturated pastels in the daytime and a vague yellowgreen tint at night. The movie is visually interesting without being calling too much attention to itself but it's a shame that there's not enough to watch. The actors are sufficient but the movie has no protagonist and we don't get to know anyone well enough  not even Robert Graysmith Jake Gyllenhall who becomes the de facto main character half way through.The friendship between Graysmith and Paul Avery Robert Downey Jr.  particularly a bar scene in which Graysmith introduces Avery to the merits of girly drinks  is interesting enough but when Avery ceases to be a major character we don't get enough of an indication that Graysmith has a life outside of his obsession with the Zodiac case. That may have been the point but it doesn't work there is nothing wrong with a plot that goes nowhere if the characters manage to hold our interest but they don't hold our interest for all 2 12 hours and the movie itself seems to lose interest in Graysmith towards the end. ZODIAC has no payoff which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't such a plotdriven film.Still it has its moments that nearly redeem it. It's a bit like a friend who tells long and meandering but enthusiastic stories once you realize that his stories will always be too long you can focus on the better parts. But his stories are still too long.".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew a good amount about this case going into the film as I always found the famous serial killer ones very interesting when I'd see a TV special about them on. It's also no secret that it's one of the few that went unsolvable to this day so I really didn't know what to expect from a thriller that pretty much everyone already knows how it'll end. However Zodiac was made with a style that allowed the perspective to seem fresh even if it ultimately wasn't. This is a must see for any true lover of real police work that gets down to the nittygritty of what detectives have to go through in actuality. No one's job is glamorized and in fact it's portrayed as the other way aroundpeople get fired demoted or simply go flat out crazy. What fascinated me so much about the 'Zodiac Killer' more than the other murderers I've heard about was how he kept changing his methods which is the main reason why he was able to elude capture for so long. All in all this made for one excellent cinematic puzzle that remained that way.The biggest surprise of this movie was that David Fincher directed it. Even though he doesn't come out with many new filmswith the exception of maybe Panic Room those that he does direct are both highly innovative and entertaining. However this effort strayed away from the beaten path and was very different from the type of flick he usually churns out which turned out to be a worthy venture. While I still prefer the likes of Seven and Fight Club this was close to them in overall quality. So much detail was taken into account when recreating the time period and crimes. Even though the film was shot digitally they edited it so the appearance had a grainy texture as it did back in the 70's. Also the costumes settings modes of transportation and everything else was matched to a T.The acting was strictly topnotch here and the biggest kudos goes to Robert Downey Jr. He was absolutely amazing! It's sad that he's at his best when he's playing a character that gets lost in a world of drugs and alcohol as his life has imitated this art for quite some time. Nevertheless he was so amusing to watch and added a playful quirkiness to Paul Avery that I don't think it would've been possible to play him any better. While Robert easily stole the show a very honorable mention was Mark Ruffalo. He did quite well too and while he usually does this went above and beyond what he's normally capable of. It's evident that as decent as Mark always has been in the past there's always room for improvement. Everyone else put in great turns too and there wasn't a single performance that came close to being unbelievable.Potential viewers should also be warned this film isn't for everybody. There are a few very disturbing sequences that while they aren't even terribly graphicstill manage to be creepy beyond belief due to their realism pertaining to the sheer coldness in which they're displayed. Another factor is the 160minute running time which except for the first third when the actual killings are taking place quickly starts dragging on following that. All the facts had to be included though so it really couldn't have been much shorter without losing its potency. You also have to remain openminded if you watch it and can't demand any kind of closure except for what you can conclude on your own otherwise you'll leave awfully disappointed. Finally it can be argued that only one viewpoint is being showed here and that is the author's this automatically leads to a bias. I personally think it's the most logical account of events but if you want an impartial take on what went down your best bet is to watch a documentary on the history of events that took place.It's very scary to think that such a gruesome individual could go about undetected for so long and that we'll never get to find out the real answer on who it was behind everything. Fincher's latest contribution is a compelling view for all those with strong stomachs and was eerily refreshing compared to what junk has been streaming out of Hollywood lately. There are many notable guest appearances and is quite simply a welldone movie even if it did get hammed up a little bit. I personally am going to avoid secluded places for awhilejust in case my astrological sign reads anywhere near the same as it did for all the poor victims.".

Everyone else put in great turns too and there wasn't a single performance that came close to being unbelievable.Potential viewers should also be warned this film isn't for everybody. There are a few very disturbing sequences that while they aren't even terribly graphicstill manage to be creepy beyond belief due to their realism pertaining to the sheer coldness in which they're displayed. Another factor is the 160minute running time which except for the first third when the actual killings are taking place quickly starts dragging on following that. All the facts had to be included though so it really couldn't have been much shorter without losing its potency. You also have to remain openminded if you watch it and can't demand any kind of closure except for what you can conclude on your own otherwise you'll leave awfully disappointed. Finally it can be argued that only one viewpoint is being showed here and that is the author's this automatically leads to a bias. I personally think it's the most logical account of events but if you want an impartial take on what went down your best bet is to watch a documentary on the history of events that took place.It's very scary to think that such a gruesome individual could go about undetected for so long and that we'll never get to find out the real answer on who it was behind everything. Fincher's latest contribution is a compelling view for all those with strong stomachs and was eerily refreshing compared to what junk has been streaming out of Hollywood lately. There are many notable guest appearances and is quite simply a welldone movie even if it did get hammed up a little bit. I personally am going to avoid secluded places for awhilejust in case my astrological sign reads anywhere near the same as it did for all the poor victims.";

It's truly all over now.I went to a radio station screening of the movie yesterday and I was utterly disappointed. Most people know the story of the Zodiac so a lot of the suspense would be gone. But a good movie about a serial killer needs suspense. The movie starts off brilliantly focusing on writer Paul Avery's downward decent of obsession with the story and the revelation of the identity of the killer. Robert Downey Jr's portrayal is stunning and he builds much empathy for the character. The story moves along at a brisk pace and it keeps you entertained.Then when you think the movie is over it just keeps going. It tells the story of the decent of Robert Graysmith retreading a similar storyline for another hour plus. Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job but the audience quickly loses interest. The movie keeps track of time by announcing the time lapse between scenes 2 months later for example and as the movie passes the two hour mark you could hear the audience groan every time a new announcement of time was displayed.Why is this a bad movie? The photography set dressing and costuming was top notch. The cast was brilliant. Even the story is compelling but the editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall seems to be missing. I think Fincher used every frame he shot in the final cut and that does this movie a terrible disservice. When telling a story you have to read your audience and make sure they stayed engaged. This movie loses you at 150. I hardly ever tell people to stay away from a movie but I'm telling you to stay away from Zodiac. It will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.".

After a while you start to think the acting is pretty good because there is nothing else to look at. But there's no getting around the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is just plain awful. You don't believe him for a second. Save your money stay at home sit in a dark room and just think about how bleak underwhelming flat and empty life is.";

	schema:headline " This Is The Zodiac Speaking";
	schema:reviewBody "With those five words and with countless threats and baffling cryptograms a serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 60s and early 70s. In the thirtyfive years since the attacks the only suspect ever officially named in the case was Arthur Leigh Allen. Yet recent DNA analysis seems to have eliminated Allen as a suspect. Like Jack the Ripper the Zodiac's identity remains to this day ... unknown.There have been a couple of other films about the Zodiac. But Director David Fincher's thriller is by far the most ambitious and high profile. Based on two books by researcher Robert Graysmith the film starts off with reenactments of some of the killer's attacks. Most of the film however follows three men who were involved in the original investigation Graysmith Jake Gyllenhaal Inspector Toschi Mark Ruffalo and reporter Paul Avery Robert Downey Jr..Procedural in style the film reminds me of All The President's Men with its dogged and maddening investigation by unofficial individuals. Here Graysmith's obsession with the case matches the obsession of Woodward and Bernstein. Zodiac has a big problem with pacing. Suspense is sporadic at best. Too much dialogue and unnecessary sequences especially in the film's middle Act render considerable boredom. Given the film's length these talky sequences could easily have been edited out.The film's production design and overall acting quality are good. I could have wished for more late 60's era music. The Hurdy Gurdy Man was good but not enough. Authentic location shots add credibility to the story as nonfiction. The film's cinematography makes use of the new digital Viper camera. As such Zodiac is significant in that it becomes the first major movie to be filmed without conventional videotape or film.A flabby screenplay interferes with what should have been a riveting thriller. Still if you are interested in this true life crime case Fincher's Zodiac records the lengthy and futile search for the infamous killer who still fascinates us even after all these years. Unless this case is solved quickly it will soon become a crime legend of historic proportions every bit as haunting as the legend of Jack the Ripper.".

What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be well crazy. He was eccentric and freaky the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherlyfigure and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.This is definitely a movie for everyone especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen Charlie  The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks ! and more specifically since Big Fish Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films  now the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it reality but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie  The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with real sets real Oompas Loompas real squirrels the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and SpiderMan the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers a true musical rollercoaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film. After that it's just emotions. All kinds of them laughs many  the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds tears of joy we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster mercy the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching amazement the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us and many mores. Very much like the book even though it seems simple and childish you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact. Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well pretty unknown flick here in Europe and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those weird a word he likes  you've all seen the TV spots and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus Vercua Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that John August's vision of Wonka's past including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic BurtonElfman work with some interesting experiments the main themes are splendid the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses they're just offbeat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out it'll bring them back 15 years ago.What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.As for the ending without revealing it August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the family theme that he developed through the film it's still Burton not Disney Burton makes you feel good because he feels good and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie. I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father he became one he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the Edward Scissorhands of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.Thank you M.Burton. Thank you very much".

I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father he became one he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the Edward Scissorhands of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.Thank you M.Burton. Thank you very much";

I loved the book as a child and loved the original film with Gene Wilder for its own original contributions...perhaps I'm biased. Still I have always admired Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's work and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of Roald Dahl's book.This film was indeed more true to the book than the 1971 version...the squirrel room the jungle scene the children leaving the factory perhaps a little wiser for the wear. However the character development of the 1971 version was MUCH better than here...you were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character including Willy Wonka. I did think that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was more true to the book than Gene Wilder's...Willy Wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric. However I thought that this film's preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important which is to establish the intentions of each character. At least in the 1971 version it's pretty clear what each character's intentions are...even if establishing some of these intentions requires a conspiracy involving Slugworth. And though I haven't read the book in a very long time I do NOT remember any details being given as to Willy Wonka's childhood...I thought these were unnecessary distracting and a waste of time. This energy could have been better spent on the children's' character development in my opinion. This is after all supposed to be a story for and about children.The oompa loompas. It's true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version i.e. very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair. However though the songs they sing here are true to the book they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top. Also I didn't like that they were all clones of each other...I think that was a poor choice.Finally I was appalled with the ending...this ties in with my previous comments re Willy Wonka's childhood. It changed the whole idea behind the story itself which is supposed to be from my perspective that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending as long as they're honest selfless and generous. This movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity. Both are perfectly good and legitimate themes but my reading of the book left me with an impression that Roald Dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter. Accordingly then this movie did not do the book justice in the most important and fundamental way whereas the 1971 film was able to do so despite its shortcomings.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of its important to say that I am a Roald Dahl fan and indeed a fan of the original 1971 film Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. What that film and the work of Roald Dahl have in common is charm warmth eccentricity etc. This Tim Burton film does not share in any of it. Having sat and forced myself to watch the entire film hoping something good would happen I was left feeling nothing but empty. I enjoyed most of Tim Burton's work and was rather excited about this film when it was announced the trailers never gave away too much and I kept on hoping right up until the credits rolled. So whats so bad about it then? My first massive problem with the film is the reactions from the children through the film. Were they sedated during filming? Watch the scene where they tear down the chocolate river in the boiled sweet boat does one of them even scream in delight? are they not amazed they are on a boat made from candy on a river of flowing chocolate? Most of the time they stand there looking like they would rather be somewhere else how are we supposed to believe in the wonder of this amazing factory if the kids there aren't even impressed too much blue screen work perhaps means the poor actors had nothing to be amazed at my second not quite as massive problem with the film is Burton's muse Johnny Depp. Perhaps their relationship is getting stale but Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was nothing but irritating less eccentric more pathetic. The creepy grey skin luminous teeth puppy dog eyes and hushed voice all add up to a character that I was bored of in the first 5 minutes after seeing him. The ridiculous back story of his childhood was totally superfluous and added nothing to the film it's like Burton really wasn't trying 'why does wonka love candy....? hmmmm maybe his father was a wicked dentist who wouldn't let him eat it... I could get christopher lee to play him! get on to casting!' Wonka was supposed to be a man with years and years of experience behind him a weathered eccentric not an excitablesedated puppy point number 3 THE MUSIC perhaps the worst score to a film I have ever heard Danny elfman shame on you. OK so they wanted to bring the songs up to date but jeez the music is just bad the incidental music is bad also its all bad.4 the Oompa Loompa's. this really made me sad really sad so in the revised book they are like miniature cavemen in the 1971 film they are crazy psychedelic dwarfs in this film they are... one man one dwarf Burton employed him in 'Big Fish' he did OK there but he is so wrong for the part of an oompa loompa and why does he have to play all of them? another gimmick that I suspect Burton really didn't waste any time over coming up with his expressionless face might have worked as a sad clown but the cheeky Oompa Loompas? I think not there were a few god points the authenticity minus the stupid flashbacks I loved seeing the candy boat in all its glory the fudge mountain  an actual glass elevator rather than the weird gold thing in the 1971 film but who really cares about all these things when not one person in the film seemed to be impressed by it did the crew record dry run rehearsals by accident?  by the way the original elevator of the book didn't have rockets on the side it used sky hooks and was powered by sugar but kids would just laugh at that right? It was nice to see charlie's dad regardless of the fact he is of no importance to the film. The sets were OK but lacked any real wow factor.basically if you took burtons script chucked out all the nonsense hired a new director kept the sets and gave them a bit more wow and hired a new sound guy and told everyone to smile and have a laugh it wouldn't be that bad but that didn't happen mores the pity. OK so one day say 30 years from now I will make it again its the only way I can resolve my issues with this disaster.in short if you are a roald dahl fan and like the 1971 film DO NOT WATCH THIS honestly I regret ever seeing it".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly cannot see why anybody would like this rubbish over the original. Whereas the 1971 version sparkled with innocence charm and magic this monstrosity will leave you feeling violently ill and internally disturbed by the time the closing credits roll.Let me begin by saying I don't personally enjoy Tim Burton's style and didn't like the dark influence he brought to this film. Depp's Wonka is perhaps the creepiest character I've ever watched in a movie. Unlike Gene Wilder's eccentric yet loving Wonka he openly expresses his disgust and hatred towards the children. One need only watch the scene in which a shrunken Mike Teavee is nearly stabbed by a viciousfaced OompaLoompa or the one in which Veruca Salt is dragged screaming into the garbage chute while Wonka pretends he cannot find the right key to let Mr. Salt into save his daughter to understand Wonka's cruelty. In the original Wonka seemed merely disappointed and bored during the children's accidents and he always kept his head he knew no harm would befall the young troublemakers. Here we see Wonka laughing dancing and cheering as the Oompa Loompas sing about children being turned into chocolate and eaten.The scenes of the four naughty children's punishments were incredibly disturbing and the jokes about cannibalism just made me cringe at the stupidity of it all. Charlie Bucket who should have been the main character was a disappointment. Throughout most of the film he seems rather expressionless and bored unlike the genuine and honest boy played by Peter Ostrum in the original movie. The 1971 Charlie had a dream he wanted more than his povertystricken life he strived to help his family out of tight situations he wasn't perfect but he was a believable character and that's what made him so lovable he was just like us all. This Charlie doesn't seem to care about anything he seems perfectly happy with his life and hardly seems to care about getting a golden ticket. The other children are equally disappointing Violet Beauregarde manages to pull off her characters fairly well but even so she had little to work with. The songs in the original were hopeful and inspiring such as the charming 'Candy Man' and 'I've Got a Golden Ticket' the heartwarming 'Cheer up Charlie' and the magnificent 'Pure Imagination.' In this new versionthe only songs we get are a cheesy welcome song in which childlike puppets explode and melt into ghoulish wraith like figures plus the nauseating OompaLoompa filth. The emotional 1971 ending with Wonka Charlie and Grandpa Goe in the elevator has been replaced with Wonka refusing the other Buckets to enter the factory becoming a hobo and eventually reuniting with his abusive dentist father ??? In a short review with a maximum of 1 000 words I simply can't do justice to the badness of this movie so I'll leave it at this the old movie has a positive and uplifting message that will bring tears to even the coldest eye. This one crushes the viewer down into the dust while screaming its message into their face. So unless you enjoy stupid jokes children in despair and nauseating songs don't waste any money on this soulless emotionally disturbing piece of filth.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was simply awful. I am waiting for someone anyone to point out that Johnny Depp was just terrible. The first twenty minutes in a grandiose fashion leads us to a giant man named Willy Wonka who can put the world on it's toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars. Then when you meet Wonka he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich and bad. You get the whole Hollywood push of rich kids are evil while poor kids are perfect meanwhile what about the children of Hollywood actors and producers and directors are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists?

The first twenty minutes in a grandiose fashion leads us to a giant man named Willy Wonka who can put the world on it's toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars. Then when you meet Wonka he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich and bad. You get the whole Hollywood push of rich kids are evil while poor kids are perfect meanwhile what about the children of Hollywood actors and producers and directors are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists? I don't get it. I just don't get it. I really don't get this at all. This movie was so terrible. The songs were horrid.

The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting the dialog the people all fell short of human behavior. Small example A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand I want it Daddy. Where's the yelling the screams has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum?? Additional Example The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune. As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by ANYTHING much less squirrels?!The Ompa Loompa problem I loved them actually. Tiny creepy and what a great story on how they were found. They were great until they broke into a bad Britney spears song and dance. What the ! was that?!Flashback problem I loved johnny's character quirky and fun. Nevertheless the flashbacks didn't add much at all to anything. And they were executed in the WORST WAYS i've ever seen. sorry I was having a flashback. They are far better ways to have had those worked honestly.The T.V. kid was he really so horrible?

	schema:headline " Burton Studied the Book's Original Illustrations";
	schema:reviewBody "If Tim Burton's out there I just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the book's original illustrations to the screen. He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings especially in the case of Charlie's family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I'm talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of crosshatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available especially in a hardcover but you'll need to search the net. I don't know how he did it but he got the facial expressions of Charlie's family and of Mike Teavea's father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl's sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one really get Roald Dahl's sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton's addition of Wonka's childhood story fits well although I'll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl's spirit. Even in the resolution however Burton maintains sly humor. It is wellacted by everybody. I'd like to say that Julia Winter who plays Veruca Salt has turned in a truly wellobserved comedic performance. Depp converts the novel's jaunty precise Wonka into a quirky one but it works well because as in the novel Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man given power will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very very close.".

	schema:headline " Tim and Johnny Disappoint";
	schema:reviewBody "If the only justification for this being a great movie is that it is true to the book then it shouldn't have been made at all. Tim Burton has successfully digitized and sterilized the Chocolate Factory universe and in so doing has destroyed a wonderful piece of pop culture. No longer will orangefaced greenhaired Oompa Loompas populate my imagination and nightmares. No longer will I wonder just what in the world an American boy was doing living in a ramshackle house in a nondescript Bavarian town. And no longer will I wonder what drove Gene Wilder's Wonka to be such a lovable sadist or just exactly what drugs he popped before taking that insane boat ride. In short the imagination of the original film is gone replaced with a shallow bloated bigbudget disappointment. When the film was first announced I was ecstatic that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton would be taking it on. I thought only Johnny would have the skills to successfully reinvent the enigmatic Wonka and only Burton or maybe David Lynch would be able to make the disturbing Oompa Loompa's even more disturbing. The film fails in both respects. Visually Depp does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of Wonka. His buggy sunglasses velvet coat and top hat were faithful both to Wilder's Wonka and the whimsical nature of the character himself. But Depp's acting andor the material he was working with fell flat. In the few lines of dialogue that actually fit into the context of the scene Depp's delivery was synthetic and provided no insight into the character. Perhaps this was intended but for me it backfired. If they wanted me to loathe the character it worked. By contrast Gene Wilder's take left no doubt about his distaste for children  Think of his wonderful eyerolling while saying No please stop..  or his true reversal when he finally finds a child of virtue  You did it Charlie! I knew you would! His performance is nuanced and genuine. Depp's is taut and plastic. Where is the playful and inventive dialogue like Oh you should never never doubt what nobody is sure about. and So much time and so little to do. Wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it.?Now to the Oompa Loompa's. Those little orange buggers have been scaring the hell out of me ever since I saw the original as a child. I couldn't wait to see Burton's twisted take when the movie was announced. Then I heard that the Loompas would be played by one actor Deep Roy and digitally reproduced. I began to worry. My worries were well justified when I saw the film and the Oompas had become a cloned and shrunken version of Roy with only latex jumpsuits to lend any suggestion of the bizarre. The musical numbers were equally disappointing. Glitzy fastpaced and well choreographed they nevertheless pale in comparison to the catchy and unforgettable originals with their doompadeedoos  on a par with the Ohheeohhs of the Wizard of Oz for great movie choruses sung by guys with brightlycolored faces. In fact I don't think there was one line in any of the new movie's songs that I actually could understand. And since the musical numbers added so much to the story in the original I definitely felt something was missing this time. Burton has always been a master at creating otherworldly environments that incorporate just enough anachronisms and bizarre elements to keep you guessing whether the story is supposed to be set in our universe or not. He does another admirable job of it here. From the opening credits with their depiction of a Rube Goldbergesque chocolate machine to the imaginative nut sorting room Burton uses his talents well to create a rich landscape. However I think he fell short in a few spots. His take on the Augustus Gloop and Violet Beauregarde incidents is identical to the original but with less dialogue. And the only new element in the Mike Teevee scene is the cute homage to 2001 A Space Odyssey and other cinema classics. I think a director like Burton could have gone to town so to speak with this material and still stayed faithful to the book. Another element of the film that I found irritating were the flashbacks to Wonka's youth and other departures from the main story such as the origin of the Oompa Loompa's. The biographical material on Wonka not only eliminated some of the mystery surrounding the character but it was tired and predictable to suggest that his eccentricities were the result of his troubled relationship with his father. Gee  Their subsequent reconciliation at the end of the movie was a real shocker once this was revealed. And how how how Mr. Burton could you tackle the subject of the vicious indigenous creatures of Loompaland without talking about those rotten Vernicious Knits!Bad remakes and needless sequels are not only poor cinema they detract from their predecessors. Unfortunately I think Burton's film will have just that impact on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Perhaps I need to read the book again something I haven't done since my childhood to appreciate this movie for its faithfulness to Dahl's vision. Somehow I don't think that will make me like it any better though. After all when we now see Homer in Simpsons episode DABF03 ask to see the Oompa Loompa because he's freaky will it strike the same chord? I think not.".

About the only things in our opinion that had improved over the 1971 version was the visual effects  these were excellent and giving some background to some of the characters was also a good idea.Overall given that we could only bear to watch the first hour I would say don't waste your money  go and rent the 1971 version from the local video store.".

The opening scene was absolutely riveting showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate. I almost fell off my sit because I was so intrigued. The beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful. The real fun began when we met Willy Wonka. I won't say who he reminded me of.. anyone who's seen the film would know and I don't want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who haven't yet had the honour. The oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things I have ever seen. Who choreographed them?! I want to meet this insane idiot! It literally made me want to puke. They had an eerie kind of synchronization which was so unnatural that it was scary. I admit to finding the first dance slightly amusing but by the time I'd got to the 4th I was just staring at the screen in disgust.Words of warning Don't go and see this sad excuse for entertainment.

	schema:headline " I can't shake longings for Wilder and tangerine faces...";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Tim Burton has come a long way since his first job as an animator for Disney in the early 1980's. He made several animated shorts none of which were deemed suitable for children  an early indication of Burton's dark outlook. However his hard work and talent did not go unnoticed. His subsequent directorial work on Beetlejuice 1988 Batman 1989 and Batman Returns 1992 cemented his role as an experimental and visionary directorproducer. Nobody else therefore was surely more suitable to adapt Dahl's muchloved novel and nobody else was surely daring enough to attempt a remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971 directed by Mel Stuart that enduring classic starring Gene Wilder as Wonka.Burton's repeated use of Depp in previous films Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow to name just three indicated him to be an obvious and it could be argued perfect choice to cast as Wonka. Depp is by far the best thing about this film. His character's whole persona  the costume and body language the tone of his voice his pithy lines delivered in a contemptuous and yet charming manner are all presented in such a way to add up to a well deserved challenge to Wilder's crown. But does he steal it? I'd say he doesn't. For someone that grew up with Roald Dahl's novels and film adaptations Wilder IS Wonka. Trying to ignore my obvious bias I believe Depp does put up a good fight and perhaps if the parents of the four terrible children had shown more spark or been actors of a higher calibre his comic moments would have had much more impact.Burton's other muse Helena Bonham Carter is miscast as Charlie's mother. Her lines are delivered distractedly and with the air of someone very aware of her status in the film industry. Thankfully her role is quite minor and doesn't impact negatively upon the film. Freddie Highmore is fairly insipid yet not offensive in his role of Charlie. The same description can be applied to David Kelley who plays his Grandpa Joe. With the exception of Augustus Gloop whose role is comparatively minor the four ticketwinning children do not live up to expectations or standards set in the '71 Mel Stuart version. They simply serve to mildly irritate and disappoint particularly Veruca and Violet. But I doubt anyone could match Julie Dawn Cole the original Veruca.A certain amount of furore has surrounded Deep Roy the 4ft 4 tall actor who plays every single one of Wonka's allsinging alldancing Oompa Loompas. He also plays Wonka's therapist and in a tongueincheek moment appears briefly on the closing sequence where he is revealed to be the narrator. The effects used to reproduce Roy as every single OompaLoompa I believe detract from the film. When viewing scenes surely it's preferable to be absorbed and involved than to be distracted by special effects and wondering 'howwhy did they do that?' Additionally Roy's scenes are the only ones to feature music  there is no Wonka or Grandpa Joe breaking into song and dance in this adaptation. All we get here are the OompaLoompa's didactic lyrics which unfortunately are drowned out by belowpar sound editing.In an unprecedented move Burton and screenwriter James August have given Wonka a history. Christopher Lee who is sadly underused in this film plays his father and we get to find out exactly why Wonka is such an enigma. I won't reveal the outcome short of saying it's pretty unsatisfying and takes away Wonka's mystery  the very thing that makes him appealing. Claims have been made that this adaptation follows Dahl's novel much more closely than the 1971 version of which it does  everything is followed almost to the letter. Unfortunately the Wonkafather storyline clearly undermines any attempt the film has made to stay true to Dahl's novel  should Dahl had wished there to be a father figure he would have included that in his book. However certain artistic license is always taken when adapting books and plays to the big screen and this creativity is needed to keep images and story lines fresh and to prevent any static grounding.As regards the imagery of the film well it's a Burton film and true to form we aren't disappointed. Typically we enter and leave the film during gentle snowfall. The poor Buckets' house leans pitifully to one side and almost makes you shiver when Charlie climbs into bed underneath a gaping whole in the roof. Colour is suitably hued down apart from certain scenes in the factory where the vibrant colours bring the songs and sets to life  the Chocolate Room and the Boat Ride come alive and the Television Room almost blinds. The only fault I could find and it is minor is that at certain points of the Chocolate Room scene the chocolate river where Augustus Gloop meets his untimely suction looks more like brown water than creamy chocolate. Apart from the aforementioned poor sound editing of the featured songs audio here is of a top standard. Sound effects are clear no dialogue is gone unheard and the musical score is in keeping with the tone of the film.Verdict  It's easy to be overpicky when comparing a film not only to a novel but also to an earlier much loved and highlyestablished film adaptation. However faults notwithstanding this is watchable fare that should appeal to all ages. Is it a classic? No.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton did a great job with musical numbers in Nightmare Before Christmas but the same isn't true in the live action Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. With the exception of the musical scenes this film is a splendid film with imagery characters and a general mood characteristic of Burton's films.Burton's version is a fresh retelling of the story and is a much different film than the 1971 version. I never thought I'd say this but I think I prefer the musical numbers in the '71 version poor graphics and all!. It also includes new scenes at the end which are supposedly authorized by Rohd Dahl's widow. I think the story was better as it was but the scenes do support the additional depth Burton injected into Wonka so I do appreciate the scenes for what they do.Depp was fabulous look for at least one Edward Scissorhands reference though at times reminded me of a modern Michael Jackson shudder. The only miscast character in my opinion was Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregard. She does play a good witch but I'd have preferred someone else in the role.The opening sequence has some beautiful CG though one of the final scenes has terrible character animation rotoscoped in a live action scene the Violet Beauregarde character.90 of the movie is true magic. The other 10 is ruined by the musical acts and I LOVE musicals. By the third number I learned it was a great time to get a popcorn refill or hit the restroom...The film is certainly appropriate for children and adults and both will enjoy it.".

He has no interest in children and only became a chocolatier as revenge to his father's abhorration of sweet things because he was a dentist. Depp's Wonka is much darker than Wilder's portrayal and it's one that probably caused nightmares.The Oompa Loompas are played by one person who is CGI cloned a thousand times. He's not even cute! Having the same Oompa Loompa is repetitive and annoying some variety would've been nice. The songs they sing take the lyrics directly from the book but aren't as catchy as the original's songs. I do like the different genres of music used though.The children are just as annoying as you'd expect them to be. Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie although he doesn't come across as the centre of the movie as one might expect. The demise of each child is the highlight of each segment and really moves the film along nicely.Where the film strays from the book are the parts that annoy me the most. Violet being overly competitive seems out of place and the subplot with Wonka and his father is silly. It has no place in the film and delays the inevitable ending which everyone already knows. Delaying it with an outofplace subplot is completely pointless and unnecessary.So why don't I like the movie? It's too dark. Wonka is a happy loving hyperactive character. Depp's Wonka meanders through his factory like a robot and the occasional amusing comment when he's not having flashbacks to his demented childhood.Give it a miss and see the original. Better still read the book!".

Anyways I do believe they could have done better for the role of Willy Wonka! Much better. You can really tell this was a Tim Burton movie. The coloring the acting and the sets. How about that house?? Seemed like one small touch to it and it would just fall like a deck of cards. How can Charlie really sleep with the roof open like that? Yea I know it is a fantasy book The Oompa Loompa scenes were terrible! It was interesting that the same guy played ALL of the Oompa Loompas but the dance scenes were just plain awful. Just another part which downgraded this movie. But back to the fact that he played ALL of the Oompa Loompas would it have hurt to get more than ONE person to play the parts??!? At least in the Mel Stuart version they got a bunch of them to play the parts and some of them couldn't speak English! OK time for the good parts. Tough to do. I would give this movie an 8 for the special effects. The glass elevator for instance. Traveling throughout the factory and even through the town with rockets. Nice. So having the choice of the Mel Stuart version which got away from the book a lot but good actors or this new Tim Burton which stuck to the book but bad choice of actors I would still pick the Mel Stuart version in a second!! Sorry Roald Dahl!!".

I expected a wild colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed.It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing Charlie. I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nicewholesome as one in Willy Wonka but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently as did the brat kids.A different feature of this version as opposed to the 1970 original was that here the OompaLoompas were all played by just one person a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting features on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.Johnny Depp meanwhile did what he always does  do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them. This was the only part of the movie frankly where I preferred the 1970 version the role of Willy Wonka. Yes Depp was interesting as always but a little too weird too Michael Jacksonlike for my tastes. I'll take Gene Wilder's take on the character.Otherwise this remake has it all over the original simply because it has 35 years of technology and computer work that the original wasn't able to have. It made this remake a real hoot to watch. Since entertainment is what the business is called and this movie is extremely entertaining then I have no complaints. A fun two hours!".

However her transformation into a blueberry is overdone and just looks like the computer FX it is. The oompaloompa's are without personality and their songs are mostly unintelligible. The choreography was okay but I couldn't help thinking Those CGI guys sure did a lot of work on that. Stick with the '71 version.

The man of the house played delightfully by Richard Dreyfuss saves his live and decides to take him in despite the objections of his wife played wonderfully by Bette Midler. The bum becomes an influence over everybody in the household. Plus their dog starts to love the bum. There are big laughs throughout the film though the movie is a little less funny than Bette Midler's other 1986 comedy Ruthless People. Still Down and Out has some terrific performances from Midler Dreyfuss Nolte and the rest of the supporting cast. But the real scenestealer here is the performance by Mike the Dog as Matisse the canine with a dog psychiatrist. Mike gives one of the best performances by an animal of alltime.12 out of four".

But I've never seen any whom I wish might be more like his onscreen persona than Nolte. The guy has charisma believability and is completely likable in every role.Here he staggers pretty much literally homeless into the mansion of a Beverly Hills wealthy family as dysfunctional although pleasantly so as any on the planet.Of course his presence and counsel take care of all their neuroses  bringing a relaxed enjoyment of life to Dreyfuss a reawakening of sexual delight in Midler enjoyment and relief from anorexiabulimia to the winsome daughter direction to the frustrated adolescent son happiness to the sexy Latino maid and effecting a change in the family pooch to where he can now enjoy the pleasant life of a contented happy pet.The diversions and hijinks in the story are also pleasant  often these necessary components of a film can detract  and the equally necessary closing events lead to a pleasant rapprochement and a happy ending.An excellent feel good viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure it hasn't dated all that well but look at this 1986 hit as a nice time capsule of L.A. from that time period. A period that basically ended with the sobering and terrifying riots of 1992. Down and Out in Beverly Hills deals with a welltodo yet dysfunctional family having its priorities rearranged by a bum who first attempts to drown himself in their swimming pool. Nick Nolte looking only a little scruffier than his 2002 Hawai'ian shirt mugshot plays the Jerry Baskin character on different levels. Early on he seems much like the typical run of the mill schizophrenic homeless person chasing after a dog who found himself a better owner. Then after his dunk in the pool we see that he is actually quite intelligent and observant. Almost instantly he sees what is wrong with everyone in the household. He just can't seem to point any of that intellect toward improving his own situation. Even when it is laying there right in front of him.The patriarch of the family is Dave Whiteman who embodies some of Richard Dreyfuss's better work. He is very successful yet he it just too uptight. Something seems lacking for him. It isn't the appearance of the bum that sets him off. He actually is the one who most wants him to stay if perhaps to live vicariously through him in some ways. Bette Middler is on hand as Dave's sexually unfulfilled wife who mostly spends her time with worthless selfhelp gurus. She even has one hired for their cutesy little dog. Nolte is apparently the only man around who has what it takes to recharge her batteries in bed! The family has an attractive yet obviously anorexic daughter and an androgynous son. A sexpot Hispanic maid is also on hand for Dave to use at his will... that is until Nolte moves in on her as well. The film takes place over about a month's time and there really isn't much plot to speak of other than seeing how these characters are altered by Nolte's character.The film has several funny moments and thankfully Ms. Middler is not allowed to sing too much. The theme song by the Talking Heads is always welcome to the human ear. Some of the comedy mostly involving the cutesy dog reactions and Little Richard's exasperated yelling are more annoying than anything else. There are some great performances and many funny observations about successful Angelinos at that time. Not much of a message to be learned from any of it however. Maybe that is why it works. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Nick Nolte was arrested for DUI in 2002 and they published his mug shot picture I thought it was Jerry Baskin. I first saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and found it very amusing. This is a retelling of playwright Ren Fauchois' Boudu sauv des eaux that was made into a film in 1932. In this story the rescued drowning man is played by Nick Nolte who is a down and out former actor who is homeless and had but one friend his stray dog. He can't find his dog and wanders into the backyard of a Beverly Hills dysfunctional and affluent family where he plans to end it all by drowning in their swimming pool. Homeowner Richard Dreyfuss comes to the rescue and the homeless man Jerry becomes a wanted and unwanted guest in their home. Bette Midler is Dreyfuss' wife Tracy Nelson is the daughter Evan Richards is the son Elizabeth Pena is the maid and Little Richard is the nextdoorneighbor. A fun situational comedy the screenplay was written by Paul Mazursky and Leon Capetanos who collaborated on several films with Mazursky. Mazursky is a multitalented directorwriterproduceractor who also appears in this film. He got wrote and produced I Love You Alice B. Toklis and then went on to big success as the director of Bob  Carol  Ted  Alice. In the 70's he had some other notable films that he directed including Harry and Tonto and An Unmarried Woman but his only film of note in the 80's was Moscow on the Hudson and after Down and Out in Beverly Hills directed only seven other films of little note and his writing creativity seems to have stalled to as he only wrote four more screenplays in the past 20 years. Cinematographer Donald Mcalpine is this film's photographer. He's had recent success with Chronicles of Narnia. Some of his other films include Mrs. Doubtfire Predator My Brilliant Career and Breaker Morant. Andy Summers of the rock band the Police provides the music score. The Talking Heads song Once in a Lifetime which was 6 years old was used as the theme song of the film and it suddenly became a charting single. This is a good film if you've never seen it and a good look back to the 80's. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.".

DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.Down and Out in Beverley Hills is a comedy which bizarrely gets funnier every year.Whereas it's release saw it as a fairly standard screwball farce time sees it more and more as a parody of vain 80s obsessions. Among the targets are the growing trends for therapists jogging alternative religions designer drugs and fashion diets.Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as Dave Whiteman the nonplussed businessman in the centre of the chaos going on around him. Whereas in some movies the cute dog would be irritating even this element is satisfying thanks to the open hatred he and Dreyfuss displays towards one another. I particularly like the scene where unable to wreck Whiteman's sexual encounter with his mistress the dog vindictively sets off the burglar alarm. Another nice touch is an early spoof reference to Close Encounters of the Third Kind which of course starred Dreyfuss in the lead role. Closer inspection of the film reveals that it's also a lot wittier than you remembered.Bette Midler's meditating shallow and indulgent Barbara acts a light counterpoint to the social conscience thrown up by Nick Nolte's tramp Jerry. Jerry's entry into the household 35 minutes in initiates a radical change in all the characters with Jerry seducing all three women in Dreyfuss' life helping his son to out himself and taming his dog.What makes this film a little bit special is the slightly darker thoughtful edge it portrays. While it admittedly doesn't see through all the issues it throws up this is a more intelligent than average comedy with neatly drawn characters and a satisfying resolution.".

All the women looked alike. Beautiful. Their long hair fluffy each strand curled like Top Ramen. Okay okay. I lack the vocabulary. Excuse me. They all seemed to wear the same dark roughknit longsleeved sweaters tight Levis and leather boots. This is what one kills for? The privilege of wearing a uniform? Paul Mazursky has got the milieu down pat and he skewers it. I haven't seen the French original but though it may be different it's probably not funnier than this version.I'll skip the story except to say that it's about a homeless man Nick Nolte who is taken in by a wealthy dysfunctional family and he straightens everyone out by giving them what they want  as he puts it. Some gags are funnier than others helped along by Mazursky's direction. When the spoiled bored wife has an orgasm with the bum she screams so loudly that the neighbors a block away turn to listen. A flock of pigeons is frightened out of its tree. I can't think of another movie that features a psychiatric veterinarian.The climax unfortunately is more silly than funny as if nobody could think of an ending that would stop what's already gone by. Mazursky had the same problem with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice at the end of which the sting of genuine phoniness gives way completely to fantasy and everyone does a ring dance to What The World Needs Now Is Love... In Down and Out in Beverley Hills a party ends with the accidental setting off of a fireworks display and everyone jumping into the pool. You almost wince at the desperation behind this scene.And then in a denouement when the bum decides to leave with the family dog the whole family and their servants follow him into the mews behind the mansion and beg him with their eyes to come back which he does quickly enough. Sure it's a happy ending but just exactly what is going to happen when Nolte returns after he's been exposed as a lying manipulative lazy scuzzbag who has given the son permission to be a transvestite and has been doing both his host's wife and daughter? All he had with him when he first entered the family was a pocket full of rocks. This time he's got a lot of baggage.Still it's a lighthearted and engaging comedy and none of the acting hurts a bit. Aside from the doggy's psychiatrist I thought Little Richard was the most memorable character especially when he complains about how much longer it takes the police to respond to HIS emergency alarm than his white neighbors'. The dog chases him away tearing at his golden robe. Dreyfus is quite good too reminding me of his performance as the exasperated and finally mad psychiatrist in What About Bob? Mazursky wisely avoided any attempt to insinuate overt signs of seriousness into the screenplay. A comedy doesn't need dark undertones to be successful and this is successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that this movie was nominated for awards and only took one of the 4 or 5 nominations is just perplexing. Bette was fun and did a good job she was nominated. Dreyfus was superb as Dave Whiteman tongueincheek I love it! Richard Dreyfus was not nominated. But 'Nolte' as the Bum Baskin 'Jerry' should have at least been nominated that is absurd that he wasn't in light of a 'capitol' performance! I had not seen this movie in many years. I had seen so many others and thought about viewing this again when I finally bought the DVD I was blown away! This movie hasn't lost and inch of it's original comedic height. Nolte Jerry Baskin looked as if with every step he took that he was about to fall off the end of the earth. He looked like a street guy with atrophy in his muscles from sleeping on sidewalks. He played down and out and 'bum' to the very edge. It was the best bum in any story that I have seen or could remember. I was interested in following this character through more than one or two scenes. For instance in the park staggering through after the absence was felt in regard to his 'Little tan dog' he bellowed out questions to passers by then found himself at the mall. While inside he abruptly inquired to the patrons interrupting their conversations and meals with no awareness or understanding as to what's going on with anyone but himself. Then afterward when he's escorted out by two mall security guardsmen his reactions words and inflections were just 'picture' perfect. I have worked in places where there were many a transient at times and 'Nolte' being that character with his attitude and abilities just became 'King'. In addition the two lead characters have something in common...dog problems! 'Matise'Mike the dog steals part of the show and chews on it a little. It was a riot when he got 'insensed' at 'Little Richard' and became a little anxious!! This little fellow is a doublethreat...'cute' and 'funny' too. He is a great supporting k9 cast member. Mike does a great job as the family pet who ends up as jerry's little side kick.Not too far down the line the introduction to 'the family' through Dave was a classic cinema moment in modern times. He 'upends' the whole apple cart here. The even funnier parts are how things eventually turn and shift for Ole' Dave. I enjoyed the politically incorrect wit and sharp comedic retorts. The characters are developed to a 'T' and they interact and play out in absolute excellence. I would only recommend this to people that will understand and enjoy a hard driving politically incorrect film with the enjoyable cynicism that this has. But even for those not well versed in movie intellect this one is hard to miss it really drives it home! It's infectious and in a way very timeless in some of the overtones. I rate it a Ten. ".

He's the Boudu character rescued by Beverly Hills businessman Richard Dreyfuss who is as genial and as soft as a poached egg and who radiates goodness. He's the kind of man who feels he has to set the world to rights but isn't pushy enough to do it. That can't be said of his jiggly wife Bette Midler who is brash lewd and who seems to be wearing dresses several sizes too small for her. Midler moves like a mini tornado and her performance has some of the energy of her stage shows. Between them Nolte Dreyfuss and Midler bring combined wit and intelligence to the material. They seem to be having a right old time and their pleasure is infectious. Mazursky keeps things on a low boil and lets his players have their rein. It's to our advantage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Down and Out in Beverly Hills features an excellent cast doing probably their each individual best work. The casting itself is pitch perfect right down to the two dogs. But I believe the problem stems from the direction. The films claims it's a comedy when really it's a chuckledelivering drama. I think director Paul Mazursky accidentally made the premise a bit too serious.You know how people say a film is love it or hate it? I think Down and Out in Beverly Hills is love it or accept it. I think of these kinds of films sort of as elegant comedies where the sets and actors are very classy but it's questionable you'd want to see a movie with those kind of characters. Other movies I believe fit into my subgenre are Arthur and Fierce Creatures. They aren't bad films but I don't believe the characters are interesting enough to carry the weight of a full length film on their backs.The plot A rich family's life is changed when a bum tries to commit suicide in their backyard pool. The family is made wealthy because the husband Dave Whiteman Dreyfuss is the head of a coathanger factory. His wife Barbara Midler is happy with the wealth but unsatisfied as a person. Her and Dave's relationship is complex and she is more often than not left unfulfilled by her husband.The bum is played fantastically by Nick Nolte. His name is Jerry and after his faithful dog companion runs away to find a home with a jogger Jerry jumps in the Whitemans' pool when it is draining to try and kill himself. Seconds away from being gone Dave jumps in to save the man and to revitalize him as a human being to make him happier in life.An act of role reversal is made here where the happier half is the bum and the sadder half is the wealthy family so the film gives a sincere look at how some people live their lives and how some are happier than others. The problem is just in the way it's executed which is hard to explain. It's hokey and not as inspired as it would seem.Paul Mazurksy has a talent for squeezing the most out of his actors and giving them constant incorruptible shockingly wellbuilt chemistry. Later in his career he provided the same chemistry to Woody Allen and Bette Midler in Scene from a Mall a movie that besides the chemistry has little to offer. The setup between the three leads is anything but contrived and highly welcomed as they each give their own sense of screen magic.So what is wrong with Down and Out in Beverly Hills? It's honestly hard to say. I sat through the whole thing no interruptions and upon finishing it I reached a quandary. I didn't know if I liked what I just watched. Sitting down writing this hasn't helped much either. I think it's one of those films that is cute warm and gentle but that's it. There's nothing wrong with that if that's what you're looking for but there isn't much urgency or attraction equipped in the script. Just a bunch of characters wandering around awaiting the next predicament to fall into.Starring Richard Dreyfuss Bette Midler and Nick Nolte. Directed by Paul Mazursky.".

It made me dream so soon and I tried my best my life to be the nearest to the fantasy world. This movie was very touching to me in some way. I don't know exactly why but I felt very identified with its different characters. I think the story was very cheerful and funny. We all know that it doesn't have to be realistic to express that strange human nature in ourselves. I think this movie is a satire that talks about the immature people trying to give a sense to their lives. This premise doesn't change the fact that even if it is silly it is to me very endearing. Firstly I like the principal character because of his courage and his impertinence. Probably this is which I will more identified with. Secondly the rich family really made me laugh each one of them from the wife so alienated in her superficial and material life full of appearance to the kid the typical adolescent who doesn't know what to do with his life so careless to his parents. Then its the servant a sign that is a middlehigh rich family of Beverly Hills one of the most riches cities in the world. She is a Latin woman who doesn't have a hight level education and she soon choose to believe that she is oppressed by her boss. So she became Marxist. I know that this story sounds absurd but I think that this picture is probably one of the best entertaining comedies I ever seen. I like watching it from time to time. I probably will watch it again soon. I like very much the rhythm of the film its music and its montage. It's a very swift movie easy to see. Nothing complex. Even though you can always feel that the filmmaker is talking about deep matters. That is the good thing of art. You can always discover new reviews and feel new experiences across them. Im very sorry about my English. I'm practicing because it's been a long time a didn't practice. I hope to improve it on the future. I would like to write much more in the future. I have spent a long time watching thousands of movies and I want to share my experience and my opinions. I hope anyone to like it or find it useful. I'm sure there is many people here who loves cinema as much as I do probably more. I'm not watching by now so many movies as I used to do but I still feel for films a deep love and respect. I've been thinking a long time that films have many to give to the people not only entertaining but culture freedom and learning. I know this is to simple to be written but I need to be clear so I could find my way to be happier in the future. I think we are all destined to be happier if we make and effort for that the right thing. Thank you very much to all who have red me. I hope to write soon again. Kind regards and wishes.".

Firstly I like the principal character because of his courage and his impertinence. Probably this is which I will more identified with. Secondly the rich family really made me laugh each one of them from the wife so alienated in her superficial and material life full of appearance to the kid the typical adolescent who doesn't know what to do with his life so careless to his parents. Then its the servant a sign that is a middlehigh rich family of Beverly Hills one of the most riches cities in the world. She is a Latin woman who doesn't have a hight level education and she soon choose to believe that she is oppressed by her boss. So she became Marxist. I know that this story sounds absurd but I think that this picture is probably one of the best entertaining comedies I ever seen. I like watching it from time to time. I probably will watch it again soon. I like very much the rhythm of the film its music and its montage. It's a very swift movie easy to see. Nothing complex. Even though you can always feel that the filmmaker is talking about deep matters. That is the good thing of art. You can always discover new reviews and feel new experiences across them. Im very sorry about my English. I'm practicing because it's been a long time a didn't practice. I hope to improve it on the future. I would like to write much more in the future. I have spent a long time watching thousands of movies and I want to share my experience and my opinions. I hope anyone to like it or find it useful. I'm sure there is many people here who loves cinema as much as I do probably more. I'm not watching by now so many movies as I used to do but I still feel for films a deep love and respect. I've been thinking a long time that films have many to give to the people not only entertaining but culture freedom and learning. I know this is to simple to be written but I need to be clear so I could find my way to be happier in the future. I think we are all destined to be happier if we make and effort for that the right thing. Thank you very much to all who have red me. I hope to write soon again. Kind regards and wishes.";

Sadly this genre that consisted of feel good movies such as L.A. Story' Mr. Destiny' and My Blue Heaven' doesn't exist in the fast moving world of today. Anyway the film isn't perfect and has plenty of bad flaws.One of the problems is the way the film grips at the start but into the last halfhour it begins to ramble and loses your attention. It could have done with some rather unnecessary scenes being excised. In the supporting cast the acting standard is a bit ropey. Even though the film is only 99 minutes it only barely going into overlength and getting too nonsensical. Only one more quibble the title. Surely they could have come up with something a bit more attractive than Down  Out in Beverly Hills'. But the film isn't completely marred by these flaws. The acting standard is quite good. Back in the days when we could understand what he was saying Nick Nolte gives a terrifically eccentric performance as the happygolucky tramp brought into this stylish environment. Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler are quite good in their respective roles as the neurotic husband and the spoilt rich wife. While the rest of the acting isn't anything above adequate the characters themselves are likeable. With the flamboyantly effeminate teenage son the anorexic daughter and even a rather pointless cameo from rock  roll superstar Little Richard.Even if it tends to bumble a bit towards the end the theme song Once in A Lifetime starts and ends the film on a good note leaving you with nothing but memories of the good things in the movie. There are some flaws in the narrative and in general but if you don't take the film seriously then you'll probably like it. I did and I though it was good. So I give it 6.410.".

The funniest bits come from Walter Olkewicz's coach character even though he was probably cast because he greatly resembles John Belushi he is really funny and it's a shame that he almost completely disappears from the second half of the movie.However the movie is far from perfect. Much of the time the movie seems to be spinning its wheels where scene after scene goes by with little to absolutely no advance to the plot. It's almost like you are seeing a bunch of deleted scenes from the special features section of a DVD. At the same time there are a lot of scenes that seem to finish much sooner than they should as well as a lack of explanation about some things. Since the movie runs 105 minutes quite long for a comedy my guess is that the original cut of the movie ran much much longer than 105 minutes. Then when they tried to cut down the movie to an acceptable running length a lot of material that would have made the movie make more sense had to go.As problemfilled as this movie is there is something likeable about it all the same enough so that you can't help but wonder what Tourista the sequel announced during the closing credits  that ultimately never got made  would have been like.".

Sure it is a 80s movie with all of the usual 80s fare but it is worth watching. There are funny things in the background throughout the movie as well as great lines that you barely hear.For any comedy to be great it needs at least one character that stands out. Judd Nelson was not character. He was overshadowed by the real Palmer Woodrow III Dana Olsen. This as well as the money problems at the corporate level are probably why Tourista wasn't made. With the additions of Gordon Jump from WKRP in Cincinnati and Andrew Dice Clay this movie will make you laugh. The Dice man actually does a good job in this movie. I know I was shocked as well. In realistic terms it isn't the greatest comedy of all time. However it is a personal favorite and you should enjoy it too.It is now on DVD so get out there and watch it. See it soon!".

One thing I couldn't understand was the Jonna Lee appeal. Her character and she herself were boring. The plot of the movie was complicated enough to be funny but not so convoluted that we were scratching our heads trying to figure it out. The coach and the Diceman in his first appearance as his alter ego were amusing too. Judd Nelson and Dana Olsen were so great in this movie that I really wish a sequel had been made. And a soundtrack. This movie is silly for sure but good fun and a definite 80's classic.

There is a reason he faded in the late 80's Well two reasons the other being he had an overly arrogant attitude in real life I do have a major soft spot for him though. He can be very entertaining when he wants to be. The Breakfast Club proved that. I actually was looking forward to this film. It seemed to be right up my alley. I love cheesy 80's comedies. This one tanked at the box office for a reason. It is way too derivative and shockingly dull. Do the movies Arthur and Trading Places ring a bell? This movie is essentially a combination of the two. It is filled with corny slapstick that fails to garner any chuckles or laughs. Judd Nelson seems bored half the time and as a result he is also boring. He tries to incorporate part of the things that worked so well with Bender to no avail. He isn't interesting enough to command your attention. His humming of NuhNuhNuh got annoying fast. He did have an epic dance scene I'll say that. Scott McGinnis is OK as the academy bully. He was rather dull in all honesty. He looked like a poor man's James Mardsen. Andrew Dice Clay does alright. Jonna Lee makes for a rather average love interest. She didn't really have anything that stood out about her. The ending is filled with proper ethics where Eddie has a change of heart. I don't think I need to explain the rest you should be able to figure it out for yourself.Final Thoughts I didn't hate it I just didn't get into it all that much. It lacks everything I loved about cheesy 80's comedies. They were expecting a big hit as evident from the promised sequel at the end credits The Tourista with Judd Nelson returning.

Leading lady 3 is Susan Clark who doesn't golf in this golf movie but would go on later to play golf's greatest gal Babe Didrikson in the latter's TV biopic.I watched this tonight on the Golf Channel. It didn't carry a rating but one supposes it ran uncut except that save for the titles its original Techniscope was panned and scanned to TV size. It did not of course run uninterrupted by commercials. Wagner is in top form here taking precise swings both on and off the course. All the lead actors as well as a host of recognizable character actors of the day turn in credible performances. Gene Hackman has a relatively small but pivotal part. Speaking of the golf which actually consumes but a small part of the movie I kept wondering about the ratio of golf shots to camera shots i.e. how many takes it took to get the lies the director wanted in order to tell the tale.What makes this movie interesting are the cast the photography a few plot surprises and a look back at the styles the cars and the mannerisms of forty years ago.

It didn't carry a rating but one supposes it ran uncut except that save for the titles its original Techniscope was panned and scanned to TV size. It did not of course run uninterrupted by commercials. Wagner is in top form here taking precise swings both on and off the course. All the lead actors as well as a host of recognizable character actors of the day turn in credible performances. Gene Hackman has a relatively small but pivotal part. Speaking of the golf which actually consumes but a small part of the movie I kept wondering about the ratio of golf shots to camera shots i.e. how many takes it took to get the lies the director wanted in order to tell the tale.What makes this movie interesting are the cast the photography a few plot surprises and a look back at the styles the cars and the mannerisms of forty years ago. Slightly above average.";

	schema:headline " 25th Hour A Film With Sway!";
	schema:reviewBody "For myself watching 25th Hour was sortof like taking a palm reading. Noticing one line representative of a lifepath stretches out long and far while another line branches off and stops short in the middle of your palm. You question which life path will you take and which are you currently on now. Are you one the short one or the long one? You question the various choices and decisions that you made in the past and which lifeline have those choices and decisions ultimately lead you down. In a roundabout way the three characters in Spike Lee's 25th Hour are struggling with these same kind of questions. Based on a novel by David Benioff the film is essentially three people struggling with the choices that they have made in their past and the choices they are to make in the future  and which path will it ultimately lead them down.Edward Norton stars as Monty Brogan a man whose life decision becoming a drug dealer has left him facing a seven year prison term ...with 84 days off with good behaviour. It's the morning before and Monty has twentyfive hours left to examine his life bond with his closest friends say goodbye to family find a home for his dog and figure out a way to survive in the joint. At one point Monty's friend refers to his incarceration as ...going to hell and never coming back and the audience gets the feeling that it's not just a coy metaphor. If Monty does survive his time he will most assuredly not be the person they once knew when he gets out.Even though he has grown distant from them over the years Monty chooses to spend his remaining hours with his closest friends from childhood Jacob Elinsky Philip Seymour Hoffman and Frank Slaughtery Barry Pepper. Socially and economically these are two of the most dissimilar people one is likely to see spending time together in a film. Their only real connection is the deeply entrenched devotion they feel to their friend. Jacob is a nerdy English teacher whose gift for the language has done little for his social skills. His selfdoubt and shame for being born wealthy has left him single lonely and in a thankless job. He desperately yearns for one of his students a beautiful and precocious seventeen year old Mary D'Annunzio Anna Paquin but is afraid to act on it fearful that such a decision will lead to him being fired from his job or even worse arrested. Frank on the other hand is on the opposite end of the character spectrum he's a goodlooking rich Wall Street trader who unlike his nebbish friend has never had a problem with the ladies. Also unlike Jacob Frank is much more forthright in his feelings about life and his friend's impending incarceration He profited from other's misery and he deserves what he gets he tells Jacob. Norton's character also has a girlfriend Naturelle played by Rosario Dawson whom he believes might have been the one who sold him out to the police. There's also his father played by Brian Cox a retired fireman who owns a bar on Staten Island which caters primarily to fire fighters. Each of these people in their own way blames them self for what is happening to Monty.The story propels forward when the three childhood friends gather in a nightclub with Jacob's student Mary and Monty's girlfriend Naturelle tagging along. It is what happens in this club on this night that provides the core of the movie. The accusations that are made the favor that is asked the choices that are acted upon and the truth that is revealed will stay with these characters long after the 25th hour has widdled and gone away. Will these friends be willing to enact Doyle's Law in a figurative sense and save Monty Brogan the symbolic beaten dog?25th Hour is also memorable for grappling openly with the aftermath of September 11th. Lee skillfully immerses it into the subtext of the story. Referenced in pictures of fire fighters who lost their lives at the World Trade Center which adorn the walls of the local sports bar and the uptown offices of the traders to the mention of Bin Laden in a particularly biting commentary by Monty to Frank Slaughtery's defiant refusal to move from his apartment which sits overlooking the ruins of the Twin Towers. Director Spike Lee never known for being subtle thrusts these images and his obvious anger about it into the viewers lap and compels them to deal with it. Also memorable is the venomous diatribe by Norton into a bathroom mirror where he verbally attacks every group in New York regardless of ethnicity sexual preference or socioeconomic standing. Not even the church or JC himself is safe from his tirade which ends when Monty realizes the only person he has to blame for his predicament is the one staring back at him in the mirror.The whole film plays in a subdued almost depressing tone. There are no laughs to be had no falsely engineered moments where the characters break bread and cry and get all remorseful  none of that. We feel as Monty feels perplexed distressed unsure of those things to come and angry for how he happened to arrive at this place and moment in his life  his last 25 hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read the novel 'The 25th Hour' before I even knew it was going to be adapted into a movie and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was one of the best books written in the last ten years. Being a huge fan of Spike Lee and Edward Norton I was extremely excited when I found they were making it into a film.However I will admit I was a bit skeptical to whether Spike Lee could pull the film off but when I saw the trailer I had a new found faith in it and I'm sorry to of doubted him. I saw the film yesterday and was just amazed. It's nearly flawless and is almost exactly like the novel which was written by David Benioff who also wrote the screenplay.The characters in the film are great. You got Monty Brogan Norton who's looking at seven years for drug dealing charges. It's his last day of freedom and he's just trying to tie up any loose ends before he goes. Then you got his two friends Frank Slaughtery Barry Pepper and Jakob Elinsky Philip Seymour Hoffman who each have to deal with the fact that their best friend is going away for seven years but also have their own demons to deal with. You also have his girlfriend Naturelle Rivera Rosario Dawson who must deal with it as well and must also deal with the fact that she's suspect on who could have sold Monty out to the DEA. And finally you have James Brogan Brian Cox Monty's father. He's a hard working guy who obviously wished that things didn't turn out the way they did. One last night for Monty to set things straight and also make decisions.The film sticks almost exactly to the novel but there are slight differences. Since the novel was written in 2000 and the movie was filmed during 2002 Spike Lee and David Benioff included the mentioning of the attacks on New York and the aftermath which I applaud Lee for. He didn't cop out and try to ignore it like others. It was necessary to capture the emotion of what New Yorkers are facing and among that what the characters have to face with Monty going to prison. There are also slight differences and cut outs from the book to make the film flow easier but I was disappointed with only one thing that the film didn't include. In the novel Monty constantly thinks of how he always wanted to be a fireman. While firemen references and his father was a fireman are all mentioned in the film it didn't really tackle Monty's regret of never becoming a fireman like it did in the book. But the film makes up for that one thing by being terrific all around.There are some stellar performances here. Edward Norton is always great in everything he plays but in this film he is just excellent. The 'Fk You' scene he has when he's staring in the mirror is just excellent and I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for this role he was robbed from one for American History X. Barry Pepper is in his greatest performance yet as the tough guy stockbroker. Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as Jakob the high school teacher. Dealing with his attraction to his student Mary Anna Paquin. Rosario Dawson really made me feel for her and it was great to see more of her in a film. Brian Cox doesn't have a huge role but he's great as Monty's father. I would also like to give praise to Tony Siragusa for his performance as Kostya. He was dead on with the accent.So without going on any further I just have to say that '25th Hour' was really great and is now one of my favorite films of all time.SCORE 9 out of 10 excellent".

His script is fresh yet somewhat slow in spots. His characters shine however in a truly believeable tale of consequence. Edward Norton in another masterful performance shows an almost frightening level of genuine human emotion as the protagonist Montgomery Brogan. The supporting cast consisting of Philip Seymour Hoffman Barry Pepper and veteran Brian Cox provide a solid foundation  that allows Lee's story to flow freely.  While most would consider this tale a literal one take note  It is quite apparent through subtlety and the rather obvious restroom mirror scene that Spike Lee has a message he wants to get across.  What I think makes 25th Hour so appealing on a theoretical level is the fact that his message is surprisingly openended allowing the individual viewer to decide what he or she wants to retain from the film.  This is a genuine film experience a haunting dose of reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a great movie. That's the first thing that passed through my head when the credits started rolling. This is the story of a man's last day of freedom before starting a 7year prison sentence. Funny how they almost never if ever use the words prison or jail.Edward Norton is great as Monty and so is the inimitable Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays one of his best friends. I always enjoy watching both these actors. Hoffman plays a prepschool English teacher who has the hots for one of his students. They run into each other at a nightclub where a big party is thrown for Monty on his last night of freedom. She's not innocent but she is naive. They have an intense moment together at the club.The movie is not really about prison or even what Monty's crime was. It's about all the things Monty has to do to wrap up his life before going away. It's about the things people do to get what they want. It's about the realities of going away and the difficult emotions of all those involved. There's a brilliant scene where Monty's deepest hate and rage surface that is very reminiscent of a scene in another great Spike Lee Joint Do the Right Thing. He basically says F everybody and then at the end of the scene F himself. He has nobody else to blame for anything. He alone has ruined his life.This movie made me think about what I would do if I were in his position. How would your parents react if you were going to prison? How would you say bye to your mom or dad? How about your spouse? And your closest friend? What about your dog?It is a thoughtful film that is not about one particular thing. It does not try to get in your face with a single message but has many messages.".

	schema:reviewBody "25th Hour is a movie that I just came across one day and decided to rent it I noticed that it had Edward Norton in it and figured that I would just give it a shot. I absolutely fell in love with Edward Norton when I saw American History X he immediately became one of my favorite actors. I couldn't believe how much I fell in love with this movie it's honestly one of my new favorite movies it's intelligent intense and greatly written. Edward Norton pulls off an incredible performance and truth be told I couldn't believe he didn't get a nomination at least for this movie I don't know 25th Hour just didn't get enough notice but this is a great movie and a very moving story.Monty Brogan is walking the streets of New York with Doyle his dog. He goes to his old school where he meets up with his teacher friend Jacob Elinsky and discusses a gettogether at a local club planned later that evening. Elinksy then calls Frank Slaughtery who is working as a Wall Street trader. Brogan then goes home to his girlfriend Naturelle and they discuss the fact that this is his last night before prison. Brogan has been busted for being a drug dealer and he is looking at seven years in Otisville prison. Brogan visits his father James at his Irish pub and his father blames himself for Monty getting into the position he's in. Brogan and his father then discuss whether it was Naturelle who tipped off the police about him. The group later meets at the club Jacob runs into one of his students Mary who we see before complaining to Jacob about the grade of one of her papers. She goes with them into the club. Frank and Naturelle also discuss how Monty got to this position but Frank accuses her of not doing anything because she got used to a fancy life. Monty and his partner Kostya then go to speak to a group of Russian mobsters run by Uncle Nikolai. Nikolai gives Monty some tips on how to survive in prison. Then it is revealed who really was the traitor that tipped the police about Monty.25th Hour is also the movie that introduced me to Rosario Dawson and I have to tell you that I fell for this girl immediately she's a great leading actress who has a strong presence on the screen. In fact the entire cast is something to admire in this movie Phillip Seymour Hoffman Anna Paquin and Barry Pepper. Then we have this incredibly intense scene that is one of my favorite in movie history when Edward Norton is in the bathroom and goes off blaming everyone else for his problems then finally breaks down and just says F you you had it all and you screwed it up that scene went from funny to intense to just plan sad. This was also the fist movie that also brought up the pain and aftermath in New York after 911 the opening scene was in fact showing the lights that represented where the towers once stood and you really felt the pain and emptiness of New York. Honestly I would say this is Spike Lee's best film it's not bitter or over the top and made this film perfectly. If you have the opportunity to see this movie I highly recommend that you take it it's such a terrific story and is one of the most effective of 2002.1010".

The scene where he breaks down and Norton thanks him in a way for what he has done is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen.

	schema:headline " One of Spike's best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely Spike Lee at the top of his game!  25th Hour' is a purely characterdriven drama filled with engaging complex characters and sharp dialogue.  I like how Spike allowed the scenes to play out without being too concerned about dampening the pacing.  I'm sure some will complain and this probably explains why it wasn't a big success that the film is boring and slowmoving.  If they do that's probably because audiences are so used to watching movies with a million cuts in one scene and more time emphasized on action and sex scenes than character development.  The characters were so welldeveloped that I felt a deep connection with each of them.  It's rare nowadays that I really get sucked into a film and this was one of those rare cases.  It might also have to do with the fact that I'm familiar with many of these types of characters in real life.  You have the Barry Pepper character who's this smoothtalking playboy who ends sleeping with a ton of women despite the fact that he's harsh and not very likable. And there's the Philip Seymour Hoffman character who's a lonely averagelooking guy who's alienated from society because he doesn't look like an Adonis.  It's a harsh reality that handsome guys with nice bodies get away with being complete jerks and still maintain an active dating life while averagelooking guys can have great personalities and women will be repulsed by them but it is indeed a reality.  Sure it isn't right for Hoffman to be lusting after one of his underage students but I'm sure if he were ten times better looking people wouldn't be as disgustedbecause God knows that teachers sleeping with their students is sweeping the globe like an epidemic.    The approach to these character interaction scenes is almost documentarylike which adds to the film's engaging qualities.  I love the scene between Pepper and Hoffman where they chat about dating and Pepper describes his buddy as being part of the 62nd percentile in the dating world.  Sometimes it doesn't work when you deviate from the main characters to focus on the supporting characters but in this film it did being that they're very essential in Monty's life and it's helpful to allow the audience to know them inside and out.  The acting is terrific.  Edward Norton is always brilliant.  But the supporting cast is just as strong.  Barry Pepper is a wonderful actor as well and it's interesting to find out that he's from Vancouver yet he convincingly inhabits the character of a true New Yorker.  Brian Cox is only in the film for about 20 or 30 minutes but his appearances are very memorable and he is absolutely magnificent.  After seeing him in this movie I must add him to my list of favorite underrated actors.  It's ironic that he shows up in practically every other film yet he never gets the recognition he deserves.  Hopefully one day he will.  Even Tony Siragusa impressed me.  I'm not hugely familiar with him but I saw him make a guest appearance once on The Tonight Show' and he seems like a cool guy with a good sense of humor but I wasn't sure how he'd pan out in a serious dramatic role.  Well he is great and pulls off the Ukrainian accent with hardly a hitch.  I also liked how his character would mess up on his English every once in a while instead of these foreign characters in movies who speak perfect English only with an accent.  I'm always  proud to see Philip Seymour Hoffman who never fails to impress.  One reason I'm so drawn to him is becauselike mehe's an averagelooking guy yet he receives decent roles and doesn't get typed as the fat slob' like most actors in his weight range.  So I think of him as an inspiration to all overweight aspiring actors.  I once read a review for Magnolia' in which someone bashed him for being so ugly.  Of course this person didn't mention anything about his acting but that just proves how superficial of a society we live in today. Many audiences are so used to seeing actors and actresses with nearperfect faces and nearperfect bodies that they can't stand to see actors who look like normal people.'  How often do you walk outside and see people who look like Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow?  Even these socalled reality shows try to include the most beautiful people possible.  So people get hypnotized into thinking that's reality.  I'm a heterosexual man so naturally I'm open about enjoying the sights of beautiful actresses but that's not going to impact how I feel about their acting abilities.  And the sight of beautiful women alone surely doesn't make a film good i.e.  Charlie Angels'. Speaking of beautiful women wrapping up this talented cast are Anna Paiquin and Rosario Dawson.  Paiquin is cute and effective in her role though technically it's similar to the ones she played in HurlyBurly' and It's the Rage.'  I just hope she doesn't get typecast as the teenage slut who loves sleeping with older men.  But she's a fine actress and despite these similarities she takes different approaches to each of her characters. Rosario Dawson just gets hotter and hotter by the movie.  When I saw that trailer shot where she's dancing in the club in that silver dress I couldn't help but think to myself I'd give my left leg to marry that girl.'  Well I'm glad to see that she receives good roles that compliment her acting abilities.  She really has a commanding screen presence outside of her outstanding beauty.  I only have two minor criticisms about the film.  One is the unnecessary F.U. sequence' where Norton goes on a blue streak about his hatred for the people of NYC and the world in general.  I'm sure many will find deep meaning in that sequence but I felt it was out of place and simply an opportunity to remind people that this is a Spike Lee jointsince it's identical to the racebashing montage in Do the Right Thing.'  Spike mentioned in the commentary that the scene was in the screenplay and adapted from the original novel but I'm sure he thought of it as a perfect opportunity to insert one of his directorial trademarks.  My other criticism is the use of flashbacks.  Nowadays some directors feel that dissolving into flashbacks and showing subtitles that read things like Three years earlier' is passe but the audience needs some sort of clue that we're going back in time.  In the scene where Dawson and her friend are in the playground and Norton first meets her is obviously a flashback since Dawson is wearing a Catholic private school uniform.  But there are other scenes that I didn't realize were flashbacks until I watched the movie with Spike's commentary.  But even without knowing those scenes were flashbacks I didn't feel thrown off so that's always a good sign.    Besides the F.U. sequence' there were other Spike trademarks which I felt worked out well like his famous dolly shot.  The movie is long but not overlong.  As I said this is Spike at the top of his game.  I'm personally a fan of most of his work even the awfully bashed Summer of Sam.'  Other fans should also be impressed.  Hell even if you're not a Spike Lee fan you should appreciate this film!  It's a smartly written wellacted characterdriven drama that doesn't come along too often. My score  9 out of 10".

My other criticism is the use of flashbacks.  Nowadays some directors feel that dissolving into flashbacks and showing subtitles that read things like Three years earlier' is passe but the audience needs some sort of clue that we're going back in time.  In the scene where Dawson and her friend are in the playground and Norton first meets her is obviously a flashback since Dawson is wearing a Catholic private school uniform.  But there are other scenes that I didn't realize were flashbacks until I watched the movie with Spike's commentary.  But even without knowing those scenes were flashbacks I didn't feel thrown off so that's always a good sign.    Besides the F.U. sequence' there were other Spike trademarks which I felt worked out well like his famous dolly shot.  The movie is long but not overlong.  As I said this is Spike at the top of his game.  I'm personally a fan of most of his work even the awfully bashed Summer of Sam.'  Other fans should also be impressed.  Hell even if you're not a Spike Lee fan you should appreciate this film!  It's a smartly written wellacted characterdriven drama that doesn't come along too often. My score  9 out of 10";

The casting for their grown up children don't even reflect the right mixture of races.Far too many predictable boring subplots all shot from your usual Spike Lee camera angles. Spike Oh! Look at me! I'll create an interesting color palette by putting everyone in a nightclub so people will forget they're watching another pointless scene.Now there's nothing wrong with trying hard to make a good film but when the story is weak you can't make it any better by covering it up with a nonrelated backdrop. Putting two actors in a room where it overlooks the remains of the World Trade Center does not make their pseudophilosophical yet very pointless dialog anywhere close to being interesting or actually philosophical it's just a sign of trying too hard to put an importance on some mindless rambling. Looks nice but that's about it.Spike in the past has done a good job at taking jabs at racial issues. Issues that has to do with a film's certain era. Here however he throws in 5 minutes worth of racial slurring even though it's unrelated to the film's eternity for the sake of being dramatic. It's almost as if he's venting out his own prejudices on the big screen then tells us Hey I'm only joking! by having Norton correct his own thoughts. All the hate added nothing to the already wafer thin film it only sunk it down another notch.I think Spike must have had some bad run in's with people of other colors especially the Koreans. In all his films he displays them as the nospeakyEnglish type who all own corner grocery stores. What did any of that have to do with Norton's last day before prison? Older man is attracted to a teenager some guy who is evil because he wears a suit to work and makes more money than your average joe European immigrants are nothing but two dimensional criminals cops are bad. Endless clichs perhaps all this would have worked if the film was made 15 years ago but for something that's from 2003 I expected a lot more from Spike.I could go on and on but one thing that really bother me why are they everyone all so overly dramatic about Norton going to prison? 7 years is a long time but it's definitely not a lifetime. Prison is tough but the way they played it up it felt like Norton was going to be executed.This film was Lukewarm at best. And that's on a very good day where one is positive and generous with any movie. Overall 25th Hour does not amount to much its runtime could have been perfectly compressed into a mere 25 minutes. There was no reason for it to be made all the actors in this should be a little bit shameful to have pick up such easy paychecks. I'm voting it down to a 110 only because it's rated much higher than it deserved to be which is no more than a 410. Each Seinfeld episode weighted in for about 22 minutes but at least a good chunk of them were quite enjoyable to watch.".

I guess I don't get it because I'm not a New Yorker and not an American but when they go for cheap emodrama with yet some more references to the 911 attacks that's really annoying. For me the movie was a complete waste of time. There were no new or refreshing ideas in it the soundtrack was irritating at times I didn't feel connected to any of the characters and it was a waste of talented actors.".

I don't need to know that the director knows how to add that effect.There is NO character development . . . NONE. There is NO plot development . . . NONE.I can understand the ending if the movie builds up to Norton's character deciding to flee. But he doesn't and at the end of the movie I ask myself why did I sit through 2 hours to peek into 12 hours of someone's plain and ordinary life.  The flashbacks are sprinkled throughout the movie horribly.The only poignant moment is when the father describes his escape and fugitive life.  That's the only time when I thought if I could stay under the radar.I'm an Ed Norton fan but his acting is becoming quite repetitive.  You see his 'The Score' character and 'Fight Club' character recurring in this movie.In all this was quite disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "As 'A Spike Lee Joint' 25th hour is a paradigm filled with Lee's typical style and directorial vigor. A flowing feature length music video containing a story that is coherent topical and above all strongly analytical in its approach to the characters 25th Hour is the story of mid level drug dealer Monty Brogan  Ed Norton whom on his last day before being incarcerated for his elicit trade must make peace with his family and friends answer to his Red Mafia suppliers say farewell to the city he so obviously loves and ultimately accept that he is now in receipt of justified dues. With a post 911 setting in NYC the script deviates from the book which was written pre911 only slightly in order to encompass the destruction yet the atmosphere is set with the opening credits and a slice of dialogue during the first quarter followed by some beautifully filmed cutaways to a sodium lit nighttime cleanup crew working in Ground Zero which leaves the audience with no alternative but to associate the main characters' desperate tableau with plight of the city in the aftermath of tragedy. This could perhaps beg the question What was so bad about how Monty made his living to warrant the end of his life in effect in the 25th Hour?This is a question answered before it's asked with the first scene after the opening credits showing an exchange between Monty and a disheveled wreck of a man who is quite clearly one of his customers. It's further reinforced in a later flashback to Monty's earlier days as a dealer when the same man approaches Monty dressed in business attire. The destruction of others for personal gain is something that will not  and quite rightly so  go unchallenged. A subplot concerns blame where Monty vilifies and accuses everyone in the city himself included. However later in the film the injustice of this is rectified with a simple shot of the various people looking upon him with sympathy  the personification of this being a small boy offering a sign of friendship. Monty's own redemption begins and is represented by him expressing his brotherhood to the child in return. Relying somewhat on symbolism and hidden meanings there are a number of subtexts as well as ample opportunities to read into the narrative more than is intended but the overall message is clear culpability is in the hands of the bearer and with his last 24 hours of freedom sifting away and the eponymous 25th Hour quickly approaching Monty must see that blame can only lie with himself. 25th Hour's greatest achievement is in relaying a subtle but highly relevant parable in a manner of storytelling that is both enjoyable and compelling. Very few words are wasted and the dialogue remains taught and muscular throughout. The editing acting score direction and cinematography are all of the very highest standard. It could've been very easy for a film of this nature to fail by being presented as an embarrassing lecture. Thankfully 25th Hour is definitely no lecture but a powerful and haunting movie.".

There are a couple of truths to what they say.Monty is a super nice guy drug dealer as though any of us has ever met a character like this. How he got involved is never explored. He just has 24 hours to analyze his life before he goes to jail... but he does little of this and his activities are surprisingly trite.The film is entirely comprised of trite subplots that are never explored nor properly resolved with situations that are not realistic. There is the question of who turned Monty in villian identified but it made no sense nor was there a reason why this even happened. There is the selfhating Jew who lusts after an underage student. Why this is in the film and why the character has to be Jewish and selfhating is unexplored but I can only wonder the motivation given that this is a Spike Lee film. There is the White Irish stockbroker who has absolutely no morals chases every skirt but still believes righteously that his best friend should go to jail for selling drugs to high school kids. Say what? Then there is the act that Monty asks his stockbroker friend to perform. Why? I have absolutely no idea.I could go on and on about the gratuitous shots of the World Trade Center the lack of any exploration of the relationship with his girlfriend but why bother. This is the kind of film where critics will praise because of an association with the filmmaker but read closely. Nobody can really identify why they think this film is redeeming  it isn't. It's a sad wasted opportunity that deceives the audience through it's tagline of changing your life in a day that it has any substance whatsoever.

It displays in five parallel stories how people reject from speaking up when they have the opportunity due to more or less rational fears and once the right moment has slipped away it becomes multiply difficult later.Most of the parts are played by actors unknown to me and they are all fantastic. In every scene the dialogue is performed the way people actually speaks in real life And I'm Swedish I know what it should sound like. it's believable and absorbing. Nowhere to be heard is the theatrical and stiff line delivery that so often haunts Swedish cinema. The images are often still in unorthodox angles while people pass in and out. It is highly innovative and it works out extraordinarily well.The film is filled with hilarious lines but it is serious all the way and the humour is of the kind that makes me shiver with embarrassment. It is downright painful to watch these awkward situations and know that I could so easily be a part of something similar in real life. Not least the problems with partying and binging is displayed in a refreshingly nonromantic manner. It is all simply brilliant!".

The theme is admittedly rather hard to explain it handles the awkwardness that follow those defining moments where a small decision leads to growing consequences. It's an hilarious movie dark and hopeful at the same time. You can tell stlund has sharpened his pen since his previous feature movie Gitarrmongot. The dialogue balances so delicately on the thin line of becoming ridiculous or indifferent without ever falling over to either side. De Ofrivlliga craves your attention in order to mesmerize you the way it's meant to and you will be required to give it.

	schema:headline " Impressive and immersive despite its approach to its material film looking to dot the I's and cross the T's in regards to an array of seemingly random modernday Swedes.";
	schema:reviewBody "Involuntary is the rather brilliant in places fascinating throughout Swedish drama which takes its lead from something like Short Cuts or the more recent Babel or Crash and explores the lives and times of a handful of disparates the film believes are in actual fact connected by an underlying item or theme. The film attains a similarly sized level of accomplishment to those examples in what is a piece that probably weaves in and out of more plights featuring more people to that of the mentioned films but comes out just as mucha worthwhile effort. The good news is above all else that it's a lot shorter than something like Magnolia and as a result a Hell of a lot more interesting for more of the time.Principally the film is a study of human behaviour once the individual has reached a certain point in one's life that either comes about naturally through either the body or mind's transition or is born out of chance encounters people with established jobs or roles happen to stumble upon. This behaviour is as such which has the power to overbear certain proceedings in a person's life on one strand of the film but is able worm its way into the life of another on another wholly disconnected strand albeit on a smaller scale as something else takes precedence  that item itself usually a theme on a lower echelon in the life of the previous example. In exploring the thesis the writerdirector Ruben stlund is able to meld together a fascinating series of what are effectively short stories stories shot statically with an aesthetic resembling that of a close circuit television camera often anonymising others in the frame but accentuating degrees of unbearableness resulting in the film being really quite something.Take for instance the scene in which what one might perceive to be a lowly coach driver becoming rather taken by the power that he has over his passengers. The driver is established to be a careful man whom slowly plods his coach down the motorways to ensure the safety of his customers open minded and sociable he speaks with the tour guide beside him as he drives. Having driven them into the rural areas of absolutely nowhere the driver will not take them away from there again until somebody owns up over the breakage of a rail in the coach's toilet compartment  because it is his family's business and the expense comes out of his own balance it riles him and equates to everyone being held somewhat as hostages.Many miles away in a school a woodwork teacher himself becomes besotted with the power that he happens to have over a class of kids  the thematic link resonating. His hitting of a misbehaving child and the believing of that to be a proper punishment is witnessed by a female teacher whom has similar degrees of power over other classes of kids. This female teacher does not need to resort to such manners of discipline providing them with daily exercises that engage them at the front of the class more than any woodwork apparently does  even allowing them to expresses the desires to act out or shout out or whatever by permitting them thirty seconds of classroom time to scream and bang the tables as much as they like. Linked by that illusion of power turning people into those that they become both stories are at once wholly disconnected in a binary sense in regards to location and the nature of those victimised yet are at once intrinsically linked by a thematic chain running throughout the film.In another two different strands of the film the covering of burgeoning sexuality takes centre stage two strands that are again disconnected from one another in a binary sense of gender and age the transition of sexual inclinations but indelibly linked by a common thematic of coming to terms with one's urges towards sexual orientation. One strand is made up of a group of oafish men in their midthirties men away together on a weekend holiday that resembles a stag night without anybody in the pack actually getting married. In the beginnings the men speak to one another pompously and openly about automobiles and how cars are great and how fantastic their new cars are tapping into that deeply heterosexual characteristic built on the myth of men and their motors insinuating manliness. Throughout the course of this time spent together the film opens up routes leading to a homoerotic relationship shared between the halfdozen or so of them their stay away together seeing them get a tad closer to each other than some have liked.One instance sees two of them wrestling in a field leading to a mocksex act causing the victim to panic and call his wife to drive all the way out into the wilderness so as to vividly reassure himself of one's heterosexuality. The individual decides to stay behind after all later on around a campfire and picnic table at their piggish shenanigans give way to one of them performing what is effectively a striptease further imbuing proceedings. The equilibrium treads in perfect harmony with two young promiscuous blonde girls of about sixteen in age intermingling with the wrong crowd and purveying their sexuality onto that of whatever or whomever they can the idea of a group of people shifting into this newfound sense of sexual identity prominent between two widely disparate groups of people. The film is a project I read from a breakaway group of people with their own studio producing their own material its vast disconnection from more familiarised methods of filmmaking as well as its highly specific overall look might suggest something ill at ease or somewhat outsider but Involuntary is a film with the power to resonate with the viewer far more despite its approach  a film from people whose output I look forward to seeing more of.".

As it stands it's merely an example of how not to make a film unless you want to limit the audience to folks who are convinced that the lack of a story and technical ineptitude are the mark of genius. It's hard to believe this was Sweden's official entry for the Academy Awards in 2010.";

After 25 years the effects of the radiation fallout from Chernobl that drifted over Sweden are now evident as it must have affected the minds of the committee who selected this drivel as Sweden's official submission to the Academy Awards as Best Foreign Film. The chances of this being one of the five nominations are slim to none. This film deals with five different stories that have nothing to do with the other except that they all take place in Sweden and all deal with alcohol to some degree. There is a man who accidentally gets hit in the head by a bottle rocket two school girls who get drunk an actress on a bus trip a teacher whom none of her peers at the school really care for and a group of young straight men who enjoy homoerotic behavior. The film is shot from unusual camera angels that give the viewer a sense of eavesdropping in on ordinary mundane conversations. After about five minutes this technique gets pretty old and after about 10 minutes it becomes evident that the stories are going nowhere and people start walking out of the theater. Lessons learned from the film include if you hit yourself in the eye with fireworks you should not selftreat it but see a doctor immediately and don't be shooting off fireworks under the influence of alcohol if you are a teenager don't get drunk and pass out if you break something it's best to confess if you don't seem to fit in then learn to have an interest in your coworkers or maybe look for another job and pretending to be gay is not emotionally healthy. I would give this embarrassment to the Swedish film industry a very generous 3.5 out of 10 as low as I personally go on reviews and recommend it to no one.".

Back to the film There seemed to be too many thematic subplots going on despite other reviews that seem to say hey that mirrors life. But generally the film was entertaining and was an interesting diversion. The homoerotic malebonding deal with the guys seemed a bit contrived. I couldn't figure the rhyme or reason there.";

	schema:reviewBody "For the record I'm a sappy horse lover  I desperately wanted to like nay love this film but I have to give it two stars. Based on a children's novel by Michael Morpurgo I never heard of War Horse until the Broadway production. Magnificent lifesize horse puppets were so eerily realistic and moving that THEY actually moved me to tears. This was before I had an inkling that Spielberg had optioned the story and was making a film of it.Spielberg has pulled out every stop here  the movie is shot on real film and looks it lush and expensive. The battle scenes are detailed and exciting. There is a skillful cast of respected British actors. But it's entirely without real heart and soul.Without the exciting puppetry that undoubtedly drew Spielberg to the material as it did me the only way to save this would have been some kind of thoughtful retelling of the material. And once you get past the swelling music the golden sunsets and manipulated emotional level frankly this feels empty. The Black Stallion  from 1979  is a much more fantastical story without historical precedent or realism and yet I never watch it without sobbing like a baby because it touches something deep and human and universal. War Horse simply does not. It feels like a calculated bid for an Oscar nomination.Being released along with TinTin at the same Christmas slot my impression was that the first big mistake Spielberg made was to go realistic with the story. The play worked because it is NOT realistic. Frankly I think he should have used animation for the horse story  made it more symbolic and expressionistic  and filmed TinTin straight up as an Indiana Jones type adventure.I was also struck from almost the start of the film that Spielberg honestly knows and cares NOTHING about horses and that lack of genuine interest plagues the film. The first part of the film set in an English village has the Narracott family  apparently the dumbest and most incompetent tenant farmers in British history  who irrationally decide to buy a thoroughbred for plowing. Strangely they seem not to have owned ANY horse prior to this. How did they plow the farm BEFORE Joey? Mr. Narracott spends 30 quid on Joey I believe this would be about 150 US as it was valued in 1914  that amount of money would have easily bought Joey AND some old plowhorse.And why is Mr. Narracott about 6065 years old with a 14 year old son? People married young back then  Albert is more the age of his grandchild. How on earth did the father think he'd run a goodsized farm when he's handicapped? and has no plow horse? Note nobody apparently had ever heard of mules back then  much cheaper than a thoroughbred! Since he spends his life savings on Joey Mr. Narracott now has NO RENT MONEY....why did he do this? He doesn't even like or WANT the horse! He has no use for such a horse! He's put his entire family in danger of going hungry andor being evicted for a horse he dislikes. Then he gambles what's left of his future that this slightly built yearling can plow up a huge rocky field.Of course the horse does so with considerable anguish and suffering  in one day because nobody remotely considered doing it a bit at a time. The Narracotts are so mentally challenged as a FAMILY none of them consider FIRST going through the field and REMOVING the giant ROCKS but prefer to make it as hard as possible for the horse. When they amazingly DO NOT KILL the horse with this abusive behavior it then rains washing away the entire crop of turnips no less. While all this happens the village folk  who have no work or farms of their own to run  stand around IN THE RAIN watching! Literally they have no more sense than to stand in the rain in their good clothes. Naturally NOT ONE OF THEM  all presumably village tenant farmers  has a spare horse or mule or even the decency to pitch in and help a CRIPPLED MAN and his 14 year old boy. Nice town. Glad I don't live there. Note by 1914 if they had CARS they had TRACTORS.After this segment there was nothing about the war scenes or Joey's unlikely survival against all odds that moved me or made me feel anything for the characters. Jeremy Irvine as Albert the boy is especially weak and he doesn't look 14 he also looks identical at 18 whereas we all know that boys change VERY rapidly in physique in those 4 years.At the end when Joey and Albert return from war....well they apparently take a wrong turn and end up in WYOMING. Because suddenly there are westernlike expanses of land and big golden sunsets and vistas that go on forever. Frankly it's not Devonshire England.Among the many subplots  where Joey is handed along by one unbelievably kind and decent person to another literally the nicest warring folks in history  one set in a French farmhouse with the world's most annoying kid with the world's lamest fake French accent is a real low point. Later we hear the little girl has died  old movie disease since she looks healthy as well a horse  we just feel relief we don't have to hear her fake French accent again I was afraid she'd resurface somewhat older as a romantic partner for Albert.Sorry I can't buy one frame of this film. A big disappointment. If you do get a chance to view some of the puppetry from the theatrical play don't miss it  THAT is magnificent. But the film just third rate.".

The scene is breathtaking and it's the sort which noone does better than Spielberg.Longtime collaborator John Williams provides a moving score regardless of its resemblance to the one he composed for 'Saving Private Ryan'.

Early reviews are now saying that this film will be in the running for major Academy Awards  a statement that seems accurate after watching the film.Based on the book by Michael Morpurgo War Horsedepicts the story of Albert Narracott played by Jeremy Irvine and his treasured horse Joey in Britain where World War I is about to begin. Joey is sold to the cavalry by Albert's alcoholic father and finds himself trapped in the devastating fields of war while Albert is trying to find him.Spielberg finds a balance between heartfelt emotion especially from seeing the war through Joey's eyes and the people he meets along the way and the tragic problems the main characters face for example the separation between Joey and Albert after we have watched them bond and connect in the first part of the film. It is those emotional contrasts that Spielberg translates onto the screen well perhaps the best one being the contrast between the overall setting of the devastation and trauma of World War I and the love between the main character and his horse portrayed throughout the film.Although some of the cast are newcomers to cinema they put on a stellar performance. Jeremy Irvine perfectly portrays on screen the character's determination and devotion to find his horse. Practically unknown before this film his performance in War Horse has now made him one to watch. The rest of the cast include Emily Watson Peter Mullan Tom Hiddleston and Niels Arestrup.War Horse is the perfect film to settle down with the family for Christmas. It is a touching beautiful depiction of the relationship between a boy and his horse and of life in the countryside during World War I. The usual bloodbath and gory murder scenes are ditched in favour of a genuine story that manages to provoke passion and deep emotion in the audience and overall this fits into the beauty of the narrative.Check more reviews from The Upcoming on httpwww.theupcoming.co.uk?cat9".

	schema:reviewBody "As a nonhorse lover I was sceptical about seeing War Horse but the emphatically positive reviews won me over. I don't want to exaggerate but the film was amongst the least interesting two hours I have ever spent. Many films are dull but entertaining in patches War Horse only rarely strays into 'watchable'There is barely even the semblance of a plot for much of the film the horse encounters various different groups of people however none of them are given a chance to truly develop before they are killed off. Unsurprisingly the horse lasts through until the end of the film so suspense is totally lost.That would be fine if the characters weren't so vacuous. Other than the soldiers with the wirecutters and the old man on the farm the horse is comfortably the most interesting character in the piece and if I'm honest he didn't even excell as a horse. In particular Albie is one of the most onedimensional characters in any film I've seen and to make matters worse his one dimension is that he really really loves his horse. If he had been given even a trace of personality then I might have cared that he'd lost his horse.I possibly come across as heartless but if I'm honest I can't think of any moments in the film when I was even aware I was supposed to care. Someone near me in the cinema clearly had tears in her eyes at the end but unless they were in despair at the eternally lost hours of her life I can't really understand why.It's worth 2 stars rather than 1 because the cinematography is at times excellent and the fifteen minute period where Joey runs wild and is then cut loose is very well done if not especially original. If any other character in the film had the personality of those two soldiers then perhaps the film could have been saved.".

The title says the movie is about a horse but it's really about a lot more than that. The horse plays a central role but the humans figure in the story too in a big way. The cinematography is outstanding it really conveys the bleak gory nature of war. The movie alludes to the Battle of the Somme which is one of the costliest battles in history in terms of the sheer number of lives lost. At times the movie does lapse into sentimentality but in general the story proceeds at a fast pace pun intended. The performances of the horses in this movie are impressive. They are stars in their own right. If the movie accomplishes nothing else it shows that war is hard on animals too and like the humans they are victims too there was never a horse that wanted to go to war. That any horses survived at all in the war is amazing. Anyway this movie is well worth watching.".

The film was professionally made it looked amazing sounded great. Legendary composer John Williams crafted an amazing and beautiful score. It was one of the best I've heard in years.Jeremy Irvine delivers a very heartfelt and convincing performance he's just great. The rest of the cast Emily Watson Peter Mullan David Thewlis Tom Hiddleston etc were all great as well. However the star of the film The Horse was simply amazing the facial expressions were all spot on. Its just great how you see the movie from a horse perspective. Steven Spielberg deserves a lot of praise for that and I hoper he gets it.The cinematography is as good as it gets its simply astounding. The film's cinematographer Janusz Kamiski deserves all the praise he gets an Oscar surely awaits him. The movie deserves all the technical praise it gets. The editing is well done the art direction is spectacular the look of the film is quite breathtaking at times.The film is uncompromisingly sentimental and I wasn't annoyed by it. Because it worked so well it made me care about the story the characters the horses. A good old fashion studio epic I miss them and I'm happy Spielberg delivered one. There are a lot of powerful scenes in the movie from which I cried. It was just so moving it showed the true consequences of war. Some of the battle sequences were simply fantastic and astonishing.I am happy to see Steven Spielberg in his top form. He showed that he's still one of the best in the business and I hope to see more of him in the future. It may not be his best film but it certainly a wonderful film to watch. I'd recommend anyone to see the film it will appeal to everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautifully shot yes! Wonderful story absolutely! Plus it's a war  movie that you can take your family to but.. WAR HORSE is  underwhelming it gets lost in trying too hard to be a tearjerker so  much so that I hardly feel its emotional power. You can definitely  label WAR HORSE as the feelgood movie of the year but it's nothing  short of formulaic  I'm a die hard fan of John Williams what a brilliant composer! And his  music for this film is probably the biggest reason why I was looking  forward to WAR HORSE and it doesn't disappoint. His new music is as  memorable as his previous scores in the past. The film however just  doesn't work for me even with the gorgeous cinematography by Janusz  Kaminski. The fact that it's made by Spielberg certainly would still  attract audiences but just don't expect it to be like Saving Private  Ryan or Empire Of The Sun because WAR HORSE is not on that same level.  I do admire whatever method the production applied to train the horse  for this film and I'm sure they used more than just one horse for the  character Joey. There are certain scenes that might make animal lovers  everywhere cringe because of what those scenes required the horse to  seemingly do. In the story the horse Joey encounters several human  characters besides Albert through its unexpected journey and sadly  the film doesn't allow us enough chance to get to deeply know those  human characters There is a point where Joey is so crushed by  excruciating grief that he starts to run like the wind and it even  doesn't care which way it's going it doesn't care about living and  dying either and that tells you the film's intention all along to  make Joey have some kind of humanlike personality this happens when  you deal with movies that have animals as their lead stars which goes  back to formulaic. So that aspect would resonate with audiences who  love films like Babe. I just feel the film doesn't challenge itself and  it leaves me with an indifferent afterthought.  WAR HORSE has its funny and heartfelt moments the themes are  empowering and liberating they exude strength and loyalty there is no  denying in addition to a very hopeful ending but it plays it safe and  it's not one of my favorite Spielberg films.".

Quite a few scenes are captivating to say the least as is the scene with the horse Joey forging through heavily barbwired no man's land.'War Horse' surely reminisces the older WW1 films and epic war films in general such as Lawrence of Arabia that drag on forever yet do not fail to keep you enthralled with their stunning visuals and topnotch acting. Jeremy Irvine's performance was acceptable for an actor fairly new to the game as were the performances of the gamut of child actors in the film but honorable mentions must go to Emily Watson Niels Arestrup and Peter Mullan. The production did a wonderful job to give the horse Joey a deeper personified image as if he were an actor. The same goes for the other horses in the film who seem to converse amongst each other and reveal a chemistry shared between animal and animal as well as animal and man. A wonderful job on the whole. Certainly Spielberg's finest work in recent months yes I don't think cowboys and aliens should ever mix.For what its worth this picture will move you deeply as it has done to many. 'War Horse' inspires antiwar sentiments as Joey's endeavors help him sympathize with men on both sides of the trenches and ultimately reminds us of the beauty of Earths beasts. Each one has its own character that strikes a chord with the audience and this is undeniable.Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "World War II has been put to film a number of times in many different countries but there are not nearly enough World War I films. Steven Spielberg set out to redress the balance giving us War Horse an adaptation of a children's book and the play of the same name.Albert Narracott Jeremy Irvine is a young man living in Dartmoor in 1914. His father Peter Mullan buys a thoroughbred horse when he should have plough because of his rift with his landlord David Thewlis. Albert is able to break in the horse who he names Joey and he shows to be a very special horse strong determined loyal and intelligence. But when World War I breaks out Joey is sold to a British office Captain Nicholls Tom Hiddleston and during the course of the conflict the horse see all aspects from a Calvary horse in rural civilian life for a French girl suffering Hollywood's disease i.e. they say she is dying but seems perfectly healthy as a German work horse and in no man's land.Spielberg has a good track record making historical films with Schindler's List Saving Private Ryan and Empire of the Sun. War Horse is a solid film rather then being a great film. It is a film that is rich in period detail showing the brutal nature of World War I from the effects of chemical warfare and you feel the muddy dirty environment as horses pull a giant artillery battery up a hill and Spielberg knows how to make a mundane scene of a horse ploughing a field exciting and emotional it must be the most boring village in the world for watching a horse ploughing to be considered entertainment. But at the same time there are also some problems particularly Spielberg's reliance on cutesy humour from a goose who chases people to a scene in the trenches. I would not be surprise if Richard Curtis was partially responsible. The film is too long and many scenes could have been shorten or cut particularly in the beginning. I think the relationship and love between Albert and Joey could have easily have been done in half the time.It was a great idea of using a horse to show the horrors of war and the different perspectives of war. It is a great opportunity to show that they are good guys and bad guys on both sides of the war. There is some success in that in the German army privates are show to be decent caring people to the horse but the officer core and sergeants were very harsh and cruel. Compare it to the British officers who are noble if a little arrogant or cocky but there are hints in one of the officers that behind his eagerness that in reality he was scared of the prospect of going to war for the first time. I would have wanted to see more of a mixed picture within all sides of the war and try to give more depth to the characters.There is a great cast in War Horse we have emerging talent like Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch who in their small roles show they are going to be big actors well more so new talent like Irvine who was excellent playing his character like Sam and Frodo from Lord of the Rings and Celine Buckens where the humour works best. Emily Watson was also brilliant as Albert's mother and it great to see in a big film. And of course Joey the horse shows a lot of promise as an animal performer.John Williams also supplies Mr. Spielberg with another great score fitting for the film and Janusz Kaminski continues with great camera work from the bright work of Devon in the summer to more grey and dull view of the front line of the war.War Horse is a solid piece of filmmaking. It is typical Oscar bait but it still works as a film and Spielberg is able to make us care for Joey.7.510.".

	schema:headline " A Fantastic War Movie that Will Appeal to All Audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see War Horse in a special prescreening last week and I can safely say I will be seeing it again when its released on Christmas day. I went in with relatively low expectations after watching the series of mediocre trailers and walked out being able to safely say that War Horse is one of the best movies of the year one of Steven Spielberg's best films and quite possibly one of the best war films ever made up there with my personal favorites The Thin Red Line Apocalypse Now and Paths of Glory. Steven Spielberg had long said that he didn't want to make Saving Private Ryan again. He said he wanted War Horse to be a war movie that parents cant take their children to and teach them something about love and war and in this respect I can say that he more than succeeded. Spielberg comes close to the clinical perfection of Private Ryan but more importantly from an emotional perspective War Horse far exceeds Private Ryan. There are many people apt to cry at Private Ryan but War Horse is more likely to cause tears at a similar level to say Schindler's List. More importantly unlike either Schindler or Private Ryan War Horse is unlikely to cause any sort of political or moral complaints. He never tempers the antiwar message with nationalist tripe. Rather he plays war straight. War is evil men are good. There are no sides in this movie. In fact at various points throughout the film he seems to directly reject Saving Private 's heroism is dying for country message.War Horse is based on the children's book and play of the same name. It is about a boy who's father on a whim buys a horse for his son that he knows will never be what is needed for the farm work it is purchased for. The boy forms an incredible bond with the horse. The first forty five minutes of the film is spent establishing the relationship between boy and horse. This part of the film is rather slow but is necessary to establishing the film's central relationships and is quickly made up for by the shift in pace as soon as the war begins. From the Scottish country side after this important turning point in world history War Horse shifts to France where the titular horse is serving after being sold to the army. The boy is a year or two too young to follow his horse to Europe at this point so for the next section the film follows the horse only. From here on out I will leave the plot a mystery but it is gripping thrilling and very emotional.There are two scenes in War Horse that I think are worthy of further mention. The first is a charge across no man's land. For anyone not familiar with the bulk of World War I's combat it consisted of months at a time of back and forth shooting between trenches broken up by awful charges across no man's land to take a few hundred yards of enemy territory. These charges as short as they were as a result of the machine gun came with death tolls in the thousands or higher. War Horse contains one of these charges and it is carried out with both taste and near perfect artistry. It is just grisly enough to get the reality across but not so grisly that it makes the movie impossible to show to younger audiences. In fact this trench charge ranks up with Steven Spielberg's other famous World War battle scene the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. It doesn't quite make it but it comes close.The other scene worthy of mention also occurs in the trenches and reflects the other side of War Horse. The titular horse gets caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land. The soldiers on either side spot it. No one knows what to do as it is clear that its in incredible pain but they know that leaving their respective trench would expose them to machine gun fire. Eventually two soldiers one British the other German both move to free the horse. The soldiers on both sides know what is going on so no one fires a shot. This scene is unbelievably touching. The discussion they have the German soldier happens to speak good English explained adequately through a joke will move even the most cynical of viewers and gives a good idea of just what perspective War Horse takes to the act of war.There are a few small problems in War Horse that in most films I would take issue with but I will forgive in this case as I feel that they are so necessary for this film to appeal to younger audiences. The German soldiers speak English to one another a big pet peeve for me. I would have preferred for French characters to speak subtitled French and German characters to speak subtitled Germans but I recognize that many younger viewers refuse to read subtitles. There are a few unnecessary jokes but again younger viewers will enjoy these. Spielberg as always has three different endings tacked onto the movie in this case necessary to provide the cut and dry resolution younger viewers require. As I said these are still problems but they are for better or worse required to accomplish what Spielberg was trying to.I can say with absolute certainty that when Christmas rolls around I will be dragging all my younger relatives to a screening of War Horse. I have never seen a movie so able to pull its punches enough to get a PG 13 rating but show enough to explain just what it is about war that makes it such an odious disgusting awful affair. In short see War Horse as soon as you possibly can.".

	schema:reviewBody "I quite enjoy most of Spielberg's films. From the trailers I had moderate expectations that he would deliver good entertainment value which is why we go to the cinema in the first place. I am not familiar with the novel that this film is based on and know nothing of the play version. I know a few facts about WW1. The operative word that kept going through my mind in the film was improbable. It is a given that at some point in most films you are requested to surrender your belief that the images are realistic representations of some story. In this case WW1 is a fairly well known event so if you place your drama in the midst of it you had better get it right.The drama begins in Devon just before the war where an impoverished and semi drunken farmer bids an enormous amount of money for a horse that would be put to use behind a plow. While most level headed men would have purchased a stocky draft animal that was well suited to hauling a plow over rough terrain this farmer inexplicably buys a horse far beyond his purse and his choice is a thoroughbred unbroken racing horse. His young son has had eyes on this horse for several years don't you know and throws his body into saving the horse from his fathers wrath. Eventually his father has to sell the horse to pay for the rent on the farm. The horse is bought up by the British Army and is shipped off to France and Belgium to help in the war effort. The young lad is too young to go fight in the war just yet but don't you know that he'll be there just as soon as he possibly can. And in the back of his mind he is hoping against all odds to find his horse. And at the end of the film again against the highest of all odds he finds his horse. A more impossibly silly story in Spielberg's output is rarely found. The horse is taken over by several different people who for short periods of time take care of it. In the midst of the carnage of a full scale front line bombardment it survives being entwined in layers of barbed wire while a plucky and perhaps insane British soldier decides to wander out under cover of a white flag to try and relieve the horse of it's sufferings. Don't you know that the horse is down closer to the German lines and a brave and perhaps equally foolish German soldier wanders out to watch what the British soldier is going to do with the horse. At this point I'd have to say that it's all down hill and into a Disneylike wrap up.The battle scenes are very loud I had to plug my ears but there is very little gratuitous blood and gore that lots of his films are rich with. No head exploding blood flying everywhere like in Saving Private Ryan. This seems to have been toned down for a younger audience appeal maybe? The problems with the film are obvious. The first 23's of the film are slow ponderous quiet overly dramatic but without any direction to a climax. The war is depicted for what it was horrific and led by supremely inept leadership on both sides. This is really a side bar because this is a horse movie. That we watch British Cavalry ride off with sabres flashing as if they were fighting Napoleon only to be mowed down in a slaughtering hail of bullets from machine guns is really the only major display of insanity that the witless leadership brought down on themselves. That they fought trench war fare and were killed or maimed by gas is given just a passing glance. The war in this film is a distraction and at the point where it looms large on the screen you've forgotten exactly where this film was supposed to be going. Oh yes the horse.A quick glance at Wikipedia tells me that at least 480000 horses died on the British side alone. That this film wants us to zoom in on the travails of just one of them in the midst of maybe a million others is far fetched and a stretch too far. Would we be as swept up in the glorious drama these are words used by other reviewers if some heart broken bloke had his dog overseas and in the trenches and somehow he finds it in the middle of hell? It is preposterous. This part of the film reminds me of two other occasions where a major Hollywood film puts men at risk of the trenches with someone trying to keep a sharp eye open for a close friend or relative the premise being that they've given a promise to someone back home that they'd bring them back alive. It was covered in Legends of the fall where the brother dies and it is covered in Passchendaele where the main lead gets himself killed. Those were more believable front line stories than War Horse.I found the dialogue unmoving the visual images overly beautiful the plot predictable in the midst of a muddy sea of improbabilities. And for God's sake Spielberg has the German soldiers speaking English but as they are led away in a march the officer leading them away counts off in German. Give me a break. Consistency be damned. The music was predictable John Williams fare. All in all I was let down and found the first 23's of the film tedious and too slow. I would hardly use the words stunning enthralling or exceptional. Surprising let down from a real master.".

Jurassic had my kid brother literary climbing the walls of our local cinema in sheer youthful terror at the sight of the realistic evil little lizards.For my part Ryan was and is still one huge pile of greatness. The name Spielberg was a surefire way of knowing that you were going to be on one heck of a thrill ride when seeing one of his movies.I mean Indy shooting that sword guy or harassing that poor Chinese midget? Classic! But somewhere along the line Spielberg must have suffered a stroke that has been kept quit or been abducted and replaced with one of them surrogates from Bruce Willis bleak masterful prophetic movie with the same name.Cause this can't possibly be the same person can it? Can it? And if it can then help us god...What can you say about war horse that hasn't already been covered? Its a 2.40h blazing poop wave of sap and ham fisted acting.Right from the start where Lupin somehow is alive again and a bit of tool forces jovial and lovable drunk Irish farmer into waving a bidding war over a horse.Or as the movie war horse subtly puts it the most super awesome honey dipped pantspeeingly amazing horse ever EVER! The horse plows a field runs by a car which is puttering along at the neckbreakingly speed of 5miles per hour but did not stop a burning child from crying or end poverty or won the dance audtion or even saved the rec center. So it did nothing that would warrant its status as a godlike being.But i digress wasn't my meaning to give a blow by blow of this either magnificent poopstorm of a movie but i can't help myself cause it got me really upset dang it...I rented this movie and it promised me the feelgood movie of the year a magnificent and gripping epic tale of friendship bravery and love Spielberg has done it again he has!.But i really just hated it.The horse Joey was said to change the life of everyone he meet. And did he ever? Two stout German youths with outrageous accents why the hell were the Germans doing speaking English? i mean come on...get shoot.Then this prissy lil girl who was so sweet n cute and cutesy that my teeth ached has some cutesy scenes where somehow Joey the horse has them fooled of his godlike status by doing absolutely nothing.Its a kinda of a bad movie when you feel a smile coming on when you hear that this little girl will die horribly of some sorta disease. Really? will we get to watch? please please please?? But no.And don't get me started on the whole thing at the end when the evil salami maker is going to buy Joey for 30 pounds and the cute girls grandfather comes out of nowhere and offers 100pounds for it..and is prepared to sell everything to buy joey back.This whole scene with its heartfelt speech made me gag on my own bitter cynical hateful bile. 100pounds? Really? 100? When all you had to do was raise to 3540 pounds tops? Why does it have to be such grand gestures? Why does Spielberg try so overly hard and sloppy to try n pluck at our collective heartstrings? Its insulting to say the least.To summarize i saw an episode of fear factory few weeks ago where the contestants had to drink blended rats. I really think that would have made a more entertaining evening then watching Spielbergs latests mouth fart of a movie.And what the heck was with that music? Do we really have to have 80 violins squeaking every scene to cramp the seriousness or whimsy of each scene down our collective necks?".

No disrespect to those who said it was the most wonderful movie they had ever seen. I went with my wife and 13 year old daughter. They both asked me if we could leave I promptly obliged something I don't remember ever doing. I am the type that can see 3 films in a row. I also teach film so I will be using Mr. Spielberg's movie as a case study in what not to do. I honestly don't remember seeing worst cinematography since the early 40's Mexican exploitation films that always featured horses! . Double and triple shadows on exterior shots? Does this story happens in another planet with multiple suns and I totally missed that? Beautiful overcast skies which could have been used to light the scenes with soft light instead actors in the foreground including the horse lit with horrible harsh light in the most amateurish fashion. 3 point lighting in the interior of barns? Light coming from opposite direction from where the source is supposed to be? Mr. Kaminski has certainly done a much better job in other films including Spielberg's. So what happened here? The buck stops with the director specially in a production that has been shot digitally with instant access to the shots. Was he absent? Worried about meeting distribution deadlines instead of storytelling. This movie is unacceptable by any modern standard but the Hollywood machinery will try to sell any sap to an unsuspecting audience. I won't say much about the acting. Fairly decent actors that could have done a decent job in any well directed film reduced to grimacing masks and theatrical silent movie antics. It's a shame. This movie signals to me the end of Spielberg as a credible director I now suspect he only lent his name for the excellent production of Tin Tin by Peter Jackson who has demonstrated consistently that he has the talent and the craft. this movie is not worth the popcorn let alone a Golden Globe are you kidding?".

	schema:headline " A Stinking Pile of Horse Manure";
	schema:reviewBody "A woeful movie that possibly challenges Amistad as Steven Spielberg's very worst film.War Horse is an episodic tale of a  you guessed it  horse and its journey through the hell of World War I. Because the film spends no more than a few minutes on each set of characters the horse comes across and because a horse is a rather uninteresting main character the film has no narrative momentum a fact that is not helped by its running time of 230.Spielberg's version of WWI is so simplistic that my threeyearold could have understood this film leaving those of us who don't need to be treated like we're imbeciles by a movie director feeling grumpy that we're being so condescended to.

	onyx:emotionText "A woeful movie that possibly challenges Amistad as Steven Spielberg's very worst film.War Horse is an episodic tale of a  you guessed it  horse and its journey through the hell of World War I. Because the film spends no more than a few minutes on each set of characters the horse comes across and because a horse is a rather uninteresting main character the film has no narrative momentum a fact that is not helped by its running time of 230.Spielberg's version of WWI is so simplistic that my threeyearold could have understood this film leaving those of us who don't need to be treated like we're imbeciles by a movie director feeling grumpy that we're being so condescended to.

One wonders at the degree of corruption in More's time that he should have been so highly regarded for his honesty  and how he might have been regarded today.What Robert Bolt and Fred Zinnemann had wrought is absolutely brought to glorious life by the incomparable characterization of Sir Thomas More by the chronically underrated Paul Scofield. Bringing superb support to the role are Nigel Davenport as More's close friend Norfolk who is caught between the rock of his respect and concern for More and the hard place of his duty to and fear of Henry VIII Leo McKern as the jovially sinister Thomas Cromwell whose verbal jousts with More are virtual poetry from Bolt's pen John Hurt as More's fairweather friend Richard Rich Dame Wendy Hiller as More's devoted but frustrated and misunderstanding wife and the elegant Susannah York as his equally devoted and strongminded daughter. Two standout performances in relatively small but vital roles Orson Welles magnetic as the shrewdly pragmatic Cardinal Wolsey and Robert Shaw whose energetic portrayal of a young Henry VIII before his corpulent days! dominates the screen the two times he's on it.As with The Lion in Winter the remarkable scriptwriting is the driving force behind the story but Scofield's dignified restrained but at the same time quietly forceful delivery are what give the writing its power. The great quotes of the film Why Richard it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the entire world...but for Wales? When you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience and I am sent to hell for not doing mine will you come with me for fellowship? etc. are conveyed with either enormous gravity or poignancy by nothing more than the tone of Scofield's voice.I think that the dilemma at the heart of the tale and how men of power came to grips with it is artfully summed up in the dying words of Wolsey and of course More. Wolsey regrets he did not serve God as well as he served his king. More on the other hand dies as His majesty's good servant...but God's first. Whether criticized or praised as a morality play it's wonderful to at least HAVE an uncompromising morality play to watch from time to time  especially one so well crafted.".

On a side note the American Republic wisely sought a nation that divided church and state. However the fine distinction remains that it would be a state informed by faith but not run by the church. The aforementioned exemplary performances by the leads are backed by excellent supporting turns especially from Orson Welles as the less than saintly Cardinal Wolsey and the eternally ebullient Susannah York as Sir Thomas's daughter Margaret.

He was made for Bolt's dialogue and Bolt's dialogue is drilled forever into our conscious by Scofield's flawless performance.Everything else is also here.  Leo McKern is brilliant as politically motivated prosecutor Lord Cromwell.  A bit subtler but no less brilliant is Nigel Davenport as a man of some conscience but not quite enough.  John Hurt is unforgettable as ambitious young Rich led into temptation by Lord Cromwell.  The incomparable Dame Wendy Hiller  who passed just last year  adds several more dimensions than her rather sparsely written role as Scofield's wife should have allowed for.  Every minute she is on the screen is magnificent.  Susannah York walks a tightrope between being scholarly reason and her passion for what is right.  Robert Shaw as Henry VIII and Orson Wells as Cardinal Woolsey are larger than life and completely compelling during their alltoobrief virtuoso solos.  The cinematography is lush.  The soundtrack is historically accurate and perfectly positioned. Key sounds punctuate three pregnant pauses with explosive impact.  The movie is technically as perfect as an historical epic can be.  The film is simply exquisite.All that being said as I reflect momentarily in my head on closing this it is Scofield's incomparable and breathtaking performance which still leaves me in complete awe.".

	schema:headline " What Profit In Selling One's Soul?";
	schema:reviewBody "Fred Zinnemann's one of our great forgotten directors amazing considering that he was nominated for eight directing Oscars in four decades winning two. Today's critics and auteurs don't champion him you won't read much about him in Entertainment Weekly. For Zinnemann the script was the thing what he worked from and his greatest genius may have been in choosing the right scripts and knowing how to do them justice.From Here To Eternity may well be Zinnemann at his highest tide though IMDb voters seem to prefer High Noon. Then there's A Man For All Seasons the film of the year in 1966 though its hard to imagine a film that represents the ethos of the 1960s less. A Man For All Seasons presents us with an unfashionable character who refuses to surrender his conscience to the dictates of king and countrymen resolute instead in his devotion to God and Roman Catholic Church.When statesmen lead their country without their conscience to guide them it is short road to chaos Thomas More tells his nominal boss Cardinal Wolsey when the latter unsuccessfully presses him to give his blind assent to King Henry VIII's request for a convenient divorce. Perhaps out of pique Wolsey makes sure More inherits his office of Counselor of the Realm where More's sterling convictions are really put to the test.More is a marvel of subtleties tensile steel covered in a velvet glove a mildmannered lion trying at every turn to do well even though his political savvy knows how dangerous that can be. As a lawyer More knows the angles yet he is no sharpie. He respects the law too much for that. Rather he sees in law the only hope for man's goodness in a fallen world. I'd give the Devil benefit of the law for my own safety's sake he explains.Paul Scofield plays More in such a way as to make us not only admire him but identify with him and come to value both his humanness and his spirituality. His tired eyes the way he gently rebuffs wouldbe bribers around Hampton Court his genuine professions of loyalty to Henry even as he disagrees with the matter of his divorce all speak to one of those great gifts of movies which is the ability to create a character so wellrounded and illuminating in his window on the human condition we find him more haunting company than the real people we meet in life. It's a gift the movies seldom actually deliver on so when someone like Scofield makes it happen it is a object of gratitude as much as admiration.The script adapted by Robert Bolt from his stage play is very literate and careful to explain the facts of More's dilemma. It moves too slowly and opaquely at times to qualify A Man For All Seasons as a true classic that and a supporting cast full of onenote performances though some are quite good a few however are notably flat. I especially liked Robert Shaw as a young and thin Henry VIII full of vigor yet also a childish temperament and inconsistent mind.

	onyx:emotionText "Fred Zinnemann's one of our great forgotten directors amazing considering that he was nominated for eight directing Oscars in four decades winning two. Today's critics and auteurs don't champion him you won't read much about him in Entertainment Weekly. For Zinnemann the script was the thing what he worked from and his greatest genius may have been in choosing the right scripts and knowing how to do them justice.From Here To Eternity may well be Zinnemann at his highest tide though IMDb voters seem to prefer High Noon. Then there's A Man For All Seasons the film of the year in 1966 though its hard to imagine a film that represents the ethos of the 1960s less. A Man For All Seasons presents us with an unfashionable character who refuses to surrender his conscience to the dictates of king and countrymen resolute instead in his devotion to God and Roman Catholic Church.When statesmen lead their country without their conscience to guide them it is short road to chaos Thomas More tells his nominal boss Cardinal Wolsey when the latter unsuccessfully presses him to give his blind assent to King Henry VIII's request for a convenient divorce. Perhaps out of pique Wolsey makes sure More inherits his office of Counselor of the Realm where More's sterling convictions are really put to the test.More is a marvel of subtleties tensile steel covered in a velvet glove a mildmannered lion trying at every turn to do well even though his political savvy knows how dangerous that can be. As a lawyer More knows the angles yet he is no sharpie. He respects the law too much for that. Rather he sees in law the only hope for man's goodness in a fallen world. I'd give the Devil benefit of the law for my own safety's sake he explains.Paul Scofield plays More in such a way as to make us not only admire him but identify with him and come to value both his humanness and his spirituality. His tired eyes the way he gently rebuffs wouldbe bribers around Hampton Court his genuine professions of loyalty to Henry even as he disagrees with the matter of his divorce all speak to one of those great gifts of movies which is the ability to create a character so wellrounded and illuminating in his window on the human condition we find him more haunting company than the real people we meet in life. It's a gift the movies seldom actually deliver on so when someone like Scofield makes it happen it is a object of gratitude as much as admiration.The script adapted by Robert Bolt from his stage play is very literate and careful to explain the facts of More's dilemma. It moves too slowly and opaquely at times to qualify A Man For All Seasons as a true classic that and a supporting cast full of onenote performances though some are quite good a few however are notably flat. I especially liked Robert Shaw as a young and thin Henry VIII full of vigor yet also a childish temperament and inconsistent mind. He demands More not oppose his marriage to Anne Boleyn then decides he must have either More's outright assent or else his head. There's no bargaining with such a man. Perhaps More was better off standing on his principals as he did than climbing into bed with homicidal Henry.

And I definitely won't be that quickly amazed and impressed by a performance again. May I just say that Paul Scofield embodies great acting to it's very core. Comprehending his masterful and skillful acting is evident even to the greatest fool or layman and I not being a big expert myself could not believe how a man can attain such knowledge of perfection. His every word is spoken with the greatest skill intonation and accent as well as his facial expressions and movements. His performance is so strong it's scary when I think about it. As if he knewand he most definitely did! EXACTLY how to perform his acting task. This movie is an explosion of outstanding acting and actors showing their skills to the fullest and to the amazed viewers. It may well be the greatest movie ever made but the reason for this lies also in the jaw dropping and mind opening script that deserves more credit than it could have ever gotten. If you thought On The Waterfront Bridge On The River Kwai Glennary Glen Ross or even The Usual Suspects or Pulp Fiction had some great dialogs then this inspiring and simply amazing script will definitely change your mind. There are so many memorable lines monologues and great battling dialogs I can't even give an approximate number. Every moment is meaningful and the movie is full of smart and important thoughts. I won't go into the story because as a previous commenter said there are just too many points of view and meanings to it but I will say this Sir Thomas More was too moral and too strong to give in to the Church and because of his reasons he was respected. But because he was for some this stubborn he paid the price which in the real world when you play with the big boys is a given. A movie every future actor actress director and screen writer should and must see and a movie that makes most of the later Oscar winners for best picture look like a joke. And a final though Leonard Maltin was absolutely right if Paul Scofield acted only in this movie he'd still be remembered as a marvel worth every praise and respect. 910".

	schema:headline " Fantastically acted beautifully shot";
	schema:reviewBody "A Man For All Seasons' much like the film Becket' is about a man standing up to his king with tragic results.  In this film the man is Sir Thomas More Paul Scofield a wellliked and wellrespected lawyer and the king is Henry VIII Robert Shaw.  Henry VIII wants to divorce his wife and marry another something illegal by the courts of England.  But since he is the king and he is fond of executions practically no one objects except More who refuses to believe that anyone is above the law even his king.It's not that More objects rather that he doesn't go along with it.  He never says he's against it  because that way he could be charged with treason  but he doesn't sign the new law passed in favor of the king.  He could get away with this of course but Henry VIII stubbornly refuses to have any opposition and the rest of the movie is spent on characters trying to persuade More to abide for this reason or that.  There is also a subplot about Richard Rich a young John Hurt and Thomas Cromwell Leo McKern plotting to frame More to quiet him.That is what I got from the plot at least.  I could be wrong.  It was hard to follow this film because of the fast fury of dialogue in each scene never relenting for the audience to understand.  This fast approach to the subject matter wasn't too tedious but it did prompt me to rewind a few times to hear things over.That I am glad to say is the movie's only flaw.  Everything else is wonderful.  The acting was great.  Scofield creates a sense of pride duty confidence and principle with his character that gives him a high strong presence whenever he's onscreen.  His character is complex and in a way simple.  Simple he's refusing to relent not because he believes strongly on the issues of marriage and divorce but because he believes strongly that no one not even the king is above the law.  Complex his strength and duty begins to become selfdestructive when he is jailed his family is made poor and unhappy and he loses respect from most around him all the while still refusing to conform.  An Oscar well deserved.The rest of the cast rounds out nicely.  We have Orson Welles in a small role as the gruff Cardinal Wolsey Leo McKern using scorn as his technique as Cromwell Hurt playing a sad role that goes from nice and likable to selfish and nasty and much others.  Ones that stood out for me were Robert Shaw and Wendy Hiller both Oscar nominated.  Shaw is loud rude stupid and in some way likable as the king it's not his best performance but it is an entertaining one.  Hiller playing More's wife creates a character whose pride and strength diminishes when her husband is punished revealing what we least expected love.Also the film is beautifully shot.  Its scenery is nice but how the camera captures it is better.  The set direction and costumes are also very impressive making the film as much a wonder to look at as it is to watch. And notice how as the movie progresses and More's situation becomes more and more hopeless the tones become muddier there are more grays and browns than the reds and oranges from early on.The film won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Picture.  I liked The Sand Pebbles' a little more but it was still a deserved win in my book.  A great picture made better by Scofield's powerful performance 810.".

For centuries the Medieval Church had propagated any belief contrary to those disseminated by the Holy See was heresy. People not only faced eternal damnation but could also be tortured and executed for holding contrary religious ideas since the time of Charlegmagne sometimes even for very slight doctrinal disagreements. Part of these sets of beliefs included unquestioned allegiance to and even worship of the Bishop of Rome aka the Pope. The film A Man for All Seasons is about a man who stood up for the traditional beliefs propagated by the church and his refusal to recant somewhat in the same vein as Martin Luther but in the opposite direction.In the early 1500's seven hundred years after Charlemagne used military might to secure the supremacy of the Pope in Western Europe King Henry VIII of England decided to break with religious and political tradition. Almost over night the king rebuked the politicalreligious power of the Pope in Rome and declared himself to be head of the church in England mainly as a mechanism to secure a divorce and remarry. Fearing the awesome power of the king all of the nobility and legates which surrounded the royal court signed a declaration not only recognizing the king as head of the church but that God had granted him this power directly from above. Except one did not sign. Sir Thomas Moore.Thomas Moore was the only member of the class of litigators and lawyers who would not sign the document. Openly he kept silent on his exact opinion. The King decided to regard this act of defiance as treasonous although Moore never openly admitted his point of view until the trial. He simply refused to sign the document. The case against Moore was certainly on shaky legal grounds as Moore had not actually done anything treasonous. He simply refused to sign and refused to give his reasons.Thomas Moore was a devout Roman Catholic. And although from a modern perspective his reasons for refusing to sign the document may seem like blind loyalty to a medieval church and its dogma Moore's point was that by signing he would lose all religious integrity and ultimately condemn himself to damnation. His signature meant a recognition of something he did not believe in his heart. He ultimately believed the divorce between Catherine and King Henry was an act of heresy. Simultaneously he did not deny Henry as head of the English church and Anne Boleyn as the new queen. The document he was asked to sign contained religious wording that placed the powers of local monarchs over that of the church inviolable grants of jurisdictions given by God. The wording was far too religiously charged for Moore to consent to signing it. It is speculated that if the wording had been altered slightly and words pertaining to God and the Roman Church had been removed Moore might have signed it. But of course King Henry who was as stubborn as Moore would not revise the document. The film in question is a tourdeforce period piece that wellreflects the religious and monarchical fanaticism of the age. Paul Scofield offers an AcamemyAwardWinning performance as a man who could not recant even with the threat of the headsman's ax being wielded above his head. Robert Shaw is more than convincing as King Henry VIII who after having broken with Rome could not abide any nobleman or subject to disagree with his position as head of his reformed church. I would not have thought that Shaw would be the ideal actor for this role but Shaw brings a hotheaded sensibility to Henry that may be relatively historically accurate. Honorable mention goes to John Hurt as Richard Rich considered by some English historians to be the worst Brit of the 1500's partly because of the perjury he committed against Moore at his trial and Wendy Hiller as Alice Moore. Both Shaw and Hiller were nominated for their supporting roles. A great film not to be missed especially for viewers who enjoy Renaissance and English history.".

It is speculated that if the wording had been altered slightly and words pertaining to God and the Roman Church had been removed Moore might have signed it. But of course King Henry who was as stubborn as Moore would not revise the document. The film in question is a tourdeforce period piece that wellreflects the religious and monarchical fanaticism of the age. Paul Scofield offers an AcamemyAwardWinning performance as a man who could not recant even with the threat of the headsman's ax being wielded above his head. Robert Shaw is more than convincing as King Henry VIII who after having broken with Rome could not abide any nobleman or subject to disagree with his position as head of his reformed church. I would not have thought that Shaw would be the ideal actor for this role but Shaw brings a hotheaded sensibility to Henry that may be relatively historically accurate. Honorable mention goes to John Hurt as Richard Rich considered by some English historians to be the worst Brit of the 1500's partly because of the perjury he committed against Moore at his trial and Wendy Hiller as Alice Moore. Both Shaw and Hiller were nominated for their supporting roles. A great film not to be missed especially for viewers who enjoy Renaissance and English history.";

He is able to capture the insanity that actually was in the real King and also is a good villain for the film. Shaw along with Scofield make the film what it is. They are simply amazing and bring out their characters true nature.The film conveys a powerful message of not bending to something you don't believe even if it means punishment. in St. Thomas More's case the punishment was hatred from the country.

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Thomas More a multitalented man of letters and law went to the executioner's block because he would not recognize a temporal king as head of his country's church. Though a friend of Henry VIII and his chancellor he was more afraid of offending God than the king. A man who took his Catholic faith quite seriously.Robert Bolt's play ran for 637 performances in the 19611963 season on Broadway and the only two who came over from the Broadway cast were Paul Scofield as More and Leo McKern as Thomas Cromwell. They present quite a contrast indeed as antagonists Scofield the man of honor and principle and McKern as the sly intriguing Cromwell. This Cromwell was in fact the grand uncle of Oliver Cromwell and he suffered the same fate as More for finding himself out of step politically at Henry VIII's court.That's the way it was in court politics in Tudor England. You stayed in step with the monarch whims or the executioner shortened you a little bit. As Henry VIII Robert Shaw does actually have reason to be concerned.The only American in the cast Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey explains it quite clearly. It was only 40 years since the king's father Henry VII took the throne and reunited the York and Lancastrian claims to the crown. Previous to that for sixty years England went into a steep decline during the period known as the War of the Roses where rival factions fought for the crown. The lack of a strong male heir would guarantee such an event which was fresh in a lot of minds.Why wouldn't the Pope just find some ecclesiastical loophole and give who had been his ardent defender a divorce? Very simply Henry VIII's first wife Catherine of Aragon was the aunt of Emperor Charles V and his army was occupying Rome after the battle of Pavia a few years back. Catherine's marriage to Henry put England in the Spanish orbit and he wasn't about to let it go. Basically the Pope was going to dance to Emperor Charles's tune.Which still left Henry VIII with a dynastic problem. He made the complete break and said he was head of the Church in England. That is how the Anglican church came into being. A lot like More thought this wrong and paid with their lives.Paul Scofield won Broadway's Tony Award for playing Sir Thomas More and matched it with an Oscar for Best Actor in 1966. Scofield set a standard for playing a man willing to die for a belief. His More is a man of wit and humor not a priggish sort by any means. It's what makes More such an appealing character and even nonCatholics can certainly appreciate his sacrifice.Besides those I've already mentioned the cast also includes Wendy Hiller as More's good wife Susannah York as his daughter and Corin Redgrave of that great theatrical family as his somewhat bumptious but well meaning soninlaw. Sister Vanessa is her briefly as Anne Boleyn who Henry hoped to marry to begat a son with her. For the story from her point of view see Anne of a Thousand Days or for the whole saga see the fine BBC production of their miniseries starring Keith Mitchell as Henry VIII.Besides Scofield though my favorite in A Man for All Seasons has always been McKern. To see what a wide ranging player he was apart from being the henpecked barrister Horace Rumpole you have to see A Man For All Seasons. He plays Thomas Cromwell every bit as slimy as he has come down to us in history. Also note the presence of a young John Hurt who plays Richard Rich whose perjured testimony convicts More.A Man For All Seasons a film for all seasons and lots of reasons.".

Vanessa Redgrave who was to play York's role did a play instead and agreed to do the nonspeaking role of Anne Boleyn provided she not be given billing in the ads for the movie.The story concerns Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine is brother's widow and his desire to marry Anne Boleyn so that she can give him an heir. Great pressure is put on More a wellrespected lawyer to support the King but More will not. He instead chooses to be silent on the matter even when the King pronounces himself the head of the Church of England. If More speaks out he will be charged with treason by keeping silent the King has no case against him. Nevertheless a number of people work on More from all angles to get him to sign an oath to the King but he will not. Finally the King's cohorts realize that perjury is the only avenue left open to them in order to secure a charge of treason against More and have him executed.Really there's not much to be said about this profound film about a man who to the death had a commitment to his beliefs and never faltered. Paul Scofield is not as famous to vast audiences as Sir Laurence Olivier Richard Burton Sir Anthony Hopkins and a whole host of excellent British actors who have made contributions to film. Scofield has made 30 movies each chosen by him carefully. If he cared about money he could gone slumming as a few of his counterparts did with his magnificent voice and imposing presence he could have done a Grey Poupon or a Polaroid commercial. But as a true artist and not an actor looking for production money money to support a theater or like Burton unable to recover from an impoverished childhood his film work is not geared toward superstardom or prolific work. In every role he plays from the obsessed Nazi in The Train to van Doren Sr. in Quiz Show he is magnificent.But Sir Thomas More is his greatest role. It was turned down by Richard Burton who would have been excellent but perhaps given us a more showy performance. Scofield's Sir Thomas More is a man humble before God his true leader. He believes that no man is above the law and that no man is above God. He is an unusual person in this world  he stands up for what he believes in no matter the cost. We seem to love these characters in films and books  More Atticus Finch Terry Malloy and yet in the world outside of film there are fewer and fewer exhibitions of such character.The rest of the cast is uniformly great including Orson Welles as Cardinal Wolsey Leo McKern so beloved as Rumpole of the Bailey is here the horrid Thomas Cromwell who will stop at nothing to make More bend his way John Hurt as the slimy Richard Rich Wendy Hiller as More's suffering wife and Susannah York as his beloved daughter Margaret.It's sometimes forgotten that Henry VIII was once a young athletic and very attractive man  I was reminded of it just last summer when I saw an absolute hunk play the young Henry. The arrogant flirtatious handsome man playing Henry in A Man for All Seasons looked familiar but I couldn't place him. Having only seen the Robert Shaw of The Sting and Jaws it was hard to believe that he had ever looked or sounded the way he did in this film. He gives a marvelous fiery performance.The cinematography and scenery in this film is stunning and there are many outside scenes  the sunlight in Thomas More's eyes as the King comes into view the hustle and bustle of the town the darkness of More's cell juxtaposed with the bright outdoors  all important parts of the story.The last half hour is hard to take for the viewer but it is some of the most beautiful work ever in film. More's final moments are magnificent and to be treasured.A mustsee for the story of a great man and for one of the top performances of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite quote from this film is the following exchange between Sir Thomas More Lord Chancellor of England the rough equivalent of today's Attorney General in the US and his soninlaw to be Will Roper. ROPER So now you give the Devil the benefit of law! MORE Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ROPER Yes I'd cut down every law in England to do that! MORE Oh? And when the last law was down and the Devil turned 'round on you where would you hide Roper the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast Man's laws not God's! And if you cut them down and you're just the man to do it do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes I'd give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety's sake! This has been quoted widely in the blogosphere to describe the behavior of the current administration and the war on terror. Would the zealots among us cut down every law in the US to get at terror? I fear the counsel we would be given by this administration would be rather different from Sir Thomas' advice to his daughter's suitor. But more instructive advice comes to us from one of its villains Cromwell. We are just the administrators Cromwell tells Richard Rich who is meeting with him secretly desperately seeking a job. Cromwell enthralls young Rich telling him that if the King wants to divorce his woman and marry another it is up to the administrators to make it happen. Slowly inevitably Cromwell seduces Rich to betray Sir Thomas More from whom Rich once received a gift. No matter what the King wants Cromwell will make it legal. This sounds too familiar. Who could it remind us of today? No wonder people yearn for the quiet moral rectitude of Sir Thomas More. Rich is played by a young handsome John Hurt Cromwell by the durable actor who played The Common Man in the play Leo McKern. Scofield as More brings admirable restraint to More's uncompromising loyalty to his principles of faith. The contrast to today's champions of people of faith is most instructive. It is about Rich who More knows is about to betray him that More has the following dialog with Roper. MORE There's no law against that. ROPER There is! There's God's law. MORE Then let God arrest him. More was incorruptible. He would not invoke God's law over the humanmade law he had sworn to uphold as Lord Chancellor even to save his own neck.Rich goes on to betray More by misleading the court at More's trial for treason a charge brought by Cromwell because More would not bless the King's marriage to Anne Boleyn. Like someone we know who went to Africa and came back with the wrong intelligence More has to be gotten out of the way discredited or killed. Rich is just the man for the job. And his reward he is made chief solicitor of Wales a job for which he is too young and clearly not yet qualified.When this film was released in 1966 the intelligence being cooked so the President could have his way was about Vietnam. Today you know the story.More was eventually elevated to Sainthood. He is the patron saint of lawyers and politicians. The certainly seem to need a patron saint.".

	schema:headline " A Film for All Seasons";
	schema:reviewBody "To celebrate my 800th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. Fred Zinnemann is one of my favourite directors for three reasons. Firstly he made High Noon my alltime favourite Western. Secondly he made From Here to Eternity another great film of the early fifties. Thirdly he made A Man for All Seasons which must be the greatest ever film about British history. The screenplay was adapted by Robert Bolt from his play of the same name and tells the story of Sir Thomas More the 16thcentury writer scholar lawyer philosopher and theologian who became Lord Chancellor of England and a confidant of Henry VIII. More however resigned his office because he disagreed with the King over his divorce from Catherine of Aragon and his break with Rome disagreements which were to lead to More's execution after conviction on false charges of treason. Today More is regarded as a saint not only by the Catholic Church but also remarkably by the Anglican Church. When I first saw the film as a teenager I had little knowledge of the historical background but today I am well aware that the Catholic church had throughout history used charges of heresy to silence and persecute those who disagreed with its teachings often over minor points of doctrine and that as Lord Chancellor More had played a part in the persecution of Lutherans. Henry at this time was still regarded as a loyal son of the Church. These matters are not mentioned in the film and some have seen Bolt as dishonest for praising More's courage while ignoring the sufferings of his equally courageous religious opponents. Does this matter? In my view it does not. Bolt was not a Catholic but an agnostic and wrote his play not to make propaganda for one religion against another but because he saw More as a man of conscience and integrity who remained true to his principles even under threat of death. The title is borrowed from a description by a contemporary of More but it also reflects Bolt's view of More as a man for all time. For the film Bolt abandoned some of the Brechtian devices used in the play clearly feeling that these would not work in the cinema. In particular there is no Common Man the character who acts as the narrator in the play. The film does however retain something of the character of a play with the story presented in a formal stylised way. Unusually for a film derived from a stage play it is very visually attractive with memorable scenes such as that opening boat ride down the Thames against a backdrop of the setting sun. The sets and costumes are very good and combine with Georges Delerue's excellent musical score to give a vivid sense of Tudor life. The main reason why I love this film is the quality of the acting. Zinnemann was an American and there was an obvious temptation to have More played by a major Hollywood star such as Charlton Heston who greatly admired Bolt's play and had campaigned to get the role. Heston was eventually to produce and star in his own version more than twenty years later. Zinnemann however resisted this temptation and insisted on using Paul Scofield who had created the role on stage even though the producers would have preferred a betterknown name like Richard Burton or Laurence Olivier. Zinnemann was absolutely right because Scofield gives a towering performance which rightly won him a Best Actor Oscar brilliantly demonstrating not only his character's moral integrity but also such other qualities as wisdom humour powers of intellect and love for his family. Apart from Orson Welles all the supporting cast were British. Although Leo McKern was born in Australia he spent most of his career in Britain. All were excellent there is not a single poor performance. Those I would single out for special mention areRobert Shaw as King Henry. Shaw plays the King as an outwardly jovial character whose air of bluff good fellowship conceals a hot temper and an intolerance of any opposition to his wishes. This was a much more convincing portrayal of England's most notorious monarch than Eric Bana's in the recent The Other Boleyn Girl. John Hurt as Richard Rich a young friend of More who treacherously betrays him in the interests of selfadvancement. More has refused to find Rich a position at Court fearing that he lacks the strength of character to resist the temptations he will find there. This was Hurt's first major role and helped establish him as a promising newcomer. Welles in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey played as the supreme politician who realises too late that realpolitik is not enough. Wendy Hiller as More's loyal wife Alice who continues to love him and stand beside him even if she cannot always understand his motivation. McKern as Thomas Cromwell a cynical unscrupulous man on the make who acts as the bullying prosecutor at More's trial. Corin Redgrave as More's fiery soninlaw William Roper who perhaps reflects Redgrave's own personality. He was a passionately committed Marxist. Redgrave's sister Vanessa appears briefly as Anne Boleyn. Nigel Davenport as the Duke of Norfolk another friend of More. Unlike Rich Norfolk is not portrayed as a villain but a basically decent if intellectually undistinguished man who does his best to protect his friend.  Besides Scofield's Best Picture the film also won awards for Best Picture and Best Director for Zinnemann. Certainly the Academy have at times honoured some unworthy titles but this is not one of them. Few films have deserved Best Picture more. It remains as relevant today as it ever was a film for all seasons. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the ancient world epic died its death during the 1960s period pictures were still popular and prevalent. In particular this era saw a little fad of features set in medieval England. They differed from their more ostentatious forebears not just in setting but in a realistic and intimate approach that went with the new generation of filmmaking. A Man for All Seasons represents the subgenre at its peak.A Man for All Seasons is derived from a play by Robert Bolt a name most familiar from the screenplays for David Lean's epics. It stands as one of his best works. He has these brilliantly succinct and engaging ways of introducing characters. When we first meet Thomas More he has that exchange with his servant Matthew where he implies his knowledge that Matthew has sneaked a peak at the letter. It shows More's intelligence but also his maturity and in a way that also endears him to us. Similarly the little moment when the king first appears and he jumps in the mud there is an awkward silence as his lackeys are unsure how to react then they all laugh when the king laughs. It tells us everything we need to know about the king's character and by extension the state of politics in the country at the time. All the way through characters are fully rounded and familiar yet never clichd. One of Bolt's biggest weaknesses in the Lean screenplays was an inability to write strong female characters The part of Alice More is an exception to this.The director is Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann has not exactly a documentary style as some have stated but certainly a penchant for naturalism frequently staging little acts that make logical sense without ever delving into the banality of protracted realism. For example in the opening scene we see Leo McKern giving the paper a little shake to dry the ink  you wouldn't see anything so everyday in a 50s historical picture. A few shots later and we see the messenger momentarily lose his balance as he leaps out of the boat. This aspect of normality when coupled with the impressively authentic sets and costumes seems to bring us incredibly close to the era depicted. Zinnemann's camera is wonderfully calm and meditative with Spartan shot compositions that show us only what we need at any given moment. Every reaction shot has some meaning and I'm not just talking about the closeups. Sometimes they are further back yet still noticeable for a more subtle touch. I'm thinking for example of John Hurt's reaction when he hears that the cup he sold for fifty shillings was worth a hundred. Zinnemann's montages of carvings and monuments give context to the scenes that precede them without being too contrived in their symbolism.

What's more both the political and even the religious arguments against it seem fairly sensible. To my mind it somewhat blunts the presentation of More as a man of logic and shrewdness.

Purely as a piece of filmmaking this comes pretty damn close to perfect.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although the ancient world epic died its death during the 1960s period pictures were still popular and prevalent. In particular this era saw a little fad of features set in medieval England. They differed from their more ostentatious forebears not just in setting but in a realistic and intimate approach that went with the new generation of filmmaking. A Man for All Seasons represents the subgenre at its peak.A Man for All Seasons is derived from a play by Robert Bolt a name most familiar from the screenplays for David Lean's epics. It stands as one of his best works. He has these brilliantly succinct and engaging ways of introducing characters. When we first meet Thomas More he has that exchange with his servant Matthew where he implies his knowledge that Matthew has sneaked a peak at the letter. It shows More's intelligence but also his maturity and in a way that also endears him to us. Similarly the little moment when the king first appears and he jumps in the mud there is an awkward silence as his lackeys are unsure how to react then they all laugh when the king laughs. It tells us everything we need to know about the king's character and by extension the state of politics in the country at the time. All the way through characters are fully rounded and familiar yet never clichd. One of Bolt's biggest weaknesses in the Lean screenplays was an inability to write strong female characters The part of Alice More is an exception to this.The director is Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann has not exactly a documentary style as some have stated but certainly a penchant for naturalism frequently staging little acts that make logical sense without ever delving into the banality of protracted realism. For example in the opening scene we see Leo McKern giving the paper a little shake to dry the ink  you wouldn't see anything so everyday in a 50s historical picture. A few shots later and we see the messenger momentarily lose his balance as he leaps out of the boat. This aspect of normality when coupled with the impressively authentic sets and costumes seems to bring us incredibly close to the era depicted. Zinnemann's camera is wonderfully calm and meditative with Spartan shot compositions that show us only what we need at any given moment. Every reaction shot has some meaning and I'm not just talking about the closeups. Sometimes they are further back yet still noticeable for a more subtle touch. I'm thinking for example of John Hurt's reaction when he hears that the cup he sold for fifty shillings was worth a hundred. Zinnemann's montages of carvings and monuments give context to the scenes that precede them without being too contrived in their symbolism. The shot of fluttering leaves and the sound of bird song that open the final scene create a really beautiful moment a hint of undaunted nature carrying on regardless.And then of course there is the magnificent cast making all this work. Paul Schofield gives a nicely subdued performance showing us not only More's calm demeanour but also a man smothering his true thoughts smothering even his emotions allowing them to break through to the surface just a little in the last few scenes and even then doing so with breathtaking control.

	schema:reviewBody "Zinnemann's adaptation of the Robert Bolt play remains an all time masterpiece. He tells a quiet story of faith courage and steadfastness that is so missing today. It portrays the life and death of Sir Thomas More a prominent member of the court of English King Henry VIII. Grounded in historical fact this movie vividly tells the story of More's stand against the king's betrayal of the law of God. When the Catholic King Henry VIII sought to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon so he could instead marry Anne Boleyn his will was opposed by the Roman papacy as being repugnant to the clear teachings of scripture. Rather than submit Henry chose to rebel by having Parliament pass a law to establish the Church of England and declare Henry the head of it. In order to legitimise his claim to this new title however Henry needed the support of his members of state not the least of which was Thomas More.In a brilliant performance Paul Scofield depicts Thomas in his steadfast assertion of integrity and conscience toward the law of God. His chief accusers are repeatedly confounded at Thomas' evasion of their clever snares and manipulations designed at first to gain More's cooperation but later to get him to incriminate himself.Films such as this are rare today 'A Man for All Seasons' turns not on action sequences battles past or present or on a love affair. It is neither a comedy nor a tragedy in the classic sense. In a word it would seem to have little to recommend it  however it is one of the best film ever produced. The director Fred Zimmermann resisted the urge to provide orchestral music as a background to many of the scenes indeed through much of the film there is no music at all as the drama itself carries the weight of the narrative and atmosphere. The cinematographer Ted Moore as well as the director received Academy Awards for their work.This is an actor's film the force of the drama being driven by their performances. Exceptional acting by John Hurt Leo McKern Nigel Davenport and Robert Shaw enhance lead actor Paul Scofield's Oscarwinning portrayal. Robert Shaw's Henry VIII presents the mood swings and apparent callousness toward human values reflecting the common judgement of his reign in traditional history. Shaw displays a fine villain but can touch only lightly the complexity of Henry's position in Reformation England. Bolt's screenplay denies Shaw the scope he might have used in depicting Henry's burdens.Hurt and McKern portray Richard Rich and Thomas Cromwell schemers and social climbers of which royal courts were always full. The roles of More's wife Alice Wendy Hiller and daughter Meg Susannah York are admirably played. Alice as the illiterate yet intelligent wife of More is concerned for the family's wellbeing Meg as the educated daughter More's experimental school practised generations ahead of its time gender equality in education almost steals the scene from Shaw at one point.The message is unmistakable  that in an age of moral and ethical relativism sometimes one must gamble all even one's life to cling to integrity  and ultimately one's own soul. This parable is sorely needed in our own day.".

	schema:headline " The most highly anticipated supernatural horror film of my life!";
	schema:reviewBody "Constantine 2005 in my opinion is an underrated Comic Book Film and one of my favorite anticipated supernatural horror flicks of my life. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz reunite in this flick after 9.years later when they both made together Chain Reaction 1996 one of my favorite scifi action flick. Anyway beside End of Days 1999 with Schwarzenegger in the starring role Constantine is the only supernatural horror film that I know and like. After just watching this film I must say is a far way million times better than overrated The Exorcist 1973 that everyone highly praises that film. I love this movie to death and it is my fifth favorite best Keanu Reeves movie. John Constantine is iconic character that I think that Keanu Reeves did impressive acting performance including way better job than he did in movies he is doing this days.I love this film. It has nice thoroughly believable action for this sort of supernatural fare and attractive leads in the shape of Keanu  Rachel supported by Tilda Swinton as god's righthand Gabriel reprising her Orlando persona. It looks great too and does the merging of separate worlds Earth and Hell very well. Keanu plays an embittered exorcist with a 30 a day habit and some caustic barbs for anyone he runs into. Rachel Weisz enters as a cop with some private history of her own connected with the occult world and soon the two of them are drawn towards apocalypse  hell on earth. It's a throughly enjoyable purchase if you like the big theme Good Vs Evil with the usual blurring devils angels and shotguns firing holy shot. The CGI is also up to scratch which isn't something you can always say on films being made even in 2008. Very very enjoyable so long as you appreciate the subject matter and don't expect massive gunbattles stop frame kungfu bullet time etc. An absolutely superb film. Keanu Reeves plays his role perfectly to his characters identity. Interesting throughout I was gripped to this film from start to finish. One of the best comic adaptations without a doubt.This is the type of comic book movie that I like to see R rated good action scenes badass main character and in Constantine case he sure is one considering that Devil himself will come to collect his soul actors who actually do their job right good direction good score no unnecessary bullshit subplots that are not needed and only extend the running time great cinematography and visuals and some decent practical effects. CGI maybe doesn't hold up but I personally don't have any problems with it in this case. My only problems with the film are again all the hate that it gets. I still don't get the hate for this film I love the storyline  the action and the twists. Specially this is Keanu Reeves I see in here. 10.years ago he was a promise actor now he is a sold out washed up actor who just doesn't care about his fans any more. He keeps wearing long hair and he has a beard  he can't act anymore. Watch Knock Knock 20015 and you will see what I am talking about.Constantine tells the story of John Constantine Keanu Reeves a man who has literally been to hell and back. When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson Rachel Weisz to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.That's the basic plot. It is more apocalyptic movie that means end of the world. Gabriel Tilda Swinton the archangel believes that by bringing Hell to Earth humans can become worthy of Gods love through repentance and faith. The movie has everything ghosts demons arch angels it even has Lucifer Peter Stormare in it. Rachel Weisz did a perfect outstanding job as female lead in this movie. I seriously love her performance and I love Keanu Reeves. Shia LaBeouf also did a perfect job as Chas Kramer Constantine's friend and helper I feel sad that he had to die by the end of the movie and his character was killed off.Overall I am giving this movie 1010 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it by critics or fans. The movie was fun and I have enjoy it!".

It's a throughly enjoyable purchase if you like the big theme Good Vs Evil with the usual blurring devils angels and shotguns firing holy shot. The CGI is also up to scratch which isn't something you can always say on films being made even in 2008. Very very enjoyable so long as you appreciate the subject matter and don't expect massive gunbattles stop frame kungfu bullet time etc. An absolutely superb film. Keanu Reeves plays his role perfectly to his characters identity. Interesting throughout I was gripped to this film from start to finish. One of the best comic adaptations without a doubt.This is the type of comic book movie that I like to see R rated good action scenes badass main character and in Constantine case he sure is one considering that Devil himself will come to collect his soul actors who actually do their job right good direction good score no unnecessary bullshit subplots that are not needed and only extend the running time great cinematography and visuals and some decent practical effects. CGI maybe doesn't hold up but I personally don't have any problems with it in this case. My only problems with the film are again all the hate that it gets. I still don't get the hate for this film I love the storyline  the action and the twists. Specially this is Keanu Reeves I see in here. 10.years ago he was a promise actor now he is a sold out washed up actor who just doesn't care about his fans any more. He keeps wearing long hair and he has a beard  he can't act anymore. Watch Knock Knock 20015 and you will see what I am talking about.Constantine tells the story of John Constantine Keanu Reeves a man who has literally been to hell and back. When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson Rachel Weisz to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.That's the basic plot. It is more apocalyptic movie that means end of the world. Gabriel Tilda Swinton the archangel believes that by bringing Hell to Earth humans can become worthy of Gods love through repentance and faith. The movie has everything ghosts demons arch angels it even has Lucifer Peter Stormare in it. Rachel Weisz did a perfect outstanding job as female lead in this movie. I seriously love her performance and I love Keanu Reeves. Shia LaBeouf also did a perfect job as Chas Kramer Constantine's friend and helper I feel sad that he had to die by the end of the movie and his character was killed off.Overall I am giving this movie 1010 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it by critics or fans. The movie was fun and I have enjoy it!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was really great in my opinion. If you like the horrorscifi genre then this is definitely for you. The effects are great and the makeup is exceptional as well. Keanu and Rachel really compliment each other in the roles they are in. I wouldn't expect something phenomenal but this genre of movies is rarely gifted with such a insightfully plotted movie such as Constantine.The character build is great and the background of the characters isn't completely clouded which is awesome there's no feeling of confusion when it comes to whats going on. It seems in some scenes the director was going for a certain emotion which made it feel awkward but the action and reactions are nice. Keanu really came across as tough doomed and uncaring while Rachel came across as determined and brave. There is no reason to not give this movie a chance if it seems like something you would like i recommend seeing it. The concepts and setups aren't something of the usual nature so its a welcomed change of pace. I don't rate this 1010 because is was astounding and mind shattering a movie of the century I rate it 1010 because it was enjoyable and i have watched it many times without feeling tired of it. The score and soundtrack are great as well providing some depth into certain scenes. The contrast and colors are good although looking a little too dark in some scenes. The movie takes you to many places so there is no feeling that you are in one place sometimes I feel that movies that take place in the same space create a feeling of urgency not so in Constantine. Some enjoyable aspects is the historical tie ins and use of terminology. All in all this is an exceptional movie it moves from scene to scene with little dragging in one spot and has a great ending.".

Keanu Reeves plays a very cool Constantine who is a modernday exorcist but most certainly not to be confused with a priest as he has his issues and a burden of sins from his past that he carries with him. Constantine is a very realistic and human hero who is devoid of superpowers but has all the cool gadgets and the kickass attitude needed to survive in a world slowly being invaded by demons and scheming angels. He meets Angela Rachel Wiesz after she loses her sister Isabel to the forces of evil. She comes to Constantine in search of an answer on where Isabel has ended up following her apparent suicide. Constantine journeys to other realmsdimensions in an attempt to get those answers even paying a couple of visits to hell. Needless to say with such a plot the special effects acting sets script and even wardrobe have to be carefully conceived and executed to make it believable and they are... in spades.Constantine achieves what all great movies always do it takes you into another world that makes you forget everything about your own world the whole time you are watching it.

	schema:reviewBody "My first sortof mistake was going to see Constantine at 1130 A.M. this would have been a much better experience in a nighttime atmosphere I feel. In fact I'm thinking about going again this weekend at night.That being said I still enjoyed this movie immensely. For starters I actually thought Keanu was quite good in the role and it didn't take long to forget drawing comparisons to Neo. I haven't read the comics but I thought Keanu did a great job with the role... I laughed and winced right along with him not at him! All the supporting actors yes Shia LeBeouf included were great and my only issue is that they didn't get enough screen time to explore their characters further. Djimon Hounsou was especially cool as Papa Midnite... with a name like that how can you not be?! Finally Rachel Weisz deserves the better than the movie comments she's been getting in reviews. Yes she is that good and she's pretty foreign to genre work but should definitely do more! I can't believe I'd only seen her in About a Boy before this her magnetism had almost got me to pick up Confidence and Runaway Jury at the video store which I have not. Yet. For one she does a damn good American accent  I had forgotten that she's British. I'm sure many other reviewers will put this in better words than me but she really adds a whole new level to this movie. Her performance is easily the most daring and heartfelt of the bunch and I'd even go as far to call it subtly exquisite... a phrase I don't hesitate to equate with the actress herself. If Rachel Weisz had not been a part of Constantine I wouldn't have liked it half as much as I did. Even if you're not a Keanu or genre fan I'd still check this movie out if you like yours truly  have a thing for gorgeous talented undertheradar actresses.Onto special effects. Pretty darn impressive if you ask me. NEXT! I'm definitely very tempted to check out the Hellblazer comics because I really love the mythology and style of the Constantine universe. I mean Hell as a parallel dimension to our own world? How cool is that? Certainly less banal than most movie versions of Hell. The story is based around Catholicism and it's just how I like my organized religion  all twisted! All in all Constantine was made up of a lot of things that I really love in my movies detailed fantasy universe fun characters good effects and action and of course the vulnerablebutbutt kicking woman. Yay! The major problem with the film I feel was bringing all of its elements together. Throughout the film I kept thinking to myself what I would've done differently. There was so much crammed into it that every single character and plot point felt underused and ignored  not one thing was explored deeply enough for my satisfaction. They should have chosen just a few elements of this complex universe and story arc for this movie and left the other stuff for subsequent Hellblazer flicks which I hope there will be!.So basically the parts here are very interesting and cool and worth a looksee but the whole just can't service all of them. Which is a damn shame. I left the theatre wanting MORE wanting to know more about the characters and what living in their universe was like. MORE darnit!! While Constantine is fun and nice in its own right I would've really liked to see it expanded to its potential. Oh well! At least there's the fantastic Rachel Weisz so I can't complain further  Last words I want to see it again! Maybe not buy the DVD but definitely rent it. Oh and those rumors about an extra albeit short scene after the credits are true so STAY through them!".

	onyx:emotionText "My first sortof mistake was going to see Constantine at 1130 A.M. this would have been a much better experience in a nighttime atmosphere I feel. In fact I'm thinking about going again this weekend at night.That being said I still enjoyed this movie immensely. For starters I actually thought Keanu was quite good in the role and it didn't take long to forget drawing comparisons to Neo. I haven't read the comics but I thought Keanu did a great job with the role... I laughed and winced right along with him not at him! All the supporting actors yes Shia LeBeouf included were great and my only issue is that they didn't get enough screen time to explore their characters further. Djimon Hounsou was especially cool as Papa Midnite... with a name like that how can you not be?! Finally Rachel Weisz deserves the better than the movie comments she's been getting in reviews. Yes she is that good and she's pretty foreign to genre work but should definitely do more! I can't believe I'd only seen her in About a Boy before this her magnetism had almost got me to pick up Confidence and Runaway Jury at the video store which I have not. Yet. For one she does a damn good American accent  I had forgotten that she's British. I'm sure many other reviewers will put this in better words than me but she really adds a whole new level to this movie. Her performance is easily the most daring and heartfelt of the bunch and I'd even go as far to call it subtly exquisite... a phrase I don't hesitate to equate with the actress herself. If Rachel Weisz had not been a part of Constantine I wouldn't have liked it half as much as I did. Even if you're not a Keanu or genre fan I'd still check this movie out if you like yours truly  have a thing for gorgeous talented undertheradar actresses.Onto special effects. Pretty darn impressive if you ask me. NEXT! I'm definitely very tempted to check out the Hellblazer comics because I really love the mythology and style of the Constantine universe. I mean Hell as a parallel dimension to our own world? How cool is that? Certainly less banal than most movie versions of Hell. The story is based around Catholicism and it's just how I like my organized religion  all twisted! All in all Constantine was made up of a lot of things that I really love in my movies detailed fantasy universe fun characters good effects and action and of course the vulnerablebutbutt kicking woman.

The plot is a little hard to follow especially if you don't listen and watch carefully for the clues. It centers around John Constantine Reeves who helps save the world from demons. He's not the usual sort of superhero because he is very reluctant to fit into that kind of role. The supporting actors are very well cast and Rachel Weisz deserves all the praise she gets for her part. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel portrays the angel perfectly as not quite male or female. The film presents interesting views about heaven hell and death it's very thoughtprovoking. In a way Constantine reminded me of IRobot because it has a male lead who meets a female lead and also has LaBeouf as sidekick again. But other than that this was a good film and I think I will buy or rent it on DVD when it comes out. Here's a tip wait until the credits ends there is an extra scene!".

Sure it had some flaws and the story kind of dragged on but the effects were very good and the acting which is pretty amazing didn't suck. Keanu wasn't as bad as he usually is and Rachel Weisz does a very good job with what I think is a well written part. The must annoying actor in the film is in my opinion not Keanu but Tilda Swinton. The actor who I felt brought most passion and enthusiasm to his role was Peter Stormare who obviously enjoyed playing Satan and the scenes with him are admittedly some of the most interesting in the film and even though he is only on screen for something like 5  10 minutes he should almost be credited as a main character thats how good he is.Now story wise the film had some issues but they weren't as serious as many people claim they are. As I stated previously the film does drag a little and it does take a long time for the film to actually reveal its point but its the little things that are really interesting. The exorcism scene is very well done and the effects are generally very well made. Effects doesn't make a film however and in spite of the issues the film actually succeeds in telling the story it wants to and the ending is indeed a climax.I haven't read the comics so I didn't really have any expectations when I saw the film. I have heard that the avid fans of the comic books complained that Keanu Reeves doesn't fit the role. That might be true but to me he really didn't seem that bad. He still has a very clear well defined body language which I feel makes up for his monotonous voice at least to some degree. I went in to the cinema and saw the film with an open mind which is what I advise future viewers to do and not rely too heavily on what the critics say.All in all an excellent film 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Keanu Reeves plays the title character in this adaptation of the cult DCVertigo comic book called Hellblazer and while the movie does have its merits it's not very faithful to the source material that it came from. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a gumshoe whose specialty is in dealing with the occult. He specialty draws the attention of a police detective played by Rachel Weisz who asks for his help in her investigation of her twin sister's suicide. A suicide that she thinks that is more than it appears to be. In due time they both will encounter what lies under the surface of their world which is inhabited by both the angels of heaven and the demons of the underworld who are both fighting their own war for the fate of mankind. The movie is shot beautifully in the way it tries to capture both of the landscapes of good and evil that lives in this film's setting and the special effects does the film justice in its interpretation of hell that looks like an apocalyptic version of downtown Los Angeles which is the setting of this film by the way. Unfortunately the script is so unfocused that it hurts what this film trying to accomplish and the dialog itself lacks conviction for the material itself. The climax of the film is a major letdown because it just takes all the serious aspects of the film and just tosses them out in favor of a brief Matrix like a gunfight that undercuts the movie's tone and an incoherent ending that leaves more questions than answers. I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and he does his role well but his performance lacked something here in this film and it felt more phone in than genuine. Rachel Weisz on the other hand delivers a strong and moving performance that does deliver the goods but you will end up thinking that she is giving more to the film that it deserves because her performance is way too good for this movie. She's so good in fact that if the people who made this film wanted to make a faithful adaptation of the Hellblazer comic book they could have cast her in the role of Kitt Constantine's one true love. Now being a casual reader of the comic of whom this film is based on the character of John Constantine is not well represented in this film and the script makes him look like a shill who wants to redemption which is the polar opposite of who the character is in the comic book who only served himself. The character also had a slick side to him that gave you the impression that he knew more than he let on while the character in the movie is flying by the seat of his pants during the whole film. Plus he relied on his wits to defeat his enemies while the character in the movie has a gadget man who makes him weapons The brass knuckles scene in the movie is a joke because the John Constantine of the comic book can't handle himself well in a fight. The cancer subplot in the film only serves as a footnote while in the comic book it had more of an impact and certain characters who show up in the film are just watered down versions of their comic counterparts. The most offensive of these characters is Chaz who is John Constantine's best friend and is a grown man with kids but he is reduced to a street kid who is basically a lap dog for Constantine to pick on. The only character in the film that closely resembles the comic book is Papa Midnight who's really more of an adversary in the comic than the friend he is in the movie. Judging this movie on it's own merits It's a passable popcorn movie that has a better than deserved performance by Rachel Weisz. Judging the movie as an adaptation of the comic book it's a letdown.".

I was a little disappointed with Gavin's role as Balthazar. His role could have been expanded a bit. But all in all eerie and definitely interesting. People who bash Keanu Reeves are more upset with the fact that he gets paid 30 million a picture even when the film isn't so great! But this one is great.

	schema:headline " The Kind Of Film They Make You Watch In Hell";
	schema:reviewBody "3905 As I sat staring at the screen watching Constantine come to an end I couldn't help but smile. Not because the film was just that brilliant but rather it was that big of a train wreck.This seems to be the time of year in which every studio agrees with one another to release their worst movies. So I've spent the first two months of 2005 catching up on some of the Oscar nominees and other good films I missed from 2004. I passed up an advanced screening of Robots to go see Constantine at the theater with some friends. Sadly this was probably the best choice out of everything playing at the theater with the exception of Million Dollar Baby.Before I go into more detail on my opinions let me preface by saying that I have never read the Hellblazer comic books that this movie was supposedly based on. This review is a critique on the acting directing screenplay etc of the movie and it likely doesn't apply to the comic.I'm not sure where to begin in recounting the plot of Constantine. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets. Rachel Weisz plays Angela Dodson a detective who wants answers as to why her twin sister committed suicide. Through Constantine she learns the truth about Heaven and Hell Demons and Angels live on Earth in alternate spacetime planes always trying to win our souls. There's also shots mixed in every now and then of a random Hispanic guy wandering around Mexico and California with a staff that makes him invincible. This has something to do with the story I think. Together they fight evil in a world where nothing ever makes any sense and where Satan is a good guy who would never want to upset the balance of good and evil. It all comes tightly wrapped up with clich after clich and dialog so cheesy you will laugh out loud and every now and then it transforms into The Matrix.Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves. We all know him and we're all familiar with the standard roles he is cast in. This one is no different. He takes an unlikeable character and makes him even worse by being as dull and unemotional as possible. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel is just plain awkward and the only somewhat redeeming bit of acting in this film is Rachel Weisz who really isn't half bad.This was Francis Lawrence's first try at directing a movie and you'll know when you watch it. The root word in 'director' of course is 'direction' which was something this movie had none of. It was really no different than watching one of Lawrence's Britney Spears or Will Smith videos just a bunch of random images thrown together. Characters came and went with no explanation of their relevance to the film and there was no flow at all.Visually they got some things right. But how hard is that in these days when the right amount of money can make any effect you want? The depictions of Hell Heaven Demons and Angels were good and I suppose the Matrix style stuff was done well even if it was unnecessary.Overall Constantine had a good concept. Appeal to those who want intelligence in a movie with religious theories and random babble. Appeal to those who want mindless action and dazzling effects by giving them just that. But in the end there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention and the depth the film supposedly had never showed up. It will have you trying hard to figure it all out but I'm not so sure even the film's creators ever figured it out. There are certainly many movie out now that you could go see that would be much worse than Constantine but much of this film was nothing short of a disaster.C 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine a PI who dabbles in the supernatural. He does routine exorcisms and fights demons that try to enter our world. His reputation draws the attention of detective Angela Dodson who is played by Rachel Weisz. She needs his help to solve the apparent suicide of her twin sister Isabell who jump to her death while she was locked up in a mental hospital. Angela does not believe her sister would commit such an act because of their religious upbringing and thinks that there is something more going on than it seems. So like the rabbit from Alice in wonderland. Reeves takes the Detective on a wild ride though his seedy world. Which involves a man made up of bugs demons that fly at you an annoying smart mouth street kid and angels with secrets of their own. Which in fact all leads to a climax that involves the devil himself and a battle for a lost soul. If you kind of recognize the story you would be right on the money. It's lifted from The Prophecy films which stared Christopher Walken. Only this time with a bigger budget and a better cast at its disposal. With out the great Christopher Walken himself of course but his character is in the film HINT HINT The acting is good particularly because it has a game cast willing to go with what ever is going on with the script. Unfortunately not everyone gives their best and it leaves the others to pick up the slack for them. Keanu Reeves is one of the actors who don't really give a hundred percent with his performance. Yes I know I'm talking about Keanu Reeves of all people but he's not his usual self in this movie. His character is basically a miserable human being during the course of the entire film and you don't understand on why would anyone even want to be bothered with him. Yes he's the lead and he is playing a kind of rouge heroic character but he does not even have a likable side to him. You end up wishing that your able to know the other characters more than you get to know him. One of those characters is The police Detective played by Rachel Weisz who not only bring a sense of steely determination and strong will to the role but also is a much better lead character than Keanu is. You actually care about her while you really don't care about Constantine or what is happen inside of him. The other interesting character in the film is Papa Midnight who is played by Djimon Hounsou a demon hunter like Constantine himself but with a lot more charm and personally. I would have rather seen more of him than Keanu Reeves as well but he's only in the film for about fifteen minutes. Chaz the street kid is just too annoying for words and is really only there to I will not spoiled that for you you have to see it to believe it. There is an Angel Demon called Balthazar who is actually a real hoot and does give the film a real presence of evil in it. The angel Gabriel is in it as well but if you have seen the Prophecy films you know what purpose heshe has Big hint Christopher Walken and the devil himself comes in the last ten minutes of the film to cause a little havoc for our heroes.The movie has it's up and downs in other aspects as well. The script in a sense does not know what it wants to be from time to time and the dialog is not really well done in some of the scenes in the film. The cinematography is very well done in portraying the grim aspects of the Los Angeles but it's too dark in some places and it seems to me that it was done that way in order to hide some of the special effects which are not too shabby but not as well done as one might have hoped.All in all a decent film saved by the game performances of Weisz Hounsou and the guy from Bush but you will get a sense of seeing this film before.".

I would have liked to have learn more about her character and her relationship with her sister which would have been a much better movie than this film was if they just could have based the film around her character instead of John Constantine. Djmon Hounsou who was so great in the film  In America only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film.

	schema:headline " Weisz and Hounsou do well with what they got but the film is a major letdown";
	schema:reviewBody "Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels. He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson Rachel Weisz who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. So they both embark on a investigation that includes half breed demons strait out of episodes of Buffy and Angel angels that look way too asexual for words and the devil himself who looks like he just got back from gambling trip in Atlantic City. Now if you think that I'm being a tad over the top in my plot summery think again. I'm actually being way too kind. Now it's very hard to start off with the good parts of the film with out addressing the very bad parts of it first and that's Keanu Reeves himself. I do think that he's a good actor with some promise but he's miscast in this role as a hardboiled and cynical private eye with supernatural connections and his sour face demeanor does not help him out with his character at all. There is a subplot that involves that his heath adds nothing to the overall story at all and his character borders between self important idiot to whiney bastard that cries to god when he does not get his way. His transformation into his Neo persona during the last act of the film takes away a lot from what the movie was supposed to be all about and just turns it into a sad parody of itself. The screenplay feels like a hack job in some places and some characters don't really serve a purpose at all other than to be killed off or to just be a part of the scenery. Some character don't really need to be in the movie at all like the character of Chaz played by Shia LaBeouf who really adds nothing to the movie other than to be a really bad side kick to our sour faced hero and the angel Gabriel who is played by Tilda Swinton who for starters is only in the film for about ten minutes and really adds nothing to it other than to have a really bad scene with John Constantine that will make you sit up and take notice on how bad this film really is and the last act where her character is a part of one of the most stupid plot revelations in recent movies it involves the devil who is dressed like a pool hall gambler from Atlantic City. I don't hold Tilda Swinton responsible for this she is a very good actress as much as I hold the screenwriters who wrote her role because we don't really know enough about her character to be surprise with the sudden turn around that she does in the last act of the film. The screenplay itself feels like it does not know what it wants to be from time to time switching it's tone from dark horror drama to dumb down action movie in the last fifteen minutes of the film and some of the dialog is so badly written that you are grinning your teeth to the bone when you hear it. While there are a lot of bad in this film there are some bright spots that make the film somewhat bearable to sit though. The best of these is the performance of Rachel Weisz which is literally holding this film together by a thin and dangling thread. She gives this movie something the script should have giving it and that something is called class. Her performance is gripping and soul searching and its what the film really should have been about if you had serious people behind scenes making it. Which is too bad because the movie would have worked much better as a standard supernatural thriller with just her character in it instead of the mind numbing mess that is presented to us here. Djmon Hounsou is great as well but he's not really in the movie much at all and his character is really just there for camp effect not substance. The special effects are cool for what they are and they do have a visual impact but not even that is strong enough to make you forget how cheesy the film is after it ends.".

	onyx:emotionText "Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels. He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson Rachel Weisz who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. So they both embark on a investigation that includes half breed demons strait out of episodes of Buffy and Angel angels that look way too asexual for words and the devil himself who looks like he just got back from gambling trip in Atlantic City. Now if you think that I'm being a tad over the top in my plot summery think again. I'm actually being way too kind. Now it's very hard to start off with the good parts of the film with out addressing the very bad parts of it first and that's Keanu Reeves himself. I do think that he's a good actor with some promise but he's miscast in this role as a hardboiled and cynical private eye with supernatural connections and his sour face demeanor does not help him out with his character at all. There is a subplot that involves that his heath adds nothing to the overall story at all and his character borders between self important idiot to whiney bastard that cries to god when he does not get his way. His transformation into his Neo persona during the last act of the film takes away a lot from what the movie was supposed to be all about and just turns it into a sad parody of itself. The screenplay feels like a hack job in some places and some characters don't really serve a purpose at all other than to be killed off or to just be a part of the scenery. Some character don't really need to be in the movie at all like the character of Chaz played by Shia LaBeouf who really adds nothing to the movie other than to be a really bad side kick to our sour faced hero and the angel Gabriel who is played by Tilda Swinton who for starters is only in the film for about ten minutes and really adds nothing to it other than to have a really bad scene with John Constantine that will make you sit up and take notice on how bad this film really is and the last act where her character is a part of one of the most stupid plot revelations in recent movies it involves the devil who is dressed like a pool hall gambler from Atlantic City. I don't hold Tilda Swinton responsible for this she is a very good actress as much as I hold the screenwriters who wrote her role because we don't really know enough about her character to be surprise with the sudden turn around that she does in the last act of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's masterpiece  one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time. It is 1978 classic this movie really started the zombie genre. It is been almost 40 years anniversary now since this movie come out. Night of the Living Dead was George A. Romero's first film that really introduced the zombie genre but this to me really started the zombie praise. This in my opinion is one of the best zombie movies of all time. It is my number 1 favorite zombie movie I love this movie to death and it is one of my personal favorite horror films of all time. This movie is based on a Zombie apocalypse this group find's them self's with this pilot who takes them with the helicopter in the air and they find a shopping mall. There is a perfect place to go in to a Zombie Apocalypse. So they go in to shopping mall and they have every single item in that shopping mall after disposal to use on the zombies. As you can tell it is a very fun movie but more important this movie inspires zombies. Without this movie there wouldn't have been The Walking Dead there wouldn't be 28 Days Later there wouldn't have been any of that. This movie is very important this days it was remade in 2004. It is a fun fun ride I enjoy this film it is entertaining horror flick. Back in the 1978 that come out it was more scary than it is today. This is where I give this movie the most credit just like... you have a great time watching people murdering zombies. This movie has a great action great story plot great effects the real zombies. It has gore blood you se heads been blowing off. George A. Romero's wrote and direct brilliantly this movie. Tom Savini creates a great special effects for the zombies. Great make up great blood squibs. The film is fast paced it is excellent brilliant. You see all those SWAT team sieging the building shooting the zombies and gunning the down violent gang. You see whole world comes to an end and people shooting zombies even kids are zombies in this movie. The group in the shopping mall has to deal not only with zombies and the disposing them they also have to deal with poachers who break in to their home and start stealing items and letting zombies in the mall. Tom Savini was one of the motorcycle poachers who was stealing items in the mall. Gaylen Ross was a fantastic babe as Francine news reporter. David Emge as Stephen the pilot was excellent. Ken Foree as Peter a SWAT team member was the best in this movie. Scott H. Reiniger as Roger another SWAT team member was good in his role. They don't make movies like this today anymore. It's a Rrated movie and it is a perfect 10. Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time I highly recommend this film to any horror fan.".

Many have criticised the film for being too over the top and questioned the quality of the acting.  This for me is one of the joys of the film Romero uses gaudy sets and effects and combines this with comic book hero dialogue to lull us into a false sense of security. Then masterfully Romero pulls the rug out from under us and brings the reality of the situation crashing in on our heads.Dawn stands alone well but really comes into its own as part of the trilogy to which it belongs.  One theory of mine is that the Alien trilogy forgetting the miserable fourth installment takes a lot from the dead trilogy namely the pace and claustrophobia of the two which bookend the mass hysteria and over the top horror and violence of the middle film.Undoubtedly one of the great Horror films of modern time. Or perhaps there is something about being the only people left alive and living in a shopping mall that appeals to the kid in all of us. 1010".

This film is a rare thing in that it will please both gorehounds and fans of art cinema and there isn't a vast amount of films that do that. Aside from doing what I've just mentioned this follow up to Night of the Living Dead established George Romero as a household name in many a gore fan's home and his trilogy of zombie films will ensure for ever more that the name 'Romero' and the zombie film will always go hand in hand. The plot of this film follows four survivors of the zombie apocalypse that has ensued after the events of Night of the Living Dead as they hold up in a shopping mall to try and hide from the events going on in the outside world. However this poses another problem as once their home has been built up in the midst of the atrocities will our hero's be able to give up all that they have built?The commentary on society and the trappings of consumerism that Romero appears to be keen to implement in his film come off as being somewhat muddled due to the fact that it's lost under the reality that what we see our hero's doing makes absolute perfect sense. This however is where the genius behind the commentary comes into play it's a depiction of what people within a consumerist society would do in this situation which makes the commentary all the more potent. Despite it being a film about zombies Romero implements a sense of realism into the proceedings which works due to the fact that he never overindulges in anything. Sure the gore towards the end is over the top but even that is realistic as it is what you would expect a zombie massacre to be. Because of his sense of realism we are able to care for the characters that Romero has presented us with even though we really know little about them. The audience is able to put themselves into their situation and we are constantly given the feeling that we are actually involved in the events on screen. This makes the ending of the movie more potent by way of the sense of security that Romero has lulled you into throughout the movie and at the end we really feel for what is happening to our characters and even though we want to see the massacre happen as that's why we're watching the film at the end of the day we sort of don't want to see it at the same time. This kind of mindgame isn't carried off successfully very often but Romero has it down to an art form here.The movie benefits massively from a great score by Dario Argento's house band Goblin. In fact with the obvious exception of Suspiria I would even go as far as to say that this is their best work ever. The score blends so well with the happenings on screen that it's impossible to have one without the other. Some films have a superfluous score or one that doesn't add anything to the film but it's undeniable that the score of Dawn of the Dead not only adds to what we're seeing but 'makes' it. As many people will be tuning in to see gore I am pleased to tell you that this film doesn't disappoint in that respect. It's one of the goriest films ever made with many sequences reaching a level of disgustingness that is rarely seen in cinema intestine dinner anyone?. As you are probably aware Tom Savini did the makeup effects for Dawn of the Dead and it is the film that made his career and established him as the gore guru that he is often seen as today. The film is also notable for a certain line that has been quoted more times than any other line uttered in any other horror movie. I am of course talking about the fabulous When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the Earth.Dawn of the Dead is undoubtedly one of the most important films ever made. It inspired a barrage of ripoff's that are still being made today and it stands tall on many a horror fan's list of favourite horror films. Dawn of the Dead is one of the most recent films to inspire a remake and unfortunately it turned out to be terrible. Not that it matters as the original is where it's at and this film is an undeniable masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review refers to the theatrical cut of the film. When George A. Romero's nobudget horror movie Night of the Living Dead hit screens in 1968 the same year that had already given audiences the all time genre classic Rosemary's Baby no one could have predicted the indelible effect it would have on the history of cinema. The film introduced audiences to a degree of graphic violence never before witnessed on American screens. However it was the film's intense omnipotent terror that forever scarred a generation of viewers. Although the film enjoyed unprecedented mainstream success for an independent production the filmmakers saw little of the movie's earnings. Romero's string of box office disappointments in the years to follow would diminish his clout in Hollywood and as such he found it was an uphill battle to fund his ambitious sequel to the film. Then along came Italian horror maestro Dario Argento hot off the heels of such international blockbusters as Deep Red and Suspiria. Argento helped secure funding for the film in exchange for the rights to personally oversee the international cut of the film. The collaboration would be a match made in horror movie heaven for the end product would be Dawn of the Dead one of the most acclaimed and enduringly popular horror movies of all time. Dawn of the Dead's plot is so effectively simple and now thoroughly familiar that it almost goes without description. While the world approaches a still unexplained and ever growing zombie apocalypse four individualstwo millitary men a helicopter pilot and his TV reporter girlfriendbarricade themselves in an abandoned suburban shopping mall. The mall provides fodder not only for the film's well known social commentary but also for some truly thrillingif not terrifyingsetpieces.With its graphic depictions of human evisceration exploding heads and gruesome flesh eating Dawn of the Dead may well be the goriest American film of all time. The film is actually so violent and gruesome that it was released unrated in the United States for fear of being slapped with an X Rating. That didn't stop the film from being a huge hit at home and abroad. The film earned rave reviews from critics most famously from Roger Ebert who called it one of the best horror movies of all time'. It instantly became recognized not only as a genre classic but also as one of the sharpest social satires of the decade with its often hilarious commentary on an ever growing consumer culture embodied by the film's mall location.Internationally the film was even bigger. The movie was released in a special 117 minute cut overseas the US theatrical version was 120 minutes which was edited by Dario Argento and featured a more prominent presentation of the soundtrack by rock band Goblin as well as a much faster overall pace. Released in most countries as Zombie Dawn of the Dead' or Zombies' it was so big in Italy that the following year Lucio Fulci previously a director of giallo' thrillers helmed a gory semisequel. His Zombie 2' released in the US as Zombie' would become one of the most popular drive in hits of the 1970s a massive international success that solidified the zombiecannibal craze of the early 1980s and sparked Lucio Fulci's own reign as a horror movie icon. Dawn of the Dead is a truly stunning example of the horror genre's ability to produce works that are as socially relevant as they are terrifying films which break free of the constraints of conventional horror movie elements and in doing so establish themselves as being truly timeless. While I would still give Night of the Living Dead the slight edge between the two Dawn of the Dead is still an extraordinary film in its own right as well as an almost superior sequel to another of the scariest movies ever made.".

The claustrophobia of the first film is replaced by a wider frame of reference including the media the military and suburbia although typically the move is once again towards the indoors.The film starts explosively inside a panicking TV station trying to report on the inexplicable emergence from the earth of the undead.

Not content with this level of confinement our heroes draw plans erect barriers shut down grids.  Romero pinpoints this national insularity by framing his modern horror movie as a transposed Western with the foursome as latterday frontiersmen wiping out the natives and erecting a new civilisation.Some might say that Romero's irony is a little heavy here  the mocktriumphal Western music on the soundtrack the composition of the four at the height of the crisis standing in front of a sign with just the letters 'U' and 'S' visible the glee in the gun culture including an ersatz Western gun store in the mall the 'Red River' like beseiging  of the mall by the 'Indian' Hells' Angels on their motorbikehorses complete with tomahawks.  But such irony is never stable  Romero keeps pulling the ground from under the viewers' feet both in terms of character identification and the shifting meanings embodied by the zombies.Romero's terrifying vision is of an America turned in on itself eating itself through cannibalistic greed the very system of capitalism based on a cycle of power and repression in which the repressed will never quite go away.  'Night' pulsated with a late 1960s urgency reflecting contemporary social and political upheaval white capitalist America beseiged by the peoples it had oppressed for centuries.  By 1978 that political anger is gone and America has reverted to being a race of consumer zombies congregating around massive shopping malls like they're the religious temples of the Incas trapped there not by the freedom of choice of capitalist propaganda but mindless instinct.the zombies are supposed to be the enemy the Other in conventional horror terms but the first thing the socalled heroes do on landing at the mall is substitute urgent survival for gleeful consumerism compare with the very similar silent fantasy 'Paris Qui Dort'.  There's no way to deal with any outside threat because we are numbed and bloated by products.  Reality ceases to exist there are some beautifully surreal scenes as our heroes make homes in showrooms.The mall sequence as a whole has a Bunuellian savagery about it and the film builds up an aggression like the characters until all is chaos  tones modes genres all colliding the 'reality' or 'integrity' or even 'seriousness' of the film as much in question as the modern world the protagonists live in where even time seems to stand still the weeks of the action compressed into the framework of a day with the night of the living dead giving onto the dawn.  It is probably allegorically significant which characters survive but by the end we're not sure whether we're watching a horror a comedy a thriller a Western or a very bitter joke.

	schema:reviewBody "There's not much use denying it George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is one of the chosen few absolute greatest horror films ever made and it's fairly unimaginable that a powerful movie like this will ever come out again. Even more than its 1968 predecessor the landmark known as Night of the Living Dead this film contains literally everything to satisfy even the most demanding fan of horror cinema. Some films attempt to reach a maximum level of high tension throughout some have eminent directors andor a professional cast some horrors will distinguish themselves from the rest by providing a lot of gore  gruesome makeup effects and others completely rely on uniquely atmospheric set pieces and filming locations. Dawn of the Dead consists of ALL these trademarks and yet a whole lot more! This film more or less begins where Night ended with an alarming increase of zombies that feast their way through America. The opening sequences masterfully capture the growing sense of mass hysteria and disbelief in a TVstudio where a 'scientist' warns the population not to regard these walking corpses as former family members or friends but as mere monsters on the constant lookout for human flesh to feed on. These scenes introduce Peter and Francine who plan to escape the big city in a helicopter. Cut to another very perplexing series of action sequences in which fellow policemen Stephen  Peter battle their way through a zombieinfested apartment building. Eventually these four characters flee together and entrench themselves in a large shopping mall complex. They can fairly easily handle the menace of the zombies here but the biggest danger comes from typical human greed and selfishness. It's downright amazing how Romero manages to present such an implausible topic like zombie mayhem in such a realistic and incredibly disturbing way. He already did that in Night of the Living Dead but Dawn is entirely different film all together since it contains a lot more humor and intelligently subtle societymockery. The gore is sensational and plentiful thank you Tom Savini! but the film never at one point drags in the tension or bad editing department. It's just in one word the perfect horror movie. There exist more than a dozen different versions of this film which are all worth seeing at least once if only to spot the differences. Particularly recommended are Romero's original director's cut duh!! and Argento's European cut. This latter cuts a little on the dialogues and humor but it features another brilliant soundtrack by Goblin! I could easily write another five pageessay about the genius of this movie but it would just constantly reconfirm that it's absolute mustsee! In case you haven't yet make Dawn of the Dead a priority and also make sure you've got the horrormunchies!".

In case you haven't yet make Dawn of the Dead a priority and also make sure you've got the horrormunchies!";

	schema:reviewBody "Dawn of the Dead George A. Romero's masterful classic is least of anything a film about zombies. Dawn of the Dead is thinly disguised as a zombie gore flick but it is really three things. 1. A cultural statement portraying racism angst counterculture and degradation. 2. An account of human bonding and human reaction to different environments harsh and eclectic. 3. Least of this trio it is a black comedy. Rather it contains dark comedic elements. Somewhere early along in the film I looked past the initial plot of four strangers hiding in a mall from hordes of zombies swarming the world as the government attempts to find a solution to the chaotic massacres. Peter Washington Ken Foree is the strong black courageous SWAT team member who rises above the other three protagonists to become their leader. Steven Andrews David Emge is the  somewhat timid and hesitant traffic reporter lover of the pregnant Francine Gaylen Ross. Ostensibly hapless and useless Francine is actually a valuable aide to the quartet. Last is the resourceful and daring Roger Scott H. Reiniger.From where I left off I overlooked the premise of the quartet defending themselves from hordes of flesheating monsters and instead saw thoroughly fleshed out character personalities bonds and interactions. Throughout the movie's length we learn to genuinely love these guys Roger is so smooth and fun easily likeable Peter is quiet warmspirited and reliable Steven and Francine are charming. We knows them like our friends and heroes so when they are attacked by the ferocious zombies the suspense is so nervewracking and our hearts beat so rapidly because we really care about the four protagonists and could not bear to watch them die. They started off as strangers and parted as companions. Also it is very interesting to watch how they monopolized the mall how in the beginning they slept on cold hallway floors constantly keeping watch. Later they eliminated the threat dined in the mall's fancy restaurant ice skated on the mall's link visited the gun shop for weapons slept in rooms with beds dressers televisions and other luxuries. This is an accurate representation of how it is human nature to manipulate and survive through alien atmospheres. I found that vision ingenious. Another brilliant message the film brings attention to regards the 1970decade. I found that like Pulp Fiction Dawn of the Dead captures the spirit of its era. The racism tumult riots counterculture degradation are all well represented here. The film shows SWAT teams complete with racist officers who kill for fun raiding an unruly group of Hispanics and Blacks hillbillies heading out in troops to battle zombies for sport mercenaries and vigilantes running wild all events indistinguishable from incidents in the 70's. Perhaps the most disturbing and ironic 70's incident in the movie involves raiding gangs of bikers who explode into the mall mirthfully slaughtering zombies not that that is an offense and vandalizing stores stealing jewelry guns clothes and everything they can find whereas our heroes took only their necessities. What happens next is very scathingly satirical and ironic. In between the battle for the survival of the human species the bikers find it necessary to start their own little civil war amongst the notsonumerous survivors. They hunt down both zombies and our good guys a perfectly timed paradoxical and cynical scene. Just like the battles between nonconformists and conventionalists during the 1970's and 1960's when America was on the brink of disaster this cinematic revolution is hardhitting gut wrenching and very real. One fascinating facet of the movie is how the audience learns to disregard the now minor threat of the slowmoving zombies a bullet or incision to the head will do the job. At this point one would not even notice that this film had the slightest relevance to the horror genre. Instead we fear the vicious bikers a bigger threat villains with swords and guns. This time the suspense and uneasiness detonates for there is a much greater chance of death for the heroes. I found the scariest part of the movie was the deterioration of the planet during the zombie apocalypse how the human species' decline is morbidly presented effectively and expertly by George A. Romano. However a refreshing sense of black humor is tossed in towards the middle of the film. Zombies attempt to walk up escalators ice skate and explore their surroundings with chuckles as the result of their clumsiness. One biting laugh comes when Steven explains to Francine why all these creatures have returned to the mall.  Instinct memory. This was an important place in their lives he points out. And of course there are many many thrills and chills. This film isn't very jumpoutfromthe darkwithachainsaw scary but more disturbing and extremely tense because we actually care about our characters and don't want them to die. The movie is unpredictable in this aspect unlike slashers where you are guessing who the one survivor is and how the others die. As the zombies close in we plead Don't die don't die! I have two minor complaints with this film. My biggest one is that the movie seems to carry on forever the way Goodfellas did. Despite the brilliance I felt enraptured with I kept asking myself When will this movie end?!? However I realize that Romano could not have trimmed any more scenes  without damaging the potency of his work. Also the gore was at times just too much. For instance the exploding head scene was revolting and most of all the intestinal feeding scene when a biker is torn apart was repulsive I couldn't watch as his guts were graphically shown ripping apart.Aside from those two unfortunate aspects I strongly encourage you rather you HAVE to watch Dawn of the Dead. Thrilling and suspenseful thanks to extremely distinct characters whose fate you hope a happy one and grippingly socially relevant this is a unique horror or really of all genres treasure.".

The movie begins with a frantic news station that cant hold itself together with the unfold events. Then a SWAT team dukes it out with project patrons and zombies. Then 2 SWAT members and 2 news people high tail it in a stolen traffic copter. Their journey to find safety shows the world crumbling. National guard rednecks copsetc. are shown trying to stop it.

All seems fine and dandy until a army of looters on motorcycles show up to get a piece of the conquest which turns the mall into a literal warzone between the good guys bad guys and zombies. This movie has buckets of blood to accompany the painful deaths. Romero does an excellent job with the atmosphere. The characters are fine actors as well as the zombies. This film seems be a vividly realistic depiction of a state of an emergency. Watch this film don't watch the remake this is what a zombie move should be not super female clones lopping of heads and fighting dead dogs and birds. Just normal people trying to survive in a world of the dead. WARNING I do stress not for the weak stomached.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say enough good things about this movie! They accomplished so much with such a small budget and manage to evoke so many different emotions from viewers throughout you can be nothing short of amazed by the finished product. Legendary filmmaker George A. Romero Night of the Living Dead has with Dawn created the most ambitious and most satisfying movie of his entire career. It's apocalyptic horror time as four survivors policemen Peter Ken Foree and Roger Scott H. Reiniger female newscaster Francine Gaylen Ross and her husband Stephen David Emge take off in helicopter looking for a safe haven. The world's being destroyed by a plague of sorts which takes shape as quicklymultiplying flesh eating living dead. One little bite and you will be joining them as they aimlessly shuffle along looking for their next meal. These zombies have taken over not only rural areas where they began in Night but also urban areas and society as a whole is in the process of completely collapsing. Our four reluctant heroes decide if they're going to survive they need to get as far away from civilization as possible. On their way to wherever via helicopter they end up stopping to refuel at a shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to hide out for a while seeing how they have all the resources right in one place. They kill all the zombies inside clear the place out barricade the doors and try to live as normal a life as possible until they decide what their next move is going to be. The movie plays out impressively in the brilliant mall setting and emerges as intelligent horrific exciting and comedic from the slyest of satire to the most overt of slapstick. It succeeds on so many different levels that people who really don't even enjoy horror films all that much should like it and yet there's a wealth of scares suspenseful scenarios and bloody Tom Savini gore effects to keep the horror fans thoroughly entertained. Dawn is not just a horror classic but a full fledged cinematic masterpiece in my opinion and a movie any serious film buff needs to see.".

Legendary filmmaker George A. Romero Night of the Living Dead has with Dawn created the most ambitious and most satisfying movie of his entire career. It's apocalyptic horror time as four survivors policemen Peter Ken Foree and Roger Scott H. Reiniger female newscaster Francine Gaylen Ross and her husband Stephen David Emge take off in helicopter looking for a safe haven. The world's being destroyed by a plague of sorts which takes shape as quicklymultiplying flesh eating living dead. One little bite and you will be joining them as they aimlessly shuffle along looking for their next meal. These zombies have taken over not only rural areas where they began in Night but also urban areas and society as a whole is in the process of completely collapsing. Our four reluctant heroes decide if they're going to survive they need to get as far away from civilization as possible. On their way to wherever via helicopter they end up stopping to refuel at a shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to hide out for a while seeing how they have all the resources right in one place. They kill all the zombies inside clear the place out barricade the doors and try to live as normal a life as possible until they decide what their next move is going to be. The movie plays out impressively in the brilliant mall setting and emerges as intelligent horrific exciting and comedic from the slyest of satire to the most overt of slapstick. It succeeds on so many different levels that people who really don't even enjoy horror films all that much should like it and yet there's a wealth of scares suspenseful scenarios and bloody Tom Savini gore effects to keep the horror fans thoroughly entertained. Dawn is not just a horror classic but a full fledged cinematic masterpiece in my opinion and a movie any serious film buff needs to see.";

I don't wish to spoil anything for you by dodging around the plot or any of the wonderful things you can get out of this film and will continue to get from repeated viewings. It is an aesthetic triumph which has no equal one of the most filmic and delightful productions ever made. Like all great works of art it is the apex of its genre as well as transcendent of its genre. Do not read the backofthecase blurb do not read semicritical reviews you must watch this film and decide for yourself. A short premise is all you need The dead roam the earth killing those they find. Those they kill get up and kill. It is the end of the world. We're down to the line. 4 people try to survive by fighting with the ghouls for control of large mall which could perhaps sustain them indefinitely and protect them from the hungry but mindless hordes of flesh eating zombies shambling in the parking lot if they can contend with those already inside! Will humanity survive though death reigns? Are the greater threats outside or inside? There are 3 great horror and scifi trilogies in film. One is StarWars one is Alien Aliens Alien 3 and the greatest is Night of the Living Dead Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. Dawn of the Dead is the most well rounded and exceptional of the trilogy. Dawn of The Dead is about race. Dawn of The Dead is about class. Dawn of The Dead is about America. Dawn of The Dead is about death. Dawn of The Dead is about life. Dawn of The Dead is about consumerism. Dawn of The Dead is about humanity. Dawn of The Dead is about violence. Dawn of The Dead is about domesticity. Dawn of The Dead is about individuals. Dawn of The Dead is about society. Dawn of The Dead is funny. Dawn of The Dead is brutally serious. Dawn of The Dead is about great film making made by the combined effort of a dedicated and revolutionary team with the power to take the taboo and make it golden. Even on a purely superficial level these effects are brilliant filmic and artisticmuch more so than anything cgi though still light years behind the effects used in Day of The Dead. Like a Shakespearean play Dawn of the Dead has something for the aristocrats middleclass and groundlings and in that it proves that we all share a common experience. It is just that magnificent. Some people will call this satire and others camp but really there's so much more to it! I encourage you to watch this movie repeatedly because I know you'll get something different from it each time!Warning Do not watch this film if you 1. have strong predispositions against gore 2. strongly dislike parables or satires 3. cannot abide movies from the 70's. Warning If you do not meet any of the qualifications above then you cannot afford to miss this film! A perfect 100. One of those rare and precious jewels. A unique and fitting work of art both perfect for its time and timeless. When this film premiered the audience was chanting in the street. If you have even one romantic bone if your body you will LOVE Dawn of The Dead.".

Dawn of the Dead is an endless amount of toxic waste washing over your TV screen for two excruciating hours. It's a complete insult to anyone with even the slightest bit of intelligence. Ooooh the zombies are returning to the mall because that's where they spent most of their life! THAT IS SO DEEP! Someone hand George A. Romero a Most Brilliant Man Ever Honorary Award already! How in the world can this be considered great horror? The Shining is great horror. The Omen is great horror the original not that comatose slap in the face of a remake that came out last year. Audition is great horror. Casper the Friendly Ghost is great horror compared to this... this... thing! I'd rate DOTD among such classics as Saw III and Freddy's Dead. Let's look at the facts The acting is awful. It's not realistic or natural it's awful. There's a reason most of the cast members never had much of a career after DOTD  they're completely indescribably hopelessly pathetic. But hey I can't blame them since they don't have much to work with... did this movie even have a script? I could actually feel my brain dying as the inept cast read their mindnumbing lines and got into lifethreatening situations over and over again for no reason except to kill time and because of their own pitiable stupidity.About the zombies themselves... well imagine the scariest movie you've ever seen multiply it by a billion and you're still not even close to how frightening the zombies would have been if they weren't so laughably shitty. Blue makeup sloppily applied to random patches of drunk extras' faces does not equal horror. Period. When I see a horror movie I don't want to watch retards get chased around a mall by giant Smurfs moving at a snail's pace for two full hours.This is amateur hour with pink gore. It's not scary or atmospheric not intelligent and most certainly not entertaining. It's a classic  I'll give it that. But it's a classic that I wouldn't recommend to any fan of film ever and I'd rather pluck out my fingernails one by one with a wrench than watch this wretched atrocity of cinema again.Oh I'm just kidding you guys! I actually love this movie and was just pulling your leg! I mean how could anyone look at the piethrowing scene or at Peter jumping around screaming yeeeeehaaaaw repeatedly for half a minute and NOT exclaim this is the epitome of cinematic perfection! See what I mean? This is pure genius I tell you pure genius!! See the 2004 version instead.

Who are these people? Surely they're not movie fans the big problem with the internet is that you see everybody's opinion including those of blithering idiots. Some people are even complaining about the zombies not running about after people! I blame this modern idea of zombies the DOTD remake and 28 Days Later etc. They aren't zombie films dead people running about whilst they slowly decompose is just stupid. The fear is in that even though they only shuffle about they are so vast in number that there is no escape no matter where you run they only have that burst of speed when they're close to the victim in true zombie films. The idea is that you can escape for a while and try to avoid them but eventually they close in and get you. The exciting parts of this movie work because they don't move fast allowing the protagonists to do things that fill the film with interesting possibilities like what would it be like to live in a shopping mall with no customers and nobody charging you for anything? It's a black comedy about consumerism and it wouldn't work if all those zombies ran around like Olympic athletes making for quick deaths and desperate hiding as seen in the remake it took the fun out of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seriously is it? I mean it is hard to find another movie like 'Dawn of the Dead'. Whether it is or not I can't tell but it is definitely one of the most influential movies ever made. Many living dead movies have copied George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy and among the three I find it hard to decide which is best 'Night of the Living Dead' or 'Dawn of the Dead'. But anyway I found myself liking this movie more and more as time passes and it keeps getting better and better with each viewing. With 'The Walking Dead' being one of the most popular series in our modern times I can't help but think 'Dawn of the Dead' was far ahead of its time. Many of the gimmicks in 'The Walking Dead' have surely been inspired by this movie. The relationship between characters the way tension is built the way the living dead behaves people's tendency to murder each other even at the face of extinction. I can mention more similarities but let us concentrate on the movie genre horror themes society culture extinction survival year of release 1978 directorwriter George A. Romero main characters Stephen Peter Roger and Francine.Plot Four survivors trying to survive in a shopping mall amidst a living dead apocalypse. Summary Peter and Roger escapes in a helicopter with pilot Stephen and journalist? Francine. After some time of flying around they inhabit a shopping mall which they clear out of the living dead and starts living a life isolated from the rest of the world. Now the strength of the movie is the relationship between the characters. Without it the demise of the characters would have had less impact. What happens to the characters gives me goosebumps and fills me with dread at the end. One of the other things that gives the movie strength is atmosphere. Usually movies in this genre tend to be more driven by gore and violence with little to no atmosphere with characters you do not care about. The atmosphere in this movie is full of dread and full of a sense of imminent doom. But it also has sense of humor comic book style. Almost like a parody What are they doing? Why do they come here?  Some kind of instinct. Memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives was part of the dialogue on top of the mall between Francine and Stephen.At that point the director was comparing shoppers at shopping malls to zombies. Although not originally natural to us it had become so common within society shopping malls became an important part of society's life. It is a social commentary where shoppers go to shopping malls without wondering why and never seem to question why they go there in the first place. Like mindless zombies controlled by black magic or what we usually call Voodoo. So although the movie on the surface seems like just another horror movie it really isn't. It appears to be more like a study and questioning of society's modern culture. Anyway the movie is magnificently directed by George A. Romero and the cast acts amazingly too. So amazing I find it to get better and better after each viewing. It also has a big influence on modern culture from the first Resident Evil game to The Walking Dead. I am 25 years old and I find it a little sad people from my generation doesn't recognize the importance of this movie simply because it is old because the blood looks fake because the acting isn't like today and it is not a fast paced movie full of explosions and gunfights with zombies. Like the okayatbest remake of Dawn of the Dead from 2004. I am tempted to say society's standards have degenerated like the living dead in this movie but that is just my opinion.P.S. I once watched the German version DVD and it took away all the gory violence which is sad since the violence is part of the movie's charm. A small plus to the atmosphere and relationship between the characters. Awesome movie.".

It was quite popular in Europe inspiring many Spanish and especially Italian zombi flicks Fulci Lenzi.... Not to mention the Resident Evil video games. What to say that already hasn't been mentioned. The whole film is quite an experience. From start to finish it has been a great ride. Romero's direction is great. The soundtrack the acting's fine. Great makeup and special effects. Savini truly did a great job here. This is maybe the best thing about the film. The gore effects are very well done. I would say grab some beers sit back relax and watch those mindless zombies getting killed.".

Day of the Dead received a lot of negative press upon its release in 1985  people picked apart unsavory characters OVERacting from a noname cast and outlandishly gory special effects that only Tom Savini himself could be proud of.But none of this makes it a bad experience really does it? I don't think so. For the reason that I usually detest zombie flicks I have worked up a fondness for the works of Romero and over the last two weeks have separately watched each film in his trilogy.Night of the Living Dead 1968 virtually defined a new genre of horror moviemaking and basically set the standards for the many zombie flicks that would follow in its footsteps. Next up to bat was the most praised film in the trilogy  Dawn of the Dead 1978  which was more of an action film than a horror movie and was nothing short of epic. Then came Day in 1985 which got the tonguelashing that I described earlier.However those that did like it praised the Savini effects its complex plotdriven characters and satire. While Day is certainly a step down from Night and Dawn Day is more of a claustrophobic horror movie and that allows it to stand on its own as a fitting end to Romero's trilogy. It's more in sync with the tension of Night than it is with the adrenalinlaced action zombieslaughterfest that was Dawn.A team of civilian scientists and a loose army unit clash with each other's motives after they have taken shelter at an underground military base from the hordes of living dead that storm the surface above. The civilian scientists aren't seeking to eradicate the zombies like the soldiers are hellbent on doing but are instead trying to get to the bottom of what is causing them to be what they are.In doing so they need live zombie specimens which are held captive in a maze of dark underground tunnels where they're corralled like cattle. We later get what is one of the most profound and moving experiences in the entire trilogy with Day when we see one zombie nicknamed Bub by one particularly eccentric scientist who eventually learns what it means to be alive so to speak.Day of the Dead obviously isn't a perfect movie but is more or less a fitting conclusion to one of the most daring film trilogies in the horror genre. It may be best to not watch Day thinking it'll be anything like Dawn just because it has military men blasting away mercilessly at the living dead. Zombie slaughter is few and far between and much of the first hour of the film is clashing dialogue between the characters.The darkest day in the world  Day of the Dead.910".

	schema:headline " A longtime sufferer of the Alien 3 Syndrome";
	schema:reviewBody "Day of the Dead is a film that is an unfortunate sufferer of the Alien 3 Syndrome. And no I don't classify those that are affected by the syndrome to be disappointing final entries in a trilogy. To suffer from Alien 3 Syndrome you must follow two exceptional films and the entry that has preceded you must be so exciting and actionpacked that when you dare take a grimmer more deliberately paced approach to your material you will become universally reviled with many people failing to notice that you have more than your fair share of merits on your own. In fact Day of the Dead has a LOT of merits  even more than the film that its syndrome is based on. While it doesn't quite approach the greatness of Dawn of the Dead it is still an intelligent firstrate horror effort and stands as one of the best genre films of the 80s.In this final entry of George Romero's Living Dead trilogy the walking dead supposedly outnumber the humans by a ratio of 400000 to 1. Twelve people who have devoted themselves to studying and wiping out the zombies hole up together in an underground missile silo and for all we know these could be the last twelve living humans on the face of the planet. Most of these people don't capture our sympathy like the foursome who holed up in the shopping mall in Dawn. Half of them are gungho soldiers who seem to take great pleasure in threatening the scientific team and Romero spends much of the first half focusing on the bickering and intense conflicts between these people. In fact for over an hour the hordes of living dead get very little screen time as the story focuses on the tension between the characters and the efforts of an offthewall scientist to train a captured zombie named Bub to act human. Compared to its predecessors this long section of the film may seem slow and talky but it is always interesting and for the most part effectively performed by its unknown cast. Besides it all eventually leads up to a corker of finale when the zombies finally invade the compound and most of the humans become showcases for the brilliance of Tom Savini who outdoes even himself in the gore FX department.While most of this material is very grim Day ironically has the most hopeful upbeat conclusion in the trilogy  which alas is its only major shortcoming. The quick transition to the final scene is so abrupt and unexpected that the audience feels cheated leaving the impression that the production ran out of money before the whole climax could be filmed. Indeed Romero has often expressed his unhappiness about being underfunded for this project which prevented him from creating a truly definitive final chapter for the trilogy. But while Day of the Dead may not quite be the ultimate finish to one of the greatest trilogies of all time it is still a very satisfying conclusion at least until Romero gets funding for his longrumoured Twilight of the Dead. It may not be popular among everyone due to many unfair comparisons to its superior predecessors but on its own it is about as good as horror films get.".

	schema:headline " Another zombie classic from Romero. Highly recommended!";
	schema:reviewBody "'Day Of The Dead' is one of the greatest sleepers in the history of horror movies. A flop when originally released almost twenty years ago its reputation has slowly increased over the years and now is generally regarded as a classic. I certainly underestimated it for a long time. In my opinion Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' are two of the greatest horror movies ever made but I always thought that 'Day...' was a bit of a let down. But after watching it again for the first time in several years via the highly recommended double disc special edition DVD I must humbly eat my words. This is a GREAT movie! Romero and special effects Tom Savini do wonders on a limited budget and the movie is full of suspense a claustrophobic atmosphere and plenty of gore. It probably flopped the first time around because it's so bleak but now that's one of its strengths. Interestingly Romero features a strong female protagonist Lori Cardille and a strong black supporting character Terry Alexander something not all that common in horror movies. Both actors give good performances the soldiers led by Rhodes Joseph Pilato are all suitably ultra macho and deranged and it was cool to see John Amplas 'Martin' in a supporting role but the two stand out performances are by Richard Liberty 'The Crazies' as Dr. Logan who the soldiers refer to as Frankenstein and Howard Sherman as Bub the zombie he has tamed. The sequences between Logan and Bub are just terrific and add a whole new level of pathos to the movie. The only negative comment I can make about 'Day Of The Dead' is that it brings home the depressing fact that George Romero hasn't made a truly outstanding movie in close to twenty years. I really hope he makes his long threatened fourth Dead movie 'Dead Reckoning' and that it turns out to be his masterpiece. But whatever happens he has already carved his name out in horror history as the creator of three classic zombie movies that just get better and better as the years go by.".

	schema:headline " Greatest special effects ever and that isn't even the best thing about this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "George Romero's zombie movies have always been standouts in the genre. Easily the best zombie movies ever and contenders for the best horror movies ever. Night of the Living Dead his first movie set the ground work for every single zombie movie to come after it and Dawn of the Dead which came 10 years later in 1978 set the new standard for splatter and gore flicks. If you ask me without George Romero's zombie trilogy horror movies would have never been the same.Day of the Dead takes place after the entire Earth has become overrun with zombies. Every human must either hide fight or die. The movie follows two groups of people doctors and army men. The army men pose as the bad guys in this movie just as Mr. Cooper did in Night of the Living Dead and the doctors pose as the good guys as Ben did in Night. The groups of people are hiding out in a secluded underground base. The zombies await outside while the humans try to come up with a plan to eliminate the zombie plague. Day of the Dead falls at the end of the trilogy. Being made in 1985 zombie movies were already high on the charts. Since the popularity of Dawn of the Dead especially in Europe a ton of independent film makers were pushing out these zerobudget zombie flicks faster than you could watch them. Finally in 1985 George Romero and Tom Savini grouped back together to show the kids how it was done. Day of the Dead fixed all the mistakes that occurred in Dawn of the Dead and turned out to be the perfect zombie movie. Day of the Dead IS the best zombie movie ever made.The main mistake that was fixed was the way the zombies looked. In 1978 Tom Savini special makeup effects was fairly new to the job and couldn't take on the very large amount of zombies he had to apply makeup to. Therefore he simply painted their faces blue. Here Tom Savini had his own team of make up artist. The zombies in Day of the Dead look far more disgusting and gross. Facial decays and bite marks were abundant in this movie. Not only that but every zombie looked different. No two zombies looked exactly the same which added a small shock element every time a zombie appeared on screen. The gore in Day of the Dead was even more amped up than Dawn of the Dead. It looked more real and came in much higher amounts. Day of the Dead ranks up with some of the goriest movies of all time only Cannibal Ferox and DeadAlive surpass Day of the Dead. For the way the gore looked Day of the Dead holds the trophy for the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie  bar none.While the special effects have greatly improved they aren't even the main reason I favor Day of the Dead over every other zombie movie. The reason Day of the Dead is and always will be labeled as my favorite is for the extremely serious tone of the movie. The characters in this movie with the small exception of the doctor are extremely serious and brutal in tone and pose an even bigger threat to the good guys than the zombies! It's Night of the Living Dead turned up to 11! The characters in this movie especially Captain Rhodes are very very well written characters although I wouldn't hold then as high as the characters in Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead is an extremely serious zombie flick with absolutely no humor whatsoever. It's serious it's brutal and has an extremely thick script with plenty to offer. Remember to bring a barf bag!".

For the way the gore looked Day of the Dead holds the trophy for the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie  bar none.While the special effects have greatly improved they aren't even the main reason I favor Day of the Dead over every other zombie movie. The reason Day of the Dead is and always will be labeled as my favorite is for the extremely serious tone of the movie. The characters in this movie with the small exception of the doctor are extremely serious and brutal in tone and pose an even bigger threat to the good guys than the zombies! It's Night of the Living Dead turned up to 11! The characters in this movie especially Captain Rhodes are very very well written characters although I wouldn't hold then as high as the characters in Dawn of the Dead. Day of the Dead is an extremely serious zombie flick with absolutely no humor whatsoever. It's serious it's brutal and has an extremely thick script with plenty to offer. Remember to bring a barf bag!";

	schema:headline " Very gruesome and claustrophobic zombie movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1985 this zombie movie virtually went by unnoticed except for many Romero fans. It was virtually dead a week or two after it hit the theaters. Many attribute its failings to the other many horror films released that year including ReAnimator Fright Night and Return of the Living Dead. All these movies were R though and day was not. Romero stuck to his guns and made a very gory movie. Unfortunately when dawn was released there were still many independent theaters but by 1985 the chains had taken over and one thing chains do is not show movies like this. So it went by unnoticed and those that did notice it usually had nothing good to say about it other than the zombies looked really good. So suffice to say I wasn't expecting much when I bought this movie except the zombies would look good. However I am happy to report that I was very pleasantly surprised. Granted Dawn was still a better film as it had more likable characters than the ones featured in this film. This would be the final Dead film George Romero would do until Land of the Dead was released but I do not count that one as part of his original trilogy as they seem to belong together because Night showed us the humble beginnings of the zombie outbreak Dawn showed us the zombies beginning to overrun us and this film shows us a bleak world where the zombies now outnumber the living 400000 to one. The story has a group at the beginning flying a helicopter in the hopes of finding some survivors. All they find is the dead and quite frankly any survivors out there would be better off keeping their mouth shut as they do not want to go back to the facility this group belongs to. It is like a bunker and in it we have scientists who have no clue what they are doing army people in a rush to leave said facility even though there is no indication there are any people left two civilian guys just doing their jobs and Bub the most awesome zombie ever! Tensions are running high in the facility as the army people want to leave and there is a lot of arguing however things take a turn for the even worse and the zombies that are topside begin to lick their lips! This film has great looking zombies and it does a good job with its setting. Originally George wanted to do something much larger in scope but could not get the funding so he had to scale back immensely which is why we sadly on get the one shot topside in the city and get to see how much the zombies have taken over. Everything in this film is rather good except the characters! Seriously Bub who is a zombie is the most likable character and then civilian guys. Everyone else just wants to yell and rant and this film is not a good one to watch when you have a headache! The good news is that this creates a finale where you really want to see a few of these guys eaten and suffer unlike Dawn where you just kind of get a random motorcycle gang out of nowhere. So this film is good just not as good as Dawn as this one just does not have the action of that film and for a good portion of the film the only thing you have to look forward too in between the shouting matches between the scientists and evil Bono are the Bub scenes. It does help build up the finale and like I said you really want to watch these guys get eaten but it also tends to get annoying as no one really seems right. That is just the way it goes though mankind is pretty much lost here and so why worry about trying to cure something that cannot be cured when you can just try and live out your life the best you can.".

	schema:headline " The Last Great American Horror Film?";
	schema:reviewBody "Cinema is wasted on cinema. Most cinema is bedtime stories for adults.  Peter GreenawayConsensus seems to be that this is the worst film in George Romero's zombie trilogy. Personally I think it's Romero's best film and one of the bleakest if not best horror movies ever made.Three points. Firstly what people fail to realise is that the humans are actually the bad guys in Romero's zombie universe. They are adept at selling out their friends stabbing their companions in the back acting violent brutal and flittering away their lives with mindless banalities. In contrast the zombies are representative of a kind of primal humanity which because it always remains at the core of mankind can not be escaped. In this film we have a group of people trapped in a military bunker whilst thousands of zombies wait outside. The humans are divided into three groups the hastily militarist right wing the scarily experimental left wing and the apathetic and hedonistic middle ground who just want to drink and live peacefully whilst the world goes to hell. Romero's point though is that despite their differing ideologies everyone is selfishly looking out for their own interests no matter how altruistic they may seem.Secondly this film acts as a precursor to fare like The Mist in that it is about a small group of people who when put under extreme pressure begin to turn against one another exposing their prejudices insecurities sexist feelings and petty jealousies. Romero's point a small group of humans can be far more divided vicious and bestial than any number of ravenous undead.Thirdly  and this is what distinguishes the film from all other horror movies  the film says that because most if not all actions are motivated by self interest mankind is ultimately doomed. Forget all the ancillary themes often attached to this film  Reganism the threat of nuclear war feminism Aids etc  while they're valid this film takes a far grander far more hopeless view of things.The zombies and the humans are divided by what Freud called the pleasure principle and the reality principle. The zombies as a kind of stripped down primal version of humanity simply eat breathe and wander about looking for food. Satisfying their primitive instincts are their only purpose. As one scientist says they gain no nutrition from the flesh they consume. In other words they eat solely to satisfy a desire to eat much as wealthy nations no longer eat to survive but to prolong pleasure. Humans in contrast are able to defer instant gratification constructing a variety of long term plans.What the humans in this film realise however is that the rewards of the reality principle of all their long term schemes are no more advanced or noble than the drives of the zombies. The lead scientist in the film for example conducts experiments not because he wants to save humanity but because he is thinking about future accolades and scientific prestige. These themes are summed up in one scientist's interactions with a domesticated zombie called Bub who performs only when rewarded. They can be tricked into being good little girls and boys he says same way we were tricked into it on the promise of some larger reward.For the humans however any chance of a long term reward is slowly being eradicated. The last survivors on the planet and unable to fathom any future the humans increasingly see no point in surviving. It's the beginning of civilised behaviour one scientist says pointing out that the zombies operate on the same performancereward level as humans civil behaviour is what distinguishes us from the lower forms. Civility must be rewarded if it isn't there's no use for it. There's just no use...for it at all.The notion that there is no use for any and all human actions is expanded when one character discusses the various immigration papers tax returns and official documents that the American Government stored in the bunker. All this information stored all these records kept...toward what end? What is the use of human history? To what goal does it climb?Ultimately the world Romero creates here is one that is ruled by self interest. Goal oriented man's actions are guided by pleasure constantly striving to achieve his ambitions and protect his interests. The only easy way to get someone to not spend their lives as a Machiavellian power zealot would be to persuade them that they will enjoy an eternity in heaven. Heaven being pleasure incarnate.Man is merely a dopamine zombie fingering his neurochemical Gspot in one form or the other no distinction between loworder pleasure and highorder pleasure. By a similar argument we'll never achieve true happiness through the pursuit of pleasure because we can never be truly comfortable while we are in a pleasurable state. If we're experiencing pleasure it's because we must need something. Take temperature. Only if we're too hot or cold will we be able to experience the pleasure of a cold drink or hot bath. Once our temperature has stabilised we're indifferent to either experience. If we are in no danger or need of any kind we're in a comfortable but indifferent state. Sensory pleasure is not happiness it is joy. The state of indifference is true happiness.Now reconsider the final scene of the film where the female character escapes and sits on a beach with the apathetic hedonistic middle men who refused to fight throughout the film. They haven't escaped. They've become 21st century zombies. Get your mind around that and this film will have you slitting your wrists.8.510  Ignore the one dimensional characters and the 500000 budget. This film attains a depth of utter hopelessness that few films match.Worth two viewings.".

Deep in a storage bunker in Florida a group of soldiers and a group of scientists have formed an uneasy alliance in order to try and discover something that can help reverse their spread. However Dr Logan is not making the progress that the soldiers require and Captain Rhodes becomes increasingly impatient and erratic as a result. Things continue to worsen as the zombies gather above and Logan's work gets more worrying.Having seen and enjoyed if that's the word the remake of Dawn I decided to rewatch the three originals on their own values. While I had seen the other two before this was the first time I had seen Day and assumed that it would be bigger than Dawn was in the same way as Dawn extended the ideas from Night. In that regard I was a little disappointed to find that the film stayed on a rather small scale and didn't manage to really convince me that the world was actually over on the surface of the earth. However this is not to say that it is not a good story in itself because it is albeit very different from both Night and Dawn. To me it lacked the social commentary that was to be found in Dawn but it is still tense gory and gripping. The claustrophobic nature of the bunker and the battling characters means that tension is easily created even when the zombies are distant and seemingly pose less of a threat than the humans do to one another. The film is a little weak at points  the medical experiments are given too much time and the character of Bub is not clear as to his reasons for being included as much as he was. I didn't like the idea of Bub the film didn't seem to know what to do with him other than using him to fill out the story  Logan's progress with him seemed such a waste of time that even if that was the point it didn't work.When the gore comes it is very hard to watch and a little sickening at times  bodies are ripped into and ripped apart in full bloody colour  as a horror it succeeds because I was looking a way quite a lot of times! Even though Shaun of the Dead has made fun of these slow zombies recently they still manage to be very effective here  I personally find them scary as they are relentless and simply wish to kill. True the fast ones are scarier but these ones are too. The cast are more than just victims and are reasonably well drawn and acted. They have to be engaging or else the tension between them wouldn't work and while hardly totally real people they still are good enough for a horror movie and they are not just fodder to rip apart  even if they are clearly penned as 'goodies' and 'baddies'.Overall this is not the best of the trilogy but it is still a good horror film. The tension between the characters creates as much of a threat as the zombies do  even if some of the plot isn't that good. It all builds well to a gory finish that really only lacks teeth because both the film and the actual ending both fail to really show just how bad things are and never convinces that the world has come to an end in the way that the whole trilogy suggests it has.".

While I had seen the other two before this was the first time I had seen Day and assumed that it would be bigger than Dawn was in the same way as Dawn extended the ideas from Night. In that regard I was a little disappointed to find that the film stayed on a rather small scale and didn't manage to really convince me that the world was actually over on the surface of the earth. However this is not to say that it is not a good story in itself because it is albeit very different from both Night and Dawn. To me it lacked the social commentary that was to be found in Dawn but it is still tense gory and gripping. The claustrophobic nature of the bunker and the battling characters means that tension is easily created even when the zombies are distant and seemingly pose less of a threat than the humans do to one another. The film is a little weak at points  the medical experiments are given too much time and the character of Bub is not clear as to his reasons for being included as much as he was. I didn't like the idea of Bub the film didn't seem to know what to do with him other than using him to fill out the story  Logan's progress with him seemed such a waste of time that even if that was the point it didn't work.When the gore comes it is very hard to watch and a little sickening at times  bodies are ripped into and ripped apart in full bloody colour  as a horror it succeeds because I was looking a way quite a lot of times! Even though Shaun of the Dead has made fun of these slow zombies recently they still manage to be very effective here  I personally find them scary as they are relentless and simply wish to kill. True the fast ones are scarier but these ones are too. The cast are more than just victims and are reasonably well drawn and acted. They have to be engaging or else the tension between them wouldn't work and while hardly totally real people they still are good enough for a horror movie and they are not just fodder to rip apart  even if they are clearly penned as 'goodies' and 'baddies'.Overall this is not the best of the trilogy but it is still a good horror film. The tension between the characters creates as much of a threat as the zombies do  even if some of the plot isn't that good. It all builds well to a gory finish that really only lacks teeth because both the film and the actual ending both fail to really show just how bad things are and never convinces that the world has come to an end in the way that the whole trilogy suggests it has.";

Performances from the actors may be uneasy and the tight budget restrains the director's vision but it still succeeds as a very frightening and depressing horror film. Savini and company have made the gore more realistic and nauseating. Gone is the cartoonish blood and cheesy gore effects. Stateoftheart splatter effects have been included adding a whole new element to this awesome trilogy. I have to strongly recommend this film. If you love the first two you'll definitely enjoy this this installment of the one and only trilogy of cinema!Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Day of the DeadCourageous Woman";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the Romero films this one is my favorite. I don't even count Survival and Diary. I found Lori Cardille's portrayal of Sarah riveting. Unlike Milla Jovovich's Alice of Residen Evil fame Sarah's a real woman. There are so many layers of horror coming at her and most of them come not from the zombies but from the men around her. Rhodes Logan Miguel.Folks watching this forget that she is the only female. That's huge. Her cabin fever is magnified just by this very fact. There's no motherfigure or female colleague or little girl to to whom she could be a motherfigure ala Alien 3. She's trying to save the world with her only power her power as a scientist ala I Am Legend. Her confrontations with Rhodes and his men are terrifying and yet realistic given the circumstances. It's obvious they weren't handpicked for this mission. Much like something out of a prison movie is Sarah's experience after Rhodes takes command. Rhodes and his men are not simply on edge they are hanging off the edge with nothing more than a pinkie finger. I kept feeling Sarah was in physical jeopardy especially of some kind of sexual assault. When taunting her boyfriend one of Rhodes' men says when contemplating what might happen with Sarah if something happened to Miguel. Maybe some of the rest of us can get some loving. The men resent her for being so competent when wrangling the zombies despite the fact that she was coolheaded. She's also concerned that too much is being asked of them when it comes to wrangling the zombies. Take the scene when upon her return in the helicopter Miguel her boyfriend is commanded to wrangle zombies for another scientist's experiments. She knows Miguel is PTSD and beyond exhausted and so volunteers but she is barred physically by his seniors. If she were a man she'd be hailed as their emotional leader but they hate her because she's not in a corner weeping profusely. They can't seem to understand that she's very much affected by everything that's going on but because she is not fitting the stereotype of a weak and whimpering woman who needs a big strong man she's reviled.Her scenes with Logan too are disturbing. Her research and his are very different. Hers is biochemical while his is clearly behavioral. She wants to cure the zombies while Logan wants to train them to do tricks and obey orders. He's not her colleague. He's her competition because he want to give the men quick answers while she wants to reverse everything a process she knows may take years. Logan even alludes to the fact that she's expendable to Rhodes as a warning telling her basically that she has to watch her back.Miguel who obviously presented himself to her in a better light in the beginning of their relationship becomes more and more diminished by the stress of the zombie apocalypse. He's suffering from PTSD and hates Sarah becomes she doesn't visibly collapse like he is. He's broken and resentful that she's not broken too. It hurts his male ego and they grow apart quickly. He even physically slaps her in one scene. In some ways he's worse than Rhodes and his men because at least with him she should have had some expectation of support and comfort but he has absolutely none to offer her. Just before the physical slap he is found awake watching her HATING her. Still even after he is bitten she protects him but he betrays her by releasing the zombies into the bunker. He's a punk a coward and vengeful and uses his religion to selfdeceive. At no point does he do anything to protect or aid her. If he was so religious he made no effort to share his religious experience with anyone especially not Sarah.Sarah's only fault is that she naively expects in the wake of the horror that everyone should be reasonable. This is how she's broken. She's in denial. But it's a kind of hope that she has a hope that is groundless.Of the men in this movie only John shines. It's almost as if he's only hanging around until he can make Sarah see the futility of what she's doing. He tells her I don't believe in what you're doing here Sarah darling. As an AfricanAmerican woman who actually got to see Night of the Living Dead in the movie theater in 1968 I've been gratified to see Black men portrayed in zombie flicks who weren't hoodlums or thugs. God save me from zombie flicks like Gangs of the Dead Dead Heist and The Horde. I wanted the zombies to chomp on the protagonists in these movies. Oh and in The Horde the Black men were more monstrous than the zombies. If you hate Black thugs and bad cops I recommend you watch The Horde. If I'd been a character in that movie I would have pitched myself off the top of the building and into the zombie horde. I live and work with Black men like the ones in Night of the Living Dead  1968 Dawn of the Dead  1978 and Day of the Dead  1985 and even in Land of the Dead where the zombie chief is a Black man who was an automechanic. These I can relate to so thank you George Romero.Frankly I'm glad the original budget for this movie was slashed. I'm glad they were forced to rewrite the script. I read the original and hated it. I think this made it possible for Romero to feature a woman with realistic problems in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. I learned too that of the first three this is Romero's favorite. Now will someone tell me why Netflix doesn't carry it. The horrible 2010 version is the only thing you can view with them.Lori Cardille rocks!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This third instalment in Romero's series of zombie films is a mixture of the thoughtful the satirical and the downright gory.The zombies are generally more of a sideshow in the early part of the film with more emphasis on the semimilitary group dynamics of the humans under siege. Romero expands upon this theme by contrasting the 'egghead' Dr Logan Richard Liberty with the twisted action herogonewrong Captain Rhodes Joseph Pilato.

Both are dismembered neither approach shown to be 'right' or effective in the face of the undead onslaught.Again the zombies are wonderfully crafted though there is less poetry and surrealism in their depiction than in the magisterial Dawn of the Dead. Barring perhaps the pivotal scenes of Dr Logan with his application of behaviourist theory in training a lone zombie in his lab. These experimentation sequences have the sort of evocative use of sound that runs throughout the earlier film the same sense of melancholy and dislocation and Romero clearly relishes elaborating the 1978 film's core theme of the zombie regressing to previous learnt behaviour. There is a woozy ambient calm to the scene where he tries to instill in the zombie a liking for Beethoven through textbook behaviourism. Otherwise the music tends a bit towards the postCarpenter 1980s norm.Performances are excellent makeup and assorted guts present and suitably incorrect. However whilst Lori Cardille is excellent she could have been given more to do and the progression towards the resolution is rather more contrived than in the previous two films. There are stretches towards the end where it gets close to standard action territory and several characters are barely developed.This hasn't quite got the style and engagement of the previous films but works on the level of a satirical exposure of mainstream action films and of dry academic theory. Day of the Dead is an admirably cynical and at times thoughtful piece of entertainment always holding the interest.".

'Day of the Dead' focuses upon a group of survivors who have holed up in an underground missile silo in the Florida Everglades. Tensions run high betwixt the military and the scientists the scientists wish to study the undead while the army just wants to blow them away. Joe Pilato is wonderful as Rhodes a thoroughly nasty piece of work and he has some great lines like 'You got 'til the count of five and that's two ya wasted!'.Lori Cardille stars as Sarah a scientist and she is joined by Terry Alexander as John the helicopter pilot Jarlath Conroy as William McDermott a brandyswigging electronics whiz and Antone DiLeo as Private Miguel Salazar an increasingly unhinged soldier who is Sarah's partner.The blood and gore of 'Day of the Dead' is incredibly graphic with bodies ripped apart by zombies in unflinching closeup. But there is definitely a vein of dark humour which helps to lighten proceedings and provide some muchneeded comic relief.Along with Pilato another great performance is that of Richard Liberty RIP who plays Logan an unorthodox surgeon who is experimenting on captured zombies and who is referred to as 'Frankenstein' by the soldiers in his midst. Logan is especially interested in a captured zombie he has nicknamed 'Bub' Howard Sherman because Bub is displaying distinctly human characteristics.I highly recommend this but be warned it is not for the faintofheart!".

Miguel Salazar for disregarding Sarah's safety.now there is a remake of day of the dead as well I haven't seen it yet. it's not out in the Netherlands but i already dislike it the fact that captain Rhodes Joe Pilato who was very good in his character is now replaced by with all due respect Ving Rhames.".

Miguel Salazar for disregarding Sarah's safety.now there is a remake of day of the dead as well I haven't seen it yet. it's not out in the Netherlands but i already dislike it the fact that captain Rhodes Joe Pilato who was very good in his character is now replaced by with all due respect Ving Rhames.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Day of the Dead the gore fest so loved by fans of the carnivorous Night and the skewering Dawn is used not so much for generic horror thrills but is posed by creator Romero as a scenario concerning more deeply rooted issues regarding humanity than the more predominantly social elements underscored by the previous films. Presumably set some time after Dawn Day finds the zombie epidemic that began with unknown origins in the first film having grown to insurmountable proportions. Killing the dead is of almost no use at this point beyond saving time our conceptions of which provide one of the themes Day is predominantly concerned with.Considered disappointing by most upon its initial release and still viewed as the weakest chapter of Romero's trilogy soon to be widened with the now upcoming Land of the Dead Day requires a different viewing lens than its more renowned predecessors. In Night and Dawn hope for survival was one of the predominant links between the audience and the human protagonists. In Day the humans are down to what may be the last band of survivors a motley crew of soldiers and scientists holed up in an underground storage facility hoping to hold out long enough that some practical means of overcoming the zombie epidemic can be found.In many ways Day paints its characters with little more than contrasting strokes of black and white and while the sometimes exaggerated presentation makes it nearly inarguable as to who will ultimately live and die many viewers don't engage the performances properly within their context. If Night and Dawn were eagerly perceptive of racial issues and consumerism in the midst of an encroaching unknown Day surpasses both of them in terms of its examination of the human condition and its disintegration in the absence of the protective stronghold of society. This seemingly nihilistic look at human values ultimately gives way to a more optimistic conclusion and it is this striking perception that ultimately makes Day's themes far more universal in nature. The dozen characters that remain at the start of the film bicker and fight often with little provocation or at times even reason but these conflicts aren't a distraction from Day's core they are absolutely essential to it.Unfortunately this aspect opens the door for the film's lone flaw Joseph Pilato's turn as the tyrannical Captain Rhodes as well as some of his faction's nearoutlandishness pushes the overall credibility of the performances to hazardous levels in contained moments. Fortunately however even the potential damage waged by this factor is largely countered by the film's subtly exaggerated Twilight Zone texture the triumphant qualities of which range from the cavernous underground look imbedded in the composition the subtle winks Romero still manages to slips in for adherents and more than anything else the relationship between Dr. Frankenstein Logan Richard Liberty and a captured ultimately docile zombie dubbed Bub Sherman Howard. Respectively their performances are delightfully but subtly cheeky and endearingly awkward Howard conveys emotions and nuance through body motion with great effect. As it is Day is inarguably the most ambitious of Romero's trilogy and a flawed masterpiece at that.In Night the flesh eaters were largely alienated from the humans warding them off they were an inexplicable distinct other. Dawn loosened the boundaries drawing a brilliant parallel between the stumbling zombies and the mindless consumerism fostered by the shopping mall the survivors holed themselves out in. Day takes the equation to the next logical step They the zombies are us declares the doctor. A baser less civilized version of ourselves but the bitter irony of it ultimately lies in the obvious fact that the zombies' hunger for flesh isn't just dissimilar to the division of our own factions but is a far less malicious attitude than those demonstrated by their live counterparts. Instinct drives the undead not desire and in Dr. Logan's teaching sessions with Bub past memories are rekindled and the progress that follows is akin to watching a child discovering the joys of life for the first time through the reintroduction to basic daily objects music and the same kind of rewards system used to condition people in a typical social setting.An attempt to look past the cynicism of the Reagan years is no more apparent in Day than through the spiritually motivated John Terry Alexander. Maybe we bein' punished he says. Maybe the creator wanted to show us we're getting to big for our britches trying to figure his st out. Whereas Dawn's characters found comfort in the paradise of society Day's characters long for the distractions that made up their former life. In denial of her own humanity's decomposition in midst of their situation Sarah Lori Cardille looks with intimate longing at a photo calendar in the films haunting opening scene ultimately also a poignant bookend for the film's hopeful conclusion. With not much left time really does seem to be the only luxury these characters have left to savor.Despite having far more on its mind than the average horror film and make no mistake the thematics are integral to the screenplay rather than being pretentiously overplayed Day still delivers the goods when he time comes. Savini's gore effects and makeup are ages ahead of the pasty look of the zombies in Dawn which is not to say the cherryred blood of that film wasn't effective in it's own manner. However the film's real sense of tension comes from its epic sense of impending claustrophobia and involving use of framing. The aforementioned opening shot captures the enclosed nowayout mentality the characters have no choice but to deal with while another early shot of the undead masses lurching through the barren streets of a debunked city is one of the most effortlessly haunting images in modern horror and a continual reminder of Romero's skills as a genre filmmaker. Day's resonating intimacy is perhaps the most longlasting trait of this dark horse.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very fitting quote from the film which applies to more reviews here than it should do.This film has it all and I have always preferred it to the previous instalments which were somewhat lame in comparison though 'Dawn' was indeed fun. I'm an 80s child as it happens if I'd been alive and old enough to see 'Night' when it came out I might have been more 'shocked' which is essential for a good zombie movie.I honestly can't see the beef with this film it's one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen. Sure the zombies might not be as convincing as the Italian versions with their 'Thriller' style makeup but who cares? Not I!Anyways the story is a progression from the last film where zombies have virtually taken over the whole world and only a handful of survivors remain. The film depicts a doomed species in a hopeless state of affairs that is truly apocalyptic. To top it off some of the most arrogant selfcentered people of those who remain are trapped in an old army bunker trying to escape amidst fighting each other. This really achieves a choking claustrophobic atmosphere that 'Night' had but 'Dawn' failed a mall isn't that confined and..a gun store? Come on! All these people have are a few rounds and their wits to survive thousands of zombies  I'd be bricking my load!To take the film up to true 'Classic' status we are given some of the most memorable and lively characters put to film. The show stealer is Joseph Pilato as 'Captain Rhodes' he..was...aweinspiring! 'Memorable Quotes' should be filled with his script. He really does throw his all into the film and deserved an Oscar or a new blood vessel! Two others come to mind the sweet but crazed Dr. Logan or 'Frankenstein' as Rhodes called him who sadly passed away in 2000 and the zombie that he tames  Bub! They just don't make 'em like this anymore. sighGORE GORE GORE!!! This film certainly has it by the bucketload and it is very disgusting and realistic at times the soldiers being literally pulled apart and feasted on at the end is quite foul but undoubtedly cool. Choke on 'em! CHOKE ON 'EM!' Rhodes gasps as they eat his intestines!So basically screw the people who worship 'Night' and 'Dawn' as some sorts of almighty monoliths of greatness and watch 'Day'  it's far superior. Needless to say but what the hay if you're a fan of 80s horror then you will LOVE this. It is gory intense and slightly fun at the same time qualities which the other films did before but not nearly as well.".

In fact being an avid horror movie consumer and favoring zombie movies especially it is only now that I've been lucky enough to get a copy of this. I'm so glad about that! Day of the dead is to my mind not only the best of all Romero's zombie flicks but also in the top three of all zombie movies ever made. It has every single asset that I consider desirable for a zombie film to be perfect a claustrophobic environment with little realistic ways out characters pushed to the limits paranoia darkness literal darkness as well as an obscurity a density of word thought and mindset that clearly reflects the apocalyptic world that they now live in powerlessness lots of quality suspense and gore. Many of those elements are missing in an awful lot of zombie movies.Day of the dead is also ahead of its time 1985 in special and makeup effects and beyond that in the general pessimistic mood that is now sadly a reality. There is nothing funny redeeming thrilling about the new world dominated by zombies the heroes of this show do not make a point of killing zombies as if it were some sort of hunting expedition with lots of adrenaline. They are simply the last humans standing a group of scientists and military who happen to have survived so far how and why them is never told and trying to live another day in an underground facility which is one of the best settings ever devised in a horror movie. Some kind of science project or experiment is also taking place with a Dr Logan leading it great character that one but this doesn't leave for much optimism. Basically the gray primary claustrophobic setting the rivalry between the military and the scientific communities and the sickness and nightmares that ail the heroes let us know early on that we're in for a gloomy tale.Day of the dead is also worth watching because it introduces elements that are completely original in the genre and have still to my knowledge either not been used at all or have been so only recently.My score is a resounding 1010!".

He creates some great characters and plenty of sequences of intense drama. There's a good share of scares especially the memorable opening scene and climatic chase through the underground caves. It ultimately comes out with a tremendous and bloody finale that showcases some incredible gore effects. Makeup guru Tom Savini returns to create the highly gruesome makeup work.The cast isn't bad but it's really bombastic Joseph Pilato who steals the show as a villainous military captain. Romero fans will surely enjoy this flick while the weak of stomach had better be warned! 12 out of ".

He creates some great characters and plenty of sequences of intense drama. There's a good share of scares especially the memorable opening scene and climatic chase through the underground caves. It ultimately comes out with a tremendous and bloody finale that showcases some incredible gore effects. Makeup guru Tom Savini returns to create the highly gruesome makeup work.The cast isn't bad but it's really bombastic Joseph Pilato who steals the show as a villainous military captain. Romero fans will surely enjoy this flick while the weak of stomach had better be warned! 12 out of ";

Gruesome third film combining gore 'bona fide' frights horror and in dirty style with simple characterization . The first time the Zombies appeared was in White Zombie1932. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror Bgenre  bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s . The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types . Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first Night of living dead movie which made Romero world famous and he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre . Most of the zombie extras in this film were Pittsburgh residents who volunteered to help in the film . This followup that doesn't hold up to its predecessors is mostly set in an underground bunker  but results to be relentless claustrophobic and talky for over an hour . The underground facility was not on a soundstage  it was shot in the Wampum mine a former limestone mine near Pittsburgh that was being used for a underground storage facility Day of the dead is even gorier than the first two Dead films . Unlike the other pictures this one has no truly agreeable roles to root for . Being easily the least of the entries and the lowest grossing film in George A. Romero's Dead trilogy. Nonetheless it's gained a cult following over the last two decades and director George A. Romero claims this is his favorite film out of the original dead trilogy. This trilogy formed by Night of the living dead Dawn of the dead and this Day of the dead were of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations copies and ripoffs . Romero gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance  giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies . And many years later Romero directed Land of dead 2005 with high budget played by Simon Baker  Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper . And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd  Patricia Tallman in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies .".

	schema:headline " Man vs film 2  museum of the dead  in depth";
	schema:reviewBody "We first see a parking lot where a mysterious figure is putting flier for the Museum of the Dead under windscreen wipers. Inside our heroine is buying a coffee after a hard class and doesn't' notice that she's been handed some sort of ancient coin. She sits down with her chronically acted friend who tries to convince her to go out and party for Halloween but instead they somehow agree to go to the museum of the dead instead. Our heroine goes home to have a power nap telling us that out loud in her apartment then falls asleep giving us not only visions of what's to come I'll get to that later but also giving us a recap of the first five minutes of the film! Ouch! Why?To cut a long story short her pal turns up dressed as a cat and brings along a costume for her pal which she doesn't wear. They head off to the museum a nondescript building and gain entrance using the coin the girl was handed. Inside they discover that the museum consists of loads and loads of identical corridors leading off to rooms filled with ancient South American artifacts I think. Get used to these corridors because the remaining 95 of this film will consist of people running around these corridors. Over and over and over again. We're also introduced to various fodder none of which are worth going into detail. One guy who was quickly followed by a mysterious masked figure into the building finds a skull with ruby eyes and gets sucked into another dimension where the fanged warrior from the credits brains him with a club and a random zombie turns up and starts munching on him. Here the film really lets the viewer down as it becomes obvious that this is going to be a fairly goreless zombie film. Our girls wander around a bit looking at things and walking down corridors. They get creeped out a bit and decide to leave which of course brings them to the skull and sucks them through into that other dimension. Elsewhere a photographer meets the masked figure who turns out to be some guy called McGlone who's there to steal something or other. In the other dimension  the two girls happen upon the first guy to be killed. At first I thought that this guy was some sort of break dancing zombie he does some weird moves but upon reflection I have absolutely no idea what this actor was trying to achieve at all. He bites that heroine's pal and gets into a kickboxing match with our heroine.The two girls head into a hut where our heroine shows sense by trying to phone the police but she can't get a signal. So not showing much sense at all she leaves her wounded pal behind and heads somewhere else to phone the police. About two seconds later her pal turns into a zombie.Here's where the film stumbles yet again. Every time this guy turns up to slash people to bits we get the animated effects from the credits superimposed on everything which just gave me a headache. The film already barely held together starts to really unravel here. Our heroine manages to call the police runs around the other dimension and the corridors meets her Hispanic friend and they run about a bit more fight some zombies and thenand thenShe wakes up on the couch of her apartment. It was all a dream maybe. She goes to the loo looks in the mirror and then ends up back in the museum running around with the photographer guy. Both of them run around some more end up in the other dimension and then she comes back out of the other dimension with the Hispanic guy in tow instead of the photographer. Not a single bit of this ten fifteen minute section of the film makes the barest bit of sense. At all.Some cops turn up and do the 'not being able to understand that shooting zombies in the head kills them but shooting them in the chest doesn't' thing. Some drawings of female warriors come alive and attack McGlone who uses magic to make them fight each other until they turn into gas ?. I'll leave the rest for you to discoverIt was really hard to write this review from memory as the countless shots of corridor running make up the bulk of this film. The heroine even dreams about running around corridors! Luckily our heroine wears a low cut top and is front loaded so the constant jiggling kept me awake. The dialogue doesn't help either. Here's your standard horror film lines spoken throughout this film What is this place? We have to get out of here! and most damagingly I feel like I'm on a movie set. It's also fairly goreless has no scares and although there's a few fight scenes they are executed in the modern 'Bourne' way.I'm not totally offended by this film however. I'll give it 'mad props' for the maze the skull sucking people into other dimension the Tolek warrior guy and the warriors coming out of the wall but I will not recommend this to anyone. It didn't hurt too bad but you might get some sort of enjoyment out of it maybe. In the case of Man Vs Film I'd say man won  I don't have any ill feelings for this film. I didn't enjoy it either though.".

One day on the beach the groom Danny is attacked and killed by a man who rises up out of the water with no explanation leaps on top of him and vomits blood into his mouth. Danny is resuscitated ten minutes later and seems to look and act totally normal. However his wife Denise finds out that that's not the case at all. It turns out that Danny has become a zombie. However instead of becoming a Night Of The Living Deadstyle creature right off the bat he disintegrates gradually in a manner akin to cancer or AIDS. He and his wife Denise do their best to cope with his slipping away not to mention the fact that he can't stop killing and eating people. As their best friends arrive for a weekend visit she makes him promise her that they're offlimits. He agrees but finds it more and more difficult to control himself. She hangs in there because he's the love of her life ...";

There are an absurd number of positive reviews here and they all praise the movie for being 'different' or for having some deep theme. There are a lot of other movies about couples fighting to stay together through a wide variety of adversity. This movie wants to do the same but stumbles in several key areas. First it's hard to care about the characters at all. The only exception to this is that the female lead draws which makes her a little bit more of a character. The male lead surfs and if you find that to be an endearing trait more power to you. Second the script is bizarre. The tone of scenes shifts unexpectedly and the direction is very strange. There's a long scene where a cop comes to visit. After ringing the doorbell he is invited in straightens a picture then sits down at the kitchen counter. He discusses grapefruit juice with the female lead. Only then does he finally reveal why he's stopped by. Aside from the lack of realism in this scene such as regardless of genre it's appropriate to have a cop act like a cop the scene goes on about 4 or 5 times longer than it should. I understood the reason for the scene but it would have been much more effective as a short scene involving a cop who acted like one and without the irrelevant chatter about juice.Other directorial choices are puzzling. Near the end the quality of the film changes to what looks like a shotonvideo dayfornight approach. I noticed a specific shot where the characters were all swept to the lower corner of the shot and remained that way.That said there are some nice looking shots. I don't know if I could specify many of them but they are there.On a larger level zombie films are about the larger event. Similar to Cloverfield they're about a metaevent with the film focusing on a smaller group's reaction to the event. In this case there is no outside event.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I read about it in the Asbury Park Press. I really did want to like it.".

	schema:headline " Still looking for the great zombie romance";
	schema:reviewBody "I was immediately attracted to the concept of the film even though I suspected it was very lowbudget. I think there is great potential in a gripping and profoundly touching zombiehuman romance provided it avoids most of the camp. Zombie Honeymoon doesn't succeed although it does have good points. It's played realistically it takes time to establish that the 2 protagonists are passionately in love and it mostly avoids camp but not totally. The newlywed husband gets attacked on the beach by a sick man coming out of the water. After a certain fright the husband seems normal but gradual hints and the trailer tell us he might be slowly becoming a zombie.Actually the whole premise of the film hinges on the wife's reaction at the first discovery she cannot deny. The main actress was very good but the whole scene didn't seem quite right to me. Don't know if it was the writing or the male lead. However one could go beyond that if other scenes later on didn't take us out of the story by their ridiculousness or unbelievability especially whenever the husband was in public. Some of the scenes seemed to drag on for no good reason such as the wife's car ride or the boring policeman's interrogation. On the other hand the finale starting with the candlelight diner had a few memorable moments such as the husband going about his business while the wife is locked in her room watching TV. Quite unnerving.I know their financial means were likely quite limited but the constantly bloody face of the husband was more distracting than horrifying. The eventually bluegray zombie makeup was pretty lacking in its different stages. I think the friends would have freaked out more during the palm reading session as the face of the husband had so badly deteriorated compared to earlier. The film does have bloody moments but nothing particularly gruesome. The camera doesn't linger andor it's too dark. Unfortunately although I think the initial concept could have made a very good romanticpsychological drama movie even with no budget the uninspired writing the conventional directing and most of the acting except the wife just didn't cut it. Rating 4.5 out of 10 Poor with some highlights2014 Edit Since that review I saw Warm Bodies that is the closest thing I've seen to the great zombie romance. Not quite there but recommended. I've also reviewed it.".

Quite unnerving.I know their financial means were likely quite limited but the constantly bloody face of the husband was more distracting than horrifying. The eventually bluegray zombie makeup was pretty lacking in its different stages. I think the friends would have freaked out more during the palm reading session as the face of the husband had so badly deteriorated compared to earlier. The film does have bloody moments but nothing particularly gruesome. The camera doesn't linger andor it's too dark. Unfortunately although I think the initial concept could have made a very good romanticpsychological drama movie even with no budget the uninspired writing the conventional directing and most of the acting except the wife just didn't cut it. Rating 4.5 out of 10 Poor with some highlights2014 Edit Since that review I saw Warm Bodies that is the closest thing I've seen to the great zombie romance. Not quite there but recommended. I've also reviewed it.";

He's a nice New Jersey guy who almost could not believe he had been invited to Torino with his second feature film the first one's title is called The Homeboy and it is briefly seen here in a funnily selfdeprecating scene at a videorental a furious client returns it to the clerk and yells his money back  but he has to pay for returning it late. Zombie Honeymoon said the director is probably the first zombiemovie ever to be based on personal experience.The audience was ready to laugh but there was nothing funny about that the plot is an effort to handle the untimely demise of the director's brotherinlaw who died in a surfing accident shortly after getting married. The premise of the movie therefor is telling the story of two people trying to remain together against all possible odds.The film's protagonist Danny is a surfer as well  but what gets him temporarily killed is not an accident like a rotting pal of Venus Anadiomene a zombie walks out from the sea to directly attack the poor guy and vomit black goo straight into his mouth. Then he falls dead over him. Rushed unconscious to the hospital our hero also dies only to come back to life a few minutes later. Problem is after coming back home he finds himself desperately hungry for human flesh  which understandably proves a shock to his young wife Denise.While presenting the film Gebroe introduced it as a cross between a John Cassavetes piece and Night of the Living Dead  which is a fitting description for Zombie Honeymoon. Although the photography does leave a lot to be desired the film is all shot on digital video and the choice of a handheld camera style proves somewhat a bit annoying instead of contributing to the realistic effect  the dialog and the interaction between the two unfortunate newlyweds are all absolutely believable  and even moving at times. Graham Sibley Danny is OK but the selling point to the film is Tracy Coogan's Denise  not only she's beautiful she is also great in totally selling the story.Maybe the film does lose some steam halfway through when the gruesome suppers of Danny start becoming a little repetitive. However the final 20 minutes are genuinely poignant  starting with a great scene where Danny after eating some of his victims spends a long time in the dark of his and Denise's home playing with one of those arcade games from the 80s while Denise devastated comes close to him and watches him play the game without uttering a single word.I won't spoil the ending of the best zombie romance since the underrated Return of the Living Dead III but any Blues Brothers fan should love the way Gebroe uses the song Sometimes is Hard to be a Woman  we sure kept humming it for the rest of the evening while discussing if death couldn't be seen as the ultimate handicap. Do check this film out it's worth your while.".

	schema:headline " Solid Emotional well Directed Genre flick";
	schema:reviewBody "In a genre so inundated with formulaic excessively grotesque can you top this shockgore I found this movie to be a welcome addition to the Zombie annals. Really if you think about this no one has attempted to do what Gebroe has donecreate a dramaticromantic zombie film. There have been elements in others but no one has shot this high before. First of all what made this movie work for me was that I bought the love story. This is a credit to both Gebroe's writing and the actors. Not only do I not agree with the venomous accusation put forth by the immature hatemongers that the charactersperformances were flat I was truly surprised at how believable and charming the characters were. In the world of Indies performances in movies with a Digital format have a nasty habit of looking transparent maybe it's the loss of the beautiful illusion conjured by the depth and saturation of 35mm. In this movie however Graham and Tracy make the love real between Danny and Denise with none of the affectations that could have prevented this from coming across. I even liked David Wallace's Buddy and Tonya Cornelisse's Nikki. Sure they're campy bestfriend fixtures but there's a refreshing likability about their performances. The real treasure of this flick and the most intriguing genre aspect is the progression of Danny's necrosis and how it is strikingly captured in both the direction performances and special effects. Graham Sibley's Danny is frighteningly accuraterarely do we see an attempt to humanize someone undergoing this horrific metamorphosis. The apologetic tone in his voice when he's pleading with Denise to help him is absolutely sincere. And the scene around the toilet bowl is almost as emotionally painful as it is revolting. Tracy's Denise's reactions to Danny's downward spiral have the authentic desperation of someone who is manically trying to shield themselves from a hideous truth. It's like being married to a drugaddict or someone who is mentally illyou love them so goddamn much you can't bring yourself to admit the presence of their destructive pathos. From a Direction standpoint the movie is remarkably sharp. It starts slowly but builds such a palpable amount of tension you find yourself short of breath at certain points. The last 45 minutes are as thrilling as anything I've seen in the last year. The scene where he's standing there playing R.B.I. baseball with those soulless impassive eyes...it's unnerving watching someone's life force slowly being drained from them. The textured psychological use of the mirrors in the Bedroom during the tense climax scene. The subtlety used in conveying Danny's increasingly conflicted view of Denisehelplessly trying to maintain the last vestige of his old self and the love they shared while trying to silence the demoniacal sublime satisfaction offered by devouring her flesh. Admittedly I am a big fan of contemporary genre revision so I am not surprised why I liked this movie so much. Whether it's Altman with McCabe and Mrs. Miller or Polanski with Chinatown the prospect of working within a familiar genre blueprint and still managing to transcend those narrow constraints usually makes for compelling cinema. Zombie Honeymoon observes this revisionist recipe quite well. And while it may not be or pretend to be either of those films mentioned above and Mr. Gebroe may not be on the level of Polanski and Altman yet there is certainly an abundance of talent evident in this film and a bright future for those involved. And yes in agreement with previous postings I believe that fofamreturns and rise4289 the negative responses to this film are one in the same person. The misspelling of waist and the dual use of the 12year old analogy clearly give that away...empty negative rhetoric from malicious people is nothing new in IMDb but it is still just as infuriating and unnecessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was as surprised by the quality of this indie outing as I was by finding it in my public library in the first place. None of the principals involved seem to have gone much of anywhere in the past few years but that's no slur on the integrity of this admirable little piece of cult filmmaking.I suspect many of the negative commentaries posted here are from people who expected something more directly related to the RomeroArgento zombie mythos. That's not what this very personal story is concerned with and more power to it. Instead what we get is what we might expect given the title a romantic tale of true love between a blushing new bride and her unfortunately zombified groom. Well actually the groom doesn't do the undead twostep until after they're married but who's to quibble? Well written and shot with only a few naff scenes Zombie Honeymoon features very respectable performances from a cast of unknowns especially Tracy Coogan as the young woman who has no trouble getting her husband to eat leftovers particularly if they're human. Graham Sibley as the hubby turns in a good showing as well although at times he seemed a bit too fey. The rest of the cast achieves various levels of believability but overall the ensemble is far superior to that of say Undead. I won't say this is as clever or engaging as Shaun of the Dead which plants itself firmly in Romeroland but it's definitely worth a cheap rental or a lucky borrow at the library. I had to give it a 6 just for the quality that ended up on the screen.Put it this way with a little bit of scripttweaking and a higher production budget along with the casting of marketable names Zombie Honeymoon could have been a true classic. As it is it's still a very watchable film and I hope that Mr. Gebroe is able to find further work in the industry. His talent and passion are more than evident. I also hope Ms. Coogan pops up again somewhere down the line because she's not only a cutie she's got some acting chops that aren't typically seen in indie films like this one. I'd say her greatest weakness is that she looks like too many other young actresses without having her own distinctive edge. Still she's young and with a little luck may well earn herself a worthy career. She has my best wishes that's for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd imagine that it's not easy to make a poignant zombie movie. Only a handful of filmmakers have pulled it off and even then the poignancy was sometimes hidden behind or inextricable from the gore humor nudity or surrealism. With Zombie Honeymoon writerdirector Dave Gebroe succeeded in crafting a film that is accessible as well as meaningful blackly humorous deliciously gory and honestly emotional.Zombie Honeymoon's exploration of love and loss is alternately heartrending gut wrenching gut munching and gut splitting. The story follows newlyweds Denise and Danny cathartically based on Gebroe's reallife sister and late brotherinlaw as their honeymoon is interrupted by an attack by a zombie. In the tradition of Romero and some other classics the zombie's existence and targeting of Danny are never really explained in this case it drives home just how arbitrary personal tragedies can seem. People die randomly all the time but no one ever expects it to happen to someone they love.Danny does die but mysteriously revives shortly afterward. Things aren't quite back to normal however especially once Danny begins to manifest an insatiable hunger for human flesh. With the new cravings and the physical deterioration that we've come to associate with zombies Danny's ghoulish transformation carries with it evident parallels to issues of addiction and disease. And suddenly there is a host of new logistical problems that Danny and Denise must face as a new married couple trying to stay together plan for the future and keep Danny from killing and eating too many people.This isn't the first ZombeoandJuliet movie but it may be the best yet. Gebroe handles the concept adeptly maintaining a subtle level of dark humor without allowing the film to lapse into sheer silliness which would have been very easy for it to do given the almost satirical premise. Zombie Honeymoon is more ZombieRomanticTragedy than ZomRomCom but still delivers its share of laughs and even uplifting moments.A quick word about the leads Graham Sibley and Tracy Coogan bring great realism to their roles as the newlyweds. They are convincing in making the transition from enthusiastic lovestruck naivet to shock frustration desperation fear sadness... and hunger. As their relationship becomes strained the way they push each other away even as they cling to each other really rings true even in the midst of some seriously blooddrenched moments.Overall a fine film.".

Ya I get it you just got married but they more acted like a ten year old who just got his first transformer then an adult couple. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was in order to make the audience get the picture they would have scenes where nothing was going on no sounds no movement just sad faces for what seemed like an eternity.If you are looking for a sweet love story that more fits a horror movie rather then a drama with some blood I would recommended David Morlet's Mutants 2009.

The two genres shouldn't work together particularly well but they do a very good job of it here. The romance is sweet without being saccharine the zombie 'snacking' is gory but not repulsive. This genre clashing is balanced by a deft dark comic touch leading to one of the more interesting zombie efforts of recent years. Zombie Honeymoon is held together by its balanced tone and production values on a budget. The acting is of a high standard particularly Tracy Coogans wife 'Denise' giving the film an emotional resonance lacking some zombie films. The film has an excellent garage  surfer rock soundtrack one of the credited roles was for 'Psychobilly Adviser' and excellent sound design  it sounds like their having a lot of fun in the production of this element.Its main flaw an unfortunately unavoidable one is that it doesn't strictly adhere to the zombie rule book handed down to us by the one they call Romero making comprimises between the zombie and romance genres a few more zombies wouldn't have gone amiss and there are a few unanswered questions lingering on later viewing. Thankfully the film is enjoyable enough whereby it's not too much of a challenge to overlook these points. This film is destined to be a cult favourite it isn't for everyone but its good to know that these two conflicting genres can work together. An accompany piece to Shaun Of The Dead or Bubba Hotep is not unfair to say. Zombie Honeymoon is a genuinely sweet fun unique and interesting film treading between binary opposite genres skillfully.".

Movies that are complete satire like Shaun of the Dead have very little intellectual depth and tend to be dumbed down. Completely serious dramas can be a little TOO intense without some comic relief.

The title brings to mind a Shaun of the Deadesquire type of comedyparody and if that's what your looking for I suggest you head for your video club and rent Shaun of the Dead. This movie while it did have a couple of laughs is more of a drama than a comedy. In fact this isn't so much a zombie movie as it is an exploration of how far we'll go for someone we truly love. Without going into anything spoilery I will just say that the ending is very touching and the movie as a whole is romantic without being sugary. I challenge anyone who sees this movie not to get a little emotional during the candlelight dinner scene ... you'll know what I mean when you've seen it. I for one can't wait till this comes out on DVD it's got to be added to my collection ... soon.".

I would not even put this film in the same category as Shaun of the Dead. There's nothing worse then striving for a joke and failing at it. This film proves that hands down. I won't mention the acting since what do you expect from a zombie film? However since this is obviously a low budget film shot on video and it looks it I would at least expect a solid story.

	schema:reviewBody "On the first day of the romantic honeymoon at the beach a random zombie that comes stumbling out of the ocean infects Danny with an incurable virus. After being dead for a full ten minutes he miraculously awakes and even continues planning his emigration to Portugal with his beloved bride Denise. But Danny really isn't the same anymore as his insatiable hunger for human flesh drives him to forcefully attack people while Denise  loving wife as she is  helps him get rid of the leftover corpses. For only his second film as a writer slash director Dave Gebroe had the bizarre ambition to blend gross horror with genuine romantic drama and even to throw in bits of comedy. The idea is admirable but as you can imagine the result is an often lacking and pathetic film. You can't really expect a story to emotionally affect you while you're watching at a slowly rotting zombie that takes large bites of flesh out of people right? Luckily for me I saw this film at a national festival where Gebroe himself came to enlighten the audience about his motivations and influences to make it. Believe it or not but that actually helped me appreciating the effort slightly more! The whole dramatic aspect of the story is apparently based on a real event as the director's brotherinlaw tragically died in a surfing accident which left his young wife behind with an emotional trauma. Reworking bits and pieces of this reallife drama into a horror film served as some sort of therapy for Gebroe who was really fond of his brotherinlaw as well. However even with bearing Gebroe's introduction in mind Zombie Honeymoon can't possibly pass for a good film. The sentimental moments are painfully tedious whereas the zombie action is quite gore and explicit. These sudden changes in tone are difficult to process and especially the tongueincheek gags entirely miss their effect. The makeup effects are rather convincing considering the fairly low budget and the acting performances are spirited. The music selection and exterior filming locations both a homage to the deceased Danny as well are winning elements too.".

Really this is more of an indie flick than a true horror movie  it's more about setting a mood and it is successful in that  with the music and the beach setting you are transported to a different environment. Again the female lead makes us watch because she looks like she believes the situation she's in and so we follow. However her desire to stay with her boyfriend is a little strong. Girls leave guys cause they wear the wrong shoes not even cannibalism is a dealbreaker for this chick! I guess there must be a shortage of guys around the beach town. Although this movie does not provide a character to root for really or a major conflict or a big set piece it is definitely original and it is somewhat compelling.".

Among the major factors keeping this down is the fact that the storyline here hardly ever reads as being a true horror film due to the vast majority of scenes in here being really uninteresting due to the vast majority of scenes in here being really uninteresting as one. Since the main focus here is the diet and how that change affects their behavior toward each other that changeover should've been handled a lot better than it is here due to the absolutely banal ability to wrap everything as if it's simply cutanddried of all explanations and based off that simplistic premise. That is where this one tries to build it's horror off of instead of where it really should matter as for some really inane manner the fact that a vegetarian is suddenly eating raw meat voraciously and continuously without provocation overlooks the fact that a man is slowly decomposing and actively eating people both of which should be far more pressing matters that are completely overlooked in here. The focus is entirely wrong and the reasoning why this is allowed to go on instead of being reported to the police is simply lame and really furthers how boring the first half is as this is barely interesting anyway. Beyond the reasoning what makes this so bad is the entire opening of this which really has nothing of interest here as the couple are arguing about their lifestyle or hanging with friends and very little of that makes for an enjoyable time. They leave so little of this with any kind of enjoyable parts that even if it wasn't as lame and bland as it is the utterly torturous pace here is of much bigger concern here as this is far more uploaded with drama than horror that it has very little chance to make an impression when it does try something. That really only leaves this with two small scenes of interest here the best being the first attack on the beach which has a pretty disturbing reality to it with the tranquility of the rushing water and the suspense of the slowlyemerging creature from the waves beyond the fine brawl and the gory resolution. As well the finale assault on the police officers is where all the blood and gore scenes are found in a somewhat energetic sequence which includes the nice stalking down in the darkened living room culminating in the vicious and brutal ambushes where we also get the fine aftermath of the bodies as well. Though the zombie makeup is decent enough that's all that works here as this one tends to feature more flaws.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and a sex scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "No real spoilers the film's description pretty much says that he turns into a flesheating zombie Possibly a decent film if scored according to budget. But on it's own it falls way short. The two lead actors provide solid performances. The male lead stumbles a few times particularly when quickly swapping backandforth between cannibalistic zombie and horrified human but I suspect poor editing shares the responsibility. The female lead provides a superior consistent performance.The cinematographer is the real star of the show in the film. He captures some breathtaking sequences. My favorite is the sequence 10900 to 11050 of the lead actress nervously applying makeup while we hear her husband munching flesh down the hall cut to a stunning dim shot of her smoothing her dress while she sits on the edge of the bed cut to her head in her hands a long lit hallway behind and her vertebrae arching beautifully. Absolutely sublime!Unfortunately the story has been done many times before the script is bad the dialogue is horrible and thus the movie is crap. I blame the director  who is also the writer! The poor cinematographer might have turned this into a beautiful largely speechless short film. Instead the director crafted something not fit for latenight TV.An excellent example of the poor writing is how clumsily vegetarianism is shoehorned in  out of the blue. And the theme is carried on poorly such as with the shot of the television cook skinning an onion while the lead actress hears munching outside. Eliminate the awkward vegetarian element and that would suddenly become a much more chilling metaphor piercing the delicate membrane of the onion's skin would evoke the fragility of our own skin. Instead the onion shot recalls the horribly written vegetarian dinner scene and I assume is intended to remind us how much the flesheating zombie has changed from the person he once was. But he's become a flesheating zombie FFS. We don't need a standard of comparison. He could have previously eaten only rare steak three meals a day and becoming a flesheating zombie would still be just as glaring a loss of humanity. It's clich student filmmaking trying to squeeze in cheesy and overused philosophical layers with no regard for how it negatively affects the story.The movie itself is not in my opinion worth watching unless you are a film student looking to learn from its mistakes. I suggest as a standard of comparison the film Let Me In remake of Let the Right One In which addresses many of the same themes enabling darkness out of love with more depth emotion and chills.".

	schema:headline " Horribly Fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "So basically the story is as follows. The military for some reason is developing a toxin that revives the dead and while it's being transported it is stolen by some terrorists. The terrorists are all gunned down but one escapes with the toxin unfortunately he ends up cutting himself on the vile somehow and becomes infected. He then flees and finds refuge in a crappy motel. There he kills and spreads the disease to a poor maid Ill explain her death a little later. The terrorists corpse is then cremated which in turn spreads the virus throughout the land. OK well...lets start with some of the things that stood out to me.1.That god damn smoke. What is with this in every scene there seems to be endless amounts of smoke being pumped out everywhere. 2.Karate soldiers. When these soldiers are battling off hordes of undead corpses and they don't have fire power on them they resort to their mastered ninja skills. Look out for an assortment of karate chops kicks and throws.3.Mirror Death. What...the...hell. The terrorist who turns into a zombie kills a poor maid by yes smearing the maids face into a mirror causing massive hemorrhaging and ultimately killing her.4.The special effects. The gore overall is pretty good tons of blood and guts and visceral feasting. After being bitten you don't immediately turn into a zombie the bite turns into some disgusting looking mutated fungus that pulsates and oozes blood and green gunk. But...at the very start when the terrorists are fleeing and the military is shooting at them there are no effects once so ever. The helicopter shoots a couple of guys and when they get shot they jump up into the air and fall down. No entry wound no blood just a guy going Argh! jumping up and falling down.5.The zombies. There are so many things to mention about the zombies. Theirs zombie people zombie birds even zombie fish their must've been zombie fish because a zombie pushes a girl out of a window and she falls into this lake one of the soldiers dives in to save her and when he pulls her up her legs have been eaten and she's instantly a zombie most of the zombies don't just mindlessly roam most of them are hiding yes hiding. They wait till you walk past then jump out from behind a bush or from behind a wall. Speaking of jumping there are at least 10 zombies that literally fall from the top of the screen then start attacking. Inside or outside they just fall and attack. There's even one zombie thats on the top of some 20 foot poll that jumps down and I have no clue how he could of got up there. You've got your typical stumbling moaning zombies and you've got your acrobatic brawling zombies that not only want to tear you apart limb by limb but want to beat you up before. I can recall the part on the bridge where one zombie gives a soldier a dirty haymaker then proceeds to put him in a headlock. My favourite was the deranged zombie at the gas station wielding a machete. He was vicious jumping all over smashing into tons of stuff he really looked like he wanted to hunt that chick down and tear her apart.6.The theme music. There seems to only be one song that plays whenever something is happening. I liked the theme music but after every time a zombie attacks or every time a soldier starts running it gets kinda of annoying. 7.Flying zombie head. That was ridiculous. They were looking around in the hotel and found a refrigerator. They opened it up and a zombie head flew out and chomped on the guys neck. The guy fell and the zombie head flew into the air and then flew down to the guys neck again.You have to see it to know how unnecessary it was. 8. The guys in the white jumpsuits. These guys were badass. All they did was gun everybody down. Zombies survivors they didn't care they were on orders to shoot everyone and thats what they did. Hell they even killed one of he main characters.9. The hilarious dialogue. Oh man. It's spread throughout the entire movie but pay attention closely when the scientist guy is telling the general guy that they are going to try to find an antidote. That guys acting is priceless.Overall it was a ridiculously bad good time. It's a fast paced movie so it doesn't get boring and its loaded with tons of things that make it so...unique.610Matt".

This is no Dawn of the Dead folks.That said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films I have ever seen. The script is wonderfully horrible. Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote Let's try putting these two molecules together. The zombies come in all varieties. From moaning shufflers to machete wielding maniacs to birds! The gore is plentiful. Legs are bitten off arms amputated stomachs burst open. The pace is fast flying from one zombie attack to the next. Then there's the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horror since Ash got his hand possessed in Evil Dead 2.You should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film.

	schema:headline " Zombie trash with a serious identity crisis.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've now seen this film twice and I must say I enjoyed it both times. It's fast paced and fun but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in Mattei's case.The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians.The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety so well rendered in the original and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either they are well versed in guerilla tactics hiding on rafters and under bales of hay and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei.There is a third more chatty variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.Then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'.The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro and one of the only effective scenes in the film.The guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. Firstly it is a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi 2 with Zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Confusing enough? Basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money. I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to walk out. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.Zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines terrorists steal it unleashing a plague and zombie run amok. The scientists want to create an antidote while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet. Overall I actually liked this film. I heard horrible things but I find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable. The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution corrupted military Man playing God etc. I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it veered off in a weird direction presumably when Mattei came on board.Besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with When you see the men in white suits  gas masks Run to them for Help. This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies. Later they straight up steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.The gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. How is it cool? Let me count the ways1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the machetewielding maniac at the gas station. He was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.Favorite Quote  When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie the scientists asks Don't you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything? To which the Sargeant boldly replies Now you're talking science fiction. He also continues to mention the Science Fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.Extras Gallery Trailers and Interviews most notably the one with Mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details.Bottom Line A must see for zombie and Fulci fans.Rating 710Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.comHorrorYearbook".

	schema:headline " Disappointing Sequel To A Gore Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I am an avid fan of Lucio Fulci and yet I must say that Zombi 3 aka. Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 of 1988 which he made with two other directors Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso was quite a disappointment. Especially compared to its great predecessor Fulci's very own Gore classic Zombi 2 aka. Zombie Felsh EatersZombie of 1979 this is vastly disappointing. Sure the low rating of 4.5 already suggests that it's not a good film but these low ratings usually come from people who are not into Italian Zombie flicks and as enthusiastic fan of Italian Horror films and lowbudget Exploitation cinema I love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings. Also many of my fellow Italian Horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated which I sadly cannot agree with. Not that the film was a complete disaster. It has some redeeming qualities above all Fulci's nauseating gore effects that are always a pleasure to watch for an Italian HorrorGore buff. The basic idea behind the film is also not bad allthough far from original and I liked the ruthless portrayal of the military. Sadly that's about it. While the great predecessor Zombi 2 was extremely gory but beyond that also genuinely creepy this is not creepy or scary for a minute and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch Zombi 3. The film is sometimes fun to watch but only for the gore and as an unintentional comedy. I guess that it was mainly the gore that came from Fulci and the disappointing rest that came from Mattei and Fragasso the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cultflicks such as D'Amato's Porno Holocaust and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made the godawful Troll 2. Overall this is definitely watchable for the gore but out of all Fulci films I've seen so far this is definitely the worst and I've seen the majority of this great filmmaker's repertoire. I am a Fulci fan and I always will be but this sure isn't his magic moment. It may be fun for the gore but I recommend to watch any other Fulci film before this!".

Everything about it from the atrocious acting to the recycled theme played throughout spoke of utter garbage.  It's a miracle we made it all the way through the movie.  Weapons are randomly placed throughout the town such as a crate of machine guns in the basement of a motel or a grenade under a jeep that had the blast radius of an atomic bomb.  Don't even get me started on the dialog.  It was garbage garbage garbage!!!  For some reason the characters felt they had to spell out everything for us.  Like when their car would break down they would say Looks like our car broke down.  I'm going to go to that abandoned gas station right over there and see if i can find some water  this brings me to my next point  the director's obsession with water.  At least three times the characters would wander off alone in search of water as if it was a miracle cure for the zombie disease.  It's killing me to write this so i have to stop now.  A warning for all those planning to see this movie don't.  You will walk away a mindless babbling zombie yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Zombie 3 1988 Directors Mostly Lucio Fulci but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast Ottaviano DellAcqua Massimo Vani Beatrice Ring Deran Serafin Review To review this flick and get some good background of it I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79 Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so after that flick named Zombie 2 in Italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the Italians decided heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there's the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn't really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei Hell of the Living Dead and Claudio Fragasso Zombie 4. They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn't really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said Do whatever the hell you want with it! And god love them they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its director. The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There's no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there's some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that don't do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically nonexistent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my bmovies but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a zlevel flick if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors the movie was filmed in the Philippines so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasn't good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don't come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else's flick. And those two involved Mattei and Fragasso didn't really put there heart and souls into it. In fact when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesn't even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it. And that my friends is the last nail on this flick. There's no love and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made. Everybody else don't even bother! Rating 1 out of 5".

As a zombie movie it blows. There isn't a shambling corpse in sight and it's terribly light in the gore department. Zombie 3 on the other hand is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its bloodspilling  therefore it is better than Gone With the Wind. It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is however not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist who has been exposed to the nasty concoction hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesheating zombie. One of his first victim's is a cleaning lady. Once she's bitten Lucio Fulci's brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick the acting is atrocious the storyline is riddled with plot holes and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot too poorly edited and the sound design is flat. Still it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest. Or don't like Gone With The Wind undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.".

The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead but whereas that film was intentionally funny this one is the opposite.

Also the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy and the death scenes are often just downright stupid. This of course makes it all the more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER  The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head which then opens its eyes and somehow FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string latching onto the guys neck killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies every law of physics known to man and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed.

Hell what else is there to do when youre dead?I had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings kicks and jumps and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers. I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained. I watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in the Phillipenes was absolutely engulfed in fog heavy doses of fog and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats. I had to even cringe when I saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle with Dead One written in the middle. I had to ask myself...if the science of curing zombies is that easy then I wonder if I could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here!All in all the effects were overboard the dubbing horrid Im sure the original acting as poor the story absurd the zombies inconsistent even in a bad way they couldve all been similar and the women ugly but I found myself enjoying this thing. It was a fun watch. It turned out to be a very very bad film and I would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films but still again I say...it was worth a good laugh. I crave zombie films no matter what but when this had Fulci's name attached to it it shouldve been much better. Let me dare say Zombie Holocaust was better.".

So the soldiers take the passengers to an abandoned hotel and in the meantime an epidemic has begun which causes chaos and destruction all around.

Fulci was replaced by Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso who  while not in the same league as Fulci  certainly know their way around a horror film. Given the circumstances it's not surprising that the film does not meet Fulci's usual high standards but it is shock that the finished product turned out to be such an awful and embarrassing mess.Fulci's Zombi 2 was a brazen attempt to cash in on the Italian success of George A. Romero's Dawn of The Dead released as Zombi in Italy. Zombi 2 exceeded all expectations and became a horror classic in its own right largely due to Fulci's sublime direction sense of humour and moreismore approach to gore. Sadly all of these qualities are sorely missing from Zombi 3. In fact Zombi 3 has very little going for it at all. There are odd moments of competence and one moment of Fulci brilliance but as a whole this film is a dog's breakfast. Even the most ardent fan of Italian horror will find this stinker painful to sit through.It is hard to convey just how bad this movie is. Zombi 3 is abysmal in just about every regard. Perhaps the most grating aspect of the film is its complete and utter disregard for so called zombielore. Fulci took an original approach to zombie behaviour in Zombi 2 the underwater zombies being one of the many highlights of that great movie but still remained within the basic zombie framework. The zombies in this turkey not only run around with great agility they also talk and remember who they were. These creatures are not the living dead  just living mutants. The misunderstanding of the zombie concept is just one of the script's many flaws. The film's basic premise of a zombie virus being released into the atmosphere is pretty lame but the fact that Zombi 3 requires announcements from an ecologically friendly zombie DJ to pull the disjointed and confusing storyline together is simply unforgivable. The same could be said for the hilariously inept special effects. The scene in which an actor is attacked by obviously dead stuffed birds would embarrass Ed Wood while I hope the person who forgot to apply zombie makeup to the actors' hands and legs is hanging their head in shame somewhere.Amongst all the incompetence there are a few moments that make the viewing experience bearable. One of them is the zombie in the fridge which Fulci considered to be one the only respectable scare in the film. Another highlight is the zombie birth scene which was borrowed for the recent remake of Dawn Of The Dead and the clever twist of having the characters pursued not only by the undead but also by crazed army officials. It must be said that these few bright moments are probably reason enough for horror buffs and zombie aficionados to hunt the film down. Everyone else will be left scratching their heads in wonderment at the epic scale of the Zombi 3's incompetence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was hoping for a little more.  Zombie Flesh Eater was originally released as Zombie 2 and was supposed to be a sequel to George Romero's excellent Dawn of the Dead.  After having seen Dawn I rented Zombie Flesh Eaters and it wasn't bad but it wasn't much of a sequel either.  This one was released in Italy as Zombie 3 but in North America as Zombie Flesh Eaters 2. Confusing eh?  It was supposed to be the second sequel to Dawn of the Dead. Hoping once again for a much better movie I rented it shortly after renting the first sequel.  This movie stunk.  It was terrible.  None of the zombie laws as established by George Romero were used despite the fact that it was supposed to be a sequel.  Sometimes the zombies are slow as molasses but at other times they are jumping out of the roof and ninjakicking the living.  You don't have to shoot them in the head a few shots to the corpse hee hee seems to do the trick.... at least sometimes.  Then there is a zombie head in a refrigerator that manages to propel itself out and bite someone?????This movie made no sense.  I know it was a zombie movie to begin with and a sequel at that but at least try to make it in line with the original!  The effects were also dismal.  It was very obvious that some of the fight scenes were with actors wearing bad masks.  Sometimes they didn't even bother to cover their hands and legs just slapped a little makeup on their faces.All in all very disappointing.  I won't bother with Zombie Flesh Eaters 3 Zombie 4 which was right beside this one at the video store.  That is 2 disappointing sequels too many I can only imagine how bad that one must be.....R.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was hoping for a little more.  Zombie Flesh Eater was originally released as Zombie 2 and was supposed to be a sequel to George Romero's excellent Dawn of the Dead.  After having seen Dawn I rented Zombie Flesh Eaters and it wasn't bad but it wasn't much of a sequel either.  This one was released in Italy as Zombie 3 but in North America as Zombie Flesh Eaters 2. Confusing eh?  It was supposed to be the second sequel to Dawn of the Dead. Hoping once again for a much better movie I rented it shortly after renting the first sequel.  This movie stunk.  It was terrible.  None of the zombie laws as established by George Romero were used despite the fact that it was supposed to be a sequel.

It is awful.What do you get when you take a marginal script tear out pages randomly give it to a director who doesn't want it and so quits halfway through give it to another director who happens to be the original author and ask him to fix it take 3 different stories and two sets of casts and throw all this into the blender.... you get Zombie 3! Slap Fulci's name on this garbage and you're guaranteed an international zombie blockbuster.The beginning of the film is fun in a Mystery Science Theater way. The actors and actresses do inexplicably stupid things to put themselves into harm's way. It is a miracle that any of them lived long enough to be become zombies. How often do you pull off the road run into a condemned building and yell Is anybody here? I just want drink of water. or park your car in the middle of the road on a curve so you can move some dead birds off the road?It goes downhill from there... During the second act we witness a man pull his girl friend from a pond while she is being eaten by God knows what and then jump into the water himself moments later to escape zombies on the bank. The zombie fish must have been full because they leave him unscathed. The end of the film isn't worth commenting on.The pacing is slow the story is incoherent the acting is bad the direction is nonexistant. The only positive that I could find was a few Fulci moments with backlit zombies emerging from the fog that was a little spooky. If you must see every zombie movie or are a die hard Fulci fan go see it. Wait I take that back if you're a die hard Fulci fan... don't see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hired out Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 expecting a decent film much like it's predecessor.  After all any film with zombies attacking sharks must be at least somewhat entertaining.  Unfortunately this film makes so many mistakes in 'Basic Filmmaking 101' it makes you wonder what the director was thinking.Firstly the plot of the film is virtually nonexistent.  Some unidentified terroristthief steals a case containing vials of some unidentified toxin which turns people into zombies.  Of course he gets the toxin all over his hand and so the atrocities begin.  Vast expanses of land in South East Asia are cordoned off to stop the toxin spreading. As a couple of sidenotes the toxin can go airborne so stopping people from entering an area is completely useless.  Also this movie was set in a remote part of Asia and yet almost everyone in the film speaks perfect English and is of caucasian decent. Marvellous!  The zombie man is killed and his body burned which only further spreads the toxin into the air and GASP into a flight of birds. These birds then attack a stereotypical group of teens on holiday and some Army soldiers on a break save the day.  For a full 90 minutes we contend with one cliched situation after another of these people slowly being killed off until only two escape in a scene directly stolen from Romero's movies.As mentioned earlier the characters are stereotyped and are so underdeveloped we don't even know half of their names.  Which makes it all to predictable to know who will die next. The amount of inconsistincies which occur with the zombies are incredible.  Some people turn into zombies instantaneously whilst others have hours of looking ill before attacking their friends 'unexpectedly'.Some zombies can talk whilst most can't.  That's right we get zombies speaking perfect English while attacking people which seems to have been unsuccessfully ripped from Return of The Living Dead.  Other zombies are armed with machetes or know hand to hand combat.  Instead of the now established lumbering mindless drones we are accustomed to we get fight scenes which wouldn't look out of place in Xena or Hercules and they simply detract from the whole movie even more.  The zombies also seem to be very fit bewing able to leap from roofs of buildings onto victims backs and run yes RUN! after people. They even have strategy like hiding under piles of hay and straw to attack people or pushing them into a pool filled with pirahnas I assume it was pirahnas as the watter bubbled when this person fell in and they emerged legless.  Then again when a male character jumped in the water 2 minutes later he was perfectly safe from killer fish Every convention established about zombies by Romero's movies and the original Zombie Flesh Eaters are broken in favour of trying to make an actionhorror movie.The effects of this movie are some of the cheapest ever seen for the time. This was the late eighties when prosethic props were in their prime and looking at their best.  In this film however the effects look even cheaper than in the first movie with the extent of the 'zombiefied' people as slightly blue skin that looks flaky.  In what was supposed to be a truly terrifying scene we find a pregnant mother in the hospital about to give birth before a hand bursts out her stomach and rips off a victim's face. It was more laughable than anything else.  As was the infamous 'Dismembered head in the fridge' scene which actually made me and my friends spurt forth beer from our mouths as we saw it.  Which was surprising because we weren't drinking at the time.I could go on forever about everything that made this film so wrong why was there only around 20 extras for the whole film and why do they make it so obvious that they are the same people by dressing them in the EXACT same waylook? or how could the guy at the end escape from the 7 zombies packed over his body trying to munch at his flesh? and why the hell do we get close combat scenes with the hero's faces only inches away from that of the zombie but their airborne toxin does not contaminate the hero but a poor porter at the start gets zombiefied by merely being in the same LARGE room as a zombie.  But I digress.Even a fan of this genre would do well to avoid this travesty as even if you set your expectations low this will still come WAAAAY lower.  Fulci did well to get away from this film in the early going and so should you. Unless you want to see a hysterically terrible film to laugh at with your mates avoid at all all costs".

Fun and Fresh!The plot reads When a string of zombie killings hits the coast it's up to the heroic Ulysses and his wildcard band of luchadores to find out whose behind it and to destroy the murderous undead.";

The main characters are largerthanlife celebrity heroes and who eat drink and sleep with their wrestling masks on and have to fend off autographhounds when they go for smokes. The story is minimal Zombie King wants to take over the world but each of the heroes has a past with at least one of the antagonists adding a feeling of depth to the story world. The fight scenes are fun if you go along with the idea that prowrestling moves are the best way to subdue an opponent. The music mostly surf music by the Tijuana Bibles carries the action very well. Allinall surprisingly entertaining. Just goes to show that lowbudget movies can work if done right. Also props for a cameo by Jim The Anvil Neidhart of WWF fame as the buttkicking local sheriff.".

	schema:headline " Terrible zero budget zombie wrestling film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Zombie Beach Party starts as zombie wrestler Tiki Rob 'El Fuego' Etcheverria plans to stage a wrestling match in a bar between himself  two flesh eating zombies. The zombies are kept out back away from the general public but barmaid Cherry Contessa Oblivian finds her follow barmaid  friend Blossom Sarah Murr dead half eaten from a zombie attack  with Tiki's zombies nowhere to be found everyone assumes that it was his zombies that were responsible. Everyoen that is apart from masked wrestler Ulysses Jules Delorme who believes his foll wrestler Tiki is innocent  sets out to prove it for no apparent reason. Ulysses  a few of his wrestler friends uncover not one but two plots by evil wrestler the Zombie King Nicholas Sinn the first is to create a hybrid zombie that can easily be controlled while the second involves contaminating the local water supply with infected zombie blood in order to create an unstoppable zombie army so he can take over the world Uylsses cannot let this happen...Also known under the title Zombie King and the Legion of Doom this straight to video Canadian production was directed by Stacey Case  is quite simply bad really bad. Obviously the script borrows the main theme of masked wrestlers as leading character's from the similar types of films from Mexico during the 60's  70's starring wrestler Santo fighting monsters including such wonderfully titled flicks like Santo Versus the Vampire Women 1962 Santo vs. the Diabolical Hatchet 1965 Santo vs. the Martian Invasion 1967 Santo vs. the Riders of Terror 1970  Santo  Blue Demon vs. Dracula  the Wolfman 1973 which sounds an absolute tag team riot. In fact all those Santo films are probably much better than Zombie Beach Party. Everything about Zombie Beach Party should have been fun the masked wrestlers as both heroes  villains the zombies the silly plot  the mixture of wrestling  horror but in the end it all sucks. This is just poor on every level from awful dialogue to a plot that makes no sense to to the slightly surreal world the makers try to create that ends up just coming across as ridiculous. There's some crap about creating hybrid zombies  releasing infected zombie blood into the local water supply to create an army of zombies but none of it is plotted out very well  makes little sense. The way Tiki manages to domesticate the zombies at the end is also laziness in the extreme he just touches them  with a magic 'ping' noise on the soundtrack that particular zombie is now friendly.Zombie Beach Party doesn't even deliver on the horror or wrestling aspects either the horror is lame  quite often there are day for night shots which look awful  the wrestling looks so fake staged  almost like two ten year olds play acting. It's really stiff  unconvincing with no proper moves at all people just seem to grab each other  shuffle around a bit. It really is that bad. There's a bit of poorly done gore there are a few ripped off heads but nothing else. Obviously shot on a low budget during one scene it starts  stops snowing in the background as it cuts between individual shots. The artwork on the DVD cover the one on the IMDb looks bright  colourful  like a comic book but the film never captures that sort of kitsch or brightness or feel.The IMDb says Zombie Beach Party had a budget of about 220000 which goes some way to explain why it looks so bad I suppose. The acting is atrocious even though most of the cast spend the entire film behind mask's the dialogue  acting is still so stiff  wooden it's cringe worthy at times.Zombie Beach Party is a terrible film it has no plot it has terrible acting  awful wrestling scenes that look like they were staged buy ten year olds  a lack of any horror aspects worth mentioning sinks it even further. What else can I say? I am sure the makers had enthusiasm  a liking for the genre on their side but that doesn't mean they know how to make a good film  ultimately they didn't.".

Ulysses  a few of his wrestler friends uncover not one but two plots by evil wrestler the Zombie King Nicholas Sinn the first is to create a hybrid zombie that can easily be controlled while the second involves contaminating the local water supply with infected zombie blood in order to create an unstoppable zombie army so he can take over the world Uylsses cannot let this happen...Also known under the title Zombie King and the Legion of Doom this straight to video Canadian production was directed by Stacey Case  is quite simply bad really bad. Obviously the script borrows the main theme of masked wrestlers as leading character's from the similar types of films from Mexico during the 60's  70's starring wrestler Santo fighting monsters including such wonderfully titled flicks like Santo Versus the Vampire Women 1962 Santo vs. the Diabolical Hatchet 1965 Santo vs. the Martian Invasion 1967 Santo vs. the Riders of Terror 1970  Santo  Blue Demon vs. Dracula  the Wolfman 1973 which sounds an absolute tag team riot. In fact all those Santo films are probably much better than Zombie Beach Party. Everything about Zombie Beach Party should have been fun the masked wrestlers as both heroes  villains the zombies the silly plot  the mixture of wrestling  horror but in the end it all sucks. This is just poor on every level from awful dialogue to a plot that makes no sense to to the slightly surreal world the makers try to create that ends up just coming across as ridiculous. There's some crap about creating hybrid zombies  releasing infected zombie blood into the local water supply to create an army of zombies but none of it is plotted out very well  makes little sense. The way Tiki manages to domesticate the zombies at the end is also laziness in the extreme he just touches them  with a magic 'ping' noise on the soundtrack that particular zombie is now friendly.Zombie Beach Party doesn't even deliver on the horror or wrestling aspects either the horror is lame  quite often there are day for night shots which look awful  the wrestling looks so fake staged  almost like two ten year olds play acting. It's really stiff  unconvincing with no proper moves at all people just seem to grab each other  shuffle around a bit. It really is that bad. There's a bit of poorly done gore there are a few ripped off heads but nothing else. Obviously shot on a low budget during one scene it starts  stops snowing in the background as it cuts between individual shots. The artwork on the DVD cover the one on the IMDb looks bright  colourful  like a comic book but the film never captures that sort of kitsch or brightness or feel.The IMDb says Zombie Beach Party had a budget of about 220000 which goes some way to explain why it looks so bad I suppose. The acting is atrocious even though most of the cast spend the entire film behind mask's the dialogue  acting is still so stiff  wooden it's cringe worthy at times.Zombie Beach Party is a terrible film it has no plot it has terrible acting  awful wrestling scenes that look like they were staged buy ten year olds  a lack of any horror aspects worth mentioning sinks it even further. What else can I say? I am sure the makers had enthusiasm  a liking for the genre on their side but that doesn't mean they know how to make a good film  ultimately they didn't.";

I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Even if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more enjoyable. You have been warned!";

Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice.Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little if anything depending on your point of view to do with zombies and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay.This film was crap in every category. Crap acting crap writing crappier sets and crappier makeup effects. The women don't look zombielike unless you count really dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk behave think and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse setup and even unless you are blind you can see the director failing. Steer clear it's a waste of time.110".

Even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.";

Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.The American cop has a German accent! The police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign Police Station hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.This cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag. The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because  he's a moron! The dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen. It is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesn't know what is happening! The director of this film is a total hack. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I won't waste anymore time on it writing this review. Absolutely WORTHLESS.".

As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.First off the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies but mindless debatable intelligent cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. Sure the eating and killing is there but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre it makes fun of that genre and asks the question why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines? I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much it's an insult and as for scarynot even.".

Stories don't cost a thing except time.....apparently they didn't have any time either.Zombie Nation had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers. The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about sounds kinda gross.....but it wasn't even that good.The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb won't allow me to use decimals.".

To make it more ridiculous they don't join forces but kind of  fight each other which didn't make any sense to me like many other  parts of this movie didn't. Many things in this movie are just thrown  in the pot and stirred without any logical explanation... best example  of the trashy script are the ridiculous sex scenes thrown in with some  booby shots all in one passage. The zombies are standard the gore is  minimal the acting is substandard and the sound of the movie in  dialogs is bad. After all it could have been a typical trashfest with  some humor like the ghettoboy with his cool slangtalk and zombiegore.  Unfortunately the staff couldn't decide which way to go and bored a  long way along the road to end up nowhere pretty much. The first ending  is as idiotic as in movies like Stink of flesh ... meaning it doesn't  have an ending. And the added rapture scene is pretty funny yet thrown  into the movie like everything else. There's too many better or at  least entertaining in a trashy way movies than this one so better  avoid Awakening.".

This film made on what would be considered a lower budget than the look of the film would belie used hundreds of actors to portray undead zombies. Dave Francis has worked with a dedicated team to create his apocalyptic vision. This work owes a nod as do so many in this genre to the cinematic tradition inspired by the Ed Wood school of horror and suspense that later brought us Night of the Living Dead which it owes much of its rehashed zombie styling to.

	schema:headline " Genuinely funnier than any comedy in recent memory";
	schema:reviewBody "Most great comedies are based on fundamental truths  we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy. Office Space is funny for example because we've all worked that type of job put up with that type of boss and suffered that type of monotonous everyday boredom.Todd Phillips' new movie The Hangover is as aptly titled as anything else released this year it's about a Vegas bachelor party gone horribly awry in which the groom inexplicably disappears no one can remember a damned thing and Mike Tyson wants his tiger back.Yes we've all had those nights though perhaps not to such extremes that's where the exaggeration of comedy serves us. The Hangover is funny because it takes this cultural ritual  an American tradition something almost all of us can relate to  and finds genuine humour in the pain of its aftermath.I concede that bachelor party movies are not in short supply the genre if it is indeed a genre should have probably both begun and ended with the Tom Hanks flick almost three decades ago. But The Hangover wisely studies the day after rather than the day itself this is funnier because the plot works backwards without tacky flashbacks and much of the evening in question is left to our imagination.While it would be misleading to claim this is a brilliant film in either regard  as comedy or character study it's an assured picture that finds its footing immediately and achieves a surprising level of sustenance throughout its running time. And frankly let's be honest this is a breath of fresh air it's one of the best Rrated comedies of the decade and certainly the most uproarious since Superbad was released two years ago. Most Rrated comedies produced today are defiant the Rrating has become a hindrance to film studios' sensibilities  everything is PG13 saving the shameless Unrated schpeel for the DVD cut. The occasional theatricallyreleased Rrated comedy as such is infrequently modest the ads stress the rating to remind us what we've been missing. For every legitimate offer such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall we're treated to movies like College that attempt to lure us into theaters based on the promise of raunchy decadence. The problem is that it's all so coldly calculated these films are not funny because a majority of the time they are simply lazy and dishonest.The simplest reason for The Hangover's success in being genuinely funny is the fact that it achieves a rare balance of character and vulgarity. We laugh at the characters' misfortunes because we like them we empathize with them and they are distinctly actualized. Are they stereotypical? To a certain degree sure we have the repressed pussywhipped guy who obeys his girlfriend's every command Ed Helms the weird John Belushiesquire figure who speaks in non sequiturs and nave absurdities Zach Galifianakis and the womanizer whose confidence renders him automatic leader of the group Bradley Cooper. It's a testament to the strengths of these actors that they make their characters endearing and believable even in the face of total lunacy.Helms has been an underrated highlight of the American Office for the past several years never quite earning the praise he deserves. His character on the show is played with pitchperfect perversity he's not overtly creepy like the program's other weirdo Creed but rather subtly unnerving. Helms invests a great deal of nuance into what is ostensibly a throwaway supporting goofball this movie if nothing else will justly reveal his talents.Cooper uses his looks to his advantage it's funny to watch handsome people exploit their securities. Cooper essentially turns your typical Leading Man figure into a bumbling idiot selfabsorbed and clueless. It's effective he's got great chemistry with the other guys and it's fun to watch such an immoral and ruthless character take center stage in a mainstream comedy.Galifianakis a cult comedian who I've admired for years has been struggling quite a while. Not many people other than myself and Sean Penn saw his 2001 comedy Out Cold probably because it wasn't all that great but he was easily the most amusing aspect of the picture. He once described himself as being gifted by the opposite of the Midas touch with more than a few canceled TV shows to his credit including Comedy Central's unheralded Dog Bites Man but it seems his persistence has finally paid off he has discovered at last a movie of strong enough quality to reflect his talents. Galifianakis has a fair share of the film's funniest dialogue as far as fat funny guys go many of them such as Chris Farley made the illfated mistake of playing dumb in a sharp fashion hurtful quips and silly oneliners all selfaware. Galifianakis plays his character straight and the laughs are subsequently heartier when he embraces his brotherinlaw while nude the act seems innocently awkward rather than deliberately awkward and that's what makes it so funny. He's described in The Hangover by another character as a child with a beard. Imagine how funny it is when he names a Caucasian baby Carlos without any shred of condescension or knowing humour.The Hangover is surely destined to become the sleeper comedy hit of 2009 and more likely a cult flick in the years to come. It's more deserving of such acknowledgment than many recent successes and while we may live in an era saturated with unnecessary sequels I actually left The Hangover hoping to see these guys again. And that's a rare feeling these days.".

The story looked like a bunch of toilet jokes and elementary grade humor slapped together resulting in a forgettable comedy that definitely doesn't live up to the hype. One of the worst moment in that movie was in the casino scene where they won over 800000 with the help of a black jack book I mean it looked like the script writer couldn't find a better way to get the characters out of that problem and he just went for the easy way with an all time classic and clich video editing scene just like the karate kid movies you know the whole be a champion in 2 minutes thing. The acting in some scenes looked like it came straight from a forgotten bgrade  straight to VHS movie. I know that a lot of people found that movie hilarious but I didn't find anything fresh in that movie it was the first time that at the end I pulled out my cellphone and started watching my sms out of boredom.".

Maybe the doctor could have magically just told them where there friend was. And those aren't even the worst parts.Dialogue I hardly feel like touching this but let's go. The nerd all he does is get abused and then start yelling then people laugh. Ha ha ha nerds yelling ha ha ha. The weird dumb guy insert non sequitur here that's pretty much every line in the movie. The Pretty boy who's a dick well he's just mean and for no real reason and as for the uninteresting groom well he only has like four lines and they aren't very good.In conclusion I wish I could rate this movie zero who ever programs this website might want to get started on that.".

Up to that point Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Justin Bartha and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Zach Galifianakis in particular was brilliant. Who is this guy???! The last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and I found the ending somewhat forced.HOWEVER everyone I talked with after the movie will be seeing it again.

I have become so used to the thought of the Judd Apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films but I realized very quickly into this movie that I was dead wrong. I think this movie was by far ten times funnier than Pineapple Express Forgetting Sarah Marshall Step Brothers etc. And I find each of those flicks truly hilariously funny.I remember watching Superbad the first time and thinking that that was the funniest movie ever made when it comes to films with legitimate plots and characters etc. And maybe Superbad and The Hangover are pretty close but who knows....So PLEASE see this film. The audience I saw it with was laughing hysterically every five minutes at least.

There were about 30 people in the theater when I watched it of a pretty good demographic spread and there were nearly NO LAUGHS through out the whole movie. At best a few people chuckled a few times. Some of the attempts at comedy are so so old. OK here are a couple little spoilers. In one scene one of the guys is face down on the ground about to get up  another one of guys opens up the car door and opens it bumping the guy laying down on the ground in the head so so stupid! This scene was funny in cartoons when I was under 10! Another spoiler coming in a different scene one of the guys finds a used condom in there car and they start grossing out and tossing it around so stupid and not funny anymore since I was 17. I can only understand the high reviews on IMDb that there are so many more potheads these days. If you are a pothead under 25 is the only demographic I can understand that can laugh from this.".

A cop car that's stolen but there's no man hunt for it a tiger in the bathroom but they're talking about it in the living room like they've had it happen to them previously. Meanwhile the nerdy guy is more scared of his fianc than the tiger! The hotel finds a bed thrown on a statue but assume it was thrown out of a window even though they don't have windows?????? What the hell! The tiger is drugged and put into their car to take it back to Mikes place? Have you lifted a tiger lately?? I know they are trying to be funny but they lost me from the beginning. By the time the photo's are shown at the end I was already over it. Not only that there are absolutely no consequences in the end for any of them. BOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNGGG! Yeah lets high five each other Amazing that Hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard and still make huge dollars. In conclusion rent Very bad things now that's a Vegas movie. And if you don't get what's going on in that movie like one person who called it an evil movie about a homicide........IT'S A BLACK COMEDY!!!".

We stuck it out to the bitter end only because so many people at the rental store said this was a very funny movie. Thanks to a couple of beers on hand I didn't die of complete boredom but we should have listened to the minority who said they turned it off after a few minutes.This movie contains trivial unfunny humor including lame butt jokes. The acting is ponderous and uninspired largely because the content is completely lame and due to the need to drag this movie out to featurelength. I could write funnier material than this if it was my job.Casting was also terrible. For instance the Fat Jesus character just wasn't crazy or ugly enough.The sleeping with the bartender joke was lame the first time. We didn't need it repeated 10 more times. Same with the Dr. Dentist joke.The portrayal of police officers and the physician as unprofessional was too uninspired to be funny.The movie is chockablock full of 4letter words and unimaginative insults yet every so often it throws in a kiddie swear word for no reason at all. Stupid on all counts!Why did Dr. Dentist ever think he'd get away with staying in Las Vegas when his girlfriend checks his credit card statements and he was billing the hotel room to his credit card? It wouldn't matter if the bill was for 100 or 10000 she would still see it was in Las Vegas not Napa.Never answered howwhy did these deadbeats meet Mike Tyson and how did Mike Tyson's tiger ever get to the hotel?Even the makeup was bad Doug should have much redder and his color was inconsistent between scenes at the end.".

Todd Phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter. From a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet this movie has everything. Seriously everything confirmed by the credit sequence.Phillips does not shy away from his formula. The movie centers around four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result of a wild Vegas night catalyzed by the foursome's out of control bachelor party. Set the day before one of the principle character's wedding the film is primarily seen through eyes of Doug the groomtobe Alan the lovable moron Stu the hopeless one and Phil the stud and in many ways the leader of the pack. The director of Old School does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it while gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters. Overall the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry. Just like the main characters we are eager to find out what happens or what DID happen. At the same time the strong relationship developed by the characters makes the viewer realize how much heshe cares about what ultimately happens to them. Chemistry is the secret to a good comedy it is about time somebody shows this understanding.I don't want to reveal too much but let me tell you this everything does get explained in the end except for the chicken aimlessly walking around in the hotel room but I mean it's a chicken. All of the actors succeeded in their roles admirably and I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys in more lead roles. Ed Helms hasn't made me laugh this hard since The Daily Show. Seriously guys. Go watch this movie you won't be disappointed.".

The clichs in Hangover are endless and the humor predictable.The ridiculous plot holes don't help. There's nothing wrong with absurd moments in comedies that aren't believable to get some laughs but come on. Personally I need some connection to reality to get a laugh. A tiger in the hotel room? And then the guy walking in the room to hand the tiger a steak instead of just throwing it in room and quickly leaving. Totally predictable. Although it was good to see the Mike Tyson cameo they totally wasted it with more random nonsense. It doesn't help that he's a terrible actor.Heather Graham who I used to love continues to throw her career in the effin garbage. Although her mere presence helped at least. Well seeing that this move got high marks from a lot of people we'll be stuck with this BS for awhile.

The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors. The performance that sticks out is Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan'. Zach has brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the point of a comedy masterpiece. As a film fan who is partial to only rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect this film reminds me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we enjoy it so much. My Dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in film. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not wish to say anything about the story. The best thing to do is to go and see this film for yourself and you'll realize what i'm talking about.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment that I saw the trailer for The Hangover I knew I had to see this movie I don't think I had laughed so hard watching a trailer in my life. But one thing I was kind of concerned about was how most movies just show the funny parts in the trailer and this would just be another Old School type of movie that would have no originality. I saw The Hangover this afternoon and I just can't believe how funny this movie was. The great thing about it as absurd as the story is seriously it's kind of realistic in some matter. I mean who hasn't had a morning where they woke up from a night of drinking and just cannot remember one thing about the night before? This is a comedy mystery story that just gets funnier with each scene that is played due to the strong cast great chemistry and a hilarious story.Doug is about to be married so his friends Stu Phil and Doug's soon to be brotherinlaw Alan take him to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Stu's girlfriend is very controlling thereby forcing Stu to lie to her about their destination. The guys get a suite at their hotel then sneak on to the roof of the hotel and toast to the night ahead. Skipping forward to the next morning the three groomsmen awake with no memory of the previous night. They find Doug missing Stu missing a tooth a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet. Initially they believe Doug to have gone out for breakfast but soon worry when his cell phone has been left behind. They collect what memories they have to figure what happened to Doug. They go through the whole town of Vegas discovering they messed with the Chinese Mafia Mike Tyson marrying a stripper and it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen I don't think I've laughed so hard consistently in a theater. Granted the movie has it's flaws not everyone is going to fully get it or have the same sense of humor but just to see Mike Tyson jam out to Phil Collin's In The Air Tonite is worth the ticket price alone. I don't think there isn't going to be one person I don't recommend this movie too. I think what did it for me was the cast they just had such great chemistry together and really made the movie work and took us with on this crazy story. All the side characters were a great laugh too with Heather Graham as Stu's stripper wife and the Chinese Mafia leader Leslie Chow who has the biggest WTF?! moment with getting out of their car trunk naked and beating the heck out of the boys. Trust me you have to see this movie if you liked Old School you will love The Hangover! If you have ever had those mornings when you woke up and don't remember anything this is the movie for you.910".

Bradley Cooper is coming into his own and I'm absolutely certain that he was born to play Emperor Caligula in a future Ridley Scott flick. The women as in most films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things are treated appallingly. They are the enemy that they have to protect themselves from or just escape run run as fast and as far as you can. Try to find the hooker with a heart of gold and if she looks like Heathter Graham that much better and forget about settling down. The Hangover has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009. I say well done it could have been worse".

The trailer is a perfect sample of what you're going to get although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the trailer hints. But it's never just sensationalism because I canregrettably I confessrelate to waking up in a room with a chicken and not knowing exactly from whence it came.Galifiankis has the most unique character well besides a naked Chinese fellow but you can discover that one for yourself and he's wonderful to watch. Not everything he does comes off 100 but when he scores it's so far out from our own comfort zone that when the jaws of the other characters drop we're right there with them. Rachel Harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why marriage can be so fearful.This is as tidy a script as My Best Friend's Wedding and just as beautifully shot. The cinematography could be pulled from any of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce ads and it only adds to our confidence that whatever is coming around the next corner we don't have to worry that it will wreck all that's gone before. The makers of this little gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control and it was joy to finally get a great farce that we're very sorry to see end.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the movie I was so unimpressed I felt like writing an ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film. However since it's currently in the IMDb top 250 and number one in the US box office being a bit more serious seems like a better choice since I think the irony probably would be lost on most people.The Hangover is about four guys who go to Las Vegas to attend one of the guy's bachelor party. They have a wild night and wake up the next morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous night. This setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film however they have failed on this one. Out of the running time I think I laughed about two times. It's a very excruciating thing to watch a film where even one joke falls flat in this one which is supposed to be a comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply aren't funny.The humor is crude sexist violent and still without going ever going over the line which is a problem. Comedies that go over the line like Borat for example really is my cup of tea but The Hangover never really dares to venture there. For example you are supposed to think the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid although he comes off as too pathetic for it to be funny.The plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the main characters they are all unlikeable in their own unique way. In movies it's important to have a logical thread going through the entire film and not introduce too many random characters or events that are not motivated especially not in the later half or so. In The Hangover way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which I suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious but it just comes off as bad scriptwriting.Worst of all though and what really puts me off in The Hangover is the glorified picture of Las Vegas it produces which unfortunately is very common in the mass media today. Las Vegas appears to be a paradise on Earth where you come to have fun win lots of money and still leave with a smile on your face no matter what happens. Because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Well let me tell you something I've been to Las Vegas. Never in my life have I been to a more horrid place. I would never ever want to go there again. To me Las Vegas really embodies all the bad parts of the American culture. Nothing feels real there it's all about surface and everything has this plastic artificial feeling to it. Commerce is what it's all about there spend money or lose it by gambling. None of this matters though because most of the average joes watching this film will never go there so film makers can continue to picture Las Vegas in this almost mythological way.".

Well it felt that way. Only it wasn't tickly but painful! All the situations gags jokes were warped and senseless. I'd rather spend 3 hours watching ants crawling.The only saving grace was was chunky pandey. His gags did make me smile occasionally. Anyway I think it is a waste of time writing about the movie.

Did he watch it himself before releasing it? If he did watch it and still release it he takes us to be absolutely dumb idiots.Have you ever tried tickling someone very hard to make him laugh? Well it felt that way. Only it wasn't tickly but painful! All the situations gags jokes were warped and senseless. I'd rather spend 3 hours watching ants crawling.The only saving grace was was chunky pandey. His gags did make me smile occasionally. Anyway I think it is a waste of time writing about the movie.

Each father wants his daughter to marry the richest soninlaw. Each daughter thinks she is marrying the richest soninlaw. Each soninlaw is pretending to be the richest soninlaw.

The FirstHour entertains while the SecondHour when all the characters come under one roof is equally entertaining  funny. Even the climax though loud its arresting. The Screenplay progresses rapidly  each character is memorable. Sajid Khan's Direction is fine. Music by SajidWajid is fabulous. PerformanceWise Mithun is a delight to watch. His portions stand out thanks to his performance. Rishi Kapoor  Randhir Kapoor are funny. Akshay Kumar is always dependable when it comes to comedy and he does well yet again. John Abraham is ordinary while Ritesh Deshmukh  Shreyas Talpade are only getting better. Boman Irani scores big time in a small role. Asin Thottumkal does a decent job. Jacqueline Fernandez Zarine Khan  Shazahn Padamsee get very limited scope. Chunky Pandey  Johnny Lever bring the house down they are impeccable. Ranjeet's Cameo is fun. On the whole 'Housefull 2' is a complete entertainer that's not meant to be taken too seriously. Go Have Fun!".

Randhir Kapoor is an average actor but again his character is similar to Rishi's. Mithun is brilliant but he is not their to make you laugh. Boman has 10mins role.

Abraham is average Shreyas is good Ritesh looks tired and bored mostly due to his role and Asin is quite at easelooks pretty.It's Rishi again who is brilliant in his comedy and delivers his dialogs with such gusto.Mithunda and Johny make a good pair and the use of Marathi liners are wellwritten and delivered.How ever Boman and Chunky were avoidable due to their loud acting.Ranjit the rapist !

Asin and Jacqueline are the main lead and looked gorgeous along with Zarine Khan and Shazahn Padamsee. Mithun Rishi and Randhir Kapoor  Boman Irani were perfect.

I feel every fimmaker should make a film that pleases them and the audience and not for reviews. However that does not mean they should take their audience for granted. Sajid does just that in this flick. I wasn't a huge fan of Housefull but still I found it enjoyable. I walked in the theaters expecting just a normal entertainer and what I get from this film is a lot of unanswered question.Why exactly do the Kapoors even hate eachtother? How is that AkkiJohn AsinJaquelin become friends again that quick? How do people not know Mithun's past despite him being one of the riches people of the UK? And that too in this high technology wikipediagoogle age? Why does John continue trying to con Randhir Kapoor if he wasn't the one they were suppose to con? The story is intended to confuse the viewer. That is okay but it's very flawed. Mithun all the sudden turning into a goon again is ridiculous! I mean are we idiots? I feel Sajid needs to go past these done to death identity confusion movies. David Dhawan and Priyadarshan have mastered this. I do feel Sajid is better than this. He showed that in his first film Heyy Babby.Writing is weak. Music is alright. Papa toh band bajaye is good. His direction is good but needs work on script. Dialogue is first rate however. A lot of questions come and go unanswered. That is the writing at fault. Sajid needs to do films with a plot instead of this crap. Heyy Babby still remains his best film.Akshay Kumar is good. Still his comedy is just not the same anymore. John is good. Ritesh is alrite. Shreyas is okay. Randhir Rishi and Mithun are great actors and do their job but needed better roles.Asin is wasted. Rest are okay.Overall  A disappointment that is a decent pass time but still is the worst of Sajid's films.".

	schema:reviewBody "After several flops in a row and Desi Boys being a comeback for Kumar he returns with Housefull 2 The Dirty Dozen. The film is the sequel to the only film from 2010 which was Akshay's successful film from that time. Plus the film promises to provide twice the entertainment with a dose of action with the comedy and the drama is also provided which is a must. From 2012 other than Agneepath Kahaani Ek Main Aur Ek Tu none of the other releases have impressed nor suceeded at the box office. However starting from April more films will do well business and Housefull 2 is the start of this year's more successful films. Though the film won't be a super hit and obviously not a blockbuster it will be a hit. The story is well narrated and the entertainment levels are high from every portion of the story. The subplots like the enemity of Akshay and John are like forms of extra entertainment to create that comedy magic people really want. But there are flaws in the script like every other film in the history of Bollywood. The major flaw with the film is madness and the silly portions like they end up in an island the off the top idea of a resort and Akshay and John fight and their sudden friendship and their fall into the swimming pool. Like Housefull Housefull 2 has gotten negative reviews but this time it is not double the negative for the mad film. There are several positive responses and the film will succeed. Akshay Kumar is the main formula to succeed the film. Though the film's performances are pretty good Akshay is the star face that is required to make a successful film. He just needs to choose the right films and not have more dreadful times like the last 2 years and from 19971999. This year will be his year as he has many good though Rowdy Rathore looks silly it will do good business. Like I said the dirty dozen entertain and this film will do good business though it is silly. But even Salman Khan's ready was extremely silly and got horrible reviews but it became a hit. Don't judge a movie by the few reviews it gets. Go watch Housefull 2 I swear this film will not let people down. Though it's silly it will be a decent entertainer. Overall a decent film and it is another Akshay film which will help not only revive his career but extend his line of hit films which he desperately requires.".

For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata a selfish detective  Siddiqui an eccentric life insurance agent  Saswata and a bhadralok Police officer  Khwaraj and last but not the least of a 300 year old city  Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals  Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people places and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh also the co writer whose recent claim to shame  an abysmal Aladdin or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re' the background songs mostly of RD Burman playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city the costumes by Sabyasachi the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score the noncondescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating you would surely ask for more a rare for a thriller!. I give this a 1010 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!P.S Please do not discuss the story with anyone else unless they have watched this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Genre  Suspense DramaReview  Kahani is indeed a worth for your money. A sincere effort to portray an incredible story which would leave you baffled would leave you keep guessing what is going on and what would happen next. We have seen several suspense movies that have a good build up but are utter disappointing in the end. Even after the climax it would keep surprising you till last shot. Truly a nice movie that you can with you Family and kids without hesitation. No abusive language no story Ki demand type intimate shots. A clean and gripping storyline. I liked that fact that story did not pushed a possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters and kept it straight and focused.Story of Girl Vidya looking for her missing husband is just the start. Movie is shot is Kolkata with characters that are real you can relate and can smile to natural gestures. Movie keeps you clutched to your seat. Its a story of nice people stuck in their own mess up routine offer help to the pregnant lady. Even with new actors jumping in with their cameo every now and then each has done full justice to their role.The story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual Kolkata.Verdict If you have been awaiting for a Good Bollywood Flick with original narration and quality acting the movie worth's every penny. A pleasure to watch with family or friends.Music  Consists of two songs different from stream line cinema. Amitabh Bachhan has brought a new spirit to Rabindra Da's Ekla Chalo Re. The other song  Ammi Shotti Bolchi is a authentic rock song on Kolkata theme in Usha Utthup's evergreen Bengali voice.Rating  8.510httpbollywoodwaale.commovies.php?movieid14Anjaneai".

We have seen several suspense movies that have a good build up but are utter disappointing in the end. Even after the climax it would keep surprising you till last shot. Truly a nice movie that you can with you Family and kids without hesitation. No abusive language no story Ki demand type intimate shots. A clean and gripping storyline. I liked that fact that story did not pushed a possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters and kept it straight and focused.Story of Girl Vidya looking for her missing husband is just the start. Movie is shot is Kolkata with characters that are real you can relate and can smile to natural gestures. Movie keeps you clutched to your seat. Its a story of nice people stuck in their own mess up routine offer help to the pregnant lady. Even with new actors jumping in with their cameo every now and then each has done full justice to their role.The story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual Kolkata.Verdict If you have been awaiting for a Good Bollywood Flick with original narration and quality acting the movie worth's every penny. A pleasure to watch with family or friends.Music  Consists of two songs different from stream line cinema. Amitabh Bachhan has brought a new spirit to Rabindra Da's Ekla Chalo Re. The other song  Ammi Shotti Bolchi is a authentic rock song on Kolkata theme in Usha Utthup's evergreen Bengali voice.Rating  8.510httpbollywoodwaale.commovies.php?movieid14Anjaneai";

	schema:reviewBody "Who would expect that someone who directed 'Home Delivery' could create magic. Sujoy Ghosh's 'Kahaani' is a mouth watering treat for any movie lover. Right from the very beginning till the end the tight narrative keeps the viewer on his toes without any hiccups whatsoever. Starring Vidya Balan as Vidya BagchiBidya Bagchi as a wife who is in search of his husband Arnab Bagchi and in its course arrives in Kolkata all the way from London even though she is pregnant. The story follows her search at the same time playing with your mind with many twists and turns. After a long time have I seen a film in which every actor has given a peach of a performance and thus requires a special mention. From Parambrata Chatterjee who plays the role of inspector Rana who helps Vidya find her husband to Office Khan played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui to even Saaswata Chatterjeeas who plays the serial killer Bob every one is brilliant. I am really looking forward to more actors from the Bangla film industry to shine in Bollywood. The script is tight with loop holes you don't even bother worrying about and to add to that the haunting background score that gives you the true feeling of a thriller. Though it awkwardly seems a bit longer than its 2 hour running time I still won't mind watching it again. And yes Vidya Balan our very own Meryl Streep is almost certain to get another filmfare and national award. Of course the year has just started but i might just be disappointed if she doesn't get it. Ha! really satisfied with Kahaani.7.510 for Kahaani and another 0.5 for the collective acting performances of the cast. Audience which included a lot of family and friends  3.55".

Disordered links and remainders of Vidya's past conversations with Arnab are her fragile hopes.

The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in Kahaani make for an outstanding watch.

The swiftness of the movie leaves no time for the audience to mentally prepare for an upcoming situation. While Vidya accepts herself as Bidyain the City of Joy gifts a chocolate to the kid in the lodge and breaks the lock of National Data Centre the contract killer Bob Biswas Saswata Chatterjee playfully murders people and Khan Nawazuddin Siddiqui smokes out his dedication towards his work besides a mouthful of white air.

The festive mood of the city the preceding and the succeeding of it the red of sindoor and the expressions of the idols of Durga have been phenomenally wellutlised in the movie. Balan is a breeze of fresh air in Bollywood which is suffering from the curves of furniture heroines and Kahaani another robust step after the recent The Dirty Picture towards reinforcing the position of heroines in a traditionally herodriven Bollywood. The subtlety with which the soul of the city has been interlaced in the screenplay while not losing grasp on the flow of the story even for a moment is a testimony of effectual storytelling. There is not a single scene in the movie where Parambrata has been overshadowed by the presence of Balan. His acting skills are distinctly sharp and flowing. Sujoy Ghosh's choice of actors for the various characters in Kahaani has made an immense contribution towards the kind of impact it leaves on the viewers long after they abandon the theatre. After all Shotti sounds better as Shotti not Sotti. The climax even though prudent and reasonably wellbaked is slightly dramatic and seems to conclude the movie before clearly justifying the actions of Vidya and Satyoki especially the latter. The momentum of the story towards the end beats its own record and the circumstances merging with the mood of the city seems to be not so much of a coincidence. Bagchi's Kahaani is one of those that would define tougher standards for the forthcoming Fridays. Why on earth would you like to miss the benchmark? Watch it. Definitely!".

But out of the blue the womencentric flicks is fast turning out to be a bankable genre. KAHAANI is a commanding story has an authoritative central character has several dominant and thoughtprovoking moments which makes it an allpersuasive film. Vidya Balan makes Kahaani come alive. It is several notches above the stuff we've been subjected to in the past. The movie triumphs in evoking emotions. You experience compassion resentmentdefenselessness and triumph at a variety of stages. A wonderful moviegoing experience you come out feeling a sense of pride pleasure and fulfillment after having watched KAHAANI. There no surprise if Vidya get all the best actress awards in 2013 also. Just do not miss it. Hugely recommended!".

KAHAANI is a commanding story has an authoritative central character has several dominant and thoughtprovoking moments which makes it an allpersuasive film. Vidya Balan makes Kahaani come alive. It is several notches above the stuff we've been subjected to in the past. The movie triumphs in evoking emotions. You experience compassion resentmentdefenselessness and triumph at a variety of stages. A wonderful moviegoing experience you come out feeling a sense of pride pleasure and fulfillment after having watched KAHAANI. There no surprise if Vidya get all the best actress awards in 2013 also. Just do not miss it. Hugely recommended!";

	schema:headline " Kahaani Review Scintillating Blockbuster Must Watch";
	schema:reviewBody "There are a few movies which will keep you glued to the screen. You will be sitting on the edge of the seat and your mind will be making a million possible permutations to deduce what will happen next. Very few of them come from Bollywood. If ever there was a blockbuster movie from Bollywood Kahaani is better than that. Read on to know why Kahaani is a must watch.Plot It's a crowded metro. Hundreds of travellers are waiting to reach their destination. They are killed with a chemical weapon. Two years later Vidya Bagchi Vidya Balan is a pregnant woman comes to India in search of her husband Arnab Bagchi Indraneel Sengupta who has been missing. She can't find a trace of him and is determined to solve the puzzle. In the search for Arnab Vidya stumbles on Milan Damji who is a lookalike of her husband and is a prime accused in the metro attack.All the clues to the case are being eliminated one by one. The Intelligence Bureau is involved and the hunt is on. Vidya is being helped by a local police officer Rana alias Satyaki Parambrata Chattopadhyay. They are warned by the Intelligence Bureau to stay away but how long can they continue their search? Why was Arnab missing? What is his identity? Will he ever be found? These are but a few questions that the story will answer you. Be ready to be taken on a rollercoaster ride.Analysis The movie is a dramathriller. This genre requires exquisite attention to detail and a very well written script. A small blunder can make or break your movie. Kahaani has it all. With a brilliant story Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala and a screenplay that runs along at a pace that will make you glued to the screen the director has paid attention to every possible detail to ensure nothing is left in a hush.Coming to performances by the cast Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana is subtle and delivers a splendid performance. He is a wellknown figure in Bengali cinema and his entry to Bollywood could not have been better. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the IB Deputy Director is just picture perfect. It is tough to imagine that he is the same character who played the pickpocket in Munnabhai MBBS. In a role as a ruthless cop he does ample justice to the role and delivers a power packed performance.Rest of the cast Saswata Chatterjee as a hit man Darshan Jariwala as the former IB agent Indraneel Sengupta as the rouge agent Milan Damji and as Arnab Bagchi and every other member of the cast have delivered wonderful performances and not one of them looked out of place.Finally coming to Vidya Balan what do I say about her? With Five brilliant performances in a row she is unstoppable. She manages to reinvent and elevate herself with every performance and in Kahaani she just does that all over again. If The Dirty Picture won her rave comments from even the harshest of critics Kahaani has just pushed the barrier a few notches higher.She not only carries out the role with complete perfection she looks every bit of the character that is written for her. She has conveniently steered way ahead of her competitors to stake the claim as the best actress in India. The review is stretching out too long or else I could have written an entire essay on how brilliant her performance was.The director Sujoy Gosh has just opened the gates to endless praise. He has handled the subject in a manner that would shut even the harshest of critics. The element of suspense is kept throughout the movie and not once does the script turn out predictable. Crisp dialogs backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better.The camera work by Setu is apt Screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas is just perfectly paced Editing by Namrata Rao is crisp and costumes by Sabyasachi Mukherjee for Vidya Balan and Suchismita Dasgupta just blend into the story perfectly. Music by Vishal Shekar is subtle and the rendition of Ekla Chalo Re by Amitabh Bachchan is just fantastic. In the end the movie is a case of all the right things at the right place in the right hands.StudentLive's Verdict I will just keep this short Kahaani is a must watch. If Paan Singh Tomar started a different trend in Bollywood Kahaani just takes it further. Don't even think of giving this one a miss. I will go with 4.5 out of 5 for Sujoy Gosh's Kahaani. It is a wonderful gift to cinema on Women's day and Holi.P.S Pardon me for the slightly lengthy review Kahaani deserves every bit of praise. Source www.studentlive.in".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Kahaani";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins in 2008 where we bear witness to an unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind a gas mask experimenting with a lethal chemical gas on lab rats before we get to the city of Kolkata where the same weapon of mass destruction got used in a terrorist attack on a subway train that unfortunately wasn't stopped in time. This almost standalone setup and prologue will keep you guessing its significance to its story since the film continues two years later where Balan's Mrs Vidya Bagchi arrives in the same Indian city from London in search of her husband Arnab Abir Chatterjee who as a software engineer worked at the National Data Centre and maintained daily contact until his sudden disappearance two weeks before with the uncharacteristic cessation of contact prompting his wife to travel thousands of miles to look for him.Worried the heavily pregnant Vidya heads straight to the local police to file a missing persons report and from there starts to visit some of the regular joints her husband could have been in including his hotel room which had absolutely no traces of the man nor with people she encountered at those places having any recollection of having seen him based on their hastily taken matrimonial photo. Assisted by policeman Rana Parambrata Chaterjee a slight mild mannered cop they soon stumble upon an investigative web filled with unanswered mysteries and a bewildering suggestion that her husband may not be who he had claimed to be all along. The name Milan Damji gets floated about a government agent in the mould of Jason Bourne who may hold the key to Arnab's disappearance again with clues that he may be more than meets the eye and at this point your imagination will start to run wild as to the myriad of possibilities the story written by Sujoy Ghosh could turn out.Ghosh also takes on directing responsibilities and he has crafted one heck of an engaging thriller amongst some of the best I've seen with scheming twists and carefully plotted turns involving government officials beat cops and Intelligence Bureau officers led by the non compromising Khan Nawazuddin Sidiqui who epitomizes a nononsense approach with a willing streak to sacrifice pawns to nab the king. With Vijay pushing for the truth a slew of bodies start turning up courtesy of a hired killer set loose to silence everyone she talks to giving rise to that sense of danger and death at every wrong turn it's a closely matched up cat and mouse game everyone seems to be playing against one another on both sides of the law with Khan's questionable tactics giving rise to the propensity of collateral damage authorities are willing to suffer for the sake of the greater good.But Ghosh also remembered to balance his superb thriller with emotional anchors and does this brilliantly through his crafting and development of the protagonists Vijay and Rana whom we journey together in their search for facts and truth. They play off each other's strengths like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully with Rana's unassuming disposition balancing Vijay's sprightly nature and relentless determination making this one of the best cop civilian pairing I have ever seen as well being all natural and therefore believable. Credit has to go to Vidya Balan for her sensitive portrayal as a woman hell bent on tracking down her loved one and seeking closure to the sudden mysteries in her life and Parambrata Chaterjee for his portrayal of a man taking it upon himself to help and unwittingly finding himself being attracted to and infatuated with someone he has sworn to protect as well. It is this forbidden attraction and romance that's underlying and brewing that he brings out well without going over the top exhibiting loads of sentimentalism that worked wonders for their chemistry with each other.Production values are top notch. I absolutely love the gorgeous city of Kolkata which I've seldom seen in Indian films and here we weave in and out the crowded bustling city area and into much laid back neighbourhoods with a fantastic capture of very natural miscen scene being a lovely ode to the city featuring its sights sounds people such as the working class from tea sellers to master craftsmen and festivals. Production designers Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik ensured a very natural look and feel while cinematographer Setu didn't impress me much with his shaky cam technique that had plagued too many Hollywood films he tried to emulate but thankfully the second half of the film decided to ditch that misguided documentary feel for camera work that's more sustainable and traditional. The music by Clinton Cerejo and Shekhar Ravjiani worked extremely well in the background without bringing in too much attention to itself nor do we have jarring breakaway musical interludes to blunt the storyline. Such is how everything worked together to complement everything else in the making of the film to churn out a result that's worthwhile of repeat viewings for clues that one may have missed the first time round. It's filmmaking and storytelling at its best and even I was more than glad to have decided to watch this instead of postponing it. Kahaani propels itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year and it is certainly highly recommended if you're desperately looking for an intelligent story great performances a film that went the whole nine yards in its desire to become a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me say right now that this is not your usual Bollywood runofthemill. If you are expecting typical Bollywood masala with hide and seek romance dancing around trees superhero fight scenes and 'filmy' dialogue you will find it in the remaining 999 films that the Indian film industry has on the 2012 assembly line. What works for Kahaani is its atypical narration arising from a well written story first class cinematography in tandem with good soundtrack and the performance of a leading actress whose very mention signals the changing face of Indian cinema.Arriving from London a heavily pregnant Vidya Bagchi Vidya Balan heads straight to the Kalighat police station in Kolkata to enquire about her missing husband. With the help of Rana Parambrata Chatterjee a rookie cop Vidya begins to unravel the mystery behind her husband Arnab's disappearance. Together their investigation leads to dead ends but not before learning that Arnab may be linked to a terrorist agent operating as a mole within the Indian Intelligence Bureau. Wrestling with this possibility Vidya finds herself digging into a high profile federal coverup even as an assassin trails her every move.Cowritten by director Sujoy Ghosh Kahaani is a well crafted thriller that is simply too good by Bollywood standards current or past. Gosh has not only set a new benchmark in Indian cinema his overall production quality is far superior to some of his counterparts across the globe. Even so the true mettle of his work is in resisting the temptation to glorify India's stand on terrorism through nationwide propaganda. Instead Gosh pays close attention to the screenplay and how it develops through the narration. Pacing is consistent with a serious tone but well punctuated with some suspense driven moments and subtle humor when you least expect it. Another strongpoint is in keeping the audience guessing all the way to the diabolical twist in the end. To avoid spoiling the surprise I will just say that this could be borrowed from a certain Angelina Jolie film but be that as it may the conclusion here is totally unpredictable and forms the icing on the cake. There are some factual and chronological goofs but there is no point going there because no film is 100 perfect.Dating back to the late 17th century cinematography captures the historical essence of one of India's oldest cities  a 300 year old artifact if you wish  in superb celluloid rendition. Gosh gives Kolkata a pulsating heart without unnecessary exaggeration while simultaneously capturing the hustle and bustle and nooks and crannies of the city with deft camera work. Using this huge backdrop along with the festival of all festivals The Durga Puja Gosh underlines the film's formidable theme of motherhood in seamlessly integrating the fragility of a woman with her inbuilt yet Godgiven power to sustain life. From joy to heartwrenching sorrow Vidya Balan personifies this ideology with perfection. Fresh off the critical success of The Dirty Picture Balan is emerging as a powerful force in female driven plots. While this could very well change the perception on Indian cinema this a welcome change and one that is long overdue. I am smitten as I am awestruck. Also worth mentioning are Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a difficult IB agent. Together their roles add vital support to Balan's as well as holding up the plot structure.As this is my first Hindi movie review I only hope that I have given this movie the recognition it deserves. Considering my fondness with all things Hollywood Ms. Vidya Balan and director Sujoy Ghosh have renewed my faith in Indian cinema. I cannot wait to see Balan's next movie. Watch this space.".

There lies the mystery as from every corner Mrs Bagchi is proved that her husband hadn't been to this city. Even his existence seems to be a mere figment of imagination. Things get complicated as IB department of country shows interest in the case. Revealing a single suspense of this gripping thriller will be a crime and it is must watch for all lovers of suspense thriller.

That's the most successful poi of this riveting thriller which can be compared to best of the thrillers in the world. The cone of this Cornetto is city of Joy Kolkata who is the true protagonist of the tale. The violence lurking in the bylanes of the city the mystery flowing with the murmuring sound of the Ganges there is an air of conspiracy and Ghosh's script rightly captures that. Ritesh Shah who wrote the dialogs of the film deserves mention to consummately penning down the thoughts of Ghosh. Thankfully there is no clich involving Kolkata which were shown in earlier film made on this city. Adding to the beauty there is Setu's camerawork which portrays Kolkata like never before in Hindi celluloid. Ghosh is gifted with brilliant technical team who did their best to make a captivating thriller in such a shoestring budget. Namrata Rao is another hero of the film. She gave the razor sharp cuts much needed in a thriller like this and her editing abilities will surely get her phone ringing for more thrillers. The background score did the much needed haunting effect to compliment the proceeding without going overboard. There are two songs in the film. Ami Sotti Bolchi which is there in the beginning is kind of introduction to the city as well as story. Usha Utthup's voice creates the aura of suspense. Amitabh Bachchan rendered his voice to Tagore's ekla chalo re which somehow worked. Vidya Balan is the pillar of Kahaani. Her character VBidya Bagchi is epitome of strong quintessential woman who is strong to take care of herself and at the same time vulnerable to regular emotions of life. This is the role which actresses will die for and luckily the role chose Vidya Balan who is beyond competition. One of the finest actress of our generation she can display any role with perfection. From Ishqiya to Paa No one Killed Jessica she went a notch higher with The Dirty picture and now sealed the top spot with Kahaani. She deserves the best actress awards once again. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the loud mouthed IB office Khan had superb screen presence. His voice modulation will lead him to such meatier roles in near future. Parambrata Chatterjee aptly cast as Inspector Sinha added the soft side to the story with his unsaid love for Vidya. He was powerful even when he didn't mouth any dialogs through his expressive eyes. Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas was scene stealer. Whenever he landed on screen people knew something is going to happen and with his expression he just stole the show. One of the finest actors in Bengal today he must get noticed after this brilliant performance in national circuits as well. His scenes with Vidya in the metro station just prior and after the interval are one of the best sequences of the film. Revealing his character will die down certain elements of suspense. Kharaj Mukherjee as podge thana head was adequate and provided some comic relief without getting too loud. Indraneil Sengupta Dhritiman Chatterjee Darshan Jariwala Falguni Chatterjee as manager of Monalisa lodge let their presence felt. Special mention to the two kids who can give the big stars run for their money. Kahaani again proved Story is the real winner. If you have a good story you can compromise on budget and still make a engaging film. Kahaani should become a guide book for those who want to make thrillers. With Agent VinodShanghaiTalaash on the cards hopefully good thrillers will revive in celluloid. Till then salute to the whole team of Kahaani and hope Sujoy Ghosh forgets his Alladin days and make another thriller as riveting as Kahaani. Watch Kahaani and experience neobollywood aami sotti bolchi!!".

If we try to see in depth the movie itself contains a lot of things which we are not aware. Govt loopholes carelessness and similar things.

Unlike usual movies this is a femaleoriented movie executed well especially by Vidya and the other cast  crew. We have seen in the past many bold leading actress like Sridevi Madhuri Dixit who were not just heroines supporting heros. Vidya is such an actress of great talent and caliber in this era.Its a good watch. I give an 810 for this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being an avid thriller watcher when I heard about the movie's script being riveting  I smirked in disbelief. Yes Since Sujoy Ghosh had only one movie  Jhankar Beats  that was considered good enough to be critically acclaimed but that too had a very limited audience. But with this one he proves his mettle and leaves viewers relishing the masterpiece served on the screen.The narration beautifully picks up developing on each character closely conveying the nuances that they would possess and along with it allowing the viewer to anticipate all kinds of possibilities that each turn of event would bring. But the moment you start to believe and make conclusions the story convolute in such a logical manner that you feel like a fool even trying to decipher the code. Saying anything more about the script would be highly unjustified however all the characters be it minor or major deserve applause for their wonderful performances  that lets you believe that this could indeed and would happen to anyone in such a scenario.The most important character being essayed in the movie is the City of Joy  Kolkata  and even if the movie in the entire duration portrays it as a festive city it starts getting on your nerves  never letting you realize what is really scary about it.Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi.. Mesmerizing.. Nothing more to say as it would be saying too much about the character.The problem with thrillers is that usually it either fails to satisfy when the final suspense is reveled or in order to make the suspense completely unpredictable the story is presented as something that is far from reality or something which would leave the viewers completely confused about the suspense. Kahaani does none of this but it enthralls you with completely logical consequences of events  and making you wonder why you never thought of it in the entire movie.A must watch for the international viewers who only treat Indian Films as melodramatic or over the top. This proves that with a beautiful and engaging storyline despite being low budget there is no need for any huge starcast or pompous publicizing  to make a movie  success.".

The movie lives up to its name for more than you could have asked for.The story starts with a pregnant Vidya Balan as Mrs Vidya or Bida Bakshi who comes from London to Kolkata to search her missing husband. There he meets Parambrata who helps her with her case. Her husband 'Arnab Bakshi' works at National Data Center NDC. NDC hotel where he stayed his uncle no one has heard of a name 'Arnab Bakshi' and Vidya continues to insist her point . The first clue takes them to Mrs Agnes who is the HR of NDC. She tells them of some 'Milan Damji' who looks like Arnab. A series of phone calls and next we know Agnes is dead. In comes Mr Khan some police head from Delhi. He is trying to protect the identity of 'Milan Damji' and we get the hint of he being the bad guy. At intermission you know you have a winner at hand and the plot keeps you intrigued .Then as the story proceeds to clues one after another all of them die in the hands of a contract killer 'Bob'. They finally come to know of Shridhar who is the chief of NDC who kept visiting 'Milan' and before Khan comes to the rescue of Vidya  Rana from Shridhar Vidya kills him. This is where we get the first twist in the tale.. Khan  Rana were using Vidya to find a terrorist named 'Milan Damji' who was responsible for train attacks in Kolkata. If you think this is it then hold on till the story unfolds. Any more revelations beyond this point would not do justice to this kahaani.Bob as the contract killer is brilliant. Nawazzudin as Mr Khan is rock solid. Parambrata as Rana supports Vidya to the core and yet again Vidya Balan delivers a stellar performance proving why she is amongst the best actresses we have. Director  Story writer Sujoy Ghosh brings to us a rare 130 minutes 'kahaani' that relives the genre of thriller movies in Bollywood.This one's for the win. Do not miss it.".

First they wrote a story then they said given this Kahani let us write a Kahani around this Kahani and then another Kahani around the Kahani around Kahani. They decided to call the movie also 'Kahaani'. What struck most was the love of Calcutta that the film maker has. Looks like he has done an independent shoot of the city's charms and has edited and mixed these later into the scenes as fillers. This aspect is very striking and has a lasting impact. The final story line is interesting too but I know that the excitement that the movie offered is going to soon become pointless. I am much less excited about the movie now than 2 hours back when I walked out of the theatre. Calcutta and the plot was very good. The film fails at integrating the emotions into the movie. Here and there pieces of emotions like seeds in an orange that you are better off spitting out.For current times mainstream cinema it is an excellent movie though. Film also fails in it's characterizations to a big extent where people portrayed as kingpins do the dumbest things. It is definitely worth a one time theatre watch. You don't lose your money for sure. Yes some things might not work very well with you but lots of things will. The 'EkLa Chalo Re' rendering by Shri Amitabh Bachchan is a great ending to the movie and reinforces the film maker's passion for Calcutta.That is the strongest thread in the movie and I have been to Calcutta just once and in my schooldays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kahaani is a 2012 Hindi Feature Film directed and cowritten by Indian movie maker Sujoy Ghosh. By striking a delicate balance between the elements of Comedy and Tragedythe two masks that define the Drama genre Kahaani serves to be a quintessential Drama while simultaneously succeeding in walking the tightrope of Mystery and Suspense. Kahaani depicts the fascinating tale of a Londonbased IT Professional Vidya VenkatesanBagchi masterfully portrayed by Vidya Balan in desperate pursuit of her spouse who has gone missing in the bewitching city of Calcutta now Kolkata. In a heavily pregnant state Vidya Bagchi arrives in Calcutta to pursue the search of her husband Arnab Bagchia Firewall expert who has mysteriously disappeared in his native city of Calcutta. Right from the moment Vidya Bagchi sets foot in Calcutta a miasma of doubt and denial seems to occlude her strenuous pursuit. The apparent sympathy of the local police seems to betray simultaneously a sense of helplessness and sneer that further aggravates the torment of her abject solitude. Incapacitated by her lack of wherewithal and the fatigue of pregnancy Vidya desperately roams about the city of Calcutta where she is greeted by the ugly realities of an ancient underworld waiting to unleash its fury. Amidst the city's perpetual hullabaloo Vidya's only hope lies with Inspector Satyoki 'Rana' Sinha subtly portrayed by Parambrata Chatterjeea local cop with a pleasing demeanor and innocent disposition. The natural affinity between Vidya and Rana soon develops into mutual bonding of trust respect and affection as the two delve deep into the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Arnab Bagchi. Kahaani's ostensibly straightforward plot has its fair share of intricacies that keeps the viewer interested until the movie's jaw dropping climax. With Kahaani Vidya Balan adds yet another feather to her acting cap. Riding high on her tour de force in The Dirty Picture 2011 Balan packs yet another punch with a powerful portrayal of a bemused pregnant woman in pursuit of her missing husband. Balan in a bid to make up for her delayed entry into the Hindi Film Industry seems to go from strength to strength making most of the purple patch that she has been enjoying since the success of Amitabh Bachchan starrer Paa back in 2009. In a short career spanning just over six years Balan has incredibly managed to conjure up a handful of larger than life portrayals be it her chilling portrayal in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2007 or her earthy portrayal in Ishqiya 2010. What makes Vidya Balan unique is her great ability to get into the skin of the characters. In an industry stricken by glamor Vidya dauntlessly seems to tread a path of her own that's richly paying its dividend. In the process Balan has undoubtedly succeeded in getting her name registered in an elite club of performancedriven actresses who over the years have done Indian Cinema proud. In Kahaani Sujoy Ghosh seems to have settled for a trade off between his creative aspirations and commercial compulsions. Kahaani's multi layered plot presents a nice blend of Drama and Suspense with undercurrents of Noir. The presence of an extremely peculiar serial killer considerably spices up Kahaani's plot and adds immensely to its entertainment value. In contrast to depicting the classic caricature of a damsel in distress Kahaani beautifully propagates the complex caricature of the beguiling city of Calcutta. Like any developed city of the world Calcutta too seems overwhelmed by lies and liars and ironically the only refuge seems to exist at the very epicenter of chaos. Satyajit Pande's topnotch cinematography adds great detail to the movie at different levels and is well complemented by Vishal  Shekhar's background music. The word 'Kahaani' translates to 'A Story' in English and Ghosh does full justice to its meaning by offering a masterclass in storytelling and managing a nice assemblage of Stage and Television actors who give memorable performances in Kahaani with special mention of Sasawata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.as A. Khan. Ghosh and his dedicated team remarkably triumph in their daunting attempt to bring the enchanting city of Calcutta to life as Woody Allen had managed with the City of Love in Midnight in Paris last year. Overall Kahaani is a wonderful cinematic experience that certainly goes beyond the realm of entertainment. However despite the brilliant execution the movie faces occasional slipups owing to some forced incorporation of gimmicks and misdirection at certain points in the plot. From the Box Office point of view the success of Kahaani is a great testament to the fact that a movie can flourish even in the absence of aggressive marketing and promotion as long as its high on quality and has an element of uniqueness about it. Kahaani also marks the beginning of a new era in Indian Cinema where filmmakers are intelligent enough to take into account the commercial considerations and practical limitations pertaining to moviemaking but not at the expense of creative liberty. 810httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Ipkiss Jim Carrey is a bit of a dorky pushover. For example he buys hot concert tickets to try to get a date with a fellow bank employee he's been pining after but she easily scams him into keeping the tickets for herself and he is too weak to publicly object. But when he comes across an ancient mask of Lodi long ago discarded by Vikings who tried to bury the troublesome object at the end of the Earth he discovers it has the power to unlock his true selfsuave smoothtalking manic a bit dangerous and a hopeless romantic.The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubberfaced antics in a manner even more overthetop than what he'd become famous for but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon 1999 The Majestic 2001 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004.The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course the amazing special effects and makeup help as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography but with the wrong actor in the part the whole affair could have easily collapsed.

	onyx:emotionText "Stanley Ipkiss Jim Carrey is a bit of a dorky pushover. For example he buys hot concert tickets to try to get a date with a fellow bank employee he's been pining after but she easily scams him into keeping the tickets for herself and he is too weak to publicly object. But when he comes across an ancient mask of Lodi long ago discarded by Vikings who tried to bury the troublesome object at the end of the Earth he discovers it has the power to unlock his true selfsuave smoothtalking manic a bit dangerous and a hopeless romantic.The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubberfaced antics in a manner even more overthetop than what he'd become famous for but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon 1999 The Majestic 2001 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004.The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course the amazing special effects and makeup help as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography but with the wrong actor in the part the whole affair could have easily collapsed.

	schema:reviewBody "If you ask me 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults but it's original imaginative creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or to use only one word to describe it Smokin!Jim Carrey can be two things either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easygoing guy with great sense of humor which matches his funny name. He is the nicest guy yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends except for his coworker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo a Jack Russell Terrier. Stanley likes to watch cartoons particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama Jim Carrey also portrays the title character The Mask which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example he can dance like Fred Astaire Gumby and Barishnikov all together  and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet despite its cartoonish humor it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time this movie is clearly inspired in many ways on several cartoons such as the Looney Tunes Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live actionanimation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds as well as great lines nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here she was more curvy sexier so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus she was great in this role. In fact she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film with a husky jazzlike voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding' where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a liveaction version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters along with Stanley Ipkiss are Charlie Schumacher Milo Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs Hey Pachuco and Cuban Pete  this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he as The Mask dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles Jim Carrey Cameron Diaz Peter Riegert Peter Greene Ben Stein Amy Yasbeck Richard Jeni Nancy Fish Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty but also for being lovable playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear joy and sadness for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember back in the day with the hit TV show In Living Color had several stars one of them being Jim Carrey. He was one goofy guy with crazy physical comedy routines that could get your stomach hurting from laughing so much. But could this man make it to the top and possibly bring in a number one movie at the box office? He did with 1994's smash hit The Mask. I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old and being in the theater nearly dying of laughter. I wanted this movie so badly on VHS when it was released my parents got it for me and I think I must have played it a few dozen times a day. Jim Carrey was like no comedian that I had seen with how crazy this guy would be and The Mask truly showcased his talents.Stanley Ipkiss a clerk at an Edge City bank is a shy luckless romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him including his boss his landlady and car mechanics. His only friends are his dog Milo and his coworker Charlie Schumacher. Stanley is smitten with Tina a beautiful young woman who his new client at his bank. Later that night Charlie and Stanley go to a club but after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo Stanley is stranded with a brokendown rental car at the city's filthy harbor where he finds a mysterious wooden mask. When he takes the object home and puts it on it comes alive wraps around his head and transforms him into a wackilysuited greenheaded cartoonish figure called The Mask a trickster unbound by any limitations whether be personal inhibitions or physical laws who cheerfully exacts revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and terrifies a street gang that attempts to terrorize him.I still watch The Mask to this day it's one of my personal favorites in my DVD collection. Jim Carrey is still a blast to watch how could you not laugh during his Cuban Pete performance and getting all the cops that are trying to arrest him into a salsa dance? Cameron Diaz's first ever movie God I wanted to look like her so badly when I was a kid she was so beyond gorgeous and absolutely adorable in The Mask. Even Peter Greene made one heck of a creepy villain as Dorian and seeing him transform the mask into something like a monster was just scary. Then seeing Jim Carrey's dog transform into the mask was classic slapstick three stooge like humor that would get anyone laughing hard. The Mask is a classic that I will always enjoy and recommend if you need a good laugh great Jim Carrey movie still one of my favorites.910".

	onyx:emotionText "Remember back in the day with the hit TV show In Living Color had several stars one of them being Jim Carrey. He was one goofy guy with crazy physical comedy routines that could get your stomach hurting from laughing so much. But could this man make it to the top and possibly bring in a number one movie at the box office? He did with 1994's smash hit The Mask. I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old and being in the theater nearly dying of laughter. I wanted this movie so badly on VHS when it was released my parents got it for me and I think I must have played it a few dozen times a day. Jim Carrey was like no comedian that I had seen with how crazy this guy would be and The Mask truly showcased his talents.Stanley Ipkiss a clerk at an Edge City bank is a shy luckless romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him including his boss his landlady and car mechanics. His only friends are his dog Milo and his coworker Charlie Schumacher. Stanley is smitten with Tina a beautiful young woman who his new client at his bank. Later that night Charlie and Stanley go to a club but after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo Stanley is stranded with a brokendown rental car at the city's filthy harbor where he finds a mysterious wooden mask. When he takes the object home and puts it on it comes alive wraps around his head and transforms him into a wackilysuited greenheaded cartoonish figure called The Mask a trickster unbound by any limitations whether be personal inhibitions or physical laws who cheerfully exacts revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and terrifies a street gang that attempts to terrorize him.I still watch The Mask to this day it's one of my personal favorites in my DVD collection.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to use Jim Carrey in a movie.  He's very good at his rapidfire mimicry routine but how can it ever be anything other than a diversion from both character and story?  Very rarely is it a pleasant diversion.  Ace Ventura' was unendurable.  And yet what else can you do with him?The Mask' solves the problem so neatly it almost cheats.  The story is ABOUT someone with a double life  so by day Carrey does all the character and story stuff and by night wearing the mask he does his standup schtick.  The two are as integrated as they need to be.  It's pulled off with such an air of innocence I can't possibly complain.  SOME of the clichs those to do with the police especially are so very worn out that even the most thorough of moviegoers is surprised to find them still alive but the writer seems to have been honestly unaware that they were clichs so that's okay.I was told that the film is saturated with animation injokes.  I couldn't spot very many.  Stanleywiththemask has the soul of a Tex Avery cartoon character I suspect that's all there is to it.  The computer animation or the computerenhancement of Carrey's animation is tastefully done.  It never looks pasted over the top of the footage the way so much computer animation does.  The Mask' failed to win an Oscar in the special effects category  like so many other more deserving films it was beaten by Forrest Gump'.  The Cuban dance numbers are irresistible as is Stanley's pet dog.  Sure The Mask' is no masterpiece but it's a clever charming film that richly deserved its runaway success.".

After all these years it's still sensational and a breath of fresh air. It's a festival of cleverness originality creativity and imagination with a unique style and cartoonlike sense of humor.I agree that Jim Carrey is a comedy genius and I can see why he is considered the man of the 1000 faces. In this film he is terrific. He does an excellent portrayal of his 2 characters Stanley Ipkiss and his own much wilder and carefree alterego The Mask  not to mention that The Mask has incredible superpowers with his characteristic bigpie humor but without pushing it too far. I think this is his best role and acting ever.This is the Jim Carrey movie to own. It now deserves the honor to go down in history as a classic from the recent history of cinema. Jim Carrey makes this movie the legend it is.This movie is definitely smokin' a wild comedy that goes farther than the limits of imagination. Like the older 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' it combines cartoonlike humor with thriller suspense and darkness and heavily drinks inspiration from lots of famous old cartoons.Other things contributing to the movie's timeless appeal are great characters hilarious lines exotic scenario and a party of special effects. It's a different and magical movie experience.Cameron Diaz's character Tina Carlyle is so enchanting that I'm sure many men's hearts melt whenever they see her in this. Cameron Diaz was extremely beautiful and hot in this.The dog that plays Milo is really cute and an amazing animal actor.Soundtrack is terrific from the various musical themes to the jaunty Latinlike songs 'Hey Pachuco' and 'Cuban Pete'.Title in Portugal 'A Mscara'.".

Either way he excels in this film he is completely in his element and completely unpredictable. He is helped by the special effects which are utterly amazing a truly imaginative and sophisticated visual style that worked so well here. Here because of the special effects Carrey moves around at whirlwind speed pops his eyeballs and swaps parts of his anatomy for his cartoon equivalents and you know what it is jolly funny. There are so many good scenes though my favourite was the Bugs Bunnystyle Cuban Pete routine. Also superb are the script which is as funny and as imaginative as the film itself and the suitably tongue in cheek music score. Not to mention the adorable pet dog underrated Peter Reigert Peter Greene's Dorian and gorgeous Cameron Diaz. Overall hugely enjoyable funny and imaginative so much better than its sequel Son of the Mask which I disliked so much I try to forget it exists. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Even though it tones down the violence of the dark horse comics it seamlessly blends Tex Avery style wackiness into the real world. If that does'nt reflect the inner child in us and what everyone wants to be then what does? Firstly the main character is brilliant. Hes an explosive combination of all the wacky toons we all love. But the difference is that its all amplified 10 times over and its all real! You actually combine all this wackiness into a very serious realistic dark and gritty world. The guy who came up with the 'Tornado' routine needs to be given a major award. This has to be Jim Carrey's best performance in his career and for once hes not overacting or being annoying. Cameron Diaz looks her best in this movie.The actors who play Kellaway and Doyle also give very likable performances. The villain is also very well played but he loses his charm when he puts on the Mask. The music is also awesome. This is one extremely enjoyable film that is also very posh cleanly cut and refined despite its subject matter and content. The production values are very high.My only complaint about this movie is that it does'nt have enough of the 'Mask' himself. For that you'd need to go and see the animated series but the latter is not at all as good as the movie itself strangely.".

If you've seen a Jim Carrey movie you know his style he tends to overdo a little sometimes but he manages to stay funny a lot of people don't like him because of all the weird stuff he throws in while acting but this movie can change some minds about Carrey. The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters one is the morethanregular Stanley Ipkins who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a greenmasked partyboy maniac ready to joke all around town all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask including dance scenes one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a supersized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled. If you're not a fan you can still enjoy it because he also plays a normal character that's actually normal without the weird faces with the crazy stuff being performed by his masked person although the crazyness is probably boosted it's easily understandable since he's indeed possessed. If you're still not convinced about Carrey maybe his comedies aren't for you you can probably enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind anyway.".

There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask including dance scenes one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a supersized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled. If you're not a fan you can still enjoy it because he also plays a normal character that's actually normal without the weird faces with the crazy stuff being performed by his masked person although the crazyness is probably boosted it's easily understandable since he's indeed possessed. If you're still not convinced about Carrey maybe his comedies aren't for you you can probably enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind anyway.";

While it's true that The Mask is another vehicle for the rubberfeatured modernday amalgamation of Jerry Lewis and the Three Stooges this time around Carrey has some competition and there are a number of scenes where he ends up playing second fiddle.The special effects are for the most part rather impressive but they're as frequently guilty of overwhelming the star's performance as complimenting it. Nevertheless if you think Carrey has an expressive face wait 'til you see him with the mask on. Eyes pop out and jaws drop  literally. ILM goes to work with their own version of liveaction animation whenever anyone dons the mask. Good costumes and makeup serve only to enhance the computergenerated visuals.And even as the audience's attention is arrested by the work of the effects wizards there's still room for a canine scenestealer. Milo whose real name is Max is the perfect foil for Carrey's goofiness and  yes  there are occasions where his animal antics divert the spotlight away from his twolegged costar.Carrey meanwhile is playing a split role mildmannered Stanley Ipkiss and his superhuman alterego the Mask. Stanley is a shy unassuming man who works in a bank and lives with Milo in a small apartment. One day following a terrible bout with Murphy's Law Stanley finds a curiouslooking mask floating amidst some debris in a river. Later at home when he finally gets around to trying the mask on Stanley learns that this isn't some archaeological curiosity. It has power  the power to transform. From the moment the mask clings to his skin and his face turns green Stanley's personality undergoes a radical shift. Insecurity is replaced by flamboyance. Physically there seems to be little that he can't do from twisting his body into a pretzel to taking a bullet in the chest or forming a tommy gun out of a balloon.While wearing the mask Stanley makes a comment about becoming a superhero but he's really interested in one thing Tina Carlyle Cameron Diaz a voluptuous nightclub singer who works for a local gangster Peter Greene. Following a bank robbery to finance his wooing the Mask discovers that a cop Lt. Mitch Kellaway Peter Riegert is hot on his trail. And it's not that difficult a trail to follow. After all how many limefaced bandits are there who move like the Warner Brothers cartoon Tasmanian Devil? Carrey plays Stanley with surprising restraint giving his zaniness free reign only when the mask is on. In some ways it's a Clark KentSuperman thing. Stanley and the Mask might share the same body but they're very different. One is a typical nice guy who finishes last. The other is Robin Williams' genie from Aladdin come to life Carrey provides dozens of whirlwind impersonations.As a comedy The Mask is genial but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof. Comic book and cartoon are two terms that come to mind for describing this movie. Neither is intended to be pejorative but each conjures certain apt images.Carrey is only in The Mask for 2530 mins. I wanted to see more. But it's good to see his serious stuff as well.For me Ace Ventura was too much concentrated Jim Carrey. In The Mask the forceful personality is diluted. The star is mostlysubdued except during those offthewall bursts of energy that accompany the appearance of the Mask. The film is entertaining enough  in a light undemanding sort of way  but more than the combined efforts of Carrey ILM and Max are demanded to camouflage the seams and holes still apparent in this production. No one else could have played the part better.".

They see each other again after he has been soaked at the Coco Bongo Club and it is on his way home that he discovers an ancient green wooden mask inhabited by the spirit of mischievous god Loki.

Eventually Stanley has bigger problems when Tina's villainous gangster boyfriend Dorian Tyrell Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene gets hold of the mask and plans to take over Edge City with his new found power. The concluding scenes in the Coco Bongo Club fighting for the mask including dog Milo putting it on are fantastically funny. Also starring Amy Yasbeck as Peggy Brandt Orestes Matacena as Niko Nancy Fish as Mrs. Peenman Jim Doughan as Detective Doyle Denis Forest as Sweet Eddy and Ben Stein as Dr. Arthur Neuman. The cartoonish special effects are amazing Carrey is hilarious as The Mask Diaz's debut is great this is just a mustsee family film. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make UpHair Best Production Design and Best Special Effects. Cameron Diaz was number 65 and Jim Carrey number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars Diaz was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols and the film was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Diaz's great introductory entrance.

Always. I think this must be the first film that I ever saw that starred Jim Carrey and since then I've considered Carrey to be one of my favourite actors of all time alongside Robin Williams. You can't help but love how wacky and lovably quirky he is in this film!

Favourite momentsscenesquotes from The Mask1 His first transformation with the mask. And when he says Look ma I'm roadkill. HahaHA!  I would find this so funny when I was little.2 His singing and dancing scenes with Cameron Diaz's character and his rendition of Cuban Pete with the police.3 His scene in the park with Cameron Diaz's character when he says something along the lines of J'adore j'adore shut the window I don't care! I'm not at this scene just yet and can't remember the line exactly as it is but I always found it hilarious.4 And the scenes in the casino where he gives a speech for winning an award asks Did you miss me..? I guess not!! and when he swallows the dynamite and exclaims That's a spicy meatball! with an accent.There are numerous moments in The Mask that are noteworthy alongside the ones I've listed above and just as funny and great to watch.

Jim Carrey The Mask in his best performance in a comic film with every gesture every nonsense every madness robs us of laughter from beginning to end. Cameron Diaz Tina impeccable in her debut as actress wasting sensuality and sweetness at the same time thanks to that majestic body that blond hair and skyblue eyes. Peter Greene perfect as a villain just by looking at that good face and those deep blue eyes and you know who the bad guy is. The cops very awesome as always the clever Peter Riegert and the clumsy Jim Doughan. And last but not least I do not know what it's called the dog that made Milo but what a bonanza by God stole the show that little son of a female dog.As a curious fact the film is based on the eponymous comic. Yes nobody or almost nobody knows that. But since the film was filmed and because of its wide acceptance by the public the comic came out of anonymity one way or another. To finish in one of the deliveries of the comic The Mask shares chapters nothing less with the Joker and Batman.".

It makes my eyes pop up and my jaw drop down not unlike Jim Carrey's Mask persona in one of the film's many incredible scenes. This is the perfect movie for Jim Carrey's talents in physical comedy. He sure had a lot of fun and improvised in many scenes doing the parodies and paying the homage to the famous movies and characters in recognizable and hilarious way. The movie made me laugh all the time it is a perfect fun for the whole family which does not happen too often. All supporting players made the film even more enjoyable but one actor who did impossible and almost stole the central spot from Carrey was the dog the Jack Russell Milo. What a great performance! If they ever gave the Oscars for the best animal performance Milo would be the one to receive it. The Mask also marked the film debut for an ex model 22 years old Cameron Diaz and I believe that it was one of the most stunning debuts ever. The moment she stepped in Stanley Ipcus's Jim Carrey bank and his life the new star was born. I've never seen her as beautiful as in her first movie and her dance with Carrey at the night club has proved that she could keep up with the most amazing physical comedian of our time. Great fun. Oh yes  how could I forget the Oscar nominated special effects that made Carrey's transformations from a shy clerk to a superhero absolutely amazing. I think that this comedy is timeless and it would delight the viewers of all ages for many years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most movie parodies Scary Movie' starts out well then begins to head downhill as it exhausts the possibilities of its limited material. Certainly few genres are as rife for selfsatire as the teen slasher films that have proliferated in theatres ever since the early 1980's.  Seeing however as even some of the earliest Friday the 13th' and Halloween' films seem like ancient history to today's core movie going public Scary Movie' draws upon more contemporary examples of the genre like Scream' and I Know What You Did Last Summer' as its source of inspiration.  In its opening stretches Scary Movie' has a great deal of fun parodying the many ludicrous conventions that have long defined these films  the use of 30year old actors to portray emptyheaded nubile adolescents the heavy emphasis on teen sexuality and partial nudity the inane actions of the killer's victims who seem to do everything possible to hurl themselves into dangerous situations and the ohsopredictable false scare usually caused by a leaping cat followed immediately by the inevitable killer's attack.Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and boasting a screenplay concocted by no fewer than six count em SIX writers Scary Movie' establishes a high speed rhythm and pace that the filmmakers manage to sustain through most of the film's 88minute running time  though there is a noticeable tendency on the part of the film to lag in the last half hour.  Part of the problem could be that as with most films made up essentially of sound and sight gags haphazardly strung together it is inevitable that some of the bits will succeed better than others and that as the movie rolls along the inspiration will run a little dry and the humor will become less spontaneous and more forced.  Indeed this type of movie genre parody has always worked best when applied in small doses on TV series like Saturday Night Live' In Living Color' and even the Carol Burnett Show.'  Stretched out to full length such concepts often suffer the curse of diminishing returns.Occasionally the screenplay edges so close to the limits of good taste that one may question whether or not the material is truly appropriate for the age group at which the movie is obviously targeted.  The crudity is actually much more comically effective when it is merely hinted at than when it is so openly spelled out and displayed.  But then subtlety is not exactly a strong suit of the straight horror movie genre either. Scary Movie' is at least blessed with a winning game cast made up of appropriately post adolescent actors who understand well the mannerisms and speech patterns of the stereotypes they embody.  The overall goodnatured quality of the film and its fairly high laugh ratio of gems to clunkers make Scary Movie' an imperfect but generally likeable popcorn entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of teenagers are targeted by a serial killer exactly one year after they ran over a man.In 1996 Scream was a film that reinstated the slasher horror genre and Keenan Ivory Wayans' spoof is a true and funny testament to that horror classic.Modern spoofs often contain slapstick humour stereotypes and a fairly predictable plot. This is evident with this 2000 hit and is pure silly entertainment that you can't help but love and laugh along with despite the conventional approach.Recent releases such as Disaster Movie have brought the spoof genre to an all time low. Filled with unfunny parodies attacks on celebrities and ultimately silly plots it's a wonder why they are still being made. In the nineties we had classic spoofs such as Austin Powers and Naked Gun silly but with a sharp and entertaining plot.Scary Movie has such a good plot choosing to focus its energy on Scream and I know what you did last summer that you forget its intentions to demean other films and therefore are able to sit back and enjoy the ride.The opening is pretty much Scream with some great moments of slapstick in and crude slapstick at that with safety signs sexual references and an out of control car.This opening sets the tone for an engrossing comedy and viewers are thrust head first into typical teenagers lives filled with some fine slapstick humour and stereotypes lives There is a consistency to Scary Movie. There is little wondering away from its objective to tell the tale of the teens being targeted and therefore achieves a realism in its own context. With followups 2 3 and 4 there is a tendency to run away from the main narrative and have sillier skits that this original remains the most sophisticated to date.Though the comedy is frequently predictable there is still elegance about the way Wayans achieves this effect. His close and unflinching style gives that humorous and equally horrific substance to fly across both genres into this tantalizing tale.Spoofs are always worth viewing for their sheer cheek to criticize blockbusters and Scary Movie is no exception with its pin point accuracy on Scream and other horrors. Filled with likable slapstick and funny stereotypes this is the finest in the series".

It's almost the same concept. While Scream tried to be taken seriously  Scary Movie mocks about everything possible in the genre in a raw way.Anna Faris and the Wayans brothers deliver a funny performance. Sure the cast is over the top but the movie asks for it. Having such a pretty girl like Faris behaving like that always shocks and this time it entertains. The rest of the cast is pretty good. All in the American Pie style but with raunchy humor. The main reason for me to like this movie is that it mocks perfectly many Horror popular movies. Friday the 13th He Knows You Are Alone Black Christmas Psycho etc. That's in my opinion the best feature of the movie. It's a joke but it's a homage at the same time. Unlike Scream that tried to convince people that it was an innovative slasher. Give this movie a try if you are in the mood of raw black humor. It surely will entertain you if you are not easily offended.".

Leslie Neilson made a handful at the end of the decade all very stupid as they didn't even try like the Zucker bros. did in the early days.  But the last slapstick film I liked was 1993's Loaded Weapon so this film was a long time coming.  Most parodies have some sort of target and this one attacks all the teen slasher pics of the last few years.  Since I didn't enjoy any of them I really enjoyed watching them get lampooned as a ton of the jokes are right on the money.  If you're a fan of parody I don't know how you couldn't love some of this.  But even with all the praise this still just barely missed being an overall success.  Toward the end it starts to run out of steam which is really too bad as a lot of it is too hilarious for words.  I do go along with everyone else in saying I don't know how this got only an R rating.  There is a ton of graphic material sexually and bloodily.  Some will laugh others will roll their eyes at the over the top approach to some scenes.  I did a little of both.  The cast for mostly unknowns is good and it was nice to see the Wayans clan finally succeed in film after about a decade of poorly selfwritten clunkers.  I see a sequel is forthcoming although I'm not sure whats left to make fun of.".

My lasting impression will be of a film that is more miss than hit  never a good thing in spoofs.  All the best spoofs have missfires but the secret is to keep the gags coming so fast that it doesn't matter.  Here however the gags aren't consistent and rely more on a mix of specific movie spoofs and some very crude jokes that aren't funny.  It does have laughs in it but a film such as this lives and dies on it's laughs and this film needed more  far too often I was left waiting for a laugh.While the film does have laughs it relies heavily on impersonation of other films rather than out and out jokes.  While this is good in some regards it is mostly quite lazy and also gives the film a limited time where it is fresh and funny.  For example as these films fade from memory so the jokes will become less funny or relevant.  The best example of this is the Matrix spoof I'm sure on release it was topical and original and drew many laughs but seeing it now it just seems old  so many others have done it by now and it just seemed obvious rather than funny.The cast are OK but they are very wide characters and none of them really have the spoof ability of say Leslie Nielsen.  The Wayans brothers are actually OK and seem happy to send themselves up.  Marlon is not that good just playing a junkie type but Shawn conveys himself as gay and makes light of his show being cancelled.  Hall is cute and funny  her depiction of a black woman in a cinema may be slightly generalist but it is spot on! The rest of the cast are average  none of them stand out but they just about manage to do what the material requires of them which ain't much.Overall this film has just about enough laughs to justify watching but if you haven't seen the crop of teen slashers made around the time then you'll often not get the jokes.  Sadly though it is more miss than hit with some crude cum'n'dick' jokes being more unpleasant than funny.".

However a combination of inept attempts at humour and a rather unpleasant obnoxious undercurrent soon made this film a chore to watch and I couldn't last the distance without fastforwarding large chunks of the film. One reason I disliked the film so much was how low its standards were. With the exception of one or two jokes early on the filmmakers seemed to think that merely making the audience aware they were spoofing a Kevin Williamsontype film was in itself enough to constitute a joke. Secondly the film seems to have been described as outrageous by the LA Times for example but what exactly is so outrageous about this film? All the predictable areas are mined for humour. The only way anyone would think that the film's litany of jokes involving goresexual innuendocrossdressershomosexualspotsmoking are 'outrageous' are those who haven't seen the 4000 or so films that have used this type of humour in the past. Perhaps like 'Something about Mary' it's deemed outrageous because it pushes the boundaries of some of these jokes a bit further but it's still a variation on the same joke. After a while the film's tone is so relentless and obvious that it's easy to see where the next joke is coming from. When I saw an overweight woman have a speaking part later in the film you knew that there would a joke relating to her weight. As Hollywood deems only 'the beautiful people' appear at the multiplexes. In reality 'Scary Movie' is anything but outrageous as it picks safe obvious targets for humour that won't cause any real controversy. This film is about the same standard as 'Silence of the Hams' from a few years back but due to a few factors mainly marketing whereas 'Hams' did zero at the box office 'Scary Movie' was a major hit.".

Call it manipulative unrealistic contrived saccharine whatever your pleasure  but I absolutely lost my heart to Mandy Moore's character here.  Perhaps the deeprooted protective instinct in my nature maybe a reminder of what I never found but always desired but I would be lying if I did not admit to falling totally in love with Jamie matter of fact that would be an understatement.An impossible blend of strength integrity natural beauty youth feistiness femininity and vulnerability  Mandy Moore delivered a performance so genuine and moving it totally stunned me. She was utterly spellbinding in every scene she was in  which was most of them. I thought her rendition of Its gonna be love during the school play was cinematic magic. She was for those moments every man's dream and the epitome of virginal translucence.  I was impressed too with Shane West's performance who at times was so reminiscent of a young Kevin Bacon somewhere around his FOOTLOOSE days. At times I agree the film seemed to be headed down THE MAJESTIC path of oversentiment but I'm sorry guys I don't care. So long as Jamie was onscreen ripping my emotions apart the rest really didn't matter!  What a stunning performance from so young a girl with barely any acting experience. The mere fact that this flick has pulled an everage user rating of 6.6 would suggest a LOT of people liked it. It blows LOVE STORY totally out of the water. On reflection it is the film's very simplicity lack of  pretension and strong supporting actors that serves it so very well.By the way it does so help being a hopeless romantic!".

I liked it then but the math class ended before the movie could be finished. Finally on the WB a few days ago the movie aired and I saw the conclusion. AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. The situations that occur are very real and very sad. Once the movie finishes you'll be left wondering what happens to everyone heck even though it doesn't make sense I want a sequel!.As a maturing male I couldn't help but cry inside and I'm someone who felt indifferent toward movies like Titanic. I found myself wishing I were either Landon or Jamie because they represent the real virtues of life and love. Aside from the movie's undying message there are some slight flaws. The ending could have been expanded a bit more you'll see when you watch it as I don't want to spoil anything to include more emotion. Otherwise the acting done by Mandy Moore and Shane West is superb and top notch  these two actors have quite the career ahead of them. You'll see as these two characters develop that you can't imagine any other people doing the job.This isn't your typical love story because when it comes down to it the love is only part of the whole scheme. While I never expected this to touch me so much AWTR enters as perhaps my favorite movie of all time. You will feel as if you're a part of the movie you will be able to relate to them and you will love it. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. Available on DVD now you'll be wishing the release had deleted scenes et. all. Highly recommended.".

You'll see as these two characters develop that you can't imagine any other people doing the job.This isn't your typical love story because when it comes down to it the love is only part of the whole scheme. While I never expected this to touch me so much AWTR enters as perhaps my favorite movie of all time. You will feel as if you're a part of the movie you will be able to relate to them and you will love it. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. Available on DVD now you'll be wishing the release had deleted scenes et. all. Highly recommended.";

Mandy Moore is especially good as the straightlaced preacher's daughter.  And I liked how they showed the transformation of Shane West's character.  It was very believable. Of course the ending won't leave you driedeyed.  It's sad but we get to witness a sortof miracle as the film puts it of how a wayward teen turns his life around.  The music was great too.FINAL VERDICT  I definitely recommend this. It isn't just some teen movie. The film has depth and the acting is much better than you would expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can not say that A Walk to Remember was a movie that I went out of my way to see or even that I recall it being aired in any UK cinema. I happened to watch it on TV one Sunday morning expecting something somewhat usual and predictable.I must admit I was more than pleasantly surprised enough so to actually watch it more than once and consequently feel compelled to write these comments. I find myself struggling not to watch it whenever I see it listed such a charming movie is this! The plot seems to be initially a rather predictable foray into the traditional territory of bad boy meets good but sadly plain girl. At some point in the movie girl momentarily transforms from ugly duckling into swan. At this point I found myself feeling that comfort that we all feel in the knowledge that we know exactly what is going to happen in a movie. I was entirely convinced that the entire culmination of the thing is for girl to gain some peer group acceptance. The presence of a seemingly overly protective father hints at overtones that he may be some kind of parental tyrant figure from whom she may require some sort of heroic liberation.However as Jaime reveals her secret then all becomes apparent and a far more absorbing plot unfolds than is initially to be expected.Performances are competent and heartfelt Shane West gives an admirable portrayal of an angry young man on a path of reformation. Mandy Moore is strong and almost graceful in her role as Jaime and enhances the charm of this romantic interlude with several pretty vocal solos.Daryl Hannah and Peter Coyote both fine actors add a lovely depth to the general proceedings and are certainly worth a mention for their respective roles as concerned parents.It is impossible for me not to like this little film because I am an insufferably romantic female and A walk to Remember has romance in a monumental dosage. There is little or no sexual content rather emphasis is put upon the more admirable and sincere aspects of courtship little seen in the average teen movie.Without going into territory that could be classed as spoiling it is worth mentioning that some people may place A Walk to Remember into the tear jerker category and consign it to a dark dusty corner of their DVD collection which is only delved into in the most girly of moments.For some several scenes may be a little too saccharine but if you don't like romance then this picture probably isn't for you anyway.In my opinion this category is a little too narrow to slide A Walk to Remember into. The true themes of this lovely story are in reality faith and redemption which are universal aspects of humanity with which we can all identify in various amount.The end result for me was that I felt uplifted at the end. Like eating a tub of ice cream or having a nice bubbly bath this is a movie to put on when you feel low or have had a bad day and it's sure to make you feel much better. You will fall in love for the first time all over again for a couple of hours.You may well sit down to watch with preconceptions about what you are going to see. You men may sit down and watch it solely to win a few merit points from your girlfriend so she'll let you watch the football in peace later. As my title says though this may be the one romantic movie you will hate yourself for loving.You don't even have to admit to anybody that you watched it and liked it but I encourage you to watch it all the same without prejudice.A little charmer comforting and sweet sets out to do something very simple and delivers well I give 710".

BUT...I gave it 10 out of 10 for a single simple reason whatever its flaws it made me cry unashamedly and that's something that not a lot of movies can claim in all honesty. And despite the sadness it inevitably brings which is not necessarily bad it also brings innocence sweetness optimism  yes that too  and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change the ability  and the obligation  to become better.

You have to give a lot of credit to the young main actors in the film Mandy Moore and Shane West they did a great job for both of them just starting their movie careers only a couple of years ago.Although for anyone that has actually read the book like myself you catch a lot of the differences between the book and the movie and in your own way you can note what could have made the film a lot better than how good it was.

You shouldn't judge this movie before knowing what it's really about. Yes I know it's about people from opp. sides of the track and it seems so cliche but there's so much more than that. And even though I don't like Mandy Moore she's a great actress. Honestly! Much better than Britney. But anyway this movie will make you cry and laugh and there is such a great message. It's about first loves and opening up to people saying goodbye miracles growing apart destiny and letting yourself become something you never imagined but it won't end the way you think it will. Besides Shane West is hot. So why shouldn't you like this movie again? Oh and go out and read some more of Nicholas Sparks books. They're a must read trust me!".

	schema:headline " Absolute Hidden Treasure";
	schema:reviewBody "I have nothing negative to say about A Walk to Remember. Its few cons are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film perhaps one of the best ever emanating from Hollywood and Warner Brothers  a monumental feat given its small production budget. The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it multiple times. It's a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever. It shows how deeply loving someone can transform you to gain the strength to forgive to accept to respect and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider. This movie conveys what true love really is how it can affect people in life and death and how absolutely beautiful it can be for those lucky enough to experience its deepest level.The movie is so caring and sincere it subtly draws you into it. It shows a popular incrowd teenage boy discovering there is much more to life than reckless carefree aimless behavior. When a stupid prank turns harmful a perpetrator Landon one lead character played by Shane West is sentenced to perform community service activities and these bring him into close contact with Jamie a noncool nonpopular nerdy religious girl the other lead character played by Mandy Moore who performs the same activities  by choice. Landon has heretofore always treated Jamie with ridicule and disdain. Though he's known her all his life through their interaction he suddenly discovers her passion for life with interests and a depth he never knew existed. He begins to find a new path for his own life and the ensuing transformation is wonderfully portrayed.Although the picture's main theme is about Landon and the transformation he undergoes Jamie is clearly the anchor of this movie. She's exceptionally sweet genuine innocent highly intelligent and passionate. She was so interested in astronomy that she built her own telescope and would venture into their small town cemetery in the middle of the night to pursue her celestial passion. She did this not to impress but for its own sake. Her beliefs in herself are solid and she never changes. She wears no makeup and wears the same lowkey nonfashionable baggy clothes from the beginning throughout and to the end of the picture. She actually likes who she is  the way she is. Unlike Landon her selfimage is not based on what others think.She has just enough attitude to not take any disingenuousness from anyone  and when being toyed with would often fire right back. When Dean a friend of Landon's and leader of the incrowd pack mockingly asked her why her Higher Power could not get her a new sweater she always wore the same one she responded He's too busy looking for your brain. When Landon humiliated her in front of his peers she coolly walked away at the time but when he later came to her for help she calmly slammed the door in his very surprised face. She's a strong figure that sees through the behavior and demeanor of her peers. Her role demonstrates how one individual of virtue faith and an upbeat attitude can so positively influence those around her by simply living her life true to her own beliefs and not succumbing to peer pressure forces no matter how difficult.Landon's role clearly demonstrates the power of forgiveness and how its redemptive qualities can bring about caring unselfish behavior. Landon's incrowd peers treating Jamie cruelly at every opportunity and eventually ostracizing him when he defended her were eventually forgiven by Landon and when tragedy struck they were all there to offer their support for him and ask for forgiveness each in their own way. And in what may be the film's most touching scene though there are many Landon essentially forgives his estranged father for leaving his family for another woman and thanks him for his considerable support in making it possible for Jamie to return home.One leaves this movie with a number of messages. The movie teaches to always be open to new experiences and to never judge a book by its cover. The strongest message however is that of being a better more passionate person yourself and to cherish those around you and the time you have with them. You're left with a sense of true love being so deep and pure that just being with the one you love brings such wonderful joy to your life. You would do anything for that person even putting your own happiness aside for the sake of theirs. Jamie was able to change an arrogant selfabsorbed teenager into a tender loving person who was willing to do virtually anything for her  and did!Don't be surprised if you end up falling in love with both Moore's and West's characters. The enduring innocence sweetness evolving chemistry and eventual deep love between the movie's leads is genuine totally heartfelt and compelling  unequaled in any other movie. In the middle of this film are a series of the most incredibly romantic scenes you will ever see in an American firm. They easily flow from scene to beautiful scene showing two intelligent thoughtful and sincere people slowly falling for each other. From Casablanca to Love Story to Titanic no other onscreen pair conveys such an honestly felt passion for each other.Despite the considerable sadness surrounding their romance the movie leaves the audience with optimism for life love faith and the ability for everyone to change the possibility to become a better person  at any age. I watch it repeatedly with both joy and melancholy. Perhaps Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert renowned longtime ChicagoSun Times filmTV critic said it best when he concluded in his film review A Walk to Remember is a small treasure.".

	schema:headline " Not for the cynical.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie last Sunday night and I have to say that I was deeply moved by it. I do not think that it had the cliches of teen films at all. If anything the movie has a new perspective on teen love. Teen films today are mostly focused on getting laid or turning the ugly girl pretty one way or another just rent American Pie or She's All That. Not that there isn't a special place in my heart for these movies but A Walk To Remember is in a class all by itself. The movie did have it's share of cheesy moments due mostly to the overbearing dramatic musical score in certain scenes. Other than that the characters were very genuine and the performances were most definitely heartfelt. Mandy Moore definitely holds her own in this movie as Jamie Sullivan showing lots of emotional depth and making a complete transformation from teen pop goddess to modest southern girl. Shane West is a talent that should not be overlooked by Hollywood. He gets better and better in every film that he's in. He can do comedy watch his underrated supporting comedic role in Get Over It and he tackles drama with ease in this film. Great supporting turns from Peter Coyote as Jamie's father and from an aged Darryl Hannah as Landon's mother.On to the topic of this review. This movie is not for cynical people or people who do not believe in love. This movie's core message is that love can and will conquer all obstacles. This is a movie about teens who love each other in a very adult way. I can relate because I have had the same girlfriend for the past two years ever since my senior year in high school. We love each other immensely and we believe that we have a deep connection. People didn't think that we would last because we just didn't act like all the other teen couples on campus. So when Landon would say these deeply loving things to Jamie in the movie I cried because someone had said the same things I had said not too long ago to my girlfriend. So if you don't believe in love don't see this movie because you won't like it.If you have a bitterness toward religion especially Christianity don't see this movie because you will just be bellyaching about the manipulation of religion on the youth of America. I am a Christian not a hardcore one but I do believe in God. There are Christian overtones in this movie faith is spoken of many times in this movie and faith is the cornerstone of Landon and Jamie's love. This movie is not preachy it does not try to hammer home topics of Christianity with words. The movie prefers to use examples in real life situations and medaphors as well.I have to say thank you to the director and writer for not including a sex scene or a drunken teen party scene in this movie. It is a tasteful family film and I'm glad it did not try to be too adult with it's content. The love that Landon and Jamie share is pure and it is what makes their relationship unique in comparison to the other kids in their town.People may hate this movie because of the amount of sap or cheesiness. Well I think the movie is very sugary and sweet and has plenty of sap. But it is realistic sap. The situations warrant that amount of sap. You wouldn't make a scene where a guy is confessing his love for his lady all dark and gritty would you? This movie also does have its share of grit especially in relation to Landon's transformation. But you'll have to see the movie for that.People may also think that Mandy Moore is not believable in the role of Jamie Sullivan. This is complete hogwash. The point wasn't to make Jamie a real ugly duckling but a swan who does not care to spread her wings and show off for the rest of the world. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers can't seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. I just wish that in real life people wouldn't look at beautiful as the equivalent of popular and ugly as the exact opposite. I knew quite a few beautiful girls in high school that sat at the back of the cafeteria and read books or did homework. That's just the sort of life they chose to lead not because they were forced into it by being picked on but because they simply existed on a different level. Jamie is exactly that type of person. Landon is that way too but he just doesn't want to find that out until he meets Jamie.Bottom line you may love this movie for many reasons or hate it for many more. This is a movie about soul mates. This is a movie about believing in people especially in the ones you love. This is a movie about tolerance and not judging a book by its cover. This is a movie about friendship. This is a movie about two people who know they are right for each other. But most importantly this is a movie about how true love can lift up even the most unreachable souls in this world and save their lives.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.".

I enjoyed the movie very much I didn't cry of nothing' but was very sad after the end.Now I'm not someone who reads a lot of fiction but after reading The DaVinci Code I decided to go out and buy A Walk to Remember book because books always give more detail. This was only a day after watching the movie and I'll tell you what by chapter 13 I would have already broken down and cried or got teary and get goosebumps at least about 9 times. Before that I couldn't really remember the last time I cried. The book was really something special and the author is very talented. I was far more satisfied with the ending in the book that with the one in the movie. In the movie we are told that Jamie passes away. In the book however Jamie's fate depends on the readers' interpretation and discretion Nicholas Sparks also says this on his website. Landon concludes with ...miracles can happen.And so my confession...I cried like hell after reading the book and for an adult male to do such a thing is unheard of and makes me a loser. But I don't really care how could you not cry or be saddened with every page that Jamie grows weaker or every page that Landon feels more helpless? The way that the book is crafted make it so difficult not to get your emotions involved because you learn to love the characters and the fact that the story was told from Landon's point of view.10 out of 10 stars  Fantastic book and movie".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not usually watch movies of the category LoveRomance its just because i feel like adding some more boredom to a routine life full of responsibilities. So I used to kind of hate them as if they are real piece of torture until I happened to watch this movie. After watching this I realized what I have missed during my whole life till now. A Walk To Remember is a story about a guy who unexpectedly falls in Love with a girl who is going to die during her teenage bcoz of a disease. He realises this fact at the very second he proposes to her. To talk about this movie especially abt the character Jamie Salluvian..I can just tell u one liner that I FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. She is the real human being so calm pious religious helping so tender and what not she is a kind of girl with whom everybody wants to talk with wants to spend time with. By the word everybody I mean to say not just guyz but all kinds of people. Each and every scene in which if i see Jamie she made me cry. That was the first time i literally cried while watching a movie. It has left an undelible impression on me which i cud not able to get over for 2 or 3 months. Guyz I don't know whether u believe it or not its not at all exaggerating to say that I am completely changed after watching this movie. I really came to know what exactly LOVE means. This movie has taught me the real meaning of LOVE  A love for a life time. I am spellbound with this movie in every aspect. This has become my most favourite movie for my life time. I bet no other movie can replace it for 100 sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the few movies that I can't get tired of watching it. It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it and I think I've watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can't get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt Matt Lutz in the hospital and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter Shane West in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan Mandy Moore who is a very shy quiet and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan Peter Coyote Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his popular friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list this is when the movie gets so good. After a while Landon and Jamie get married and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie's dad they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet extremely beautiful. This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven't watched the movie but from what I've heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment the light would be very bright warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood.".

In particular and in contrast to standard Hollywood fare redemption and forgiveness were in the air. The most obvious examples involve Jamie and Landon the two main characters Landon treats Jamie badly then redeems himself through his efforts in preparing the school plan tutoring and confronting Jamie with his feelings for her at school and don't forget the pink sweater!. At this point Jamie forgives him. Likewise Jamie apologizes for not telling Landon earlier about her illness and he forgives her. Landon's father eventually redeems himself for leaving his family by paying for Jamie's homecare and Landon forgives him in a scene that even after a dozen viewings still gets me. Landon's exgirlfriend redeems herself for the hateful flyers she made of Jamie by apologizing to Landon who forgives her. Etc. Etc.As luck would have it I saw the whole film a few days later thank you TBS and noticed other things how Landon's parents' love for him was so evident albeit off the screen how Landon's friends were more than just the evil popular types how funny Eric is and how the teenagers in general rather than stereotypes round out into plausible characters that I recognize from my own adolescence.I was well and truly hooked at that point bought the DVD and have watched it if not obsessively then at least more often than I can say I've watched any other movie. It is so refreshing to see a movie that deals with big issues soberly but lightly in the process leaving me simultaneously sad uplifted and determined to be better than I am.I know the film was panned when it was released and this is a great shame because this is a film whose pleasures exist at many levels if you let yourself watch the film itself rather than watch the film stereotype. Roger Ebert who is about the only movie critic I can take seriously anymore did get it though and more power to him.".

Even though when you think of Mandy Moore you think bubblegum popBritneyknockoff this film makes you look at her in a whole new light and respect her for the fact that she is a fantastic actress and with all the different songs she sings through out the film she shows off her amazing singing voice. Add the wonderful Shane West opposite her and Adam Shankman behind the camera and it makes an amazing piece of film. The transformation of the characters throughout the film is always convincing and never makes you think well hey that just wouldn't happen. I have seen the film at least 10 times and every time it makes me cry in three specific parts. See if you agreeSPOILER1 The moment Jamie tells Landon that she is dying. 2 The Moment Landon goes to see his father after he pays for the private home care for Jamie. 3 The scene where they get married and is followed by Landon's voice over.Possible SPOILERAlso I know they changed the end of the film compared to the book it is based around but I don't think it would have made the ending as good as the rest of the film if it had ended with Landon giving the wedding rings back to Jamie's father. It would have created a you bastard scenario for the viewers. Any sympathy and feeling you had for Landon would have been totally destroyed. End Of SpoilersSo in summary this film is a must see for any kind of romantic evening anyone who wants to watch amazing actors and an amazing story in one place and just about anyone who doesn't mind watching a teenage love story that can relate to anyone of any age.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of this film and because of when it was released I automatically thought 'It's just another one of those lovey dovey movies' .. How wrong could I be.. This shows Jamie who anyone can relate to as the lonely girl who doesn't have any friends.. The amazing part is she doesn't care. She wears what she wants thinks what she wants does what she wants and even though everybody teases her she carries on like nothing happened. Landon at first I thought was a right jerk. In all honesty I didn't have much hope for the movie in the first few scenes as I thought she would fall for the jockjerk and that would be the movie. Again I was wrong. When Jamie reveals her Leukaemia to Landon his reaction sealed the deal for me. The way he went to his dad for help who then helped him tried to make all her dreams come true married her in her mother's church built the telescope and stayed by her side morning and night. The thing that scares me about death is not death but what happens after. The fact that one day no one will remember who you are or people will get over your death. That scares me. This movie made me feel as if there are people who are caring and kind enough to actually remember and still miss that person four years later. I don't know if anyone will actually read this review but I don't really care as because of this movie I have come to think that I will become more confident and I believe it really has affected me as a person. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever loved will ever love has experience or witnessed death is a hopeless romantic or is even just looking for 100 minutes to kill. I guarantee you it will change your life in ways you didn't expect. All I can say now is.. I feel sorry for my future husband He has a lot to live up to.".

The way he went to his dad for help who then helped him tried to make all her dreams come true married her in her mother's church built the telescope and stayed by her side morning and night. The thing that scares me about death is not death but what happens after. The fact that one day no one will remember who you are or people will get over your death. That scares me. This movie made me feel as if there are people who are caring and kind enough to actually remember and still miss that person four years later. I don't know if anyone will actually read this review but I don't really care as because of this movie I have come to think that I will become more confident and I believe it really has affected me as a person. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever loved will ever love has experience or witnessed death is a hopeless romantic or is even just looking for 100 minutes to kill. I guarantee you it will change your life in ways you didn't expect. All I can say now is.. I feel sorry for my future husband He has a lot to live up to.";

	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hardearned money to see XMen 2. It was worth every penny.Firstly the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The XMenwith their forty years of history and continuityare perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well I've spoken to many hardcore Xfans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The XMen and their enemy Magneto have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.All the favourites are back including my personal favourite Hugh Jackman as Wolverine I hope Wolverine gets his own movie franchise one day. The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many XMen and women the producers have to do the best they can and they do indeed.There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics and movies have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as Hitler's treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of Martin Luthor King and Malcom X. In fact many longtime Xfans have compared the XMen's Professor X to Martin Luthor King and the evil Magneto to Malcom X. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.This is the best superhero film since the 70's when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie and the 80's when we saw Tim Burton's Batman. It was a fantastic film but it begs one questionhow are they ever going to top this?".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot has been said about this movie as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone's opinion I really don't see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.Definitely NO spoilers ahead.First of all we must realize that Xmen comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon but Bryan singer did a very good job as always in the first film and introduced the audience. Besides adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job and is also risky considering it's Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained the characters and their abilities introduced and the plot which actually had a story unlike many action flicks was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.The second film however had to concentrate naturally on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object in the title to people criticising this film for lack of character development etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read xmen comics and did not even see the first movie and see this one right away and still expect the directorwriter to spell things out for you well you'll be disappointed. Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack? someone asked. To hide them somewhere THAT'S where he took them. I don't think people would like to see the director spell out everything such as Colossus' inner voice saying Well let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility to hide them from the bad guys.And the newlyintroduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities you see whose side they're on you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes very well done.The movie had many shortcomings of course the pace slowed down more than once some main characters especially Cyclops were almost lost but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first much more like the original comic character.As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well bad news for you. Xmen is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters hopefully to be seen in the next sequels. Jubilee Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I'm eager to see Gambit also I can't wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course I can see the no character development people asking each other Who is Beast?In short this movie does what it's supposed to do Gives us entertainment and shows us our favorite characters on screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some people would tell you that X2 is more conventional and mainstream than the first movie and to that I can only say What a load of rubbish! Not only does X2 continue in the style set by the first film but it also improves on it greatly. This is achieved by adding more characters making a deeper story and making the ever expanding universe even more chaotic so as better to capture the essence of the comic book. Two thumbs way up! The story picks up after the events of the first film in a way that pleases the viewers of the first film and is satisfactory to new viewers. The story is still well written and the pacing has improved a lot from the first film. There are no real slow points during the movie and the director takes special care to cram many of the scenes with breath taking visual effects so the audience will never lose interest. The dialog is once again both very sharp and witty and intelligent and allows for adequate character development. The character development is something some people have seen fit to criticize as they claim there isn't enough of it and except for only two characters I whole heartedly disagree. The character development of the main characters happened pretty much in the first film and therefore it is only necessary to add a bit more depth to the characters instead of repeating the character development from the first film. I did feel however that the film seemed somewhat rushed at times and that is a shame as it definitely had potential to be a 2 hour film.The acting is still sublime and I of course have to emphasize Hugh Jackman who is still absolutely brilliant as Wolverine. Both in bringing out the animal sides during the fight sequences but also in keeping the character human like in the comics. Ian McKellen returns as well and further fleshes out his character of Magneto and makes the character every bit as devious and charismatic as in the previous film. Patrick Stewart returns as well and does what he did in the first film and he is still the only one who could play Xavier. Among the new actors are Brian Cox and Alan Cumming. Cox does what he does best and plays the new villain with the exaggerated style he usually does. Cumming on the other hand shows remarkable depth as Nightcrawler and is in spite of his appearance one of the most human characters in the film. I will miss him in the third film. Lets hope Beast is any bit as good as in the comics. Some have had their characters lessened in the sequel. Most notably James Marsden while Famke Jansen's character is developed further. Halle Berry's character Storm is still kept in the background but I'm sure she will get more screen time in the third film. Aside from the ones I have now mentioned the acting is quite good all round.Action wise the film took a major step up from the first film and many of the action scenes are quite simply awesome. We get to see more of Wolverine's feral rage which is always worth a look. All fights scenes with Wolverine are awesome and some of the most entertaining I've seen. Also we get a brief glimpse of Collosus kicking some ass and he does look cool I must say. In fact many of the individual mutants' powers are fleshed out in X2 and like in the original XMen film they look absolutely beautiful. My only concern regarding the effects and action scenes is how on earth they are going to top them in the coming third XMen film.In regards to music and sound the film improved upon the first film with a much more catchy soundtrack and more audible effects. For example the sounds of Wolverine's claws shooting out and retracting have been amplified making him even more menacing than he was in the first film. Very well done.All in all X2 is an excellent continuation of the original film and we are nearing something that is more like a saga than a series of films. I'm really beginning to see Bryan Singer as a master director after these two brilliant films and I am a little sad he opted to do Superman Returns rather than finish what he started with the XMen films.810".

	schema:headline " The Best Comic Book Film EVER!!";
	schema:reviewBody "With all the hype surrounding this summers blockbuster sequels not the least of which is The Matrix Reloaded as well as having to fight the ghost of Comicbookmoviebombsfromsummerspast it goes without saying that a lot of hopes and dreams were riding high on the shoulders of everyone involved in Fox's second big screen outing for everyone's favorite team o superheroes.  Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic booktofilm adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2 XMen United!It has become rarer and rarer to find a film that has the ability to grab your senses and lock your attention so firmly not ever letting up until the credits role such as this film does.  One might only be able to count a handful of films where a sequel takes all of the good elements form it's predecessor completely eliminates the things that didn't work or fit in the original then goes on to not only exceed the expectations and hype surrounding it but completely redefines and elevates it's genre.  From this day forward let it be known that all other Comic Book films will hereby be judged and held up the new level of excellence set by Brian Singer's brilliant XMen 2. And if ya' can't already tell I kinda' like this flick!  I am sure many of you would love to know exactly what makes this film worth spending your money on?  Well to try and sum it up the characters their struggles their dreams their relationships they all MATTER because infused throughout this entire production and at isn't core lies HEART! And at the same time the film can be both touching as well as possess a gritty and visceral quality giving each in attendance license to participate in the action as an outlet for their frustrations and monotony of their everyday lives.  Just as I felt as if I was part of the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings so here again I feel like I am part of the XMen team.But what really drives my excitement is Brian Singer's seemingly boundless ability to correctly interpret the true spirit of the XMen comics.

Understanding that it would be totally impossible for him to try and take the Phoenix Saga and directly translate that to film Singer has rightly decided to do what lesser directors would have cowered at to reinterpret this change still showing Jean Grey inherit this power but to use it to build on her character and realize HER potential more than most writers of the comics have done in recent memory.  At the same time treating the character with respect as well as both we the audience and the dedicated fans of the comics with that same respect and maturity.

Brian singer accomplishes all of this at the same time he is sewing up crucial subplots and characters that are ingeniously and potently utilized.To illustrate the difference between how Brian Singer and the writersproducers for X2 utilize the material and do so intelligently making us pay more attention to the details and alternately how so many of us have gotten used to dumbed down films that lead us deliberately treating most of us like children to their obvious conclusions I bring up a subject of much debate.  Now some have pointed out that in the ending of XMen 2 where Jean Grey goes out of the plane to sacrifice herself was unnecessary obviously did not follow what was occurring to Jean throughout the film.  What I saw was her character going through the anguish and realization that something inside of her was reaching far beyond her capabilities to control and after seeing what she was capable of in her battle with Cyclops that at the mom ent she saw that everyone in the team was in danger on the plane she used this as self justification to sacrifice her life for everyone and at the same time stop the force inside of her which she feared was a growing danger not only out of her control but could eventually threaten or hurt all those who she loved.What other director can you name has so responsibly adapted something like this to film?  I can think of only one off hand Peter Jackson and his diligence to The Lord of the Ring books.  I dare say the Brian Singer has accomplished more than even Mr. Jackson because Singer has taken a Comic Book something the majority of people and press disregard as children's books or even geek literature and has transformed it into a very HUMAN very poignant very real experience and can only hope that he will continue on what he has accomplished.     5 stars".

	onyx:emotionText "With all the hype surrounding this summers blockbuster sequels not the least of which is The Matrix Reloaded as well as having to fight the ghost of Comicbookmoviebombsfromsummerspast it goes without saying that a lot of hopes and dreams were riding high on the shoulders of everyone involved in Fox's second big screen outing for everyone's favorite team o superheroes.  Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic booktofilm adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2 XMen United!It has become rarer and rarer to find a film that has the ability to grab your senses and lock your attention so firmly not ever letting up until the credits role such as this film does.  One might only be able to count a handful of films where a sequel takes all of the good elements form it's predecessor completely eliminates the things that didn't work or fit in the original then goes on to not only exceed the expectations and hype surrounding it but completely redefines and elevates it's genre.  From this day forward let it be known that all other Comic Book films will hereby be judged and held up the new level of excellence set by Brian Singer's brilliant XMen 2. And if ya' can't already tell I kinda' like this flick!  I am sure many of you would love to know exactly what makes this film worth spending your money on?  Well to try and sum it up the characters their struggles their dreams their relationships they all MATTER because infused throughout this entire production and at isn't core lies HEART! And at the same time the film can be both touching as well as possess a gritty and visceral quality giving each in attendance license to participate in the action as an outlet for their frustrations and monotony of their everyday lives.  Just as I felt as if I was part of the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings so here again I feel like I am part of the XMen team.But what really drives my excitement is Brian Singer's seemingly boundless ability to correctly interpret the true spirit of the XMen comics.  Individually as a team hero and villain alike he has somehow tapped into the heart of these books and like the title says united them in a film that defied my highest expectations and ignites my imagination.

Now the XMen are back together once again and this time they've got some new friends including Nightcrawler and Pyro and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike his personal mutant assistantslave. This time the XMen find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique their nemeses from the first film against an evil military scientist named William Stryker whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.X2 XMen United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological it's longer there's more action more mutants more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags right from the getgo X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact X2 is almost the perfect comic book film almost. The one little weak link in X2 for me at least was Nightcrawler. Now I like the character of Nightcrawler but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming he came off as a bit weak and kind of dorky. The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the XJet which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House was his religious side which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast Jackman McKellen Stewart Marsden Janssen Berry Paquin Cox Romijn and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000 and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first XMen there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor and plenty of action maybe even more so than the original. And like the original X2 sets itself up for a third film let's just hope it turns out at the very least as good as the first two films if not better.".

	schema:reviewBody "They've done a hell of a lot right. That's my response to Singer's XMen films they're slick funny emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.Admirably the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging storyline amongst the bigger picture and although the story is not without its fault using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi been there seen it before it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters and it is for the continued development of these relationships  and not the cool story line and action sequences  that makes me look forward to another Xfilm.I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant  and it's true the casting is great  but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role and although his role in X2 is small James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the Xsters as Cyclops. In the first Xfilm he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags but he's been left in the gutter for X2 and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this and hopefully when XMen 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.Thankfully most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.Ultimately there are just a few slipups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed and for the most part X2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins. We are shown a tour guide leading students and adults through the White House in Washington DC. It seems normal enough. A security guard notices someone straying off the path and asks if he is lost. The man raises his head and a tail flicks out from behind him. Before the security guard can do anything he is down on the ground alerting all security in the area of a mutant attack. The blue creature known later as Nightcrawler teleports past dozens of guards and kicks and whips them with his tail and fists. Finally the action dies down with the creature being shot not killed and we are left to catch our breaths. Reader I'll tell you it took me a few moments to catch mine.It sure looks as if X2 is on the right track for a sequel and if anything it seems better. The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film and though the action never quite again reaches its highpoint as in the beginning it sets the film up for other nonstop action sequences just like the James Bond movies are known for doing.But that's not all XMen 2 or X2 as the posters abbreviate is all about. It has an important human element that adds to the pure nonstop fullblooded actionspectaculars throughout the film. The cast is bigger the budget is bigger the story is bigger and the action is plentiful. Teenagers will enjoy the action side and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story. It seamlessly combines both these two elementstechniques even more than the original film did. I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first but I must say I did.It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world.The film begins with an assassination attempt on the president's life carried out by a teleporting mutant. This act upsets the entire world and the president is about to begin the mutanthuman war predicted by Charles Xavier Patrick Stewart in the first film. In an effort to get to the bottom of the attack on the president's life and prevent worldwide war Xavier sends out Storm Halle Berry and Dr. Jean Grey Famke Janssen to search for the teleporting mutant and discover the truth behind the assassination attempt.Meanwhile Logan Wolverine Hugh Jackman has returned to Xavier's mansion after searching for any signs of his past. He has found none. He is greeted by Rogue Anna Paquin and her new boyfriend Bobby Iceman who was briefly seen in the first film and is given a deeper character backdrop in this film. But soon things start to turn for the worst as an attack on Xavier's mansion is led by Stryker Brian Cox the man behind the assassination attempt who wants all mutants to be killed off. He kidnaps Charles Xavier and reveals that he wishes for Charles to kill all mutants.How? By focusing Xavier's psychic powerstelepathy on a particular group of people Xavier can actually kill them. So Stryker plans to use his disowned mutant son who also has psychic powers to control Xavier's mind sort of and focus on all the mutants in the world automatically killing them.With this plot in motion Mystique Rebecca RomijnStamos has little time to free Eric Magneto which results in a truly amazing escape sequence which I will not spoil for you.Now in an ironic moment old enemies must fight together to bring down Stryker before his plan follows through. But the band of XMen are far from solving their problems as a new mutant Lady Deathstrike Kelly Hu may stand in their way of defeating Stryker. And Wolverine may also find the key to his past in this mess.XMen 2 unlike other sequels improves upon itself. Tragic sequels go to the dogs when the filmmakers are either too proud to try and surpass the original or are too arrogant to even attempt it. XMen was an excellent comicbook adaptation in more ways than one and XMen 2 is only better. It contains more action than SpiderMan and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original which is ironic since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes.The cast is firstclass but the real scenestealer just like in the original is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.  If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan they need look no farther because though he may not look the part in this film Jackman can look very suave and proper see Kate and Leopold and is my top choice for the next Bond.Comic book films are usually hitormiss. They're never in between. XMen was an unexpected hit but more than that a good unexpected hit. It wasn't all hype. It was smart actionpacked and hat a great character side to it. Like I said before XMen 2 improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor.I expect XMen 2 to break some box office records and unlike other films I can honestly say that it deserves it.4.55 stars John Ulmer".

Fun tongueincheek screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris w David Hayter Zak Penn and director Bryan Singer getting story credits keeps up with the multilayered storyline encompassing class welfare social strata and in general to accept one for who they are and not what they are. Well done!";

	schema:reviewBody "The XMen has always been my favorite comic book without a doubt. Spiderman is probably in second place but The XMen take the cake.  Ever since I heard a sequel was going into the works and Bryan Singer was still on board as director I had faith that he would do the sequel justice...of course I couldn't help but have that looming fear that something would go wrong.  In the end the film was released and of course I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.After seeing the film I can definitely say it's been a long time since I've come out of a movie theater as happy as I did for this film.  The story was absolutely brilliant and was told in the perfect manner to keep you interested.  ...And of course there are plenty of new characters and action to keep the audience in awe as well.Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film.  Nightcrawler Kurt Wagner has always been one of favorite XMen characters perhaps even more than Wolverine...but that's up for debate. Teleportation has GOT to be one of the coolest and most interesting ideas for a mutant ability!  I was incredibly stoked to see him brought to life on the big screen Bryan Singer and Alan Cumming did a FANTASTIC job!  Next to Wolverine Colossus has also got to be one of my favorite characters.  I can't even begin to express how happy I was to see him in the film...although not NEARLY enough was done with him when there was so much potential for his abilities in the film.  Oh well there's always XMen 3 right?  The other two new characters Pyro John Allerdyce and Lady Deathstrike Yuriko Oyama were very well done as well although not much of their character histories were explained...which is ok there is only so much time in a film.  The rest of the characters already had a firm basis from the previous film and were all executed extremely well in this sequel my hat is off to Mr. Bryan Singer Keep up the good work!The entire cast was absolutely perfect for the film.  Ian McKellan Patrick Stewart Hugh Jackman Halle Berry Famke Janssen James Marsden Rebecca RomijnStamos Brian Cox Alan Cumming Bruce Davison Anna Paquin Kelly Hu Aaron Stanford Shawn Ashmore and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work truly fantastic.The story in this sequel is great.  I love the idea of the good and the bad having an equal threat and being forced to work together in order to save them all.  The chemistry and the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier is so bizarre and interesting...and very thought provoking.  There are so many interesting and well done relationships between characters in the film Logan Wolverine  Scott Summers Cyclops Rogue  Bobby Drake Iceman Jean Grey  Scott Summers Cyclops and Jean Grey  Logan Wolverine to name a few.  I love just watching them all interact with each other.What it all boils down to is this if you liked the first film then you should definitely like this film.  I'm not sure I could say I liked X2 better than the original but I'd definitely feel comfortable saying it was just as good...and better in certain aspects but not as a whole.I would definitely recommend seeing this film in the theater or at least rent it when it's released it's well worth your time.  This film isn't all about superheroes action and fantasy there is a lot more to it than just that and I hope you can see and appreciate that.  I do hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do and thank you for reading my review be sure to read my review for the first XMen.ChrisP.S.  They better start crackin' on a X3 right away!Also..here's some interesting trivia for ya.  In the scene where Mystique is finding out where Magneto is being held she is scrolling through a bunch of names the name above Lensherr Erik Magneto is LeBeau Remy...aka Gambit...nice little touch there I didn't get a look at the other names there but there might be more allusions there.  Another cool thing is in the scene where the security guard is in the bar there is a TV on in the background with a guy named Hank McCoy talking...Hank McCoy later becomes known as Beast.  Pretty cool huh...".

	schema:headline " X2 XMen 2 Arguably the best of the series. Thoughfull exciting and exceedingly wellconstructed.";
	schema:reviewBody "With nine films thus far and at least two more on the horizon all released over a neartwenty year window 20th Century Fox's XMen film franchise is something of a wonder in today's world of near constant reboots and remakes. While it has by no means been a smooth ride the fact remains that the longrunning series has been a widely beloved and infinitely important one especially when placed into historical perspective. Director Bryan Singer's original entry was one of the first major comictofilm adaptations that convinced studios and audiences alike that comicbook movies could not only be mature and enthralling but could be certified hits once again after the genre seemed to dieout in the 90's. And thus a franchise was born and has stuck around ever since through thick and thin.It's almost a surprise however that one of the best entries in the entire saga came so early 2003's followup X2. With Singer once again at the helm the film is in every conceivable way an improvement over his excellent first film it's more thoughtful more daring more exciting... I think one could even reasonably say that not only is it arguably the greatest film in the franchise it just might be one of the best comictofilm adaptations of all time. Yes it's that good.Some time after the original film a brainwashed mutant called Nightcrawler Alan Cumming is sent on a mission to try and assassinate the President of the United States under the guise of being a martyr for Mutant Freedom. Despite the mutant being stopped the troubling event gives Colonel William Stryker Brian Cox the political edge and backing needed to get approval for an investigation on Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters but his investigation is actually an invasion as he storms the school taking many students hostage and forcing the remaining XMen to flee. At the same time Storm Halle Berry and Jean Grey Famke Janssen are sent on a mission to collect Nightcrawler and learn his motivation for the attack Cyclops James Marsden and Professor Xavier Patrick Stewart are captured by Stryker's mysterious bodyguard Kelly Hu and the shapeshifting Mystique Rebecca RomijnStamos helps her former leader Magneto Ian McKellan escape from his hightech prison. Soon the remaining mutants including Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Anna Paquin as Rogue and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman are forced to team up with their former adversary to try and stop Stryker's scheme to use Charles and his powers to wipe out all of the mutants on Earth.Given the film's nature as an ensemble piece it's nearimpossible to discuss the performances of each actor individually. But to keep it brief everyone returning from the original is great in their respective roles. Special commendation goes to Hugh Jackman and his continued excellence in the role that helped to define him as a superstar and to Famke Jannsen who gets a lot more attention this time around. They are by far the standouts of the returning cast. I also highly enjoyed Stewart and McKellen who bring a sense of class and elegance to their roles and are incredible as always. The newest additions are also outstanding. Brian Cox is one of the greatest actors of our time and his turn as Stryker is quite remarkable. He gives the character both an easily despiseable sense of threat and dread yet also a nice and subtle sense of pain and pathos. He's a cruel man yet he has a past that might explain why he is the way he is. Alan Cumming is just magical as the frightened yet also amusing Nightcrawler and there's a lot of great moments in his performance. And Kelly Hu makes for a fun and furious adversary as Styker's secondincommand Lady Deathstrike.Singer returns to direct from a script by XMen scribe David Hayter and the writing duo of Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Singer got his start with hardhitting thrillers like The Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil and I think that's part of what gives him an edge with the storytelling. He plays the stories straight and gives them a sense of real and honest threat while also maintaining an emotional core that feels realistic despite the outlandish nature of the story and heavy ScienceFiction leanings of the material. He's also a very gifted visual artist with a slick and savage sense of composition and flow that lends itself well to the needs of high concept action. His work on the series has always been nothing less than stunning. The script is very tightly written and juggles the plethora of characters well everyone has their moment to shine every major player has a clearly defined role and arc and the pacing is superb. Some wonderful work is done with the writing and it's an honest shame that neither Hayter nor the writing partners of Dougherty and Harris were involved in the third entry.The rest of the production is just marvelous. Pardon the bad joke Composercoeditor John Ottman shapes some wonderful and memorable musical themes that compliment the tone and style perfectly and he weaves together shots and sequences with a masterful touch. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel's visual palette is cool and visually arresting and his work is just stunningly gorgeous. Some wonderful visual flair is given thanks to his talent. And production and costume design courtesy Guy Hendrix Dyas and Louise Mingenbach respectively is just fantastic. The film is made with nothing but topnotch work from topnotch artists.As it stands X2 is easily one of the best if not the single best entry in the longrunning series. Its phenomenal direction sharp and thoughtful writing beautiful production and outstanding cast weave an enthralling and thrilling cinematic experience that still stands tall well over a decade later. It's up there with the best of the best in terms of comicbook movies.There's no other way to look at it X2 easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.".

He's not totally wrong like Empire X2 is darker than its predecessor characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed there's even a I am your fatherstyle revelation concerning Wolverine's past which is given more space here than in the first chapter. In fact the movie could have been named X2 Humanity Strikes Back. That's right this time it's the ordinary people who are raising hell in particular William Stryker Brian Cox a military scientist who takes advantage of the increasing paranoia surrounding mutants and has the POTUS himself approve his plan to take down the monsters once and for all. The war is about to begin and with Professor X Patrick Stewart and Cyclops James Marsden gone the only XMen left to face Stryker are Jean Grey Famke Janssen Storm Halle Berry and Wolverine Hugh Jackman with some help from Rogue Anna Paquin and Iceman Shawn Ashmore. They are eventually joined by a former employee of Stryker's the blueskinned teleporter Nightcrawler Alan Cumming as well as the most unlikely ally around Magneto Ian McKellen who has managed to escape from the plastic prison he was locked up in the breakout plays like the Marvel version of Hannibal Lecter's escape in The Silence of the Lambs and yes that is a compliment.The plot is loosely based on the famous graphic novel God Loves Man Kills by Xguru Chris Calremont the villain and the alliance with Magneto are explicitly taken from that story but Singer makes it all much more apocalyptic Stryker was simply a preacher in the comicbook while also having the time to take a look at some of the first film's subplots the WolverineJeanCyclops love triangle is taken to a new unexpected level and the Canadian mutant's forgotten origin starts getting slowly unveiled Wolverine Who are you? Stryker Don't you remember?. Jackman is the standout in this movie as we finally get to see everybody's favorite Xfella lose it and make the bad guys regret they showed up in the first place. Those sequences are a treat for those who have grown up loving Wolverine and his dual conflicted nature. Another actor who leaves a memorable impression is Cumming with his portrayal of Nightcrawler one of the mutants people fear the most he looks like a demon but also the one who's most willing to forgive mankind for its mistakes.So with all the great acting good writing and clever direction no wonder X2 was voted the greatest comicbook movie ever before SpiderMan 2 and Batman Begins were released. This is one superhero opus you won't want to miss.9510".

	schema:reviewBody "In the XMen comics the Jean GreyPhoenixDark Phoenix sequence originally from the 1970's and 80's was one of the alltime great storylines in all of comics history. In fact it's still going because Marvel realized somewhat too late just how powerful that theme was with the fans. The echos and spinoffs from the Phoenix saga have kept resonating through all the XMen titles with followon characters like the postPhoenix real Jean Grey in the longrunning XFactor series her apparent clone Madelyne Pryor whom Scott Summers married when Jean was MIA and presumed dead had a son with then separated Rachel GreySummers the daughter of Jean and Scott from an alternate timeline and ongoing conflicts between Scott and Wolverine Jean's two lovers. And the Phoenix entity itself keeps showing up once in a while. Jean herself has been put through a confusing nearendless cycle of deathresurrectionPhoenix reanimation though it seems unlikely any of these would make it into the movies since the Xfilms have now defined a path of their own.According to screenwriter Zak Penn the original concept for the movie X2 XMen United was to go all the way into the Phoenix story but he persuaded director Bryan Singer to hold back on it till the XMen movie world was more well established. On its own merit I'd say that was a wise move it's just that in X3 2006 under different director Brett Ratner they actually did go into Phoenix and messed it up. However hope springs eternal. We'll see what the new Dark Phoenix 2019 has to show us next year with the rebooted younger XMen cast. Fingers crossed.Anyway in X2 we just get three short moments when the Phoenix entity makes its appearance within Jean as a sort of prelude but they're exciting moments in themselves and a key to the big climactic scene that is the payoff to the whole movie. From the moment of its theater release 2003 X2 has been one of my favorite movies let alone superhero movies. And I'll say that a rating of 1010 doesn't mean 'perfect' which as far as I'm concerned can't be defined for films it just reflects how I feel about it. I watched this again on DVD just this week and it still holds up very well against all the other movies in this nowbig genre. My top 5 list of alltime best superhero flicks right now is no particular order X2 Thor Iron Man Avengers and Wonder Woman. What do they have in common? The answer isn't great special effects although they all have that. It's a storyline and b characters that we care about just like in any good movie of any genre. X2 from 15 years back is the oldest of these. Its special effects are just fine for what it needs but the point is that it does NOT rely on its big action sequences as its whole reason for being. It's what happens BETWEEN those action set pieces that matters the story the characters the dialog. If those are good then you've got something that lasts. After the success of the first XMen 2000 we eagerly looked forward to the second instalment with anticipation and a bit of anxiety would it be as good? maybe even better? It delivered and that was important the whole idea of the superhero genre was very new then and its eventual success was not at all guaranteed. The familiar Xpeople were back the key actors were more comfortable with their roles and the new people Nightcrawler Pyro and brief bits by Colossus and Shadowcat fitted in well  the opening scene of the movie where Nightcrawler blitzes the White House guards to get to the president is one of the great introductions to a character who's going to play a substantial role in the rest of the movie.The XMen franchise has had some distinctive things going for it compared with the MCU. Right from the start it's had something closer to gender parity with Storm Jean Mystique Rogue all having strong roles. And X2 easily passes the Bechdel test as an example see the scenes between Jean and Storm when they go off to track down Nightcrawler. This is ground that the MCU still hasn't covered 15 years later. Another strong point is that the dialog and direction of the Xfilms doesn't rely on Joss Whedonlike selfreferential humor irony or snark. Those have their place  at Whedon's best it's brilliant  but at times it's just nice to watch something that takes itself seriously and where the issues feel real. Wonder Woman 2017 fits that category too.On repeated viewings of X2 though you really start to admire the structure of the plot  its complex web of interlocking storylines and characters and the patient way in which it all unfolds until everything finally comes together in the last halfhour. Just about every piece of the web that appears in the first half of the film large or small gets used in the second half. If your movie is just a framework for running from one action scene to another for the sake of eye candy you can't do that. Who is actually the central character among this big cast and complex story? Logan Hugh Jackman is the center of a subplot about uncovering his own origin but he's not at the epicenter of the entire film. Magneto Ian McKellen is in a lot of scenes and is the leader of a sort of parallel attack on Stryker but again no. Professor X Patrick Stewart is MIA in the middle of the film again! and surprisingly we hardly notice. As I hinted above this movie belongs to Jean Grey Famke Janssen. On a second or third viewing you can see the ending coming in what happens with Jean throughout the film including especially the first appearances of the immensely powerful Phoenix force within her. And it's the last 15 minutes that lift this movie from good to great. Jean's heartrending fully selfaware sacrifice allows all the rest of the team to survive along with the mutant kids rescued from the evil Stryker's clutches. Greater love hath no man. The emotional kick of this scene is doubled by the grief pouring out from Scott and Logan who both desperately loved her in different ways. Not that there aren't other good action sequences at well calibrated intervals. There's the visit of Bobby Rogue Pyro and Wolverine to Bobby's parents' house where we get the best line of the film from Bobby's mother Have you tried ... not being a mutant? which goes sideways when the police arrive. There's the Blackbird chase by two fighter planes with the moment when the Phoenix force first pops up the allout violence of the fight between Wolverine and Deathstryke and the extended battle within the giant hydropower damturnedlab. But again it's what happens between these that is important. The characters develop interact grow and end up different people than they started.It was a letdown that X3 2006 couldn't continue the string. The franchise wouldn't rise to these heights again until Days of Future Past 2014. We'll see what next year's Dark Phoenix has to bring. The storyline is still begging for a good treatment.A footnote Jean Grey is a puzzingly colorless name no pun intended given that it's from Stan Lee himself that lovable promoter and genius behind the Marvel superhero universe. Stan came up with loads of strong andor alliterative names for his comics characters like Susan Storm Peter Parker Jessica Jones Luke Cage Ororo Munroe Scott Summers Rogue Reed Richards Ben Grimm Stephen Strange Nick Fury and dozens more. Why something so ordinary?".

	onyx:emotionText "In the XMen comics the Jean GreyPhoenixDark Phoenix sequence originally from the 1970's and 80's was one of the alltime great storylines in all of comics history. In fact it's still going because Marvel realized somewhat too late just how powerful that theme was with the fans. The echos and spinoffs from the Phoenix saga have kept resonating through all the XMen titles with followon characters like the postPhoenix real Jean Grey in the longrunning XFactor series her apparent clone Madelyne Pryor whom Scott Summers married when Jean was MIA and presumed dead had a son with then separated Rachel GreySummers the daughter of Jean and Scott from an alternate timeline and ongoing conflicts between Scott and Wolverine Jean's two lovers.

	schema:reviewBody "Having already seen the first Xmen movie and loved it I couldn't wait to watch the followup XMen 2 and it didn't let me down. From it's themes and action scenes to the acting and direction Xmen 2 is a superior sequel to the first one in almost every possible way.The movie begins with a indoctrinated mutant named Nightcrawler breaking into the White House and tries to kill the president but is unable to and flees. In the meantime Wolverine journeys to an old army base in Canada to find evidence about his past but discovers nothing. Professor X locates Nightcrawler and sends Jean Gray and Strom to find him while William Stryker gets permission from the president to examine the X Mansion for it's mutant ties. Stryker's forces than attack the mansion and abduct several students while Wolverine and a few other mutants are able to escape while Professor X and Cyclops are also captured. Now the remaining Xmen and Magneto must unite to save the professor and stop Stryker from executing his plans of destroying all of mutant kind.With sequels remakes and reboots being the main summer blockbusters these days it's becoming harder and harder to find an action movie that has the capability to grasp your mind and engage your concentration so rigidly and doesn't let go until the film ends XMen 2 is one such movie. Usually there are only a handful of movies where the followup is able to take all the previous elements from the first movie effectively toss out anything that doesn't work and goes on to not only smash people's doubts or any kind of excitement for the movie but also utterly revalues and enhances the genre's credibility like The Dark Knight or Terminator 2. Given how the Xmen feel more political and emotional than most other superheroes the main aspects of the story lie with the characters and their battles for acceptance their thoughts on how the world sees them their relationships with each other and how they all play a part in the story at hand while at the films core lies something a lot of modern action movies lack heart.But it's also thanks to director Brian Singer's obviously endless capabilities to accurately portray the authentic essence of the comics in a way that only a few directors have been able to do. Singly wither they be hero villain or as a team Brian has managed to touch upon the emotional center of the comics and bring all these heroes and villains together in a movie that has no need for epic battles or witty dialog but instead focuses on the lost arts of character development and interaction. Now that's not saying that Singer follows the comics note for note as he does change things but doesn't destroy it like what Josh Trank did to Fant4stic and while Brian's version of the Xmen allows the viewer to appreciate that any changes made to the team are for the better like how skillfully Singer handles the character of Jean Gray and her hidden abilities as he reinterprets this variation by still bestowing her this power but using it to develop Jean as a character and allows the viewer to see the abilities she has and at the same time Singer treats her along with the viewing audience and the fans with the utmost admiration while another fine case in Singer's abilities of character analysis is taking a villain like William Stryker who was a religious fanatic in the comics and turning him into a more dangerous bigot who still retrains some of his original holierthanthou attitude but making Stryker a military man makes him even more ruthless and evil allowing Singer to give us a more complex and developed villain with a clearcut plan and by adding in important subplots and characters that are used effectively make the movie what it is.The movie's screenplay is able to juggle it's vast amount of characters without feeling too rushed as it gives each hero and villain a decent amount of development as well as has a change to have their moment without the movie feeling too cumbersome while there are plenty of Easter eggs for fans of the comics that don't endanger the course of the story. The movie also has a lot more smooth action scenes than the first one including Nightcrawler's spectacular attack on the White House and Wolverine slicing and dicing Stryker's men during the attack on the X mansion while John Ottman gives us some incredible and catchy themes that complement the movie while the editing and cinematography are to a high level.Of course the movie would be nothing without it's cast and it delivers that on a silver platter. Ian McKellan continues to show his acting credibility as Magneto and he doesn't hold back when it comes to the malice and warmongering yet brings a level of class to the character as does Patrick Stewart as Professor X by conveying a relaxed grace as well as all the characteristics of a father figure and leader while Halle Berry brings the usual believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Anna Paquin is back as Rouge and gives a fantastic performance as does James Marsden as Cyclops even if he's given little to do Rebecca Romjin once again brings a dangerous edge to Mystique. Shawn Ashmore is believable as Iceman showing great emotional range while being very likable. Aaron Stanford is great as Pyro Famkie Jensen is again fantastic as Jean Grey and is given quite a lot of development which makes her all the more relatable. Allan Cummings is fantastic as Nightcrawler while Brian Cox plays a wonderfully menacing William Stryker. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine and has completely made the role his own from the action scenes to the emotional moments.Go watch this movie it's truly awesome.".

I also liked Rogue a lot more than in the first one.We get a few more characters spotlighted such as Pyro and Ice Man. The standout is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler he is one of the coolest characters in the entire franchise. We also get a wonderful villain in William Stryker played by Brian Cox.The film has a great storyline that hints more of Wolverine's past and brings up many interesting themes. It also has bigger better action sequences than the first one with the best one being the brutal fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike. The music score is once again really good.My only real issues are that the film is just a little too long and what lead to Jean Grey's death felt a bit weird I understand why it had to happen though.This was a great sequel that builds and improves upon its predecessor like any sequel should.

	schema:headline "  Somethings Wrong   Yeah The Script";
	schema:reviewBody " SPOILERS I wasnt all that taken with the original XMEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word  Plot  but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions  stunts and special effects Its here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying  Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but theres not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters  and  The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off  Note to Hollywood studios  If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after youve done that write another one and anotherRegardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and thats the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F16s on the tail of the escaping XMen  I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film its logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason its Wolverine whos the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters So I wasnt too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isnt enough any more".

	onyx:emotionText " SPOILERS I wasnt all that taken with the original XMEN movie but since it was the introduction of a franchise I forgave the flaws like the underdeveloped themes of antagonism between the humans and mutants . X2 has no such excuses however since the plot revolves around Magneto and a rogue human general trying to start a war between the humans and mutants . Well I used the word  Plot  but just like in a Roger Moore Bond film or a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster the plot gets drowned out by explosions  stunts and special effects Its here I wish to absolve the screenwriters for most of the blame of a muddled underdeveloped story because I can imagine the screenplay being repeatedly returned to the writers with a note saying  Okay Jean and Wolverine are in love but theres not enough teen romance so introduce a couple of teen characters  and  The boys at special effects have come up with a new morphing effect so write a few scenes where we can show it off  Note to Hollywood studios  If you think writing a screenplay is so easy try writing one . Then after youve done that write another one and anotherRegardless of the pressure they were under there is a couple of things the writers are guilty of and thats the mutants using their special powers to escape from a tight spot . F16s on the tail of the escaping XMen  I bet Storm can conjure up a few twisters . Yup thought so and this type of cheating takes place far too often but the fundamental error lies in a way a character is killed . If Jean dies at the end of the film its logical that Jean should be the focus of the story but for some reason its Wolverine whos the focus for much of the story which is a blunder on the part of the screenwriters So I wasnt too keen on this sequel at all and as recent blockbusters like LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL show a good memorable fantasy adventure is down to a script that allows good actors to act and have special effects that arise naturally from the story . Cramming a film with special effects just isnt enough any more";

There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134minute film.Having said that I do think the film needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action it needed more breaks. It's just too much. Either that or shorten the story.Rebecca RomjinStamos in her skintight outfit is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here such as Patrick Stewart Hugh Jackman Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution as a fact early on once again they do have something unusual in today's films a Christian character who was a good guy.All in all if you liked the first film you'll like this.".

	schema:headline " Of X2 and Reloaded Matrix is clearly the better comic book film";
	schema:reviewBody "So many rave reviews that I just have to add my bit cause frankly  I didn't like it. Okay so Matrix was not adapted from a comic book. Still it is clearly a comicbook film  exact same style approach feel and substance. It could have been a comic and a good one at that! Another thing  I never was a fan of the original XMen comic. Then again ol' Supes or Batman never gave me shivers either and still I loved the first Superman and Batman movies so that don't mean a thing. So  what's so wrong with this movie? Well basically I think it's just... DUMB. Yeah that's the word  dumb! The scenario and everybody in it is just so dumb it makes you cry. Hell with prof. X's supapowers and Cerebro I'd have fixed the Magneto problem in no time! Being Magneto and having codesigned the thing I would have killed all those pesky norms in a sec too which it is clearly able to do according to the film! And then the army guy... with an asset like Mastermind couldn't he really think of a more well intelligent way of fighting the mutants? Well of course he is an army dude so maybe that's asking too much. And then the regular guys like in the scene where Pyro blows up a load of cop cars You heard about those big bad mutants guys?style  being one of the soldiers I would go like BANG  Yeah I heard. I also heard most of you guys aren't BULLET PROOF!!!. That's one more thing  haven't they invented the gun yet in the XMen universe? Most of the mutants are not powerprotected in  any way from bullets except when Magneto's around of course still none of them ever seems to think of wearing some Kevlar let alone a gun. So okay I know it might have been a problem in the comic because of CCA regulations but still couldn't they have changed that for the movie just to make it less dumb? It would change the whole dynamic of the thing. So are there qualities redeeming the lack of basic intelligence throughout the movie? Not many... most of Wolverine's dry humor is gone and Wolverine as a character seems less interesting than in the first X though this does not seem to be a problem with the acting  see below. The fight scenes are just boring sometimes even offensively so Deathstryke could have killed Wolverine a thousand times in that fight and still she lost it in the lamest manner imaginable  what a bummer. The other action scenes don't get a lot better that plane chase for instance  there were a thousand ways they could have made that one tons more exciting than by just using YASP Yet Another SuperPower. The acting is very good for some awful for others. Ian McKellen shines as always  I bet he could even make a Coca Cola ad look exciting.  Patrick Stewart also does a very good job at it  he really CAN do something more than Trek and I really look forward to seeing him in better fares than this. And Hugh Jackman is still a good Wolverine though he didn't get half the chances to show it that he got in the first movie. Even RomijnStamos did a pretty good job a lot better than in the previous film. The rest of the acting though ranged from the simply lame to the excruciatingly bad. Nightcrawler made me crawl up the walls but not in the funny way it was clearly intended. And finally there is  the whole soapfactor  who isn't having an affair with whom in this movie? I remember this being one of the things that hit my crapometer in the comics too  but just because it's crap that's in the comic that don't mean you have to keep that crap for the movie! All in all I feel like this movie could have been a lot better which is a pity. I had a negative feeling about the first X movie as well but the more I thought about it and the more I saw it the better it became. In the end it finished about sidebyside with the original Matrix movie. X2 started out as just boring in my book however  it only got worse each time I thought back about it and the second sitting of it was just torture. This movie will be a must for lovers of the XMen comic as it quite faithfully reproduces its feel all of the crap in the original books included. For those who do not fall into that category however go see Reloaded or if you have already go see it a second time  you will be the better for it.".

To be brutally honest I've never really been that impressed with the genre with the notable exceptions being the excellent Blade films  the fun SpiderMan flicks  the silly titled X2 why not XMen 2? does nothing to change my overall opinion. I think one factor is these larger than life superhero character's with all manner of odd abilities were designed for a 2D comic book rather than a 3D film  with a few expectations they look better as a comic strip than a live action character the basic mechanics  demands of a full length feature film are just very different than a simple comic strip. The script by Michael Dougherty Dan Harris  David Hayter is really weak the character's are poor  lets not forget that not everyone will have read the comics or seen the original film the story is also very poor. It feels very slow  pedestrian most of it takes place between mutants in imaginary settings  therefore I found it very hard to think of the film taking place in reality. I know it's pure scifi but for it to work it needs to be grounded in some sort of recognisable reality otherwise where's the threat coming from? Also the XMen themselves are too powerful between them they can do just about anything including Wolverine who can get shot on the head yet heal himself. You just always felt they would be able to overcome any situation they find themselves in  it just kills any excitement or tension. At well over two hours X2 feels like it goes on forever there aren't that many memorable setpieces  as a whole I think X2 is one of the poorer Marvel superhero comic book films.Director Singer does alright but there's not much here that really stands out there are a few forgettable fights some exploding cop cars a bust dam spewing water  a few flashy CGI computer effects. In fact I was quite surprised at how bland  routine feeling the action scenes were considering the budget. I also didn't like the way this was filmed the scene at the end when Xavier  the rest of the XMen turn up in the President's office with lightening flashing outside is truly embarrassing. I suspect that it was meant to be sinister  atmospheric but I just thought it looked awful  over dramatic. The special effects are generally very good but like most CGI computer effects you just 'know' what your watching is an effect.With a supposed budget of about 110000000 one has to say X2 is well made with high production values  that big budget Hollywood look  feel to it. I personally thought the acting was awful the scenes at the end as they mourn Jean Grey are embarrassing the shots around the camp fire as Magneto fills the rest of the XMen in on Stryker's plans  they all try to look worried  concerned is another cringe worthy moment as is Rouge's 'scared' reaction when she lands the jet plane at the end. Hugh Jackman can't act Halle Berry can't act how did she ever win an Oscar? although she does look good in tight leather  even great actors like Ian McKellen  Patrick Stewart seem off colour.X2 was a big disappointment to me I was expecting lots of action  great effects but what I ended up with was a passable superhero comic book adaptation  nothing more. The story is very weak the character's are weak  the action is forgettable. Followed by XMen The Last Stand 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "FOr the most part I thought the first X Men film was OK. I thought there could have been more action and a little more character development. I think that X 2 did a little better at character development and had a little more action.Wolverine is in this film about as much as the first film. I guess he is the most popular X Men member so he gets the most screen time. Wolverine does get in some more solid action in this film but I wonder with how much he is in these X Men films how much more they can show in the upcoming Wolverine film.Mystique is in this film a lot. She really is pretty important to the film. It is kind of cool how she is completely naked other than having some sharp patches on her and being blue. Magneto is kind of on both sides in this film as far as being both a good guy and a bad guy.I was hoping to see a lot of my two favorite X Men Colossus and Ice Man. Colossus was awesome as he gets a brief scene where he attacks some guys who break into the X Mansion but that is it. He does not show up really at all after that scene. Ice Man is in this film a marginal amount and he got to show some dramatic scenes where he expresses his love for Rogue as well as how he tells his family that he is a mutant. But I was disappointed with how little he used his abilities. Could have been cooler but at least he was a developed character.Jean Gray is pretty cool in this film also. Storm was OK but I do not know something seems to be missing with her character. I also liked Nightcrawler and he is very important to the film and is developed correctly. Cyclops once again did not seem as cool as he was in the comics and does not get to do that much.I think the film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. It has pretty good flow and there is a lot happening. But there is a lot of good action about a half hour into the film in the X Mansion scene but that is the best action part of the film. THere are other action scenes but nothing as good as that part so after the X Mansion scene there is nothing as good as that. I expected a better final showdown at the end of this film against Magneto better than the one in the first film but there was NO SHOWDOWN with Magneto in this film. The ending I thought was kind of boring.THere could have been more action but what they had was pretty good not great. THey do a good job with certain characters portrayal though and that is a big improvement from the first film. A little better than the first one but still has some flaws. I recommend it over the first one.".

Ice Man is in this film a marginal amount and he got to show some dramatic scenes where he expresses his love for Rogue as well as how he tells his family that he is a mutant. But I was disappointed with how little he used his abilities. Could have been cooler but at least he was a developed character.Jean Gray is pretty cool in this film also. Storm was OK but I do not know something seems to be missing with her character. I also liked Nightcrawler and he is very important to the film and is developed correctly. Cyclops once again did not seem as cool as he was in the comics and does not get to do that much.I think the film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. It has pretty good flow and there is a lot happening. But there is a lot of good action about a half hour into the film in the X Mansion scene but that is the best action part of the film. THere are other action scenes but nothing as good as that part so after the X Mansion scene there is nothing as good as that. I expected a better final showdown at the end of this film against Magneto better than the one in the first film but there was NO SHOWDOWN with Magneto in this film. The ending I thought was kind of boring.THere could have been more action but what they had was pretty good not great. THey do a good job with certain characters portrayal though and that is a big improvement from the first film. A little better than the first one but still has some flaws. I recommend it over the first one.";

I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation see The Usual Suspects. Yet I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. I do highly recommend the original XMen but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre such as Batman Begins Hellboy V For Vendetta or Sin City.".

It has smart script that doesn't make you groan because of the stupidity of the screenwriters half the time as most of the other superhero movies do. It's really entertaining lots of humor magnificent fighting scenesthe opening sequence will forever remain a classic in that department IMO  astonishing combination of creative special effects fight choreography and totally fitting great classical music actors who  are really good and concentrated on their jobespecially Ian McKellen who is once again awesome as Magnetto and even some actual message behind all the fights and superpowers that really works. It also has what is always most important for a good movie and that's a smart director who knows his job. Bryan Singer is showing his talent here getting good performances from all of his actors despite the CGI scenes being aplentybut they are  really well done much better than Spiderman 2 for example and also creating a visual feast and an unique feel to the movie. And I've never even read the comics before but I really felt close to the characters and easily got engaged in the XMen universe. Lastly but definitely not least important is the fact that this movie has one of the greatest looking female cast ever assembled in a mainstream movie. Halle Berry Anna Paquin Famke Janssen and the ultragorgeous Rebecca Romijn Stamoswho even has a short but memorable appearance without the blue paint that goes with her Mystique part  it doesn't get better than that. And all those lovely ladies can act pretty well too. Not that their parts were difficult of course but in comparison with the pathetic failures we so often see by the pretty actresses in the blockbuster movies it's really refreshing to watch a bunch of pretty women who can act decently enough. I highly recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It's even better than the excellent first part.".

Okay now we meet a married couple with a kid who are driving home from a couple of at a remote cabin where conveniently there was no television or radio. When they turn on the car radio they listen to various television broadcasts ! about the war and the zombies. Then the war breaks down and they decide to hide in a building and... and... who cares.I was predisposed to hate this movie because it began with an arty graphic treatment of a poem which seemed inappropriate to the subject matter of the film. I didn't recognize the name of the poet. Then the credits began and loandbehold the poet was none other than one of the producers of the film Amber L. Francis. Now I'm thinking that this rather than just being a backyard production is a pretentious backyard production. However at the end of the film you discover that Ms. Francis who was also a writer and actress in the film died after the production. My condolences. Now I understood the poem and in retrospect I found it very poignant and moving. It was the best thing in the film.I hadn't reviewed a film in a while on the IMDb but as I was watching this film I knew I had to return. I couldn't wait to tear this thing apart. Now out of respect for the late Ms. Francis I will resist the urge. In fact now I will actually try to compliment it.Good things1. Some of the gore wasn't bad  compared to films of a similar budget level. 2. The picture was in focus more often than it was out of focus. 3.

It didn't seem like the actors where just inexperienced it seemed like they where all mentally challenged with mouths full of marbles.The zombie gore effects where also terrible with the camera lingering to show wriggling gummy worms and pieces of raw meat moving up and down with the rhythm of the zombies heart beat and zombies chewing down a sausage link intestines and not even taking a real bite out of it???? The gunfire was made with 99.00 effects Lab software or possibly the lite free version it seemed. The ballistics and flash didn't match up to the weapons and the weapons where lame and generic.The people being attacked just stood like mannequins to be eaten by the zombies there was not any AI or Artificial Intelligence as they put it in the gaming world. The zombies where so slow in this movie you could outrun them with broken legs but healthy young adults couldn't outrun them??? The plot and concept where not original and there where huge jumps or gaps in the plot. I would only recommend this movie to people that I hate with a passion. No wait I don't hate ANYONE that bad.".

But sometimes one comes along that just reeks of failure. Zombie Night is one of those.I sought this out based on a review on ZMDB.org. The review said good acting plot cared about the characters check it out.. but holy crap now I think it was all tongueincheek. The acting is some of the worst I've seen. It's right up there with Zombie Nation and Rising Dead. The actors actually stammer their lines sometimes as if it's difficult to speak. They're so poorly delivered I actually cringed a few times when I wasn't laughing and rolling my eyes. The actors are like talking stone walls until the script says move and then they promptly become stone walls again.The story is average but execution is unenthusiastic and extremely bland. I pray this is the director's first film. You don't care about any of the characters though you do want Derrek to make up his mind on staying or leaving and just wait for the gory parts of which there are few though it is decent special effects for such a lowbudget film. There's a couple topless scenes but other than that fing yawn.Would've been 210 but I gave it an extra star for the decent bloodwork. I was glad when it was over. I wish I could wash this movie off of me.".

With these in mind I purchased Zombie Night from my local DVDCD shop for 4 why not add to the collection? What I didn't expect was that the acting would be SO bad that I would feel almost embarrassed watching and listening to these characters interact in the film. The dialog and actors leave you to believe they were selected minutes before the shooting and given no script as they make quite a few mistakes. Shouldn't they edit those out? Additionally. the editing here was downright confusing. In one scene a couple is listening to the radio on their car stereo and when the girl reaches to turn it up... the scene cuts to live news broadcasts on a television highlighting the zombie uprising before cutting back to the pair in the car discussing the magical TV broadcasts? The cause of the outbreak is practically left to the imagination. Something about WW3 causing nuclear fallout which in turn is causing people to rise from death as flesh hungry zombies? A couple scenes of nice gore including an excellent shotgun blast to the leg and a decent bit of gut munching simply weren't enough save Zombie Night from the ABYSMAL dialog editing and acting. Overall a good rental for the diehard zombie fan or something to pop on if your looking for a laughatwithyourfriends style horror flick.".

I will admit it's something a little new with the zombie genre but the fact is that it makes the zombies less threatening so that sucks !Okay and get this the bad guy Derek he keeps screwing people over and he even kills a girl and the leader of the group Dave lets him go. Okay if i were Dave I would've shot him in both kneecaps and let those zombies eat them. AND WHERE THE HELL DID ALL OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS COME FROM ?!?!?!?! God I wish Dave Francis would just give up on filmmaking but no ! He's making a sequel. He better get it right this time.So I understand that someone died during postproduction now I'm sorry for this loss but seriously don't use that as an excuse to pass off this movie as a good BMovie.

Now enough about that on to the movie. The acting is well... meh the characters are rather dull but over all the movie's not a waste of time. It doesn't feel like a whole movie though. The beginning just cuts in after the zombies spring up the characters know too much about what to do and the ending just seems there. Many of the characters are just there never given a name or background and the number seems to always change. Over all I feel this movie is a good way to kill time. 410".

Rick was the most bad ass character in the whole film he took charge of the situation and forged a path to victory. Too bad he was killed because the writers even though none are credited... surprise surprise cannot think up a good story.The other best part of this movie was the EXPLODING ZOMBIE LEG. Not only did Derek get that shotgun inexplicably but apparently the zombie whose leg Derek shot wasn't actually a zombie but a cyborg which explains the sparks.I feel like I need to take a shower wash my eyes with bleach and watch a good movie after watching this despicable attempt at anything coherent.This movie was written by four people who wanted this movie to be good.".

A guy Mark who looks around 50 is with his girlfriend of roughly one year Amber who looks around 20 and his daughter Emily. Now in an event to get Emily and Amber to bond Mark decides that a postWorld War III vacation to a cabin in Nowheresville a.k.a. CANADA is relevant. During this time keep in mind time is a subjective matter in this film there is no feel for time in this movie. The only real instance we are 'somewhat' presented with a feel is when a still shot of the schoolwarehouseprisonbusiness building is darkened using Photoshop for night and relit for daya virus has changed FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!! into zombies. This staggering number of course has crippled every government military across the globe leaving marshall law in effect.Conveniently about this time Mark's car breaks down and thus the humor ensues. We are introduced to the vague character of Dave who unfortunately at this time his kid who looks roughly the same age as his wife becomes stricken with Zombieitis then gives it to his wife who in turn must be shot by Dave the only time in the film where Dave's acting is above subsubSUBpar.Dave assuming the leader role gathers presumably ten or fifteen guys the number keeps changing one of whom is Derek the REBEL of the group. Derek constantly giving members of the party the one fingered salute eventually is kicked out then returns then leaves on his own will returns again shoots a woman in the stomach so the ridiculously slow and idiotic zombies can feast on her and is finally strung up to a tree whilst the group takes turns punching him in the balls while zombies surround them That's pretty much the basic plot line for this excuse of a movie. Dave is the WORST leader in the modern film era constantly making horrible mistakes as his idiotic sidekicks maintain their loyalty the black guy forces a quirky British accent and people must be trained for a shooting 'stance'. Their brilliant barricade is nothing more than a few empty milk cartons that are eventually removed by Derek!!! and his bald friend.This movie sucks. My ears bled as a man stricken with the disease yells I BEAT CANCER I CAN BEAT THIS TOO and people seemed oblivious to the idea of memorizing lines. Four or five times people began stuttering and the director simply allowed probably assuming that's how people naturally talk.".

If not maybe you'll get tripped up a bit by the flaws but even still I bet you'll watch the whole thing.It's a Zombie Movie right so think about all the cool stuff you like about Zombie movies...yeap it's all there. That Dave Francis the writerdirector really knows his zombie stuff.Basically the story revolves around a group of survivors after a postapocalyptic zombie uprising. The twist with these zombies though is that they only come out at night. They are slow and their bites are infectious but they are plenty and always hungry for human flesh. And they look really good considering the budget. Still it's not so much the zombies but the power struggles between the living and the crumbling of civilization that make the conflict in the story. But like I said it's a zombie movie you want gore not plot...and there is gore aplenty... and you want action and maybe it's no Wild Zero but there is enough fighting and gunplay to go around.The 'exploding leg' alone is worth the price of admission! And yet there is enough interpersonal relationship stuff to keep the girlfriend interested.Now I must admit I helped out on the set of the sequel Zombie Night 2 not to mention played a half dozen zombies and worked with Dave Francis personally and I've seen him in action. And I have the Director's Cut double DVD and watched all the extras hours worth.

They quickly pick up others and form a group struggling to survive. A hot head member of the group named Derek Moniz keeps causing trouble which eventually leads to members of the groups being killed by the zombies. This low budget outing from Producer Writer and Director David J. Francis gets some good marks from the obvious fun it looks like they had making this. Francis is a real Zombie movie fan and that enthusiasm shows despite rough dialog and poor acting. Lead actor Danny Ticknovich could be a stunt double for Tom Cruise due to his looks but didn't get Cruise's acting chops. The gore and there is a lot of it ranges from great to very poor sometimes from scene to scene. The movie just stops rather than having an actual ending which is puzzling. Overall Zombie Night is poor but that Independent spirit and love of Zombie films comes through and it almost makes this watchable. At least the film makers gave it their best shot.".

The mad doctor was probably the best actor he was great. His character seemed the most developed also he had the most background story complete with flashbacks! Decent cinematech. Cool gore. Zombie vultures that throw peoples heads around. Igor and Frankenstein's Monster. The main heroes seemed to have either had a very bad script or a director who thought it was alright for them to say Come on we have to keep going so many times that I lost count but the good parts of the movie made up for the super cheesy lines. It seemed that most of the budget for this movie was spent on the gore and computer animated effects? Lots of blood. I recommend this movie! The part where the uncle sees the little girl all messed up and then you see him take out his nephew with a large branch was up to snuff as far as horrific goes I think.

	schema:reviewBody "A group of us watched The Rage and thought it was pretty gory and pretty much fun. And you hope it would be being directed by Robert Kurtzman of special effect house KNB. Kurtzman is the guy I just don't remember of the trio. Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero are the two I see all the time. They first worked together on George Romero's Day of the Dead. They met Kurtzman on Evil Dead II. As a company they have done makeup and special effects for many many great movies. Sadly I didn't even recognize Kurtzman's name at the start of the movie. His being there certainly would explain the continuous gore effects. As the movie opens a crazy doctor with a wish for vengeance is experimenting on some kidnapped travelers. A poor family got caught the doc's just killed mom and now it's dad's turn to give his life to science. When the experiment goes wrong doc gets infected with his own mutating rage virus. It both mutates you and makes you mad. Then you need to eat someone. Can doc get to the antidote in time to stop his head from swelling up? There's a juicy slam fest of a fight in the last half of that opening scene as the doc and dad both rapidly mutating and mad duke it out in the lab. And what a filth hole that place is blood and corpse parts all over and a cage filled with failed experiments who are eating a little girl. One is a midget who will wear her clothes face and hair. Geeze! It seemed funnier in the movie. Anyway things are going to hell in a beaker as the doc and his victim battle it out. They take their fight out doors some vultures get in on the act and the virus is on a flight path to the rest of the world. We next meet some kids who are having a drug and sex filled night at an outdoor rave of some sort. Real band Mushroomhead is playing. Next day the kids meet up with the vultures and Reggie Bannister. You might recognize him if you're a Phantasm fan. He helps the hero in that movie here he eats a little girl. It's okay she was already dead. And that's only the first ten minutes or so. It's a blood bath as the kids run from one place to another getting picked off one by one before the leftovers wind up in the lab. It's still a mess and there's a basement that's even worse. It's not a movie for the viscous impaired or my mom. Most of the sets and physical effects were pretty good. Lots of experience behind their creation. The vulture puppets were great while still being puppets and the CGI versions of them were fair to middlin'. We all agreed that the vultures were a great menace. They like people. For snacks. They're mad and they bite real well. Most of the CGI was acceptable and we believe that was the first CGI poop we'd seen. The acting was a mixed bag some of our players better than others. The story had some goofy stuff in it and the dialog didn't alway keep us on the edge of our seats. But it has that fun sense of humor that made us laugh along with it. And occasionally at it. Not for everybody but certainly something most horror fans should find enjoyable.".

Kurtzman is the guy I just don't remember of the trio. Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero are the two I see all the time. They first worked together on George Romero's Day of the Dead. They met Kurtzman on Evil Dead II. As a company they have done makeup and special effects for many many great movies. Sadly I didn't even recognize Kurtzman's name at the start of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I really love the first Wishmaster movie. I even think that the second one is really good too. Both are with Andrew Divoff who I had the pleasure of meeting personally at a convention. But more about that on a forthcoming Wishmaster review. Andrew Divoff plays a Russian scientist that's all I'm going to say which doesn't spoil anything but never fully develops any of his previous screen charisma apparent especially in the Wishmaster movies but also in smaller roles see Brisco County Jr. and others.Robert Kurtzman who also directed the first Wishmaster movie and was part of the famous KNBFX Group K being his initial of course alone was a guarantee that the movie would be good ... well at least that's what I thought ... boy was I wrong! Relying on CGI rather than on handson Special FX which Kurtzman could've done himself and pretty good was one of the baddest decision he could make ... saying it looks fake would be a disgrace to the word fake.The acting? Apart from the aforementioned Divoff there's only Reggie Bannister who could work as a saving Grace. But the Phantasm star doesn't have a chance to do so ... But then again it's not the most original script they're working with so I don't know if you really can blame any of the actors well maybe some of them at least. Of course a movie like this does not rely on acting and or a fancy story. But as the CGI doesn't work but against the movie the sparse real effects cannot elevate this experience into any level that makes it really feel like entertainment. It's bloody alright but you can and should expect more than that! Not to mention that the soundtrack sounds can and do get pretty annoying! Problem if you watch it at a theater? You can't turn the volume down neither fast forward! But just because you can at home doesn't mean you should try it ... I strongly recommend against that! Of course there are movies worse than that quite a few actually but this also isn't an argument andor point that works for the movie! I really hate to say it but stray away from this movie I didn't even get into the video quality and other stuff".

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely Andrew Divoff's finest work in the genre in over a decade since Wishmaster. He really chews the scenery like a champ and is a blast to watch. Kurtzman also redeemed himself for his disappointing effort from last year Buried Alive. Rage did have a few flaws though but first I'll highlight the strong points. For one this film keeps the action moving from the very first gruesome scene to the last. The gore and makeup effects are top notch with the botched medical experiments and mutated vultures literally disemboweling people and sending limbs flying left and right. I won't ruin the specifics but if you dig blood this film delivers. Nothing is taken too seriously in this film although Divoff's back story really added some surprising layers to the typical mad scientist role. Erin Brown Misty Mundae is really starting to show she's good for more than just T and A in skin flicks. Although a return to that genre wouldn't be un welcomed LOL. Erin has has some cool moments in this including going postal on a perverted transvestite dwarf mutant......Yes you read that right. On the negative side less than convincing CGI mostly with the vultures. It certainly didn't ruin the movie by any means but there were a few shots that didn't look to great. All in all a must see in my opinion. Get the unrated DVD.".

Of course things go wrong in the lab and he is himself infected. The disease ends up spreading to vultures feasting on the corpses of the infected and in turn vulture vomit !? infects humans. Things start out quite gory.Next we meet a bunch of dopehead teenagers partying and driving around the woods in their RV. They eventually are attacked and pursued by our vicious CGI vultures. This part of the movie is the weakest. There is very little character development of these kids not even the lovely Erin Brown aka Misty can save this. While CGI allows these vultures to be quite brutal the effect is too obvious and GCI gore is not convincing not to mention that they are nearly indestructible. And frankly watching kids running around and being attacked by some birds is just not entertaining at all.Eventually the kids reach the cabin of our scientist who by now is nearly fully transformed into a rage creature and still working but now with some very creepy and fun sidekicks. We've seen plenty of freaky humanoids recently but these fellows are pretty weird. This immediately reinvigorates the movie from the lackluster RV part. We find out why the scientist is doing what he is doing and it's a good story actually something I haven't seen anywhere else.The Rage obviously could have been much better without the vulture element. It could have been a great monsterslasher film with rage creatures on the lose and terrorizing teens. More nudity was needed the real gore is great the CGI not so much. The acting could use improvement except for the actor in the role of the scientist who is the only interesting character in the film. It is almost as if the cabin sequences were made at a different time by a different director.A good effort that has some weaknesses but it's still campy and fun. A sequel with more budget would be great.".

You have to have an open mind and should probably be in the mood to witness some nasty gruesome fun. I LOVED it. First off Andrew Divoff has always been a good actor in my mind and in this movie he ROCKED. The other actors and actresses I can't say were good by any means. They were average if not below average. BUT who cares. This movie was fun regardless. I've seen much worse acting in my day. What made this movie shine was its abundant blood and gore. Yeah yeah the CGI wasn't the greatest but I don't think it took away from the nastiness of it. Plus the makeup they used was excellent. The mutations looked gross and made my stomach queasy and it takes a lot to effect me that way. The plot was pretty simple nothing really new but the action was non stop and exciting. The movie flew by quickly. Time flies when you are having fun. I also found this movie pretty funny in some parts. Maybe it wasn't intended to be but I laughed quite a bit. If you enjoy a good classic horror film filled with non stop blood and gore action packed fun this movie is defiantly for you. True horror fans will appreciate this. I know I do.".

The mad scientist was a key element and made the movie flow with all the hell he breaks loose in this film. Raged out humans and vultures what more could you want. Buckets of blood galore for sure.

Also the zombie birds are CG for the most part they really don't look all that bad. Actually they are pretty awesome. The acting is bad at times which to me just adds more charm to the films. Misty Mundae is in this ! and doesn't show her boobs !. Her acting isn't too bad actually. I guess she is trying to get out of softcore porn. And Divoff is great as a mad scientist.

	schema:reviewBody "Allow me to summarize the first ten minutes or so for you This crazed Russian guy has a couple tied down and after the woman has died a bloody death he cracks open the skull of the man shown on screen and injects him with the rage mutagen. The man transforms into a bloody killing machine rips loose and attacks the crazed Russian guy. This one puts up a fair fight but eventually the creature wins and stabs the crazed Russian guy dead with a saw or something shown on screen. Cut to a party of some town young folk in the middle of nowhere where the decent Mushroomhead play. Cut to a couple having sex in a car. After what felt like 10 minutes apparently the producers insisted on a a sex scene for the film. However while I do enjoy the occasional sex scene this one was just sort of annoying as the setup for what follows is all too obvious the creature bursts into the scene and splits the skull of the guy open with a saw shown on screen. The woman crawls away in terror but the creature catches her plugs out her eye shown on screen and proceeds to eat it shown on screen.At that point I stopped the movie and vowed never to look at it again. If you are not looking for the real trashiestofthetrashy movies this one is not for you. I am no wimp. The gore on screen did neither freak nor gross me out. It was just so... unnecessary and annoying. Maybe I'm not far enough into this splatterslasher stuff.This is the type of movie you would usually find running at like 1am on the cheapest cable channel you can find in your country. And even then heavily cut.05 points for Mushroomhead. 05 points for the Zombie theme. I like zombies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to go into a lot of plot details...chances are if you're reading this you've either already seen it or your decision to see it isn't going to be based on a few dozen words about plot. Basically it's a mad scientist plus zombies plus killer animals vultures in this case with conventions placed accordingly.Firstly I'm not sure why ReAnimator is popping up in so many reviews...this film is nothing like ReAnimator either in story or style. Well maybe perhaps a little bit in the story department but in both cases it is but the logical end to mad scientist meets zombies. And for those of you likening this to another Bmovie please get your understanding of a Bmovie straight. The fact is most horror is Bmovie crap and if you're a fan of the genre it's likely that you've seen more Bmovie horror than actual Hollywood horror. Evil Dead Romero's first 3 movies most franchises all fall solidly within Bmovie territory. Stuff like The Rage falls squarely into C or Zgrade status depending on how many levels you want to keep separating it into.Now the reason I say all that is because for a Bmovie this is absolutely terrible. For the plethora of Zgrade horror with slick box art that has flooded the shelves for the past few years it is at least acceptable. The plot is at least coherent despite some glaring plausibility errors the script manages to mostly flow seamlessly and the acting while bad is at least not unwatchably bad. The gore is abundant and often and about 80 to 85 of it is done well more than making up for the crappy CGI. If you're used to this sort of Zgrade stuff most of this won't detract. Things like lighting and sound video quality editing and direction are all fairly competent. The one thing that really drags this movie down is the pacing. Certain scenes are far too long andor unnecessary.Mostly I find the plot tolerable. However there are some strange inconsistencies within the parameters set by the film itself. How does Uncle Ben magically end up behind his nephew? Did I miss something about teleporting zombie things...? Also a deadly killer bird I can get behind but these things have this sort of psychotic malice that I find a little out there. The vultures are also almost impossible to kill which I think is another drawback why use animals at all if they're just going to be assigned human malevolence as well as a sort of indestructability? If the enemy was going to have these qualities I'd rather the zombies themselves be the antagonists. I find that the scientists inbetween status and ability to master the other zombies underdeveloped I find this relationship to be convenient for the film and not something that really gels with what these creatures are supposed to be.One thing that ultra lowbudget horror is good for is pushing a taboo here and there. In the case of the The Rage we have 2 the killing of children and an utterly tasteless zombie defecation the latter of which was totally unnecessary. There's a ton of gore here and it kicks in from the start and continues fairly steadily. Obviously the bulk of the shoe string budget went to the creation of entrails and body parts and I'm OK with that most of it looks really good and genuinely disgusting. The film stumbles a bit with it's CGI another hallmark of Zgrade film. Explosions look totally stupid fake birds fly around with the finesse of an 8 year old with Photoshop and in a couple of instances the CGI spewing of blood looks as awful as always only even worse here because the scenes are brightly lit. The vulture puppets while slightly comical were a bit gruesome and evil looking and although the weird choppyfuzzy edit montage thing is beat to death in The Rage in does serve to enhance some of the puppetonhuman action that would look utterly terrible otherwise.The pacing of this film is quite poor and the single most difficult obstacle when actually trying to watch this. The beginning is done well although I did grow a little weary of going back and forth between the scientist and the guy begging for his life. It just kind of went on and on. The partyrave scene was blessedly short as usually this type of scene wears on and on in horror movies. There's a bit too much of running from the vultures and it really drags during the sequence in the corn field where it would seem the same 5 or 6 shots are edited together over and over. The ending is more gratuitous than most with multiple sort of miniclimaxes however this also gets tiring as we do little more than watch the 2 leads run from one room to another only to encounter some LAST last ditch effort from the dwarf zombie.If it's movies like Final Destination and Scream that rock your world hell even if Evil Dead II or Dead Alive are your favorite movies ever then this probably won't be your cup of tea. However if you've been suckered by slick box art before yet still keep coming back for more then you might dig this. I would say it'd be a decent intro for those interested in Zgrade horror but then again that's implying that it's territory worth introducing oneself to.".

I am glad I hung in there because this movie has a wonderfully evil sense of humor and rips several people to shreds in a most gruesome manner two things a good horror movie needs some black humor and some good gore.The special effects are 90esque but there is some CGI birds thrown in ad nauseaum to kind of lend some techcred to the special effects but it kind of falls flat. The puppet birds look better than the cgi.PLOT mad Russian scientist in the middle of nowhere is stumbled upon by a bunch of kids that take a wrong turn and wind up in the woods. A bioagent he has developed will turn you into a mad bloodlust filled mutagenic zombie but this does not descend into the stupidity of masses of slow moving zombies slowly advancing instead this is faster paced but in NO WAY does it copy 28 days later nor is it at the same production level of that movie. Look at this film as a festival arthouse submission of a horror movie it is low budget low tech but the sense of humor in the killings really keeps you glued to the screen till the end.Not bad for the money spent on it at all. Just remember it's a movie that's so bad it's good. It's like eating candy that will rot your teeth out. Sometimes u r just in the mood for it.

Dr. Vasilienko remains unsuccessful in his attempts  during an experiment one of his infected test subjects escape into the nearby woods where it eventually dies but several Vultures then descend on the body  begin to eat the flesh which in turn infects them with the rage virus. After a midnight rave five friends decide to take a shortcut while driving home  accidentally run a man down getting out to check the teens are attacked by the rotting corpse of the man  by the infected Vultures while trying to fend off flesh eating zombies  infected Vultures the teen have to somehow reach safety but the woods are crawling with the infected...Directed by former special makeup effects man Robert Kurtzman this gory mad scientist zombie film feels a bit like The Night of the Living Dead 1969 mixed with ReAnimator 1985  to be fair to it I quite liked it for what it was sure it has it's problems  faults but it does deliver the goods. I suppose what The Rage has going for it is that it's 90 odd none stop minutes of zombies gore  carnage that never lets up The Rage feels like it was made by horror fans who purposely just jam packed the thing with gory setpieces mutilations  an outrageous plot that makes little sense. As a Russian scientist who developed a cure for cancer Vasilienko was thrown in prison tortured  abused so he developed a serum to hold the world to ransom but unluckily for him he didn't have a proper antidote when it infected local animals including the Vultures  it's never explained how he comes back to life after being stabbed to death in the opening sequence. Then five teens are thrown into the action as they become lost  isolated in some woods  face flesh eating problems from the sky as the Vultures attack  on the ground as various zombies show up including a transvestite midget zombie. The Rage never lets up it's full on carnage from the first minute right through to the last that won't let you catch a breath but I suppose that helps to disguise the lack of a story  the cheapness of it. If your looking for blood drenched gore  a film that doesn't take itself too seriously then The Rage is something worth checking out.Where the film really falters is the technical side of things some of the CGI computer effects for the Vultures are really poor  the quick fire editing gets annoying too although maybe that's there to hide some of the cheap effects work. I wasn't impressed with the soundtrack either  as a whole it does look cheap  cartoonish at times which is a shame as it's got loads of gore in it. People's heads are cut open revealing their brains people are stabbed shot mangled decapitated their eyes are rippedout there's intestine eating  flesh ripping people are hung on butchers hooks there's rotting zombies arms are pulled off  heads sliced in half as well as even more that I probably forgot about. The Rage never lets up  the majority of the effects are thankfully practical onset makeup ones but as I said the CGI is bad when it appears.The IMDb says The rage had a budget of about 2000000 which I don't believe for a second there's no way a film this cheap  rushed looking cost that much but at least the makers decided to put every penny of the budget on screen which is more than can be said for some. The acting sucks no seriously the acting here is really bad especially by the teen leads which again slightly hurts the film overall.The rage is a great old school blood drenched mad scientist zombie horror film that could have been a modern classic if not for some really bad CGI  really bad acting throughout. Still if your a fan of gore then The Rage delivers in spades  the pace is so quick it barely gives you a second to think about the lack of plot. I liked it as a fun blood splattered horror film I really did  can forgive some roughness around the edges as it tries to please the fans.".

I wasn't impressed with the soundtrack either  as a whole it does look cheap  cartoonish at times which is a shame as it's got loads of gore in it. People's heads are cut open revealing their brains people are stabbed shot mangled decapitated their eyes are rippedout there's intestine eating  flesh ripping people are hung on butchers hooks there's rotting zombies arms are pulled off  heads sliced in half as well as even more that I probably forgot about. The Rage never lets up  the majority of the effects are thankfully practical onset makeup ones but as I said the CGI is bad when it appears.The IMDb says The rage had a budget of about 2000000 which I don't believe for a second there's no way a film this cheap  rushed looking cost that much but at least the makers decided to put every penny of the budget on screen which is more than can be said for some. The acting sucks no seriously the acting here is really bad especially by the teen leads which again slightly hurts the film overall.The rage is a great old school blood drenched mad scientist zombie horror film that could have been a modern classic if not for some really bad CGI  really bad acting throughout. Still if your a fan of gore then The Rage delivers in spades  the pace is so quick it barely gives you a second to think about the lack of plot. I liked it as a fun blood splattered horror film I really did  can forgive some roughness around the edges as it tries to please the fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Last weekend I was at the weekend of horror convention in Germany were I saw again a copy of The Rage signed. So it was time to watch this flick with Wishmaster Andrew Divoff. It starts of pretty well with a lot of gore and creepy moments. For me it was the best part when the guy disappears with the rage in his veins the movie becomes something else it becomes one of those campy movies with the use of CGI and stopmotion. A bit too much especially the birds it's a bit too long of them. One time a big laugh appeared on my face when Uncle Ben goes fishing with his children one of the kids get bored with fishing and says i would like to go play with my Xbox would like to play my new game the funny part is when uncle Ben says what about the game I bought for you phantasm and guess what uncle Ben is Reggie Bannister. I thought that Andrew gives a great performance but the flick isn't scary at all that's because the killers are the birds. I also saw here that a lot of people found that the girls never were sexy that's a fact they always are dressed never in their nudies or underwear. Not that that is necessary but in a campy one it should have contain some more nudity. Even when Erin Brown is in it she never get's undressed. Why her you ask she is also known as Misty Mundae do I need to say more...So to conclude the movie delivers a lot of gore and blood but never is scary at all but it never has a dull moment. It's one to watch with your friends and have a good time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I laughed til I cried. I paused it so I wouldn't miss anything while laughing so hard. I wasn't sure at first if it was deliberately bad but now I'm undecided whether it's deliberately awesomely bad or awesomely deliberately bad. EVERY horror movie clich is included and indelicately skewered and no detail is missed in showing the love the filmmakers have for bad horror movies. Their craft is evident particularly in the most overthetop seemingly careless bits. They say that they were inspired by George Romero but if Ed Wood was making films today THIS would be the ultimate spoof tribute of them.  Spoilers  The best bits all to my mind come under the heading of Spoilers  not that I think they'll hurt your enjoyment but if you've already decided to watch it then skip this. Otherwise hopefully these will convince you. My favorite part was when the Zombie Fetus 4 months along incredibly cheesy... with teeth uses it's attached umbilical cord like a lariat.

I wasn't sure at first if it was deliberately bad but now I'm undecided whether it's deliberately awesomely bad or awesomely deliberately bad. EVERY horror movie clich is included and indelicately skewered and no detail is missed in showing the love the filmmakers have for bad horror movies. Their craft is evident particularly in the most overthetop seemingly careless bits. They say that they were inspired by George Romero but if Ed Wood was making films today THIS would be the ultimate spoof tribute of them.  Spoilers  The best bits all to my mind come under the heading of Spoilers  not that I think they'll hurt your enjoyment but if you've already decided to watch it then skip this. Otherwise hopefully these will convince you. My favorite part was when the Zombie Fetus 4 months along incredibly cheesy... with teeth uses it's attached umbilical cord like a lariat.

And Zombie SelfDefense Force or Zonbi Jieitai is one of those movies.I sat down to watch it because it is a zombie movie and also because it was from Japan. I like all things zombie so that was the main reason for watching it. Plus I like Japanese movies as well.The story in Zonbi Jieitai is fairly out there. A UFO crashes in Japan and turns dead people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh. In the middle of this zombie crisis is a small group of soldier who end up fighting the zombies. Trapped at a small inn the soldiers are facing certain doom and not everyone in the platoon is what they appear to be.Don't expect this to really be a serious movie in the zombie genre because the story the acting the gore yeah basically everything in the movie is so over the top that it becomes hilarious. It was like watching a liveaction Manga. The dialogue was so crazy at times and it was delivered just like in a Manga. And the acting was so out there so overly dramatic and spoofy.The gore in Zonbi Jieitai was actually quite good at times so there is something interesting in it for gorehounds. Then on the other hand there were times when the blood and effects were breathtakingly fake and hilarious to even just look at.I found Zonbi Jieitai to be enjoyable because it was so over the top. Everything was pushed to the extreme and then just one further step. Remember when you sit down to watch this movie take it for what it is a comical Japanese zombie comedy that is quite Mangalike in its presentation.Now the zombies in the movie were rather interesting especially because they maintained their odd quirks that they had when they were alive. Each and every one of the zombies were really fun to look at because they all had their own unique personality.Zonbi Jieitai is a very lighthearted and comical approach on the zombie genre. It might just be enjoyable for you if you are looking for something weird and extreme.".

But what you have here is an nonstop bloody zombie movie. From minute 5 on there is good splatter and amounts of blood and brain. Of course this one is not as good as the old classics from romerofulci or jackson. also it has not the look of the newer zombie flicks like the dawn remake or 28dayslater...its just 80 minutes of bloody fun it has some good special effects when they are handmade and some not that good cgi effects.

Not only do they find that one of their number has a husband in the town and was a homecoming queen in her day but they also find that something is going on in the mine.  A man has discovered valuable radioactive material in the mine and has been using zombies to harvest it. However when the zombies escape the Cycle Sluts might be the only ones able to stop them.I didn't know anything about this film when I taped it.  To be honest I was drawn to the title as much as anything else.  I didn't expect a great deal from it but my heart still sank a little when I saw it was a Troma flick. I have never seen a film from this stable that has risen above the low standards that have become synonymous with them.  From the cheap nasty opening credits through to the rubbish special effects and laughable undead' this film is trash in every sense.Sadly it hasn't got the sense to really send itself up in the way enjoyable trash usually will.  Instead it just seems to wallow in it's own low standards with no desire to actually improve any part of it.  The plot is meaningless and is made up of poor gore no scares and no meaningful themes at all.  Add to this a really cheap look direction so poor that lack of direction' is not so much a criticism as an aspiration and a total product that cries out to be labelled banged out'.Against all this the acting of the leads isn't awful  they look good in comparison!  The chopper chicks' themselves are actually pretty cool and mostly pretty sexygood looking  Gretchen Palmer being the cutest and most fresh faced definitely not a woman who has ridden a motor bike across America!.  The zombies are a total laugh  just walking slowly with basic makeup and groaning.  The most notably actor but not for his performance is Billy Bob Thornton who must look back on this now and thank God that he has risen above this type of work.Overall anyone watching Troma films should be ready for the low standards and lack of spark that generally come with them.  I was ready for something poor but even still I was caught off guard by just how poor the whole thing was.  Worth watching if you've never seen a Troma film but other than that it's not worth the bother and is about as sht as you'd expect.".

Not only do they find that one of their number has a husband in the town and was a homecoming queen in her day but they also find that something is going on in the mine.  A man has discovered valuable radioactive material in the mine and has been using zombies to harvest it. However when the zombies escape the Cycle Sluts might be the only ones able to stop them.I didn't know anything about this film when I taped it.  To be honest I was drawn to the title as much as anything else.  I didn't expect a great deal from it but my heart still sank a little when I saw it was a Troma flick.

I did expect something from the thing at least something that did not take itself in a SECOND as really being serious. It's not to say that this isn't a flawed movie or with inanities that could make someone who wants total coherence fully plausible characters and say a 'message' have an aneurysm. It's got the word camp almost inherently in its consciousness. I wondered halfway through having a tape and not DVD what the trailer must be like. How do you string together scenes of takenos lesbian bikers some at any rate others youknowwhat cheapo zombies blind orphans a dwarf an incoherent mad scientist and effects and side characters with only facevalue interest? The movie itself plays out like basically a biker movie with zombies where plot though there never gets in the way of a trashy killing scene and establishing shots of the dead ones put to weird carnival music kazoo included.To describe the different character relationships would be moot all need be known is that one biker is domineeringcowardly another very attached to his man Billy Bob Thornton yes ol' Billy Bob up to a point and one that doesn't get past any point becoming basically zombie bait. It is of note that the man who starts up the zombies in the town played by the great Return of the Living Dead alumni Don Calfa included with fully weird eyes and a hick accent amid his Frankenstein mode basically can't seem to control these things even as the townspeople almost don't give a damn 'eh they're family' they say. In the end the Cycle Sluts end up saving a bus full of abandoned orphans what they're doing out there don't even ask and finally muster past the reluctance to save the town. It makes me grin seeing the back of the cover perhaps in an all too ironic way at seeing this movie compared to Seven Samurai even just in shades as the critic says.Along with being camp it's really an example of flawed but pure exploitation filmmaking. And coming from Troma a film company that will churn out almost anything in similar capacities that porno movies do it's definitely not a bad entry. The biker chicks are convincing enough even as writerdirector Hoskins does a flair for the dramatic i.e. long closeup on the lead biker chick as she prepares to flame up some zombies in the big brawl in the streets and the oddities help bring so much to laugh at unintentional or not that it's hard to find stuff wrong with it on such sobadit'sgood grounds. It's far from being exactly memorable as a genre film but for its time it does deliver some stupid fun with a 60's or 70's biker movie formula wedging in room for both cool and ludicrous livingdead movie setups. In short a terrific premise given decent treatment no more or less well maybe less depending on your point of view.".

I can't believe Billy Bob is in this but then again you gotta start somewhere.  We aren't dealing with genius material here but what do you expect from a Troma flick.  You expect numerous silly gags which usually aren't funny gratuitous nudity and gore. You will get all of this but there is a strange lack of nudity except on Calfa's part.  And with this title it's just expected.  The movie didn't quite live up to my expectations Joe Bob Briggs recommended it and he's never steered me wrong until now but it's growing on me.  Actually I think I'm forcing myself to like it to justify the thirteen dollars I spent on the DVD.  If you like your flesheating films serious then stay away.  If you're more into overthetop humor and horror you should probably still avoid it. Note to genre buffs  I came to the same conclusion of an earlier reviewer that this film is a comedic combination of O'Bannon's Dead and Buried and Hammer's Plague of the Zombies.".

I also think the second half like BRAINDEAD 1992 to a small extent. Where the HELL do Troma get their ideas from? 710 ";

	schema:reviewBody "Chopper Chicks in Zombietown is a whole lot of fun and definitely a guilty pleasure entry.SPOILERSRiding into a small town Dede Jamie Rose Rox Catherine Carlen T.C. Lycia Naff Jewel Vicki Frederick Jojo Kristina Loggia Rusty Gretchen Palmer Tanya Nina Sonja Peterson and Lucille Whitney Reis members of an allgirl biker gang find themselves treated with scorn from the townspeople. Trying to get repairs made so they can move on they incur the wrath of them and are forced out of town and while recuperating find that several of them are missing back in town. They eventually find that mortuary owner Ralph Willum Don Calfa has been using the dying townspeople to crate a race of zombies that will dig in his mine due to the radioactivity and when the rest of the people refuse to help them since they're all family they take on the rampaging creatures themselves.The Good News This was a pretty enjoyable entry that had a lot going for it. One of the best positives is the fact that it's just so endearingly cheesy it becomes fun after awhile. From the fact that the film deals with the headstrong females who take to leather motorbikes and the general kind of attitudes one would expect among those who do it for a living as they do which just makes it all the more camp. Some other scenes of the campy attitude come from the inclusion of the wisecracking blind kids and their encounters with the zombies which are actually nicely done and come off as great comedic relief. Handling the minigun against them the fact that they unexpectedly encounter them while stumbling around early on yet never do and a whole slew of great lines makes for some nice campy moments. Aside from the camp what also makes this one definitely enjoyable is the way it manages to stay interesting despite not having a lot of action going for it. There's really only two big action scenes in the film and both are in the later half but the fact that it doesn't get boring in the beginning is a nice touch and makes it far more enjoyable otherwise. The film also manages to put in some nice action scenes with the zombies which is a great way to help this one. As well there's also the way in which this one has it's action scenes merge into one big fight at the end starting with the burning house sequence where they battle the zombies and make a great escape before being confronted by the irate townspeople before dealing with them from then on by themselves it allows for a ton of excitement and entertainment through these scenes. It's hard not to be entirely entertained by them which always fun and definitely has a lot to enjoy with these scenes. The final fight in the streets complete with tons of high explosives lots of handtohand fighting and a rather firebased conclusion are just the icing on the cake here for how well this one ends. That it also manages to squeak in some nice gore amongst all this is the last big plus for it. There's some nice limb devouring a couple of acceptable decapitations tons of wounds on the zombies a rather impressive impaling with a shovel and the big one where a zombie hungrily devours the victim in an orgy of bloodsplatter compared to what came before and is certainly a lot of fun. These here are what really worked for the film.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this one but it did have a few flaws. The main issue is the fact that the film tends to have the majority of it's zombie action at the very end making the beginning incredibly sparse with it's zombie action. The first half to this is really based around their actions against the townspeople and while it's not entirely boring those looking for a fastpaced zombie encounter will be sorely upset at the film for not putting it into the film at the junctures where it would've worked. This is especially more noteworthy since the zombies are unleashed and willing to do something quite early on much earlier than expected and deciding to feature their battle with the residents will upset some. Also quite hard to overcome will be the film's rather hard to understand plotline with how the zombies got released. It's not all that hard to believe but it's hard to understand the science to it. That's where it really doesn't gel that well making it hard to figure out. It really could've used a few more scenes to fully get all the understanding from it out in the open but otherwise these are the film's only flaws.The Final Verdict Certainly a more worthwhile entry than expected this one was certainly a lot of fun and definitely delivered more than expected. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the cheesy films of the 80s or these kinds of zombie films while those who aren't that big on these should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Language and Graphic Violence".

You'd think that it would be difficult to make a film containing not only biker girls but a dwarf and a busload of blind children boring but the producers and director of this film succeeded in their job admirably. The poor acting overreliance on dated '80s rock music and lack of budget in terms of setscostumesspecial effectsactors help to sink this one from the beginning.Now you may have noticed the word zombie in this title's genre description. While these zombies are reminiscent of the dead in Romero's popular trilogy here they are played for laughs rather than chills in much the same way as RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 2. I never thought I would see a film that made ROTLD2 look like a work of genius by comparison but here it is. Every time the zombies appear on screen comedy music plays in this film complete with a sound effect of someone laughing uproariously. While this does create a skewed absurd atmosphere successfully it's this kind of humour that also killed off the zombie film noticeably only a handful of such films have been made since then most of them on a low budget.As a reason to have all these dead shambling about the scriptwriter threw in some baloney about a mad scientist but his sole role is to provide a human opponent for our good guys to fight. Sadly the lead characters of the biker girls are some of the most obnoxious and grating females ever seen on screen and the poor amateurish acting of the actresses doesn't help either. Fittingly the entire cast is also packed with unconvincing amateurs especially in the place of those playing the zombies I hasten to add. The only fun comes from spotting a prestardom Billy Bob Thornton in a supporting role looking embarrassed and THE TERMINATOR's Earl Boen in a cameo as a mad zombie butcher.The first hour of this film consists of many melodramatic confrontations disagreements and fights between the biker girls which really cause the plot to idle in neutral for a very long boring time. Some shots of zombies are interspersed with these actions but again the zombies don't do much. There is a slapdash battle between the girls and the walking dead at the end of the film which delivers a few unconvincing splatter effects bouncing heads spraying arterial blood severed arms and legs which sadly come too late to make this any good. The inclusion of the blind children oddly they also happen to be excellent shootists is an interesting unexpected plot twist but nothing is done with their characters either. Although this film is comparatively short it seems to go on forever with no end in sight. A disappointment all round.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not bad at least for a Troma production but far from great or even remotely memorable. That's pretty much the consensus on Chopper Chicks in Zombietown and I have very little to add to that. I expected something far worse that's for sure but I really can't say that I intend to recommend the film to anyone else. A bunch of wannabe rough and tough biker chicks respectably calling themselves the Cycle Sluts passes through a secluded little desert called Zariah with a population of 127. They stick around for some reason presumably just to shock the hillbilly locals with their bad girl attitudes and parade around in leather pants. Five miles further down the desert however a wacky mortician is developing a serum to bring the dead back to life. Basically this nut creates zombies by drilling a hole in the cadavers' heads and filling it up with radioactive goo before lowering some type of antenna in their brains. He doesn't do all this for the sake of glory or money but just because he's completely crazy and that are his own words. Suddenly a truckload of zombies break through the door of an old abandoned mine and slowly begin to wander their way to town. From then on you would expect an exciting zombie showdown horror movie but no understandably it takes an enormously long time for the zombies to reach Zariah. Also whenever they are shown dwelling through the desert a really absurd little country and western tune plays. Meanwhile back in the town the biker chicks are adapting to small town life. As to be expected in an allgirls society there's rivalry jealously arguing and eyescratching aplenty as well. When the zombies finally come marching in the townsfolk actually hire the biker chicks to exterminate them because the walking corpses are all deceased family members andor highly respected former community members and killing them would be just too painful. That's actually one of the few really interesting little twists in the plot. The comical parts in the script are not exactly funny with the exception of the zombies attacking the bus of an orphanage for blind children but the zombie action at least when it finally kicks in is quite cool. Referring back to the part with the blind orphan kids I really laughed hard with that. Defending themselves from danger they cannot even identify one of the kids says Great Blind no parents and now this happens!. The evil mortician has a creepy dwarf as an apprentice and the isolated desert setting definitely contributes a little something. Unfortunately however the film is generally lacking. For example it takes the chopper chicks ages to establish that it takes destruction of the brain in order to effectively destroy a zombie. I guess they were too busy being tough all those years and never watched a horror movie before. There exist very few good reasons to seek out this obscure 80's film expect maybe to witness one of the first roles of Billy Bob Thornton as one of the chicks' hard drinking rednecks. Watch Billy Bob getting beat up by a biker girl!".

Little man Ed GaleChucky of Child's Play and Howard the Duck personifiedis Bob Littleton Willum's victimized assistant who soon joins forces with the biker gals.Those familiar with these types of zombie comedies know what to expect..flesheating limbs and other parts ripped from bodies sight gags regarding the undead associating themselves with items they once belonged to when alive etc. The inclusion of parentless blind kids..such as Hal Sparks as the wisecracking cigarette puffing leaderis a nice touch who become besieged by zombies within their bus only equipped with their driver's machine gun needing help from the biker girls. Radioactivity within the town's closed down mine is injected into the storyline. The film's music score when the zombies are shown canvasing the area around the town is very goofy and the tone is quite loopy..kind of a RETURN TO HORROR HIGH vibe to use an example. Plenty of memorable quotable zingers. It fulfilled my quota of beheadings as Dede swings a mean baseball bat. Showstopping image could be the flaming zombie bride ignited from the flare gun fired by Rox. Anyone entering a film such as this expecting anything more than an entertaining bad movie will be sorely disappointed..it's no surprise Kaufmann and Hertz distributed it under their Troma moniker.".

The marquee name of the film is Billy Bob Thortnon in his first role as Dede's gravedigger husband Tommy. Little man Ed GaleChucky of Child's Play and Howard the Duck personifiedis Bob Littleton Willum's victimized assistant who soon joins forces with the biker gals.Those familiar with these types of zombie comedies know what to expect..flesheating limbs and other parts ripped from bodies sight gags regarding the undead associating themselves with items they once belonged to when alive etc. The inclusion of parentless blind kids..such as Hal Sparks as the wisecracking cigarette puffing leaderis a nice touch who become besieged by zombies within their bus only equipped with their driver's machine gun needing help from the biker girls. Radioactivity within the town's closed down mine is injected into the storyline. The film's music score when the zombies are shown canvasing the area around the town is very goofy and the tone is quite loopy..kind of a RETURN TO HORROR HIGH vibe to use an example. Plenty of memorable quotable zingers. It fulfilled my quota of beheadings as Dede swings a mean baseball bat. Showstopping image could be the flaming zombie bride ignited from the flare gun fired by Rox. Anyone entering a film such as this expecting anything more than an entertaining bad movie will be sorely disappointed..it's no surprise Kaufmann and Hertz distributed it under their Troma moniker.";

Other elements are sadly missingover the top camp extraneous gore even gratuitious nudity. There is a hidden easter egg Cannibal Lesbian Hoedown on the disc that contains all of these The casual 80's slasher fan would do better to check out Slumber Party Massacre. For a celebration of zombie BMovies check out The Dead Hate the Living.

Films viewed being Easy Rider The Magnificent Seven Faster Pussycat Kill Kill! and of course The Night Of The Living Dead.  However the resultant film is no way in the same league as its 'inspirations'.The film is about a gang of leather clad female bikers who ride from town to town to escape the grind of everyday life and their diverse pasts.  At the films beginning they are riding into the dusty desert backwater of Zariah population 128 no sorry 127! in search of meat' both senses of the word are applicable.   After the typical clich of the frosty reception from the locals the girls discover that Zariah has an alarmingly high mortality rate.  Yes a 'mad' scientist is at work bumping off the locals and raising them as zombies.  Cue confrontation between the 'chicks' and the shambling undead.On a sidenote The term chopper has three meanings.  Here the usage is obviously as slang for a motorbike but chopper also means axe and also has a phallic resonance.  I think the filmmakers wasted the opportunity to make a film the only film about axe wielding transvestite bikers.  The resulting film being a sort of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert meets George A. Romero!Back to the review proper  'Chopper Chicks' also has themesmoments similar to two much better zombie films namely Dead  Buried and The Plague Of Zombies.  Using the undead as slave labour here to work in a radiation contaminated mine hey it's a Troma movie  they have to get a radiation link in somewhere is lifted straight from 'Plague'.  I won't mention the Dead  Buried link as it would overtly spoil that film.spoilersSuffice to say I was not particularly impressed with 'Chopper Chicks'. For starters the film fails to make the zombies threatening or frightening. Zombies work best in claustrophobic settings when they pop up unexpectedly and when there are vast numbers of them.  They are not much good ambling down a high street or along a desert road where they just become fodder for a baseball bat.  Also the evil protagonist did not have much of an impact being reduced to the level of a fall guy for bad slapstick humour.  There isn't even a confrontation between him and the biker women.But 'Chopper Chicks' is also a comedyadventure so the horror aspect could take second place.  Fair enough but the film mostly fails here as well. Moments that I found amusing were as sparse as the desert setting.  The characters too easily fall into the realms of crude caricature and the viewer ends up with more empathy for the cadavers. Any pretence of a veneer of female solidarityempowerment in the film is quickly scraped away.  The inclusion of a blind troupe of children adds nothing to the film.  Here the potential for moments of both horror and comedy as the kiddies mingled with the undead was lost.  Finally too few of the humans die whilst the zombies are massacred.  The only biker to die in battle does so stupidly just becoming another plot mechanism for another explosion.Still 'Chopper Chicks' does have some redeeming features.  The initial victim is a child  a welcome break from the typical rosetinted treatment of children in most horror films.  The use of a stapler to seal the zombies' mouths to stop them biting is inspired.  As is the fact that the local townsfolk refuse to fight the zombies as they're 'family'.  The best moment in the film is the reaction of one biker to a proclamation of love from an exboyfriend.  Her response to the words I love you' is superb a cinematic classic.".

I expected this even more so after reading the description on the box which made a statement about the doors of hell being open unleashing a zombie horde. Wow!Imagine my horror to discover that this film is actually a composite of 1a film about an undertaker who happens to be able to teach his young apprentice kung fu skills and 2scenes that appear to have been shot for the only purpose of being inserted into this film to incorporate ninjas into the storyline.The actors in the zombie story and the ninja story never appear on screen together. However an attempt is made to make us believe they are in the same story as closeups of the actors are intercut to make it appear as if they are talking to each other.The zombie horde is certainly an overstatement as we never see more than three or four zombies at once. The master keeps calling them up to train the young apprentice in kung fu skills surely a questionable method of training at best.The ninjas are probably the most hilarious thing I have ever seen. They are caucasians who wear shiny brightly colored ninja outfits and have names like Bert Bob and Ira. Uhhhh.... not exactly what you expect froma ninja movie. Their costumes appear to be made of plastic and are white yellow and blue which really should make them quite visible in the forest.The funniest thing about the ninja characters is that they wear headbands that say ninja or nin ja with japanese writing in between the two syllables. What sort of ninja  arguably the most deadly invisible assassins  wear headbands that announce who they are?! I believe they were labeled as otherwise no one watching the film would ever know they were supposed to be ninjas as their outfits do not look anything like any other ninja costume I've seen in any movie.Also there are two ninja forces in the film but it is not readily apparent. I kept wondering why they were fighting and killing their own friends until the two ninja leaders fought at which point I realized that up until then I had thought they were the same guy. I believe that the two styles of ninja headbands  ninja and nin ja were used to differentiate the two bands of ninjas.While this has to be seen to be appreciated the movie is really bad but not bad enough to be enjoyable. Watch at your own risk. If you are easily confused I advise you to stay away.".

Whatever vintage Kung fu movie is featured in Zombie Rival it's actually pretty good I'd like to track it down. Those scenes are enjoyable. But the newer presumably 1980's ninja scenes are also enjoyable  comedy gold. The outfits. The headbands. The mustaches. The dialogue.. in between sword clashes they say things like I told you... the dragon's fire burns HOT! Here in the UK you can get this on DVD for Five Pounds or less under the title Zombie Rivals. I own it on oldschool bigbox rental VHS under the title Zombie Rival The Super Ninja Master. The video cover has a painting of a barbarian on the front. Seriously. A barbarian.Update The vintage Kung Fu movie is called Gravedigger. Yay!".

The dialogue.. in between sword clashes they say things like I told you... the dragon's fire burns HOT! Here in the UK you can get this on DVD for Five Pounds or less under the title Zombie Rivals. I own it on oldschool bigbox rental VHS under the title Zombie Rival The Super Ninja Master. The video cover has a painting of a barbarian on the front. Seriously. A barbarian.Update The vintage Kung Fu movie is called Gravedigger. Yay!";

	schema:reviewBody "Me and some friends found a copy of this in a local video store renting it was 3 but we bought it for 2 instead that was promising they really wanted to get rid of it. Anyway we were looking for the worst movie available to laugh and we found it. Zombie vs Ninja guess who wins? NOBODY they never fight There are two horrible plots in this movie two groups of ninjas the ninjas and nin jas and for some reason they are fighting gold or something really doesn't make sense. And the one that is apparently the good guy not because of what he does but because he is better and braver. He fights with the dragons fire burns hot crap style. Anyway in this part of the story nothing really happens. this guy whats through the woods and somehow doesn't notice the bright yellow and blue dressed guys hiding in the woods. they attack him but you know there is always a sword somewhere on a tree right so he picks it up and wins. In the second plot this guy Ethan has a father that was robbed and killed so he wants revenge and learns kungfu from an undertaker go figure. Anyway this undertaker always extends his lines in a successful attempt to sound retarded and says lines like i have to go take a st and summons 1 or 2 zombies hardly a horde. The only way you can distinguish the zombies from the humans is that they act like robots dommo arigato mr zombie. And guess what the good guys win and yatti yatta bad plot nothing happens. But the image is the worst we noticed the image skip when they stop filming and restart later from that point around 4 times in the movie. Most of the time the actors aren't on screen since they cut off most of their faces when they switched it to full screen. WHY THE HECK DRESS IN SHINY FLASHY CLOTHING LABLED NINJA IF YOU WANT TO SURPRISE SOMEONE TO ASSASSINATE HIM! WHY FIGHT ZOMBIES FOR FUN OR LEARN KUNGFU FROM AN UNDERTAKER? WHY Doesn't THE NINJAS AND ZOMBIES FIGHT? Horrible but funny if you watch it in a group. If you have ever seen kung pow this is probably the movie they were laughing at since the mouths never move with the words".

The story details how Ethan the necromancers student learns devastating martial arts in the aforementioned manner in order to exact revenge upon the miscreants who murdered his family. It has to be said that the martial arts choreography on display here in this story is excellent especially the climatic fight which showcases some old Shaw Brothers style action.The ninja segments also revolve around another tale of revenge and are as usual in these films tremendously fun.However the very best bit in the movie is a line of dialogue from the zombie segment in which the zombie master decides to reanimate a corpse to test Ethan's developing combative prowess. The necromancer makes the excuse that he needs to defecate and goes and crouches in a ditch where he begins his magical incantations. However unbeknown to him Ethan spies him squatting down making what appear to be exaggerated 'straining' noises and subsequently utters what has to be one of the most hilarious lines in movie history!

The way to distinguish the rivalling sides in the forest is NOT by looking whether the head bands spell ninja or nin ja since the supposedly evil side both wear bands with ninja and nin ja. For example the right hand of the evil ninja boss which fights our ninja hero the second last fight in the forestpart wears a band which spells ninja as do our hero. The only way to tell apart is to look at the colour of the head bands. The good guy is the only one who wears the orange colour band.

The undertaker called simply Master T I think employs an unusual style of training as he can summon zombies in order to sharpen his kungfu skills. The story follows the standard kungfu checklist as eventually Ethan becomes adept enough to fight his father's killers. Where the Ninjas fit in is another story. Ethan's storyline seems to come from the movie called Gravedigger. The Ninjas are filmed separately from the main movie and come in the form of a bunch of Caucasian men with very Asian sounding names like Duncan Bob Ian and Bert. Leading the way is Godfrey Ho weapon of choice Pierre Kirby as the Dragon. It is beyond asinine to watch Kirby pretend to talk to Ethan and Master T when the backgrounds behind him don't even begin to match. The sheer goofiness of the Ninja outfits complete with NINJA headbands and gaudy outfits make you feel sorry for these guys rather than be in awe of them. Nothing screams badass ninja like yellow undergarments. Watching all of these white guys prance around a forest preserve role playing ninja vs. ninja made me think I was watching a corporate getaway to promote team players.

And sure there are characters named Lin and Tiger but how many movies have a ninja master named Ira? Or Duncan for that matter. And why do they all have mustaches and headbands proclaiming that they are Ninjas or in some cases simply just Nin? Since the movie went back and forth between the White Ninjas plot and the Undertaker plot we much preferred the White Ninjas side of the quilt and it was always a bit disappointing when it went to the other side. And there's some killer music to in theory tie it all together.Seeing as movies like this must surely have limited appeal we applaud Imperial Home Video for releasing this. But if they ever were going to take a gamble surely it would be in the golden year of 1989. Video stores were booming ninjas were booming zombies were booming everything was booming. All they had to do was sit back and let the demented mind of Godfrey Ho work its magic. All that being said this epic probably isn't worth the current 100.00 asking price on Amazon.Godfrey Ho fans you know who you are. If you can find this movie cheap or rent it somehow please do.

What was the relationship between the bad guy killed in the last two minutes and Titus? Was there two separate villains? What were the zombies good for? Why were they included? Why did the master have to look like a rabbit with those teeth? Overall I gave this a 3 out of 10 just because I am always entertained by Ninjas apparently no matter how bad they look and I like the attempt at an original story with the undertaker twist.In the end this is not a movie I would recommend to anyone else but a true ninja freak...".

	schema:reviewBody "I was once a big fan of zombie movies but then I caught a number of the barrage of 'low budget' zombie flicks and quickly lost interest in the genre. It's not that the zombie film doesn't work well with a low budget the main problem was that a lot of them work from the same idea and it gets boring quickly. It seems however that certain filmmakers have noticed the problem and modern films such as Zombie Honeymoon and this one have decided to deliver something a bit different  and while still silly the result is much better than 'just another' low budget zombie flick! The plot supposedly takes inspiration from a French play called 'Rhinoceros' referenced by the strip club called Rhino and focuses on a group of strippers. As the Bush Administration enters its fourth term America has found itself looking for a way to make its soldiers last longer to help the war effort on multiple fronts. The solution comes in the form of a virus that brings the dead back to life. When the virus infects a stripper at the club sleazy owner Ian Robert Englund realises the girl's new potential and puts her back on stage. After whipping the crowd into a frenzy the rest of the girls find themselves with a choice to make. Do they stay human and stay second best to the zombie stripperor do they conform to the latest 'fad'? There's no denying that Zombie Strippers is a silly low budget zombie film but perversely it would seem that the filmmakers actually wanted to make something of it and we also get a muddled social satire along with a commentary on conformity. I have to admit that none of this really comes through in any sort of meaningful way but you have to give a low budget zombie movie with a porn star in the lead role credit for trying! The thing I liked most about this movie is undoubtedly the club where most of the action takes place. Director Jay Lee creates a dark and seedy atmosphere which really benefits the tone of the film and makes for a great backdrop for the girls' strip dances! The leading lady is the lovely Miss Jenna Jameson. I can't say I've ever seen anything else with her in it and while she's not really my 'type' she certainly knows how to put on a performance  her introduction and first dance as a zombie are the highlights of the film. The movie also features the talent of the lovely Roxy Saint both in the acting and music department. The soundtrack for the film really is awesome too and helps to enhance the sleazed qualities of the movie 'Salute You' by Roxy Saint is a memorable track. The film doesn't hold back in the gore department either which is nice. The film is already pretty silly from the beginning and it just gets sillier as it goes along. At times I felt things were getting just a bit too silly but after a while you realise that it's easier just to sit back and go along with it. Zombie Strippers is a long way from being a masterpiece but I'm sure that this film will find it's audience and anyone that enjoys this sort of stuff will have a blast with Zombie Strippers!".

At times I felt things were getting just a bit too silly but after a while you realise that it's easier just to sit back and go along with it. Zombie Strippers is a long way from being a masterpiece but I'm sure that this film will find it's audience and anyone that enjoys this sort of stuff will have a blast with Zombie Strippers!";

I thought the filmmakers were openminded and compassionate liberals. Isn't it supposed to be the Republicans that are racist and hate Mexicans?Of all the people I know the type of people this movie purposely insults rightwingers are more likely to watch a movie called Zombie Strippers! than my leftwing friends! Mr. Jay Lee take a trip outside of L.A. sometime and meet the rest of your audience!The rest of the movie was even worse than the first scene with painfully unfunny jokes and even worse characters. Did the strip club patrons in the movie actually think these dead women were sexy? I know that the people who visit strip clubs aren't exactly rocket scientists but are they that stupid? I wouldn't know. I've never been to a strip club.Apparently Robert Englund will do anything for a paycheck. What is he doing in this? He's beginning to make Gary Busy Dennis Hopper and Billy Zane look like they choose their projects very carefully. Mr. Englund there's such a word as no. People click it all the time when reading my comments!And finally what's up with Jenna Jameson's face these days? She used to look cute but lately she's looking a bit more plastic than she used to. Her eyes are beginning to get longer and skinnier while her lips look like she's suffering from an allergic reaction! Lay off the plastic surgery AND the crappy movies Ms. Jameson!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the near future..during George W Bush's fourth Presidential term!a commando unit..the Z Squadare called upon by governmental scientists to eradicate a compound riddled with zombies thanks in part to the release of a chemovirus..this virus was designed to reanimate soldiers for combat against the enemy. One of the unit is bitten escapes from the compound in fear that he will be shot and finds himself in an illegal strip joint. Biting the star stripper Katporn star Jenna Jameson he is put away in the basement at the insistence of lecherous scheming germaphobe IanRobert Englund having the time of his life who runs the illegal stripper establishment. Ian realizes potential when Kat who now a zombie seems to be an even better stripper dead than alive as the response by those in attendance is overwhelmingly positive. Seeing dollar signs as lusty males seeking a new brand of entertainment are entering with green to throw around Ian will allow Kat to continue working even though she craves human flesh and often eats her lapdanceclients! Soon other strippers are profoundly interested in experiencing what Kat has..becoming a zombie so that they can achieve the level of popularity and admiration showered upon her. It seems that once bitten and turned into a zombie the strippers seem more willing to satisfy their audience athletically superior..the way they take to the pole displays their new found abilitythan ever before and go for broke on the stage uninhibited and free without restraint not holding back..and in turn winning the adulation of males only more than willing to go back stage with them not knowing that they are to be on the zombie menu. Meanwhile the Z squad are on the lookout for the member who got away soon to find their way into the stripper club. At first Ian is able to contain those bitten by the zombie strippers using his hired help to imprison them in a cell in the basement only to lose control once they are freed after a series of unforeseen circumstances.Well if you are looking for zombie carnage gory fleshripping CGI heads exploding strippers swinging the pole as the male audience eyes bulging cheer in unison with dollar bills raining on the stage then this will more than satisfy. The film features Englund easily walking away with the movie with Jameson perfectly cast..not sure this is a compliment thoughas the star stripper..I like how the door to her isolated dressing area has a star written in crayon to establish her as the headlining girl of the club. As the film progresses the zombie strippers' flesh slowly rot their eyes an eerie black as they continue performing admirably for the crowd. Features some stunning gore like a face ripped apart at the mouth and a head pried apart the skull forced open revealing the brain as the zombie eats away. A very funny sequence features a victim turned into a zombie attempting to bite with his lower jaw hanging and tongue sticking out wagging. There are backstage dramascomedy featuring the variety of strippers in constant competitionconflict with each other and their response to Kat's emergence as a greater threat when the customers embrace her new persona on stage.A subplot concerns farmgirl JessyJennifer Holland needing cash to help her grandmotherNana during a crisis of faith questioning life having been brought up in a Christian environment and how her decision to possibly perform affects boyfriend DavisJohn Hawkesand fellow melancholy stripper BerengJeannette Sousawho often finds her peers annoying and trivial rolling her eyes and scoffing at their behavior. Carmit Levit is Ian's trusty aid Madame Blavatski often providing ideas that he can utilize to make a profit a foreigner often waxing nostalgia over memories of her homeland. Asante Jones is Terrence Ian's MC who also helps him store away victims rather reluctantly. Joey Medina is janitor Paco his Latin ethnicity used as a constant running gagBadgers!We don't need no stinking badgers!. Shamron Moore is Kat's arch nemesis Jeannie striving to achieve toplevel status as the very best stripper of the club and often failing despite going the distance for her audience..who are now transfixed with the new wave of zombiestripping. While many will flock to see this because of Jameson who gets top billing I thought Roxy Saint as the ravenhaired goth Lilith..who secretly admires Katwas quite a babe as well emerging as a possible future horror star in the making. While I really enjoyed the practical gore effects the CGI splatter where heads explode when machine guns are used less impressed me. Some nasty flesh devouring delivers the bloody goods. I wasn't particularly fond of the ridiculous overthetop supernatural abilities that take precedence over the story as Kat and Jeannie compete..swinging around the poll with extra speed as if a fireman on his way to a burning building and popping pool balls from the vagina as if a slingshot device to harm!with each other as zombies tear away at customers in the ballsout finale while the Z Squad raid the joint prepared to alleviate the world of an infestation out of control.".

I will leave my personal classification open to interpretation based upon the rest of this critique.B movies are a quirky little niche of the movie industry slipping past the radar and existing as poor in many aspects of traditional filmmaking standards yet somehow rising to the occasion to please grinning audiences. Sometimes a movie is intended to be a B and sometimes it happens by accident usually in the hands of an amateur and underfunded auteur. Regardless of how a movie like Zombie strippers came to be even though it is fairly apparent in this case the polished result and I use that term loosely can be perceived in three ways. The first is a movie that is the bonafide gold standard of schlock the second is one that has a burning admiration for this genre and directs an homage as a salute. The final and obnoxiously common result is a film that tries desperately to exist as a B movie but fails on every level and unfortunately Zombie Strippers is a direct offspring of the latter.I have stated before that I am a sucker for zombie films but I have no such admiration for this picture this zombie film just sucks. 2008 as a whole has shown a weak display of this genre the best being the disappointing Diary of the Dead by legend George A. Romero. Also more notable is the more successful B movie the Romero remake Day of the Dead. Perhaps the largest flaw of Zombie Strippers I assure you there are a number is the decision to forfeit most elements of the classic zombie picture. This lack of tradition is even more clear due to the fact that it is supposed to be traditional a homage a throwback. I won't disclose exactly how it fails to meet these expectations with fear of disclosing the plot. Other issues range from the sometimes intolerable script which only occasionally descends into something gleefully tacky the acting while not vital to a picture of this calibre needs to be watchable and pacing. Forgoing all else this garbage unfolds at a snails pace make that a crippled snail mostly consisting of random and supposedly politically satirical humour and extended strip scenes which lose their appeal quickly when the gogo's start to gobad. There is some well done gore for the budget but it is most certainly not worth your time.Called to a chemical lab a group of elite soldiers are shocked to discover the result of a government reanimation program zombies. Dispatching of the threat the virus escapes into a nearby stripclub run by the devilish Robert Englund of Nightmare on Elm St. fame who I am sure was full after filming from all the scenery he had been chewing on. Among the sultry strippers is Kat played by Jenna Jameson whose boyfriend Jay Lee directed. The virus affects men and women differently leaving only women with their preexisting mental capacity but tacking on a degrading demeanour and hunger for flesh. The catch it appears in death that these women can strip up a storm and soon despite pushing a few bodies under the rug business is booming. All is perfect for Ian Englund and his group of coworkers and friends until the gals get a tad antsy and things get out of control.Despite the possibly good intentions Zombie Strippers is simply dreck an overlong and ploddingly paced humourless mess and your money would be better spent on Romero's latest venture or renting last years Grindhouse. In Zombie Strippers the only memorable thing stripping away is your patience and the dignity of those involved.".

So this review is supposed to be about the movie but really like the movie it is more about the degradation of women and the sad people who go to strip bars. Except that the movie was supporting the pole dancing scene. I'm amazed. The movie was trite predictable and boring how many silicone titted anorexic women do you need?. Here's a tip for movie makers. If you want to do a lowgrade titty movie just do it! Don't wreck another genre because you have no creativity. Just get some girls on a beach get them to take their tops off. And hurrah! a movie that will sell to millions of frustrated US male teens. Pathetic.".

Basically it is the near future and a secret government re animation chemical virus made to bring dead tissue of soldiers back to life has got out in the facility of Sartre Nebraska. While eliminating as many zombies as possible Major Camus Catero Colbert and Lieutenant Ryker Jen Alex Gonzalez manage to let bitten marine Byrdflough Zak Kilberg afraid of being killed get away and he ends up in a near underground strip club. Blyrdflough manages to bite star stripper Kat porn star Jenna Jameson but apparently women have more of a threshold so she is turned into a zombie of sorts but still doing her job being much more sexy than before and earning much more money for greedy club owner Ian Essko Robert Englund aka Freddy Krueger. Obviously the affected girls that follow along with Kat still have a hunger for flesh but they and Ian make sure they eat back stage so the money can still roll in and the zombie customers are locked up. Eventually though the success is to end when someone lets out the zombie customers and the zombie strippers just attack anyone in the open and the specialists do show up to help the survivors get out alive. Also starring Roxy Saint as Lillith Penny Drake as Sox Whitney Anderson as Gaia Jennifer Holland as Jessy Shamron Moore as Jeannie Jeannette Sousa as Bereng Carmit Levit as Madame Blavatski John Hawkes as Davis Jessica Custodio as Kwan Laura Bach as Sassy Sue and Joey Medina as Paco. Englund is great at being mad he's kind of like that in real life and Jameson makes a reasonably good actress most people think she is too beautiful to be a porn icon maybe she should have gone down this route. As for the zombie stuff the gory effects are just as overthetop as a proper zombie flick and the dialogue is deliberately rubbish so you can sit back and a enjoy a good satirical comedy horror or you can enjoy flesh eating creatures getting naked and pole dancing I know it's not a good film but it's worthwhile enough as a horror comedy.

It started off really good but dragged a bit when the strip club came and you have to wait for the zombie strippers to arrive and then it gets to the point.

But they are part of the irony the big joke. They are deliberately depicted to be as artificially defective as the zombie countenance. In fact the folding here is that we have an onscreen audience of male louts who reward the zombie strippers above the regular girls so they willingly become zombies to be sexier.The jokes range from cinematic jokes to comments on social issues and they are at a higher level than usual.One of the strippers is a former Playmate and that's supposed to be some sort of draw.

I'm in the Chicagoland area and they one had one theater playing this film in all of northern Illinois. What is it with producers these days they disregard their core audience and its location. I saw the other day that another horror film entitled Rogue about a killer croc was advertised as playing in the ten biggest American markets yet it omitted New York City Los Angeles and Chicago which are basically the three largest markets by far in the entire country. What's up with that? Anyway the film centers on a diabolical lab an unscrupulous Strip Club manager some extremely shallow strippers and outrageously perverse club patrons. Jenna Jameson plays the first stripper to be infected with an escaped zombie virus. Robert Englund is the club manager that upon finding out of the popularity of his deceased strippers popularity on the pole now that she's one of the undead decides that all is bright and sunny with the world.. Despite the occasional hiccup of a patron being devoured by his now popular zombie stripper. For some reason the men of the town find a decaying almost lifeless corpse rotting before them while seductively or maybe perhaps moreso raunchily dancing is ever more popular and appealing than say watching real warm blooded human strippers. A commentary on necrophilia? maybe but they play this to schlocky good fun. Where most zombie films take themselves too seriously when they don't have the talent to back it up director writer cast effects etc. this film just lets it all hang out. Similar in it's tongue in cheek approach to 2001 maniacs this film lets its cast roll about in their dismal acting and cheesy dialogue. And they relish every minute of it.On a side note anyone else creeped out in Jenna Jameson's looks now adays? Look at photos of her from two or three years ago and now. Looks like she's transforming into one of those cat people. Creepy eyes and the face looks tight and awful. Apparently wearing a pearl necklace will wreak havoc on one's face.".

This one had some laugh out loud moments especially with the racial slurs and the more vile constructs of zombie behavior. I think I'll leave the discovery of all that to those who watch this movie. There are worse films out there than this one and as juvenile as it was it wasn't as bad as the trailer made it out to be.The only thing I really couldn't stand was the actors on the so called Special Forces team.

As this trend continues she finally goes to her boss Dr. Dreylock Walter Patriarca who refers her to Dr. Peter Chandler Ian McCulloch a member of an investigating board for similar such incidents. As they continue she notices a sign on one that resembles a sign from a small Southeast Asian island and convinces him to put together a team to investigate. Gathering his assistant George Harper Peter O'Neal and girlfriend Susan Kelly Sherry Buchanan to go along and head to the island. There they find the place is full of cannibals from a longlost tribe and a strange doctor performing strange operations on the locals. When they become the next targets for the experiment they try to get off the island alive.The Good News This was a pretty pleasant surprise. It's big plus is that it feels like a great mixture of two big genres namely the cannibal and zombie subgenres. That it uses the taletell signs of the two and convincingly makes this one a really entertaining and clever entry. The cannibals surprisingly get the majority of the screentime spent as it's going to their homeplace based on speculation of their existence and that in turn reveals the truth about the zombies in a notexactlynew twist revealed towards the end. There's also plenty of gore in the film as this one has some pretty nice kills in it. There's a really impressive one where a victim is impaled from a trap that shoots up from behind to impale through the body rather than the other way around with a severe series of dismemberments and skin devouring to follow some really great impalements surgical amputations and a rather shocking scene where one gets their face torn up by a rotating motorboat engine. That's not to include all the really wicked surgeries done in the film which are also quite impressive and really bloody. That there's also some really juicy skindevouring really helps to make this one bloody and gory. The fact that it remains watchable all the way through to the end is another big plus as this one doesn't really get boring and features enough action spots to stay interesting and only without a big taste for cheese will this one fail. These all make it quite entertaining.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot wrong with this one. One of the big ones is it's incredibly high cheese factor. There's a lot of that in the film which can be evidenced by the general plot description. This also has marks for it in that category for it's gore and general atmosphere which is a mark as it's not all that well received by most. That this one revels so heavily in it makes it something to be avoided by those who aren't that into that style. This one also has the problem in that it doesn't really do the big points from it's meshed styles. For a zombie film these don't really feel like zombies most of the time as they rarely do anything more than stand around and take orders and aren't in the film very long to begin with. They're involved in the last twenty minutes of the film and it doesn't really feature them a whole lot in that timespan. As well there isn't a lot of time spent on the cannibal tribe getting to know them. All that's known about them is the name and island where they live which is basically it. This here needed more information on them. Otherwise the cheesiness is the main problem with this one.The Final Verdict While not the greatest entry in either the Italian cannibal or zombie genres this one does have enough to like about it that fans of both will be happy. See this one if you're a fan of either of those two genres or are just in the mood for a quick cheesy time while those not in the mood for such a film or aren't fans altogether should seek caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence Full Nudity and Language".

See this one if you're a fan of either of those two genres or are just in the mood for a quick cheesy time while those not in the mood for such a film or aren't fans altogether should seek caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence Full Nudity and Language";

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I always point out about these Cannibal flicks is that besides the disturbing subject matter and ferocious gore these films are also usually have really interesting dare I say fascinating stories. That's right. Quality Bmovies do exist after all. However Zombi Holocaust is not one of them. It looks like your stuck with just the gore. I think it'll be fine. I mean just because this one doesn't hold up against the almighty Cannibal Ferox and Cannibal Holocaust doesn't necessarily mean it's not worth your time. And really. Who wouldn't want a film called Zombi Holocaust in their Horror collection? Not I.Besides what I've already told you the one thing you might want to consider going in to this film is that it's a Zombie movie. I suppose you already had that figured out. But still Zombi Holocaust does include cannibals as well as a jungle. Best of both worlds? More like a touch of both worlds. Nothing groundbreaking from either side of the fence. And on top of all that Zombi Holocaust is also a mad scientist flick. We start out at a hospital where corpses are being mutilated. Eventually a cannibal is caught in the act. I guess it was shame that drove the poor guy to unconvincingly jumping out the window. Obviously tomfoolery like this is not something you'd want going on at your local hospital. Curiosity gets the best of Ian McCullough and some hot chick. For some reason this hospital mystery lies somewhere in the Carribbean. A mad doctor is slowly turning a tribe of cannibals into zombies. Zombies who don't really do much of anything as the cannibals are the only ones willing to start trouble. Whatever. It's a movie. So this guy must be stopped right? And in case you're wondering all that doesn't turn out nearly as entertaining as it sounds. Ultimately if you're a fan of such classics as Burial Ground and Jungle Holocaust I see no reason why you shouldn't get a kick out of Zombi Holocaust at least out of sheer principle. Well unless you're not too big on stupid movies with ridiculous dialogue and awful acting. In that case you may want to stay clear of this one. 710".

	schema:headline " You got your zombie movie in my cannibal film! You got your cannibal film in my zombie flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "Put them together and you get a completely mindless movie! Yes the title of this film is completely misleading the Zombie Holocaust one as when I hear it I imagine hordes of zombies rampaging the countryside. Instead what we mainly get is a cannibal horror film fused together with a mad doctor film with a dash of zombies in it for taste. It shares a lot of similarities to Lucio Fulci's Zombie movie too as it features Ian McCulloch and another actor from that film and it appears to be on the exact same island! When they first drive to the one doctor's house they go down a street and it looks exactly like a scene out of Zombie heck the donkey may have even been in Zombie. They depart in terms of plot however as this one does not focus on the zombie aspect. Well it does not really focus on anything as nothing anyone in this film does makes much sense. I think they just tried to fuse to many sub genres together without a complete script or something.The story of this one is the weakest element of the film because at times it almost seems like there is none. There are mutilations in a hospital in New York and it is soon learned that it is the work of a cannibal. Other cannibals turn up here and there because somehow they can just get jobs at hospitals. A group of four people travel to an island for reasons that are really no one's business because them going makes absolutely no sense. They meet a doctor who provides them with some yummy looking lemonade and then they are off to another island where the cannibals live. The group which now includes three very expendable helpers and another dude soon find themselves under assail from the cannibals who get scared by zombies going Ah and nearly everyone is killed but the two survivors decide to try and figure out the mystery even though it literally accomplishes nothing.The film moves at a rather fast pace and it features some good Italian splatter and some good nudity too. That makes the film at least watchable but the plot is so horrendously bad that I just cannot score it any higher. Some of the effects are rather horrible too as at one point one of the cannibals is caught in New York and he proceeds to jump out a window. It is obviously a mannequin and when it impacts the ground its arm pops off! I realize they may not want to redo the scene but they could have at least jump cut and edited that part out! The mad doctor is the only person who seems to know what he is doing but making a race of ineffective zombies seems kind of a waste of time. Just too much bad in this one to overcome even with the nice gore and very hot blond.So this film is a combination film but I think they just tried to do too much. At times it is a cannibal film at other a mad doctor and then a bit of zombies in there for effect. Heck the scenes where the blond undress could be considered soft core porn because the music is right out of one! They just tried to do much and as I have said I just do not think they had fully completed script to go along with it all. Though another interesting aspect of the film is its similarities to Zombie however that one is the superior film as it makes a bit more sense why things are happening and why they go to the island. Here it just makes no sense at all.".

Sound familiar?For about the first fortyfive minutes of this film I was too busy thinking that it was exactly like Zombie to be impressed. No one these days is sure which film came out first and most people also draw parallels to another classic of the genre that came out the same year Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust. Then Ian McCollouch disposes of a zombie with a motorboat motor and suddenly things started getting a whole lot more fun. Rather like The Evil Dead this is a film where there's a whole lot of setup though Raimi pulled it off miles better but when the gore starts the director lays it on thick fast and ugly. And while deathbypropeller is probably the funniest and nastiest scene in the film there's certainly more than enough blood flowingsprayingdrippingbeing drunketc. to please most fans of hardcore horror. Pound for pound though in comparison to Zombie the latter stands up as the better film. As one reviewer put it Fulci... might have had the sauce but he passed on the cheese. Fulci's obsessive attention to detail better scriptwriting and stunning score give Fulci the edge over Girolami. But man it's fun to be the judge. ".

I picked up Zombie Holocaust with some optimism and a little knowledge of its reputation and after watching it could only help but wonder what had just happened.

Sounds like a swinging good time but the movie is downright distracting in its own indecisiveness flipping back and forth between these awkwardly incompetently blended genres without a hint of wit or style. Perhaps this is attributable to Fabrizio de Angelis who is known less for his screen writing capabilities than as a producer on Lucio Fulci's most notable works. It is conceivable that the producers wanted to churn out a genrebending smrgsbord knowing they would get some return on it but the utter ridiculousness of the finished product is an endurance test for the viewer's patience.Ian McCulloch his usual stuffy self and Alexandra Delli Colli New York Ripper venture off to some faraway island to investigate a doctor's odd practices. Along the way they encounter hostile natives zombies and an climax that looks suspiciously like another better zombie flick.

Some scenes are similar to Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 such as it starts in New York and then they go into the tropical island the Zombies in the island's church. Even two of the actors from Zombi 2 are in Zombi Holocaust.The scenes with the Cannibles killing and eating the people are nice and gory the Zombie make up is good and kind of similar to Zombi 2's Zombie make up. One problem is that we don't see much of the Zombies at first but halfway through the film they do show up.The Mad Scientist elements are something new since Zombi 2 didn't have a man trying to create Zombies for his research and uses the Cannibles for his experiments. Zombi Holocaust is a great Zombie flick with some good gore effects. Check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zombie Holocaust aka Dr. Butcher MD Medical Deviate in the United States is a film that capitalizes on the success of the now cult classic cannibal and zombie films of the late 70's and early 80's such as Zombi 2 Cannibal Ferox and Burial Ground etc. The movie begins with a mysterious man stealing body parts from cadavers in a New York hospital for a late night snack. What is with these Italian zombie films and New York connections anyways? The man is eventually discovered and promptly flings himself out of the hospital window before anyone can question him. Upon investigating his body we discover that he bears markings that link him to a native cannibal tribe on an island off of the South American coast here we go again and our leads are sent to investigate. Ian McCulloch of Zombi 2 fame plays Dr. Peter Chandler Peter...also in Zombi 2...weird and reprises his role as a zombie slayer and travels with anthropologist and medical student Lori Ridgeway Alexandra Delli Colli to the island to meet with Dr. Obrero Donald O'Brien whose questionable character leads to an interesting twist in the movies latter half. Upoon our characters arrival at the island they encounter cannibal mayhem zombie carnage and some crazy doctor antics that make for the aforementioned twist.Zombie Holocaust falls into one of my favorite categories Eurozombietrash! These movies usually contain an overabundance of gore nudity bad acting and a plot with enough holes to embarrass a slice of Swiss. Zombie Holocaust does not let down in any of these categories except acting the acting here is fairly solid. GO IAN! The movie was released in America as Dr. Butcher MD as mentioned above and it contains a different opening. Despite common belief that is the ONLY significant difference between the two films. The Dr. Butcher version contains an R rating but does not lack any of the gore in the Zombie Holocaust version. The Eurocut is superior to me only because A it is the original and B because the introduction spoils the whole zombie revealing that remains kind of mysterious in Zombie Holocaust until about halfway through the movie. You find yourself wondering how the will fit in them BAM! There they are. Things to look forward to in Zombie Holocaust include some really well done gore scenes including some eyes being ripped out and eaten graphic disembowelments a machete to the head some likely unsanitary surgeries and the granddaddy of them all here an running outboard boat engine propeller to the head of an attacking zombie! Oh... and the nudity there is plenty of that! The version of the movie that I own comes from Shriek Show a division of Media Blasters and has both crisp image and sound despite the atrocious dubbing! I still don't understand why we can't just get the original language tracks with English subtitles!? The movie came as part of the highly recommended Zombie Pack 2 along with Burial Ground The Nights of Terror and Flesh Eater. Shriek Show as usual packed this one with extras including both American and German trailers an extensive poster and still gallery an interview with the EFX director the opening segments of the US release with commentary and a slew of trailers for other zombie and cannibals flicks of the era. This movie is something that any true zombiecannibal aficionado should have in there collection. It is comparable to Zombi 2 so don't be surprised if some of the zombies or the sets look the same.Overall if you are a fan of zombies cannibals Ian McCulloch extreme gore movies with mad scientistsdoctors or a combination thereof you should check this out. An overall excellent flick in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zombi Holocaust is one of the biggest pleasant surprises I purchased in a long time. And that's a really positive thing to say because you probably know this kind of horror films...Fully made and produced in Italy in the early 80's these movies have like a dozen alternate titles and versions. Tons of similar movies like this were made during this decade but most of them only seem promising but disappoint in the end. Zombi Holocaust doesn't !! This movie is an extremely enjoyable mixture of all kind of interesting and nasty horror topics. Okay the movie is called Zombi Holocaust and there ARE a few zombies to detect but Zombie Holocaust is sooooo much more than that !!Actually the plot of Zombie Holocaust is about a mad scientist  doctor who uses a tribe of cannibals to perform medical experiments on. Due to those experiments the aborigines become zombies. Now in that simple plot summary we've had ZOMBIES CANNIBALS and freakin' MAD DOCTORS !!! I don't know about you but to me that already sounds like every fan's dream. And I can assure you that  if you have the privilege to watch the fully uncut version like I did  you'll have a true gorefest !! The level of sickness and utterly nasty scenes is very extreme and it even surpasses the work of undeniable masters in the field like Lucio Fulci and Ruggero Deodato in certain sequences. Zombie Holocaust contains a gruesome autopsy many throats are being slit faces and guts are being ripped offout etc etc...the gore highlights really are numberless. If I have to pick one I'd say the scene where a zombi is hacked up for barbeque by a propeller !! Classic needtosee stuff for horror fans !!!Furthermore the plot contains many many holes and the acting is abominable. Even though O'Brien shows a lot of potential as the freaky doctor he's given too less screentime to impress you enough. And even though Alexandra Delli Colli has a gorgeous body  and she proves that multiple times by showing it  she isn't much of a talented actress. But seriously...who cares about all these things ? Besides bad acting is necessary for this kind of early 80's horror...it adds a lot more charm to the production. Zombi Holocaust is just a magnificent splatter movie that comes with my highest possible recommendation. I've only got to known this movie recently because of all the confusing aka's. It was listed as Zombie3 in my local videostore and as Zombie Holocaust in another. But there are just way to many Italian movies called like that to let it bother you. Seek this one and enjoy it !!".

This film is slow and boring misleading there's actually very little zombie action it's mostly about cannibals and just generally stupid and amateurish. As far as the gore goes this doesn't offer nearly the same outlandish gruesomeness as Fulci's film the gore effects are quite fakelooking and silly and there is never a moment of real tension whereas Fulci does manage to achieve some suspense. Disappointing in a major way not even really fun on the sobadit'sgood level.

In fact the zombies don't even show up until 60 into the film and then appear sparingly with never more than 2 in one shot at a time. They never actually harm anyone don't move at all like zombies except in a couple shots actually follow the mad doctor's orders obediently and don't even have makeup on besides on their faces. Those looking for similar hijinx to those on parade in Lucio Fulci's goreclassic ZOMBIE will be totally baffled here.What this film DOES have though are some wonderfully unintentional hilarity  the best of which is the long LONG shot of Ian McCulloch talking to Dr. Obero Donal O'Brien outside the church. O'Brien says there's a rubber dingy up on the coast to take you off the island to which Ian looks at him then ponders off into space for a solid 20 seconds only to say but... as though he's a total moron! The editor really dropped the ball with that one. Another great part comes early on with a man jumping out of a window and falling 20 stories to his doom and when he hits the ground the mannequin in his place loses an arm. Cut to dead guy on floor and his arm is still attached.The most questionable scene has to be the whole ending of the movie where Dr. Obrero looks to be just as puzzled as the audience. Why are the natives suddenly attacking? Why doesn't he do anything? ...and WHY do they start cannibalizing a Zombie??? yuck! Watch ZOMBIE THE BEYOND ZOMBI 3 or even NIGHTMARE CITY instead. More zombies better direction and just plain better movies overall.Anime fans may recognize the voices of Ed Mannix as Dr. Obrero and Gregory Snegoff as George.".

This time instead of being a journalist Ian McCulloch plays a hard line Environmental Health Officer or something out to discover why natives from some island or other are chowing down on folks at the local hospital. I've watched the film about a dozen times but I'm still hazy on whether he succeeds or not but there's plenty of gore in the film so  who cares.Ian heads of for this island with Alexandra Della Colli as a companion. Now this lady is definitely a better trade in for Tisa Farrow as she seems to have trouble keeping clothes on. For the last fifteen minutes of the film she just gives up on them altogether and struts around in the buff. Plus she's quite handy with a machete.This island is crawling with cannibals but luckily Ian's got plenty of sidekicks that get carved up in various ways and although there are zombies this film is more of a showcase of cannibalistic setpieces where the natives gut folks and eat them. The zombies are more like a kind of garnish although one does get mashed up with a speedboat motor.There's also a mad doctor in there played by Donald O'Brien in a lovely over the top manner. Once again I wasn't 100 clear on why he was doing what he was doing or even what happened to him at the end but the film was so insanely enjoyable I was beyond caring.Infinitely rewatchable due to the scores of mistakes in the film and the gore and the nudity Zombie Holocaust is yet another great Italian movie set partially or wholly in New York just like Zombie Flesh Eaters Contamination City of the Living Dead Days of Hell Eaten Alive Cannibal Ferox Inferno New York Ripper Bronx Warriors 2019 After the Fall of New York Manhattan Baby and Bronx Warriors 2 escape from the Bronx.

What you do get is gore which although more realistic than much in this genre is handled relatively inoffensively in comparison with berpretentious namesake Cannibal Holocaust and all of which is couched in such a ridiculous and random plot that it's difficult to take any of it seriously.Take for example the heroine a true tour de force of constant nudity by Alessandra delli Colli. Refreshingly nubile for a joint degree anthropologistmedical doctor who just happens to have grown up in the southeast Asian islands where the cannibals who just happen to reappear at the very hospital where she works and who go after the ceremonial knife which she just happens to have because she just happens to study the same cannibal group who just happen to have shown up at the hospital in the first place. That and she has to be told by another anthropologist the one who they're just waiting to be given the Nobel Prize. You know the coveted Nobel Prize in Anthropology... that the island of the cannibals in the same island group where she spent her childhood mind you bears the name of the obscure cannibal spirit or something. Not that delli Colli conveys anything remotely resembling intelligence anywhere in the movie. But she doesn't have to.And then there's the plot. It's never really established why the group of people go to find the cannibals other than to act as human bait. Or why the mad doctor hate to include a spoiler here uses the Blofeldian device of slowly sedating the hero with a scalpel within arm's reach. Or why none of the countless eviscerated people seem to have ribs.Anyway this movie is so resolutely cheesy that it goes down a lot better than most of its contemporaries in either the zombie or cannibal genres especially the latter.

If you have a sense of humour like me you'll love it because there are a lot of things to laugh at such as the jesting students in the morgue. One joke is along the lines of I thought you might have mutilated the corpse after all you did say that you needed a hand with your studies. It's so pathetic that you have to laugh at it because of the sheer cheesiness and absurdity. Lots of other immortal dialogue abounds in the film that's just a sample.Now ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is a truly bad film. Viewers more acquainted with glossy American dramas with high budgets and lavish sets will be disappointed by the badness of it. As the film is Italian the voices are all badly dubbed which can be something of a hindrance. But to lovers of the bad film there's a lot to savour. Firstly the cast Ian McCulloch lends wooden charm as the lead complete with an illfitting wig Alexandra Delli Colli is there for glamour purposes alone as she's certainly no actress and Donald O'Brien who had a life in flicks such as this is excellent as the overthetop villain of the piece.The cannibals run around and shout in high pitched voices. They may not be the most convincing of actors but they soon get down to a lot of gut ripping and eyeball popping to 'entertain' the viewer. The zombies who actually don't eat any people in this film for a change walk around and breathe heavily like an asthmatic Darth Vader. Sometimes they run with knives too. They're pretty unpredictable. The comedy brain experiment ending is so unconvincing and badly acted that you just have to love it. Lots of gore a scene of a naked girl being painted by natives and hilarious dialogue make this one a very enjoyable watch. Okay so it didn't win any awards but it's fun and that's what counts in my book. I can think of films with budgets hundreds of times higher which I hated...".

	schema:reviewBody "How bad was it? Well for starters there are only a couple of zombies in the movie and they're entirely incidental. They could just as well have not been in there at all. For the most part the story is about some people on an island where there's a tribe of cannibal natives who aren't actually cannibals since their diet is composed mostly of badlymolded wax dummies filled with pork parts. Sort of somehow leading them is a mad scientist who never took acting lessons.How bad was it? Well how about a guy who has been slain and mutilated but can still blink? Or a dead guy missing almost all of his chest cavity that still finds it necessary to breathe? Or a dude who falls out of a 20thstory window and has his arm fly off but in the next scene has the arm back again? Or the reflection of the entire crew in someone's binoculars in detailed closeup? If your apartment had been burglarized and ransacked you'd report it to the police wouldn't you? How about if your friend the cop showed up coincidentally and ran around the place looking for the burglar whose footsteps you just heard... surely the cop would report the crime and call for backup or at least draw his gun right? Well not in this movie. The burglary was simply forgotten right after it happened and is never mentioned again nor is the reason for it ever worked into the rest of the film. Or hey how about this... if you found a maggotridden head on your bed right next to an arcane symbol of evil scrawled on your sheets in blood you'd be upset for at least a few minutes right? Nah not in this movie. Again it's forgotten within a couple of minutes by all of the characters and has nothing to do with anything else in the movie. Maybe on a cannibal island leaving a decomposed head on your bed is customary in the way that a good hotel in the US leaves a chocolate on your pillow. Nothing in this film makes sense including the ending wherein the cannibal natives suddenly decide to turn on the mad scientist for no apparent reason. I guess they were just in a bad mood that afternoon.The worst part of this flick though is its nonetoosubtle racist overtones. We can start with the black boat captain whose name is Mulatto no really that's his name. Or we can look at the swarthy natives who are ruled by the one white person on the island or the fact that the only person they don't kill and eat is a tall blond blueeyed woman. Instead of eating her they paint flowers on her naked body and worship her as a goddess. Or the darkskinned cannibal medical student. It goes on and on. Rule of thumb for Zombi Holocaust the darker your skin tone the more evil and devious you are. And you still won't be able to act.Now I love cheesy horror flicks but this was the wrong kind of cheese. Natives of Brooklyn may understand when I say that this is pure frummunda cheese. I won't explain that so don't ask.".

I for one am not the biggest fan of zombie flicks but I respect a movie with loads of gore and with a high level of cheese. And yep Zombies The Beginning delivers just that.The story revolves around some cuteass Asian babe who plays a scientist of sorts. She's the lone survivor of a zombie rampage which left her entire crewteam dead. Events lead her back to the island where the zombies live...unlive. And as you can guess loads of zombies and gore follow. Some weird turns in the story take place but really you're only really expecting the next scene of violence. Which basically this film is fine for.ZTB was pretty fun but ultimately it was a tad too tedious and just really amateurish. For example in the first 20 minutes they show a nightmare our lead lady has been suffering from three times. No biggie if it's quick or cool but nope. It's long and stupid....but understandable. Of course if you love cheesy foreign zombie flicks this shouldn't bother you in the slightest and you should feel right at home.If you're a die hard fan of Mattei or zombies there's no reason not to check it out. It delivers the red stuff the awful good thing dubbing and a ridiculous story. Just don't expect our leading lady to shed any clothing. Even with those nice boobs....no nudity. Oh well at least there were some zombie boobs.".

	schema:headline " Ol' Bruno goes out with a BANG!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bruno Mattei's final film picks up directly after ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD with Sharon Yvette Yzon the lone survivor being rescued at sea. Back on the mainland Sharon is having nightmares and execs at Tyler Inc. don't buy her story on how the ship and crew disappeared. Six months later Sharon is a monk but is contacted by Tyler Inc. to participate in a rescue mission after contact with a colony on a nearby island is lost. Sound familiar? Yup ol' Bruno gets his James Cameron on in his pumped up sequel. Actually I should say Mattei is getting his James Cameron on again as this is his second film to rip off ALIENS nearly sceneforscene after 1990's equally amazing SHOCKING DARK.This is truly a high note for Bruno to go out in for his long career of xerox cinema. Why? Is it a technical masterpiece? Does it contain amazing acting? Hell no! It is because Bruno has the gall to lift tons of scenes from CRIMSON TIDE and shamelessly steal the TERMINATOR 2 theme. There is also stolen footage of an oil plant blowing up but I couldn't place it. I was equally disappointed and impressed that Mattei didn't steal anything in the previous ISLAND so this was a welcome return. Plus you have to love a direct sequel titled ZOMBIES THE BEGINNING. What? The mimicking of the plot of ALIENS 21 years after the fact is just hilarious. Every major scene is here just with 150th of the budget. Yzon gets all tough like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley and the film's bloody finale has her in a big breeding chamber where there is a huge talking brain no it is never explained.In terms of entertainment I would rate this one above ISLAND for the sheer ripoff factor. But they both need to be seen together. I did them backtoback and that might be the best way as you feel like you are getting a 3hour zombie miniseries. The flick ends with a short clip of Bruno saying something on the set and the words Ciao Bruno... on screen. Indeed many thanks for all of your fine films. And also many thanks to Cameron Romero Stallone Spielberg and all of the other director's who have given Mattei inspiration over the years.".

It takes half an hour or so before it kicks off but when it does you will be incredulous that a film like this could still be made in 2007. Dialogue and dubbing are reliably hilarious there's shedloads of gore and some very nasty and distasteful setpieces. Plot is vague and gets mighty confused at the end but you'd expect nothing less really. Cinematography looks nice and whilst I'm pretty sure this is SOV it looks a lot better than 'Land Of Death' which looked really CHEAP but not in a good way. This movie gives you hope that this sort of thing can still be done  riproaring action packed brainless unPC horror with not a shred of irony or postmodernism to be seen. All this needs is a score by Goblin or Fabio Frizzi and it would be pretty much perfect. Some brave director needs to pry the baton from Bruno's cold dead fingers and continue what he started...Highly Recommended!".

Oh they did replace the aliens with zombies. Did I mention that????????? Total crap total waste of time and the worst effects I have seen since the 60's. If you love zombie movies stay away from this one.";

The plot is basically just the movie Aliens1986 except with zombies as the enemy instead of the xenomorphs.The zombies have excellent makeup they look much more like rotting corpses then much of Mattei's earlier work. The acting is hilariously terrible. Even though this was filmed in English Mattei used the old Italian trick of dubbing all the dialog. This has predicable results with the actors putting emphasis on the wrong syllables and words and having far less emotion when delivering their lines. This helps the movie out tremendously however as most dialogue scenes are chocked full of potential quotes for bad movie lovers.The gore is good it is not as explicit as some of his previous movies but it is still very entertaining. The rest of the special effects are more laughable then anything else. But what do you expect from a Mattei production? All in all its a great movie filled with quotes and moments that exploitation fans will love. It is sad though that such an entertaining filmmaker died before he got the respect he deserved.

People repeat things and it is so painfully apparent that these are not trained marines apparently people with such high training need to be told three times to open fire.But the worst part of the film is the camera work. The worst part because it is the best part the film does look good.

One of the best features here is the fact that by being so obvious and unrepentant about its status as a true fullfledged ripoff it allows for the same kind of fun as before. As the whole first half is an abbreviated runthrough of the same movie it gives the same sense of fun here in rolling through the same main scenes which gives this the creepy dreams that brings her along the transport to the island coming off the same way as before and the group undergoing the same positions and group formations as they advance and overtake the area. Once inside it gets even more fun with the locator beacons of the facility the motion detectors and even the firefight against the one creature they come across which leads into the allout fun of the storage locker confrontation. Taking off on it's own delirious tangent as the still alive body gives birth to another creature which in turns leads to one of the wildest shootouts possible where the entire room is filled with creatures and brings an endless stream of gunfire blasting limbs and bullet wounds that results in massive carnage along the way and is an extraordinary highlight especially leading into the gunfights required to escape as it shows the group running into the creatures in every corner of the building picking them off onebyone. Though the film does go back into the ripoff realm afterwards again it does so with flair as the numerous encounters with the zombies means there's plenty of action featured here with the big escape from the lab here allowing for the group splitting up as the first ones get knocked off leading to the numerous firefights and confrontations throughout here as the group falls under constant attack in plain ripoff sequences of these scenes only done in excessively graphic overthetop carnage fashion. Again this one changes nicely from the other material when it gets to the finale as the real source for all the rampage creatures is such a bizarre and otherworldly concept while still tying in somewhat to what happened in the original that it becomes all the more mindbogglingly cheesy to see this one as the chosen scenario here which still adds a lot of great action dealing with the newfound creatures responsible as this simply adds to the utterly deranged atmosphere here. Still featuring the same great gore and special effects work for the most part these here hold this up nicely against the film's flaw. Again since there's so much here that's ripped off from other movies especially in how it goes playbyplay at times it can be seen as unnecessary to watch this one instead of the source movie based on how much it does follow that route. It's cheaplooking at times but these flaws here are more individualpreference than anything to do with the film itself.Rated UnratedR Extreme Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Nudity.".

	schema:headline " Zombies The Beginning";
	schema:reviewBody "Zombies The Beginning 2007  12 out of 4Italian director Mattei ended his career with this sequel to ISLAND OF THE LIVING DEAD but don't expect a typical zombie flick. This film picks up right where the previous left as the sole survivor is asked by the government to head back to the island where her crew was killed by the zombies. That's pretty much all you need to know in terms of story as you really don't even need that considering this movie completely ignores what happened at the very end of the previous one. Yes Mattei's final flick has a lot of zombies but it's actually just a direct rip off of ALIENS. This isn't the first time Mattei has ripped ALIENS and even though this movie is extremely bad you can't help but somewhat admire how much ripping this guy can do. Not only do we get dialogue and scenes ripped from the Cameron flick but we get the typical stock footage stolen from other movies and this time it's CRIMSON TIDE. How Mattei got away with doing this his entire career is beyond me but quite a few of the sub scenes from that movie are lifted and used here. The movie actually looks like it had a fairly decent budget as the set design is actually pretty good and this is especially true at the end when we visit the alienzombie tombs. Fans of gore will get quite a bit of that here as the red stuff is constantly flowing with various heads being shot off and parts being ripped or eaten. The CGI effects are quite poor but it adds a somewhat campy feel to the film. The performances like the previous film are hard to judge considering how bad the dubbing is but most people don't come to movies like this for the acting. The film doesn't mind ripping off other movies including dialogue from DAY OF THE DEAD and Mattei even rips off his own RATS NIGHT OF TERROR. Fans of exploitation will probably want to check this out just for the cheese but the biggest problem is that it runs way too long and there's just not enough here to warrant the long running time. Mattei certainly went out with his comeback and this film contains all the bad stuff he'll always be remembered for.".

Just go with it Stupidly its unleashed on a small ISLAND community... Isn't that kinda the worst possible place for this kind of thing? If you wanted to kill a lot of people wouldn't you release it on the mainland or a major city so it can spread? Anyway I digress. The meat of the film is nothing special typical zombie outbreak with a few gay jokes thrown in to give the slower members of the audience a giggle. But this film does deliver where its needed its a true B movie with ridiculous and one dimensional antagonists. Along with main characters who were clearly written with the thought How can we get the most puns out of these guys?Really the true and honest glory of this film comes towards the end when one of the cardboard villains mentioned above I won't spoil who gets attacked by a zombie who rips his arm off and proceeds to beat him to death with it. I kid you not I watched that scene at least 4 times. I wouldn't say that this is a zombie flick that you HAVE to see. But you could definitely do worse. It knows what it is and sticks to just how corny the writing is and delivers what anyone with brain would expect from a film with this kind of budget.

I was doubtful about the movie just because of the name but I decided to watch it anyway.Alright well this is a marvelous zombie movie it has everything you need in a zombie movie. Lots of zombies usually with adequate makeup wardrobe and effects blood and gore though the blood in this movie was very strangely red and of course a story that will sink its teeth in you  no pun intended.Right from the very beginning I had a feel that this movie was going to be interesting despite it not being a multimillion dollar Hollywood production. And right I was oh yes! The story is very good and have a good constant flow to it. So you are never left with a boring and dull taste in your mouth. Sure there are some points where you wonder about stuff like how come suddenly there were so many infected people on the island. But that doesn't really bring the movie to a halt. You look past it because the movie is that interesting.The characters in the movie were well portrayed and likable. Some more than others of course. I found the dialogue to be good enough. And also I thought most of the characters in the movie were good for the story and added flavor and color to the story. The cast was for most of the roles very nicely cast.The effects of the movie weren't too shabby either. Of course they were not on Romero's level but still they were very nice to look at and seemed real enough most of the time.And also if you are the type that approach movies analytically then this movie does have some interesting things that it deals with such as terrorism homosexuality religion racism to name some. And these elements work well in the movie. Of course if you just watch a movie for entertainment these still add depth to the entire movie.Overall I think this is one of the better low budget zombie movies I have seen in awhile. It would be a shame to let this one pass you by if you are a gore hound or zombie fan. Don't let the title fool you as it almost did me.This movie definitely gets two thumbs up  if a zombie hadn't bitten off my left thumb. This is most definitely good entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "A potentially great old school zombie movie with a clever twist that is squandered by shoddy production values.I saw the trailer for this film and I was absolutely stoked. An oldschool Romeroesquire zombie movie blended with comedy and satire sounded like a sure thing. With the success of other zomedies like Shaun of the Dead Dead and Breakfast and ZOmbieland there's no reason why this should have failed but sadly it does... to some degree at least.It's got it a decent amount of laughs and gore scenes. It's post911 terrorism paranoia twist works excellently and is so refreshing for a genre that is getting stale.The film just isn't any good on a technical standpoint. The editing is really bizarre and during some of the intense scenes everything looks warped and choppy. Poor editing aside the worst thing is the horrendously bad sound design. Everything sounds awful. Everything. When anybody raise there voices the levels peak and the quality is distorted. this combined with the poor editing makes any sort of action scene almost unbearable to watch.A really good idea and a good attempt but next time more talent and experience might produce a better movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "A potentially great old school zombie movie with a clever twist that is squandered by shoddy production values.I saw the trailer for this film and I was absolutely stoked. An oldschool Romeroesquire zombie movie blended with comedy and satire sounded like a sure thing. With the success of other zomedies like Shaun of the Dead Dead and Breakfast and ZOmbieland there's no reason why this should have failed but sadly it does... to some degree at least.It's got it a decent amount of laughs and gore scenes. It's post911 terrorism paranoia twist works excellently and is so refreshing for a genre that is getting stale.The film just isn't any good on a technical standpoint. The editing is really bizarre and during some of the intense scenes everything looks warped and choppy. Poor editing aside the worst thing is the horrendously bad sound design. Everything sounds awful. Everything. When anybody raise there voices the levels peak and the quality is distorted. this combined with the poor editing makes any sort of action scene almost unbearable to watch.A really good idea and a good attempt but next time more talent and experience might produce a better movie.";

I decided to watch it with high hopes as I am a big fan of the zombie genre and some reviewers compared it to Shaun of the dead and Zombieland. In my opinion however there is no comparison even when taking into consideration the far lower production costs of ZMD. There is no depth to any of the characters and I don't see how the acting can be viewed as anything more than up to par. The humour and satirical elements consist of easy oneliners which failed to even make me grin. I mean come on  Don't shoot I'm gay. Is that even a joke ? If I was to compare this movie to anything I've seen I might consider Zombie strippers. However Zombie strippers at the very least added a new original take to the genre and there was some much appreciated subtlety to the humour in the script. Furthermore I've seen Zombie strippers twice whereas I would never consider sitting through ZMD a second time. In all honesty I feel generous in rating this movie with a 310.".

There are really no scares that I remember but the effects themselves are not that bad remember  non Hollywood! I really laughed a lot at this flick. Some of it was at corniness some was some good humor. At one point I did think that this would be a good candidate for an over the top Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead. It really picks on so many aspects of culture.The lead actress really did a good job as did the two playing Lance and Tom. I think Lance gets some of the best lines and has some good comedic timing.As long as you don't mind a little poking fun at yourself and are not looking for the next overthetop overpolished Hollywood turd this is a very enjoyable movie.".

This is something that shouldn't be a problem even in a low budget film it would've been better off with no processing.As for the zombie scenes I was actually surprised at the quality of makeup and acting during these scenes some of the effects were noticeably low budget but overall quite impressive for what they had to work with there was a lot of camera cuts which seemed a little over done.In the political sense it addressed several issues touching on homosexuality religion mayoral office and the middle east. it did seem to overemphasize them but perhaps that was the point. I only had a problem with how they were trying to make a point it detracted from the flow of the movie there would be one scene where they're fighting zombies and then the entire mood changes to make political point it seemed like the writer wrote a political movie then an editor came along and said what do you think of adding zombies. The scenes didn't mesh together and felt forced.The cast seemed a good fit for the characters they played however the acting was definitely Bfilm quality I'd say the gay couple and the Iranian girl were by far the best actorsactress of the film. The Iranian father's actions and lines seemed rehearsed and forced. The zombies seemed as you would imagine from most zombie movies slow stupid and bloodthirsty.In conclusion a Zombies of Mass Destruction is a zombie film crashed into a political movie and didn't have any insurance to fund the collision repair which makes for decent zombie killing action mixed with bc class acting and interruptions of overexaggerated political views when I say interruptions I mean it takes on the mood of an entirely different movie.".

I feel there was some sort of political satire the director was trying to portray through this confusing uninteresting storyline. It appears to be a battle of conservatism versus liberalism as expressed through not just the campaigns for mayor but also an attempt to tie in international and gay culture tolerance. All the meanwhile random zombies are tearing off faces and taking over the town. Even a dinner with mom turns into slapstick gay humor when her son attempts to come out to her and she turns into a zombie. From there the remainder of the scene is the gay son and his partner trying to figure out what to do with her as she hangs on the wall with a fireplace iron through her torso. I don't understand the reference to Shaun of the Dead as this movie does not seem humorous at all. It seems that the director attempted to make a serious political message within the context of the movie and failed miserably. So to counter this the producer has no choice but to try and sell it as comedy. In reality the only thing funny about this movie is the laugh you will get at just how horrible this movie is and how you can not believe you actually spent money on it at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well if you are into the genre there basically is no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie. It's definitely better than the average lowbudget zombieflick.But this obviously is not a movie without it flaws. I can tell what this movie tried to achieve and how but I can't exactly say that they succeeded with it. They tried to make this a comedy more than a straightforward gory shocker which is in my opinion also the right direction to head in when you have such a small budget to spend. No way people are going to take your movie serious when you are trying to create a creepy realistic and shocking horror movie with zombies in it when you only have a couple of thousands of dollars to spend. This movie seems to realize that and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It makes the movie entertaining but I wish I could also say that it works out for the best of the movie. Problem is that the writing just isn't very clever or funny.The movie of course has a very simply concept and a standard main premise of a small town being overrun by a sudden zombie plague. They tried spicing things up by adding in some quirky characters that are however doing such unlikely things in the movie that they rather work out as stupid than funny really. Their responses to all of the situations don't even work out in a comical way though you can tell that they were really supposed to. One persons mother gets turned into a zombie another person sees her boyfriend being teared up and eaten alive another one looses both parents but they all seem to be cool with that and don't seem to be too worried about the whole situation. And this is not spoiling much really since none of it seems relevant for the movie its story or any of its characters at all.What the movie also tried to add in was some social satire. The Iraq war and gays are the two elements that the writers decided to write a social commentary around. But again the writing just isn't very clever or witty so it all falls kind of flat and just doesn't seem to add enough. It certainly doesn't make the movie any more believable to watch and rather makes it more silly in a bad way instead.But oh well if you are into this genre there really certainly are far more worse movies to watch. At least this movie was still good looking with its visual style and didn't seem all that cheap though no doubt that this was a cheap movie to make. It has some good gore that is mostly being used for its comical effect though. It therefore shouldn't shock anyone too much most definitely not the most hardened genre fans. For this sort of movie it also definitely featured some good acting which is all the more an accomplishment due to its simplistic script and dialog and the fact that basically all actors in this movie had never appeared in anything else before.It's not a great or even funny movie to watch but nevertheless the movie remains entertaining throughout.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "ZMD has one kick ass precredit opening scene that had me completely psyched for the rest of the film. It boasts some impressive effects particularly for a film with a slim budget. I don't want to give away any of the juicy gory scenes but I will tell you that there are some glorious moments involving skin ripping shooting stabbing and even one shocking and hilarious hit and run.Instead of the regular cookie cutter characters you see in most horror films ZMD features a diverse group of individuals that are actually interesting. The local restaurant is run by an Iranian man who's American born daughter Frida has returned home from Princeton. Frida is conflicted with her role in the world not only because of her father who begs her to embrace her Iranian heritage but also an air headed boyfriend who keeps calling her an Iraqi. In a hilarious conversation between Frida and her boyfriend the phrases There is NORWAY you are getting in these panties and Kuwait a second are uttered. Oh yes he goes there. Then there is the gay couple Tom and Lance who have come to Port Gamble so that Tom can finally come out to his mother. The two deliver some of the film's best lines. There is a mayor with serious old fashion attitudes who's closest acquaintance is the local preacher who delivers fire and brimstone sermons. In direct contrast to the mayor is the local female high school teacher who is running against him in the upcoming election. Finally there is the proudly rightwing father with an alcoholic wife and an awkward drama student son. There are more than a few smallminded people in the town of Port Gamble. Many of the locals are suspicious of foreigners and fear homosexuals. Even the local news suggests terrorists for the cause of the zombie outbreak.So needless to say there is a crapload of material to work with. The gay couple played by Doug Fahl and Cooper Hopkins are outstanding and shine in every scene they are in. Janette Armand is also excellent as Frida. Ali Hamedani who plays Frida's father is perfect in his role and is actually the father of the director. Russell Hodgkinson is delightfully amusing and unlikable as the rightwing dad. Some of the acting from the more minor characters is iffy but it doesn't hurt the overall feel of the film. ZMD Zombies of Mass Destruction is wellpaced high energy gory clever and funny as hell. It entertained me from beginning to end. Highly Recommended!".

Also you have Tom who comes back to Port Gamble the conservative setting for the film to tell his mother that he is gay. Then all of a sudden a zombie outbreak occurs! And those three people have to fend off the zombie apocalypse while trying to get out of Port Gamble.The greatest thing about ZMD is it's comedy. The director and writer Kevin Hamedani is great at comedy and shows it well through the political satire in the film. There are great jokes in this film like jokes about gays Iranian culture American culture religion rights and of course zombies.The biggest complaint is that the film does get a bit TOO preachy. There is a preacher in this who believes that he can cure homosexuality. And this would be a good minor joke for the film IF they played it that way. But the film overplays the joke too much. Also the acting does get a bit cheesy at times even though it maybe the film's intent.But if you love zombies and if you love political satire ZMD is the film for you. It's a funnysmart and overall fun time. I suggest you watch this film with a group of friends because this is a great film to hang out and have fun with. And that's how I think the After Dark Horrorfest is supposed to be about to watch these films with a bunch of friends. Sure some of them aren't always fun but they're a good time. Like this film.".

Just to think that this Zombies of Mass Destruction is quite often labeled as the best zombie film since Shaun of the Dead is totally preposterous. This particular socalled zomedy zombiecomedy  they're so copious they even have an own slang name nearly isn't as funny or clever as it aims to be. In fact you can't even compare this movie with Shaun of the Dead. Writerdirector Kevin Hamedani is obviously a fanatic admirer of George A. Romero and desperately dreams of impersonating him. I bet Hamedami watched Romero's classic zombie films countless of times and based his screenplay on those viewings. The only thing he hasn't studied profoundly enough in the Romero film however is the art of subtlety. ZMB is an outrageous and often offensive denouncement of homophobia xenophobia post 911 paranoia and lower social class persuasions. When the small fisherman island town of Port Gamble is suddenly overrun with flesheating zombies the selfcentered community members immediately blame it on AlQuada. Logical of course because the daughter of the Iranian restaurant owner just returned to town and during her absence she probably attended some sort of Arab school for new terrorist attack methods. Another explanation for the zombie outbreak might be the visit of the homosexual Tom to his mother. He lives together with his boyfriend in New York and they probably brought all sorts of filthy diseases along to the peaceful island with them. As you can tell the social criticism and metaphors are not exactly what we call delicate or sophisticated so I guess Hamedani didn't understood George A. Romero's modus operandi after all. On top of having to deal with the embarrassing and not at all funny script ZMB is also inexplicably dull and derivative. Instead of the supposedly entertaining gay and racial slur Hamedani should have put some more effort in creative zombie kills andor makeup effects. Undoubtedly this movie will have its share of enthusiast fans but basically ZMB is a substantially void and grotesque imitation of the almighty George A. Romero.".

Of course there is a few things that make this film incomparable with Shaun of The Dead Dawn of The Dead or other great zombie movies but for a low budget movie this is good. This movie is not stereotypical as many. There is no hero and heroine that in the end live happily ever after. What they have in this movie is issues with politics racism sexual hereticgay and a few other things. In spite of that there are some weak point in this movie. The script could be better and more comical since people tend to laugh to the silly script not the comedy itself in this film. The filmmaker seems to cling with the clich act of many zombie movies where someone's arm being pulledoff so easilywhich is silly. Without such scene this movie could be better. Well this movie is worth to watch but never expect it to be that perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zombies of Mass Destruction is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a B SciFi channel movie but it wasn't even that good. There was really no plot no point poorly developed characters and just an overall bad attempt at a movie. Don't ever watch this movie unless you want to laugh at a poor excuse for anything. I literally felt like I was watching a soap opera with zombies. I will tell you right now Zombies of Mass Destruction gets the WillyT Seal of DISapproval. There really is no story so I will just rant and talk about what was wrong with this movie. A gay man and his boyfriend go to his mother's house to come out of the closet. He tries to find the words and when he finally does his mother is already a zombie. How was this possible? There was no zombie to begin within the house. And if a zombie did take a bite out of her why would it just leave? Wouldn't it just finish the job? This movie just makes no sense at all. The son ends up pinning her up against the wall. She escapes of course and the two decide to make a run for it. One grabs a weed whacker and just goes to town. A young woman comes home and she is Iranian I think and her neighbors are racist white trash. She goes on a date with some guy and he ends up being the first one bitten. It's my blood. He screams as he bleeds out. I lost it. It was too funny. This has to be the worst special effects I have ever seen in a zombie movie. The movie itself starts with a blind man poking around and he stumbles upon a zombie and he inevitably gets eaten. It was the stupidest beginning to a movie. I'm not going to lie. I turned this movie off. After the girl goes into the basement with the white trash family the wife gets bitten and on the news we find out that the zombie attack is because of Iraq. That's right Iraq has the ability to create the walking dead and they attack the United States. The family ties the girl up and the last thing I see if her father running around with a shotgun looking for his daughter. Now the one good thing I will say about this movie is that it is so bad it's almost good. I can't really say that without laughing but throughout this movie I laughed a lot. Was I supposed to I have no idea but I did. The crazy father disapproves of his daughter's boyfriend and when he sees him on the street as a zombie he blows his head off with a shotgun. That is where I lost control and could not put up with this disaster anymore. Never watch this movie. Not even if you are drunk or higher than a kite. I'm not even sure if this movie is real.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as Zombieland was. After dropping you in the action right from the start the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs however come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombiekilling 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however good action good laughs and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to Shaun of the Dead which is nothing to be ashamed of but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much you'll get your money's worth. Well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead and since its release in '04 there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland however I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film I'm happy to say that Zombieland does just that.Unlike many comedies in recent memory in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer Zombieland is filled to the brim with laughoutloud moments thanks largely to the brilliant cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the main protagonist Columbus portraying that sense of vulnerability and awkwardness without becoming too Michael Ceralike. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also terrific as the sweet yet tough Wichita and the morematurethansheseems Little Rock respectively. The real standout performance though is Woody Harrelson as the Twinkielovin' zombiehatin' Tallahassee. Next to that of Woody Boyd on Cheers and Frasier this is definitely the best performance of his career. There's also a painfully hilarious cameo appearance about midway through the film that would be a crime to spoil. Suffice it to say this is  handsdown  the best cameo that I've ever seen in a film.The most surprising aspect of Zombieland to me is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately you feel invested in the story and the characters which  I think  is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.Zombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine comedic or otherwise. The  for the lack of a better word  quotable dialogue consistently hysterical tone and endearing characters all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught a sneak preview of Zombieland with a friend and was impressed to say the least.Zombieland has to have one of the flashiest openings in memory. There is no subtle build up. You are dropped right into Zombieland as Columbus Jesse Eisenberg begins listing the rules to survival. Of course each rule gives you a hysterical example of why the rule is in place. Anything that has been taboo for horror films at one time is met head on. I won't list each as not to spoil the movie but Zombieland has a unique ability to make almost anything seem comical. This includes the fact that for some reason it seems that every zombie in Zombieland has a blood belching problem. Literally every zombie has blood spewing from their mouth. This is captured best in the intro as you almost feel like you are supposed to have the 3D glasses in place.Columbus is funny enough with his phobias and geek lifestyle that proves to be what keeps him alive but it isn't until he meets Tallahassee Woody Harrelson that things really kick into gear. Harrelson seems to have been born for this role. He has more one liners than any character in recent memory. Each line is typically vulgar but even if offensive it is near impossible not to laugh. Let's face it if you are completely offended by language or blood then you aren't likely to be sitting with a crowd watching Zombieland in the first place.A little romance is thrown into the mix when Columbus and Tallahassee come up on Wichita Emma Stone and Little Rock Abigail Breslin. For a zombie comedy I thought Eisenberg and Stone actually had decent chemistry. Not that much time is dedicated to romance but what is there comes across as sincere and lets us watch as Columbus transitions from geek to hero. Even without the romance the girls are an important part of the chemistry of Zombieland. They help to even out the brawn and the brains between the four characters.Zombieland has a simple story. The guys are loners. Columbus with the simple mission to stay alive and Tallahassee with a never ending search for any and all of the remaining golden Twinkies left on the planet. The girls are sisters who are trying to get to an amusement park in CA where they believe or at least want to believe it is zombie free. A small part of the film feels like the movie Vacation with zombies. The comical trip with a destination which you can just feel isn't going to be what the characters hope for. Like Vacation it shows that the journey is far more important than the destination.The biggest moment of the film has to be the mystery cameo. I'm glad I didn't know who it was and I won't spoil it for anyone else. I will say that it was brilliantly written into the script. PERFECT! It really goes to show how much they focused on getting Zombieland to be a top notch flick that should go down as a horrorcomedy classic to remember. It will certainly fit alongside Shaun of the Dead in my movie collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombiethemed amusement park  and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers' Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style  sensibility.

	onyx:emotionText "The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombiethemed amusement park  and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers' Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style  sensibility.

	schema:reviewBody "I just was exiting the theater after seeing '9' which is also worth a look when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture but I'd say this exceeded my expectations which isn't to say masterpiece but it was certainly entertaining and at about 90 minutes didn't really overstay it's welcome. As you might expect for this genre it's quite gory so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed no make that a substantial amount of bloodshed  but perhaps I should add in a comic environment  there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. I'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie subgenre but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead in fact not very scary at all I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing clapping and cheering. Let's face it you know what's going to happen in this flick but I'm happy to say plot conventions and all this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it see it opening night  if I haven't made it clear enough already this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.".

	schema:headline " Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best";
	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis The entire world is hit with an apocalyptic infection that turns people into zombies once they have been bitten by an infected zombie. Columbus Jesse Eisenberg is a young geek who has a lot of phobias about almost everything from clowns to bathrooms to checking the back seat of cars. Being alone and scared of the outside world has kept him alive. His new fear is being eaten by zombies. To survive Columbus has begun making a long list of rules to survive. Each time he gives you one of his rules you see an example of his rule in action. He decides to go home to Columbus to see if his parents are still alive. Along the highway he meets Tallahassee Woody Harrelson a redneck zombie killer who loves Twinkies. They team up and head for Tallahassee. On the way they meet and join forces with two girls Wichita Emma Stone and Little Rock Abagail Breslin. They may be the last surviving people on earth and they must rely on each other to survive.My Comment Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best. You usually don't see a zombie movie as a comedy but you will like this one. Actually this isn't really a comedy it is more a funny horror movie because there is bloodshed in a comic situation. There is plenty of blood splattering plenty of killing and gore and even some nudity of a stripper zombie. The film delivers you four heroes that you can root for when the zombies come after them. You will begin to love the scenes with the rules of survival that Jesse Eisenberg explains to the audience in a background voice such as wearing your seatbelt or the doubletap rule after you shoot a zombie make sure he is dead by shooting him in the head again. Trust me this is not a wasted shot. Woody Harrelson's performance is terrific as a redneck zombie killer who misses his puppy Buck and must find a Twinkie at any cost. There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. I won't say his name but it is hilarious. There is one thing that I must say about this zombie movie that is not normally in zombie movies and that is the fact that once these zombies are infected they can run very fast. As a matter of fact that is rule number 1 be sure that you can outrun the zombies because the overweight and slow people were caught first by the zombies. There are some pretty funny scenes and you will laugh from beginning to end. Columbia Pictures Run Time 120 Rated R710".

In voiceover he gives us a quick rundown of his rules of survival and then demonstrates them when he's attacked by two zombies in a car park.On a deserted highway strewn with the detritus of the old world that once existed Columbus runs into the crazy but dumb Tallahassee the characters call themselves after the place they come from so they don't get too close to one another. Played by Woody Harrelson he clearly is having a great time with his role. Without his charm the film would really suffer as the younger actors don't bring a lot to the party.Later on they meet two doublecrossing sisters the older one played by a deepvoiced hugeeyed Lindsay Lohan lookalike the younger one played by Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin. These characters are so selfish meanspirited and ultimately stupid that it's hard to feel anything for them. The romance between Columbus and Wichita at the end feels forced and phoney.The cameo by Bill Murray is a welcome respite. The affection the filmmakers and other actors have for him and his death in it raise Murray to the level of national treasure. The world even at its end seems a much darker place without him.As everything that happens in the film follows the lead character's rules for survival to the letter there are no surprises. He seems to know everything in advance. The writers get so caught up in their own cleverness that they don't see the bigger picture of what they're doing. The zombies never really come close to turning the tables on the heroes and that kills any tension there might be even when they are vastly outnumbered and surrounded their lives are never really in any danger and they easily find a way out of any situation. The selfconscious humour and deafening rock soundtrack constantly remind you that nothing bad is going to happen to the heroes.Never as funny as Shaun of the Dead Harrelson's running Twinkie gag isn't really that funny to begin with and the payoff is a letdown never as intense as Dawn of the Dead it falls between the two stools. So it's a good movie not a great one. It's fun while it's on but never reaches the heights of George A. Romero's zombie flicks or 28 Days Later for that matter. There is apparently a sequel on the way hopefully it will be tighter and scarier than the original.".

Unfortunately though Zombieland is very far from the romzomcom it's emulating i.e. Shaun of the Dead. Shaun of the Dead had a great love and affection for this genre and played to it beautifully interweaving sharp comedy with drama. Zombieland attempts this but ends up being a teen road movie that just happens to be set after the zombie apocalypse and I did not want to see a teen road movie. Don't get me wrong there are some good moments and the film starts off quite promising. However after Columbus Eisenbergand Tallehasse Harrelson meet the two girls it's begins to lose it's shine. The real problem with this film though is the poor writing. For a start the two girls are instantly unlikeable and the sudden attraction Columbus has for Wichita seem tacked on. Tallahasee's search for Twinkie think thats how you spell it I'm British so they're not well known over here screams of smack you in the face product placement. Then there's the plot holes oh so many plot holes... 1  How did the girls manage to get past the zombies in the supermarket when they immediately noticed Columbus and Tallahasse? 2  Why did the girls hide in the back of the supermarket on the extreme off chance that someone not zombiefied would stumble upon them? 3  Why bother conning the guys out of their car and weapons when there's millions of cars and guns just lying around? 4  The amusement park was meant to be zombie free so why smash open the gate with the car to get in thereby paving the way for zombies to enter? 5  Since it's shown that zombies can easily climb why did the girls think a paltry 6 foot wooden fence surrounding the park would hold them back? 6  Correct me if I'm wrong but if you live in a world overrun with homicidal flesh eating zombies then surely you'd want to keep a low profile? Why then when you finally get to this supposed zombie free amusement park would you turn all the power on lighting the place up like a Christmas tree? 7  How did they manage to get on and off the boat ride without someone else to start and stop it? 8  Why go on the ride that shoots you straight up to avoid the zombies when you know it'll immediately come back down? 9  And finally who's running all the power stations? Everything seems to be working without any problem. You can watch TV pump petrol even start up an entire amusement park yet surely the power would be the first thing to go?In all the premise was interesting though not original and could probably have worked a lot better with some better writing and perhaps playing to the fact it's a coming of age road movie which just happens to be set after the zombie apocalypse.".

	schema:headline " The most fun i have had at the theatre in a long time";
	schema:reviewBody "I mean come on who doesn't think about what they would do if zombies took over the world. Its a fun yet serious question to think about. Most movies have it right by taking the serious side of things. But what if we take a video game approach and just run around killing everyone of them? Uh.......you can more than sign me up for this one. OK lets face the honest question.......if your some little prissy girl who does not like or does not appreciate zombie films.......then this is the wrong movie for you. This movie takes everything you have learned from all those movies and puts a comedic spin on it. I mean come on a zombie stripper wearing nipple tasles running in slow motion.....how could anyone not want to see that? The movie is very basic in its groundwork but excels in its humor and character drive. Woody is basically a zombie film buff's wet dream. A hoosier red neck who wants to just kill zombies for the rest of his life. Now i must admit towards the middle of the movie it almost felt like they weren't focusing on the whole zombie aspect that much........mainly because they were adding a little depth to each of the characters. But rest assured by the end it totally quenches your thirst. But through all the hilarious dialogue and funny little zombie killing sequences the best part of the movie was hands down the cameo. Now if you have not heard who it is by now im not going to say it........but it is almost genius and probably the best cameo ever created and i will stand by that 100. Trust me it is that funny. Bottom Line.......i know i love zombie movies and i might seem a little bias........but damnit this movie is easily the best comedy of the year. It was the perfect mix of humor and gore........not only that the story was pretty decent and very entertaining to watch unfold. This movie is seriously like a fun house at the carnival. It will easily be accepted by the zombie lover crowd and the general population. This movie is easily one of the 10 best i have seen so far this year. If your looking to have a good time at the theatre this movie will surely provide that.".

The film stars Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a Zombie apocalypse thrust together on a road trip in search of a fabled Zombieless sanctuary.As it stands now Zombieland is the most successful Zombie based film in history. Proving that there is still life no pun intended in the undead based comedy. Reese and Wernick have stated that the idea for Zombieland was milling around their heads in 2005 a year after Shaun Of the Dead had made such a joyous appearance on the horrorcom circuit. You get the feeling that the guys desperately wanted an American version to rival the British torch bearer. They got it.Where Zombieland differs greatly from Shaun is that it unashamedly lives in a cartoon fantasy world. It blasts right out of the blocks with a montage sequence of death dismemberment crash bangs and wallops and never lets up on its carefree abandon approach. And hooray to that. In fact the film only pauses for breath for a short time at the midpoint and even then it's to slot in one of the best ever cameo performances to grace a comedy. Away from the tricks and smart gimmicks that gloriously light up the narrative the rules baby are awesome Zombieland works so well because of its four characters.This maybe a Zombie movie and what Zombies they are too but this is about four likable human beings asking us to invest some time with them as they surge from one situation to the next. Something we are only too glad to do. Be it Harrelson never better laying waste to any number of the undead or Eissenberg hello there little Woody Allen offering up witticisms that hide a lonely heart facade these characters prove to have depth. Yes we could possibly argue that both Stone and Breslin spunky  perky respectively deserve more screen time hell they sure earn it but as a foursome they combine to make one of the brightest buddy buddybuddy buddy movies out there.It's plot lite and unlike Shaun it has no great peril sequences to fully form the horror aspects of it. But it's so funny and awash with carefree charm we have no right to dwell too long on its tiny faults. One of the best crowdpleaser's of 2009 and proof positive that an apocalypse really can be quite fun after all. 8.510".

He has a set of rules for survival a nice device but none of the rules are exactly hilarious.We then meet our second onedimensional character roughneck with barely concealed warm heart and our first nonedimensional character feisty girl with no logical motivation for anything she does other than to present a series of romantic challenges for her one dimensional male admirer. SPOILER  Hence the two cardboard men enter a shop looking to help reinforce the film's product placement deal. They kill three zombies in inexplicably unnecessary ways then enter a back room to find two girls how have they evaded the zombies? waiting for real people how did they know the only other two people in America would be passing by? so they can trick them why? and steal their car why when there are millions of cars? and guns ditto and drive off in the opposite direction.Then they lay another trap for the guys how did they know they'd change direction from east to west and pass by in that direction down that country road at that time? steal their car again why when they have one already? kidnap them instead of leaving them behind why? why? why? why? and then again why?. Ad absurdum ad infinitum.The middle hour of the film made no attempt to interrupt the enveloping boredom. With Bill Murray this is the first time I've seen an actor introduced into a film exactly as if he were a piece of product placement along with ample cringeworthy toadying. It felt as if the studio had said the script's not long enough and we need an extra 25 pages. Bill Murray owes us a favour so you can have him for an afternoon if you like. But you only have an hour to write it. They remark on how much he looks like Eddie Van Halen which is bizarre because he clearly looks like Michael Jackson. But maybe they thought referencing Jackson would have felt too much like introducing a joke into the film.The final act was merely a bland shoot'emup computer game but without the intellectual dimension.The role the zombies play in this film is as an uninteresting unthreatening MacGuffin required to cause occasional distractions from what is in essence the lamest love story between two of the least interesting characters in modern film.It's an insult to America to refer to Zombieland as an American Shaun of the Dead a film which incidentally has an IMDb rating of just 7.8 against Zombieland's 8.4. Which is rather like Star Wars rating 7.8 against Plan 9 from Outer Space rating 8.4.1 out of 10 because 0 isn't an option.".

	schema:headline " I wanted to like this movie more than I did...";
	schema:reviewBody "I just might be one of the biggest end of population movie fans on Earth. Any movie dealing with an apocalypse...comedy horror thriller etc...automatically starts out with 6 on my IMDb voting list. You can only go up from there. I love the genre so much I even gave The Postman a 9! To get stuck at a 6 means it was just too flawed. The movie which Zombieland is most compared to Shaun of the Dead I gave a 9 vote.First of all I understand you need to suspend reality before you even step in the theater when you watch a zombie movie. But the stupidity of some of the actions was beyond retarded. I'll explain more later.Zombieland has it's moments. It looked great on the bigscreen...you could tell a lot of time went into the appearance. The deaths were done very well especially a scene where a lady is thrown from her car and her face bounces and drags along the pavement leaving a stream of blood. Woody Harrelson was great as usual but the big kudos goes to supporting actress Emma Stone who was excellent. This changes all the time but after seeing 'Zombieland' I now want to plow Emma Stone more than any other girl on the planet! She's hotter than a Mexican chili pepper in the middle of July! If I had the option of marrying her before I ever met her my answer would be a resounding Yes!...and I'm not the marrying type to say the least! But the bad clearly outweighs the good. The lead actor Jessie Eisenberg was annoying at best and downright terrible at worst. He's no Marlon Brando that's for sure. I can't recall one thing he said or did that I laughed at. For a comedy to get zero laughs out of the main actor is a joke in itself. Then there was a completely shameless subplot revolving around Woody Harrelson's love for a Hostess product Twinkies. They might as well have just stopped the movie halfway through and went to a Hostess commercial. At one point Woody and Jessie find a Hostess truck crashed into a ravine. Upon opening it one would think there would be BOXES of Snoballs or Twinkies there...but what's there? Individually wrapped Snoballs fall out of the truck like it was packed to the roof with them! Um I think even a 13yearold kid knows food items aren't shipped individually like that. Product placement needs to be done a bit more subtle to be effective otherwise it just blatantly looks like a moneygrab which it was. Uggghhh.Perhaps the biggest laugh and the biggest disappointment came during the same segment. Bill Murray's cameo. I won't rehash the laugh but the scene began with something beyond implausible. Murray as a joke I guess decides to  not once but twice  surprise the pairs of armed guests by pretending to be a zombie. Perhaps the 1 thing I wouldn't do during a zombie attack is surprise somebody who's carrying a machine gun! And even after he surprised the first pair of people and barely escaped with his life all 3 of them had no problem with Murray pulling the same joke on the second pair of armed people. Not surprisingly Murray gets shot. Even Stevie Wonder could tell that was coming. Perhaps the 2nd biggest thing I wouldn't do knowing the zombies were attracted to lights and sounds is turn on the power at an amusement park right at dusk! How unbelievably corny. Also in some scenes the zombies are 28 Days Later style FAST and ferocious. In other scenes you could be crippled and still get away with relative ease. Plus how was electricity even available after 2 months of no people running the power plant?! There are many things like that which you just shake your head at. Gas is never mentioned. All cars have the keys in them already. Seatbelts somehow stop you from getting even a headache after a highspeed headon collision much less a scratch. Twinkies are somehow EXTREMELY hard to find. Grocery stores look pristine like they are ready to go all poweredup and everything. People con you out of your car and guns twice even though cars and guns are easy to come by. Be prepared to roll your eyes a couple dozen times.Finally I simply can't recommend this movie. I love the genre but this one was just too goofy. The love scenes were fake and implausible. I would have to think Emma Stone would be more attracted to Harrelson over the complete and utter dork they made Einsberg out to be. And Harrelson attempting to cry and bring some drama to the movie was awful and out of place. It's a comedy about zombies people  not all movies need the love interest and drama! Big mistake to try to cram those two things in.I wanted to like the movie I love the genre...but I just can't recommend it.Thanks for reading! JD".

	onyx:emotionText "I just might be one of the biggest end of population movie fans on Earth. Any movie dealing with an apocalypse...comedy horror thriller etc...automatically starts out with 6 on my IMDb voting list. You can only go up from there. I love the genre so much I even gave The Postman a 9! To get stuck at a 6 means it was just too flawed. The movie which Zombieland is most compared to Shaun of the Dead I gave a 9 vote.First of all I understand you need to suspend reality before you even step in the theater when you watch a zombie movie. But the stupidity of some of the actions was beyond retarded. I'll explain more later.Zombieland has it's moments. It looked great on the bigscreen...you could tell a lot of time went into the appearance. The deaths were done very well especially a scene where a lady is thrown from her car and her face bounces and drags along the pavement leaving a stream of blood. Woody Harrelson was great as usual but the big kudos goes to supporting actress Emma Stone who was excellent. This changes all the time but after seeing 'Zombieland' I now want to plow Emma Stone more than any other girl on the planet! She's hotter than a Mexican chili pepper in the middle of July! If I had the option of marrying her before I ever met her my answer would be a resounding Yes!...and I'm not the marrying type to say the least! But the bad clearly outweighs the good. The lead actor Jessie Eisenberg was annoying at best and downright terrible at worst. He's no Marlon Brando that's for sure. I can't recall one thing he said or did that I laughed at. For a comedy to get zero laughs out of the main actor is a joke in itself. Then there was a completely shameless subplot revolving around Woody Harrelson's love for a Hostess product Twinkies. They might as well have just stopped the movie halfway through and went to a Hostess commercial. At one point Woody and Jessie find a Hostess truck crashed into a ravine. Upon opening it one would think there would be BOXES of Snoballs or Twinkies there...but what's there? Individually wrapped Snoballs fall out of the truck like it was packed to the roof with them!

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe all of the acclaim that this movie is receiving! The movie is aesthetically shallow lacks an original plot and characters and although being advertised as a comedy fails to deliver much laughoutloud humour. Zombieland is generic in all accounts a tool of Hollywood for attracting teenage male viewers to the cinema with zombies and gore and female viewers with a mediocre romance.Like the movie as a whole Zombieland's cinematography is shoddy at best. It tries to parody the intense camera work prevalent in Romero's work but with a toopolished look and an overuse of slow motion probably meant to be funny. It's like watching dawn of the dead if the cinematographer were the same guy that did the 40 yearold virgin. Zombieland which in many ways tries to be America's answer to Shaun of the Dead fails to deliver visually. Whereas the latter juxtaposed hilarious action with a grim washedout physical atmosphere for comedic effect Zombieland's camera work is too clean to shiny it simply lacks flavor like the whole of the movie.I have come to the conclusion that Zombieland is not a comedy but a romance containing a few comedic scenes. As many have already said the main funny parts are advertised in the trailer. The scene where Columbus's neighbor turns into a zombie as she and him are sitting on a couch together is an exception to this as it is actually funny. Overall concerning genre Zombieland is a romantic family values movie. Awkward nerdy boy Columbus meets rebellious misandrist Wichita and after much mistrust stupidity and heroics rebellious misandrist decides to stop being a bitch to awkward boy and stay with him illustrating the genesis of one of films most touching sadistmasochist relationships sarcasm.The film is advertised as a comedy but turns out to be a familyvalues romance on the plane of Disney  ZOMBIES. The most generic monster  an extremely generic plot apparently equals profit. Not surprising in an age where directors like Michael Bay have a career but I digress.There are two good things about this film one is twinkie loving gun toting Talahassee the most finely illustrated if not the only finely illustrated character in the whole movie the other is Bill Murray. At first glance Talahassee is a toughasnails barbarian with deep reservations about getting involved with people for fear of losing them to the zombies. As the movie progresses we learn that he is on a quest for that sweet snack which he most adores a twinkie. He finally finds his twinkie at the end of the movie reinforcing the theme of completion. We also learn that the reason Talahassee fears connecting with people because of the loss of his son. He resolves this loss by becoming a fatherfigure to Wichita's sister who lacks parents. Talahassee is a dynamic and consistently funny character and works wonderfully as a foil to reserved Columbus. Too bad he was in this movie. Bill Murray needs no explanation he's Bill Murray.Zombieland is a masterpiece of Hollywood economics. It is a combination of multiple genres targeting at least two large demographics males between the ages of 10 and 30 and females between the ages of 10 and 30. The presence of zombies gore and failed badassery are supposed to attract the males. The strong albeit bitchy female character and the romantic plot are intended for the female demographic. The attempt at comedy is mostly a failure but is intended to target the general comedyloving populace. The film was arguably cheap to produce with only a handful of speaking characters a few sets most of the film takes place in outdoor locations one Bill Murray and zombie effects. The return is of course huge partly because of false advertising. There is nothing special about this movie. Combine your average Superbad ripoff movie with Dawn of the Dead and there you go copy add paste the new Hollywood method for making money.Don't waste 10 dollars on Zombieland wait till you can rent it. In the meantime if you want to see Zombies and laugh gather some of your buddies and watch Zombi 3.On a scale of A to Z I give this movie an M".

Its gory and disgusting but most of all its terrific fun with just the right mix of violence and offkilter comedy.Jesse Eisenberg plays a young man named Columbus because thats where hes heading across the wasteland that is the middle US. Columbus is scared of just about everything clowns the cloths people use to wipe down tables bathrooms you name it. A hot apartment neighbor comes down with this hot new disease that all the cool kids dont want to have and before you know it hes killed her well rekilled and is on the run fleeing zombies and making up a long list of rules of how to survive in the eponymous new land. Near the beginning of our story he meets up with a man he calls Tallahassee Woody Harrelson whos uh on his way to Tallahassee and they in turn meet with a couple of con girls Abagail Breslin and Emma Stone.Comparisons to Shaun of the Dead are somewhat apt as both movies are comedic takes on a horror subgenre and director Ruben Fleischer was influenced by the Simon PeggNick Frost movie. But. Zombieland is both funnier and more sincere its not a slapstick comedy and its not really a horror film as Shaun of the Dead was. In fact its sort of quirky and genreless.There were a LOT of laughoutloud moments for me in this movie and I think a chief reason it all gels is that the leads are so perfectly cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the protagonist the vulnerable hero and Harrelson is a real hoot as the MadMaxlike or maybe Ash from Evil Dead gentle psycho who desires nothing more than to waste zombies and find one just one Twinkie. Yes I said Twinkie! I also really liked Abagail Breslin as the moppet Little Rock. Its always tough for child actors to make the transition into moreadult roles but shes up to the task here. Emma Stone is tough and sweet as her sisterly counterpart.Theres a cameo thatll surely surprise you  and whats more it really works. The actor  no spoilers here!  really sells the role. Lets just say that he plays himself. Did I mention that the main characters are headed to California and that basically everyone else in the world is either dead or a zombie? Everyone? You dont often hear people applaud during a movie but applaud we did at a couple key moments. The final scene in an amusement park is witty and lighthearted at least as lighthearted as mowing down zombies with machine guns can be.Now granted theres plenty of blood splattering plenty of gore plenty of cursing and even some nudity. And yes its even gratuitous. But not for a zombie movie. For a zombie movie those things are sort of underplayed a little bit at least in the true horror sense  theyre played much more for chuckles than anything else. If anything Zombieland is a movie that dares you to take it seriously just so it can pull the rug out from under you and we can all laugh. Its an offbeat look at an overused genre that cranks out the guts and guffaws in equal lethal doses.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Batman v Superman I wanted to go back and watch a movie where I was impressed with Jesse Eisenberg. Zombieland is one of my favourites so it was an easy choice. They continue to talk about a Zombieland sequel today even though it's been years since the original has been released. I'd like to think that's how big of an impact it made it was a box office success but it didn't go over like gangbusters. It's probably too late for a sequel with the entire cast moving on and becoming industry headliners but it's okay though because we'll always have this one.Minor Spoilers Ahead Our main character is Columbus Jesse Eisenberg since no one uses their real names in Zombieland. We get a brief window into the world as it is now completely invaded by zombies. Columbus takes us through some of his rules on how he survived like 1 cardio 2 double tap 3 beware of bathrooms and 4 seat belts. We then join him in present day in Garland Texas and he makes his escape utilizing those same rules he's far from a zombie killing badass though he mostly succeeds through discipline and some luck. He reveals that he's trying to get back to Ohio to see his family. The odds aren't in his favour though most of the world has been wiped out. He reveals that he's always been a loner but he actually misses seeing people around. Someone then rolls up in a Cadillac Escalade with a large number 3 painted on the side. The draw their guns on each other but Columbus holds out his thumb and Tallahassee Woody Harrelson offers him a ride. They clearly don't gel personality wise with Tallahassee being more of an unhinged zombie killing machine and Columbus is a nervous and cautious kind of guy. But they decide to stick together at least for the time being.Most zombie related programming is horror related. Zombieland is less a horror film and more of a dark action comedy. One of the things that makes it so memorable is that it's so funny. It was written by the cowriters of Deadpool another excellent dark action comedy and although the actorsactresses bring so much to the movie one of the biggest stars is the actual script itself. We see the movie through Columbus' eyes as he travels around with 3 badass zombie killers and his interpretation of the events in the movie is so ridiculous by contrast it's hilarious. Between the action and the comedy the movie rarely slows down if at all and with a short run time it doesn't overstay it's welcome either. There's nothing wrong with a movie being long if it has enough material but there's something to be said for accomplishing what you want to get done and leaving before people get tired of it.Looking at the 4 main characters of the cast you'll easily recognize them as almost all of them populate the A list. At this time Jesse and Emma were both up and coming talents and this movie helped cement them. Jesse really stepped out of Michael Cera's shadow with a great comedic performance and Emma showed that how multitalented she can be. She was really funny in Zombieland and she hit the more serious notes as well. This was a good movie for Abigail Breslin to do. It helped her transition out of being a child star and while she was still a kid in this film she more than held her own. Lastly Woody was already famous so while I can't credit his success to this movie this is easily the funniest I've ever seen him be in a movie. In an era of the Walking Dead where you have completely serious zombie killers his character was more laid back and enjoyed channelling his internal pain into brutally killing the undead. Woody makes his character somebody you want to follow and it's always fun to see how he's going to deal with the zombies in the next scene whether he's swinging a banjo or using hedge clippers.One of the really unique things this movie brings is that it was made relatively cheap but it's got some really cool visual tricks. Things like the actually lettering for Columbus' rules popping up and interacting with the environment like the letters moving when limber up appears. It's not completely new but they use it so well. The action is hard and brutal they also find ways to get some interesting shots there's lots of slow motion and they work the comedy into the action pretty organically. The zombies look disgusting in a good way and they found a way to put a different spin on them. It's not on the level of a movie that had 100s of millions in its budget but it's still well done and it could easily pass for having twice the budget it did.I've watched this movie many times over and it is still super entertaining every time I put it on. It wouldn't be in my top 10 all time but it wouldn't be far outside it. It delivers on all fronts and it's like I said in the opening if we ultimately don't get the sequel that's okay I'll enjoy the perfectly wrapped gift this movie is.".

	onyx:emotionText "After Batman v Superman I wanted to go back and watch a movie where I was impressed with Jesse Eisenberg. Zombieland is one of my favourites so it was an easy choice. They continue to talk about a Zombieland sequel today even though it's been years since the original has been released. I'd like to think that's how big of an impact it made it was a box office success but it didn't go over like gangbusters. It's probably too late for a sequel with the entire cast moving on and becoming industry headliners but it's okay though because we'll always have this one.Minor Spoilers Ahead Our main character is Columbus Jesse Eisenberg since no one uses their real names in Zombieland. We get a brief window into the world as it is now completely invaded by zombies. Columbus takes us through some of his rules on how he survived like 1 cardio 2 double tap 3 beware of bathrooms and 4 seat belts. We then join him in present day in Garland Texas and he makes his escape utilizing those same rules he's far from a zombie killing badass though he mostly succeeds through discipline and some luck. He reveals that he's trying to get back to Ohio to see his family. The odds aren't in his favour though most of the world has been wiped out. He reveals that he's always been a loner but he actually misses seeing people around. Someone then rolls up in a Cadillac Escalade with a large number 3 painted on the side. The draw their guns on each other but Columbus holds out his thumb and Tallahassee Woody Harrelson offers him a ride. They clearly don't gel personality wise with Tallahassee being more of an unhinged zombie killing machine and Columbus is a nervous and cautious kind of guy. But they decide to stick together at least for the time being.Most zombie related programming is horror related. Zombieland is less a horror film and more of a dark action comedy. One of the things that makes it so memorable is that it's so funny. It was written by the cowriters of Deadpool another excellent dark action comedy and although the actorsactresses bring so much to the movie one of the biggest stars is the actual script itself. We see the movie through Columbus' eyes as he travels around with 3 badass zombie killers and his interpretation of the events in the movie is so ridiculous by contrast it's hilarious. Between the action and the comedy the movie rarely slows down if at all and with a short run time it doesn't overstay it's welcome either. There's nothing wrong with a movie being long if it has enough material but there's something to be said for accomplishing what you want to get done and leaving before people get tired of it.Looking at the 4 main characters of the cast you'll easily recognize them as almost all of them populate the A list. At this time Jesse and Emma were both up and coming talents and this movie helped cement them. Jesse really stepped out of Michael Cera's shadow with a great comedic performance and Emma showed that how multitalented she can be. She was really funny in Zombieland and she hit the more serious notes as well. This was a good movie for Abigail Breslin to do. It helped her transition out of being a child star and while she was still a kid in this film she more than held her own. Lastly Woody was already famous so while I can't credit his success to this movie this is easily the funniest I've ever seen him be in a movie. In an era of the Walking Dead where you have completely serious zombie killers his character was more laid back and enjoyed channelling his internal pain into brutally killing the undead.

It was a piece of utter trash with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. When there is the wonderful Shaun of the Dead out there why would anyone even try to spoof the genre when it was done so expertly already.Everything that was terrific about Shawn of the Dead is missing from Zombieland. Every single gag in Zombieland has been done before done better and to much better effect. The popup list was funny once or twice  but was tedious and stupid as it went on and on throughout the film. The geeky kid as the lead has zero presence and is a blank as an actor. Woody Harrelson merely reprised his role from that bad Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. The productplacement Hostess Twinkie thing was pathetic. The female actresses were pretty terrible but with a script like that what chance did they have? The gore of the Zombies wasn't even well done and the filmmakers couldn't seem to decide between slow dumb zombies and fast mean cunning Zombies the former is always better and scarier.What a nothing of film. It wasn't worth even a dollar as a rental. Garbage. And a true testament to how far standards of taste have fallen as GenX and GenY vacuousness pervades the zeitgeist of the art world.Lastly the Bill Murray cameo was an utter waste. By showing the audience the Warhol painting of Murray prior to seeing him they TOOK AWAY HIS INTRODUCTION. Morons! These filmmakers obviously know nothing about storytelling. If there had been cameo after cameo or the Bill Murray subplot had been more of a central focus of the story this film would have had a chance but he was just like the creamy filling in a Twinkie  totally without nutrient value.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zona Zamfirova was shown at a special screening in Toronto in 2003. There are some bugs to work out my main pet peeve being the subtitles. I have yet to see a well subtitled film from anywhere in the Balkans and although using unusual contractions in English words may be a reflection of the particular dialect of the setting if you don't speak the language which you don't because you're reading the subtitles right? then you don't appreciate it. Frankly even for people who speak literary Serbian the dialect is a stumper... the DVD even gives you nondialect Serbian subtitles which are good. Seeing the film made me go back to read the book by Stevan Sremac once again. It is very true to the book. Zona is beautiful and she is initially snobby  it's a little much to compare her to Paris Hilton but I think we've all met Zona in high school. If you remember that film and stage require you to 'suspend your disbelief' then you forget that the actress isn't quite 18 and that the lead actor isn't '90210 Pretty' if you read more literature from the period and look at some of the art the male lead conforms to all expectations. You are willing to overlook these things in order to immerse yourself in the visual beauty of the film. The director was fortunate to be able to film in some historic buildings and locations and the details are dead on. The costumes are correct down to the last stitch sorry about Zona wearing red but check the book.... the hills and vineyards and cobblestone streets  it all draws you in if you let it. Sometimes it's best to just enjoy a movie for what it is  an entertaining escape.".

	schema:reviewBody "this is a lovely portrait of the patriarchal balkan society of ottoman times! it is set in late 1880s some 10 years after Serbia acquired the Nis area but European modernity hasn't quite come yet! or a myth about it. beautiful myth of the festivity and colourfulness of the bygone times a myth that every people on earth needs! I am so glad that we also acquired one and so well made the dialogue the set the costumes the soundtrack! and done true to our own spirit the dialogue the body language!!!! Indeed being an internationally overlooked region has this among its advantages  we didn't have Hollywood making our myths! cf. Braveheart for the Scottish and so many other examplesand I say we because this portrait will easily be recognised as own in any of the Balkan countries! When I was showing it to a friend from far off Cyprus and she exclaimed in surprise oh! your countries are really like this? but it looks the same as us!!!. yes unfortunately the walls of hot and cold war have been impenetrable ever since those 1880s until very recently! today we have the first chances to rediscover our neighbours.I think bulgarians will especially enjoy listening to the language. It is much lighter to understand for the unaccustomed than standard Serbian yet familiar words are delivered with a charming softening of the consonants and the quincetaste intonation patterns of the Serbian language! some local commentators mentioned that the dialect is not performed very well by the nonnative to the area actors.Heh almost everyone discusses language! Indeed as colourful as is the visual twice as much is the beauty of expression! This is typical for the XIX. century Balkans and for our national classics of literature. Unfortunately it is not humanly possible to translate but still I warmly recommend Zona Zamfirova to foreigners! Even if you miss on everything else the brave eyeflirt between the two young and the excited help of their friends for the good of love will make you remember your own first 'falling in love' and it will have your heart beat!PS I speak of myths but the film is based on a novel of the time looks like a satire on the then contemporary patriarchal society? and I am very excited to read it soon!".

	onyx:emotionText "this is a lovely portrait of the patriarchal balkan society of ottoman times! it is set in late 1880s some 10 years after Serbia acquired the Nis area but European modernity hasn't quite come yet! or a myth about it. beautiful myth of the festivity and colourfulness of the bygone times a myth that every people on earth needs! I am so glad that we also acquired one and so well made the dialogue the set the costumes the soundtrack! and done true to our own spirit the dialogue the body language!!!! Indeed being an internationally overlooked region has this among its advantages  we didn't have Hollywood making our myths! cf. Braveheart for the Scottish and so many other examplesand I say we because this portrait will easily be recognised as own in any of the Balkan countries! When I was showing it to a friend from far off Cyprus and she exclaimed in surprise oh! your countries are really like this? but it looks the same as us!!!. yes unfortunately the walls of hot and cold war have been impenetrable ever since those 1880s until very recently! today we have the first chances to rediscover our neighbours.I think bulgarians will especially enjoy listening to the language. It is much lighter to understand for the unaccustomed than standard Serbian yet familiar words are delivered with a charming softening of the consonants and the quincetaste intonation patterns of the Serbian language! some local commentators mentioned that the dialect is not performed very well by the nonnative to the area actors.Heh almost everyone discusses language!

This is not a documentary movie this is a feel good movie and any idiot that cannot see this should not comment and have such strong opinion about anything in their sad and pitiful lives. Director Sotra great job keep up the good work. Actors are great interpreting time and place but that is the secondary to other points. Film shows and celebrates the tolerance between people eg. Czechoslovakian Maestro that despite not understanding him he is integral part of the community. The songs are well played and costumes are elegant. Not to mention that almost everyone including the supporting extras are drop dead attractive. The movie depicts warmth and humility of a small community where they know to accept good and bad in people. At the end of the day they are all forgiven and a nice story is here to stay. There are so may nice human points in the movie that only requires closer scrutiny of watching it several times over. I would strongly recommend this film.".

It is about two young people who fall in love but their love is not possible because of many differences first social and the a few family disputes. But in the end the love wins. Thing that makes this movie special is it's cultural presentation of Serbish culture and customs. Music is one of the most significant factors of this movie. Connection of the future and the past is thing that make the music so special. Although this movie is simple and very light it is one of the best movies made in these territories in post war period. It is one of rare movies that has nonwar thematic. It is not ruined by typical national hate and disputes. I believe that first Sremac and then Sotra managed to create our Romeo and Juliet in characters of Mane and Zona. Great performances by leading and other actors and many others mentioned factors created a little master peace that can present Serbs in new light in the world. Young leading actors Mr. Cetkovic and Miss Radivojevic were great in performing their roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I came across this film entirely by chance while changing the channels on my TV. I had absolutely no idea that this is in fact a film classic of Serbian cinema I don't know how I have missed a film like this for such a long time. In my opinion the best test as to whether a film is good or bad is to simply give the viewers a remote control in their hands and see whether they still choose to continue watching it. Well Zona Zamfirova was one of those rare films that immediately grabbed my attention. Every minute of this film is saturated with the tender sense of beauty and passion of its creators. I watched it four days ago and since then I haven't been able to stop thinking about it The music of the film is mesmerizing! I like exactly this kind of Balkan music  with slightly modernistic interpretation of traditional folk tunes which keeps the spirit and the beauty of the original prototype. The music is very emotional and matches and supports perfectly the vision of the film. The script and the directing are superb. The whole film is done in retro style. The actors deliberately overact a little bit  as a nod to the way the actors acted in theatre productions at the beginning of last century. Frankly speaking this is the best way to do this story. If you make the actors act in a totally realistic way following the principles of method acting the film would look flat and unconvincing. You have to keep the acting a little exaggerated in order to create this sense of fairytalelike story that has happened a long time ago. The camera work is in perfect harmony with this notion. The film is beautifully shot and is edited skillfully. The camera often zooms in on details from the everyday life of the people which gives richness to the background and to the story. All the scenes are kept fairly short and are pieced together in such a way that the story flows effortlessly and beautifully just like the music and the songs. The characters are well constructed and acted  they represent a glorious depiction of women that are full of feminine energy and men that are totally in touch with their masculine nature. This creates electric polarity between the characters and is very appealing to watch. The film overflows with joy and happiness. If you have watched the film of Kenneth Branagh Much Ado About Nothing you will certainly remember the bath scene. The public bath the hamam scene in Zona Zamfirova and in fact the whole film is filled with exactly the same energy joy and sex appeal. I did see some weak points in the film  mainly the occasional fakelooking sets and too clean and sleek costumes but I did not find this a real drawback because the film does not pretend to be a fully realistic one. It rather gives the viewer a similar sense that you get in a theatre hall  you know that this cardboard castle on the stage is not a real castle and the man with the crown is not a real king but you somehow ignore this fact and believe that this IS a castle and this IS a king. In conclusion I think that this is a superb film done by a very skillful team of people all of whom have an eye an ear and a heart for the beautiful and the meaningful. This film is a true celebration of life!".

I had absolutely no idea that this is in fact a film classic of Serbian cinema I don't know how I have missed a film like this for such a long time. In my opinion the best test as to whether a film is good or bad is to simply give the viewers a remote control in their hands and see whether they still choose to continue watching it. Well Zona Zamfirova was one of those rare films that immediately grabbed my attention. Every minute of this film is saturated with the tender sense of beauty and passion of its creators.

He cannot take the advantages of wide screen! He tried to give an atmosphere of 19th century Serbia but I believe he managed it only partially. Although he had quite a high budget it gave an appearance of a TV series! He had a set of excellent Serbian actors but the script made them look silly! It was hard to sit in cinema for 2 hours and watch this movie. At home you can watch it while you make lunch or read some magazine. Otherwise not recommended!".

ZONA ZAMFIROVA tells the story of Zona finding her husband.As the husbandseeking unfolds Zona is 17 or 18 years old.  However the actress playing Zona is 23 and looks even older.  We are asked to believe that Zona is the most beautiful girl in all the province.  Unfortunately Zona looks slightly more geeky than sexy.  Zona looks slightly more nerdy than beautiful.

Zona is from the richest family in the province and Zona knows it!  Zona is the Paris Hilton of her day. During the first half of the film it seems we viewers are being guided to dislike Zona and wish for her downfall.  But ZONA ZAMFIROVA is meant to be a conventional love story not a character study about a snob failing at love.We are asked to believe that the guy Zona is chasing Mane is the most handsome man in the province.  However Mane looks to be a clone of the nerdy actor who was in that nasal spray commercial all throughout the 1970's.  Yes Mane and Zona appear to be an OK match but they should go about mating with 100 times less arrogance... Please!The English subtitles are presented with lots and lots of odd contractions...

	schema:reviewBody "Zoo is probably as tasteful a movie as can be given its bestial subject. For those of you who aren't aware there's a small population of the world who prefer the love of an animalboth mentally and physicallyover the love of a human. This film stylistically recreates the life and death of one horse lover Mr. Hands and his pack of animal molesting friends during one of many meetings and BBQ's in a small town near Seattle. Mr. Hands died from internal injuries caused by the numerous and repetitive thrusting of the enlarged member of a stallion into his anus.The film is tasteful because it's not sleazy. In this respect it's almost worse on the audience because it humanizes these socalled animal lovers. What you'd think would be more like a shockumentary more than anything else really becomes a shallow dissection of a zoophile's playful mind. It's certainly not psychological nor really indepth but its shallowness really makes it that much more grim.As I watched the film I felt like a voyeur peering into the lives of ordinary human beings doing absolutely bizarre and reprehensible thingsand they just talked about it as if it were as benign and workaday as eating a bowl of cereal or taking the dog for a ride insert pun here. Yet much like a pedophile talking about his love for children these zoophile's innocently and sincerely spoke about their love for animals.Initially concerned about the content of the film I left the theater without witnessing the exploitation or mockery of bestiality nor did I see anything graphic or overtly sexual. I did leave the theater a little sickened however because I didn't loathe Mr. Hands or his friends. In fact I somehow sympathized with their pitiful plight.".

Suddenly the horse thrusts violently into the man and ruptures his colon. He died several hours later of internal bleeding. The man was part of a Seattlebased group of zoophiles who met occasionally in a nonjudgemental environment where they would discuss and indulge in their fetish for animal love. Robinson Devor's examination of this group uses audio recordings oncamera interviews and actors to recreate the events that led up to the death of Mr. Hands a father of one and employee of Boeing the aircraft manufacturer. What's so amazing about this doc is the cinematography by Sean Kirby and the brilliant score by Paul Mathew Moore. Devor uses these powerful elements to create a deliberately discomforting vibe to accompany his always interesting revelations. Although the director scoots around the precise details of the Mr. Hands incident he packs his film with fascinating detail and evenhanded debate. The film explores what zoophilia animal love is and avoids demonizing its subjects. Although I found the recent British TV doco Animal Passions also reviewed a more thorough exploration of this incendiary subject with unbelievable oncamera interviews Zoo is effective for the atmosphere and sense of time and place it creates. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Eerily beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "Zoo is not a docudrama about caging animals but about having sex with them. The film directed by Robinson Devor comes out of an incident in 2005 in Enumclaw Washington a rural community 45 miles southeast of Seattle in which a Boeing engineer died as a result of a perforated colon after having anal intercourse with an Arabian stallion. Known only as Mr. Hands in the film the deceased man was a divorced father of a young son with a top level job who used his weekends as an escape from a suffocating life style. Since Washington law at the time allowed sex with animals no one was charged with a crime.While few object to depriving animals of their freedom in zoos or sending them to slaughterhouses to be ground up for hamburgers the thought of men having sex with animals stirs up reservoirs of righteous indignation and the incident became fodder for the media and Internet message boards which approached it with typical scorn and ridicule. Devor uses a combination of audio interviews with actual participants and reenactments from actor standins to attempt to shed some light on what actually happened. The film delivers neither judgment of the practice nor evaluation of the psychology behind it but simply raises the question whether zoophilia is simply another form of sexual orientation or whether it constitutes abuse of a being incapable of giving consent.Shot in muted colors Zoo has a lyrical and poetic style with a moving sound track that gives the film an air of something forbidden but also something eerily beautiful. Bringing a taboo subject out of the darkness and subjecting it to some light the film allows us to reexamine our preconceived notions about a practice that has in fact been going on since Ancient Greece. Opening with an interview with Coyote a coal miner from Virginia who came to Washington to meet like minded friends the film examines the phenomenon of the zoophile community a group of isolated individuals where such appetites are shared. The men gather at all night parties talk about their love for animals and engage in an activity they consider natural but which the rest of the world frowns upon. After he was identified as a participant one man asks how he could be a good man yesterday and a bad man today but the question remains unanswered.We hear the voices of some of the members of the group but only Jenny Edwards of the organization Hope for Horses speaks directly to the camera. While the thrust of her remarks are humane her participation in a dramatization of the gelding of the horse involved is disturbing and is certainly done without the horses consent. Zoo neither endorses sex with animals nor condemns it but simply empathizes with the humanity of the participants who for one reason or another prefer anonymous sex as Richard Gere put it in Pretty Woman without all the emotional hassles of relationships. By doing so the issue is removed from the level of abstraction and the death is made heartbreakingly real.".

They love the way you can see all those powerful muscles on display working in tangent to create such a gracious majestic stride. They love the affectionate nature of these beasts as they nuzzle up to you and blow satisfied gusts of hot air from their nostrils. They love to put their hands against a stallion's testicles and feel the sensual heat emanating from those glorious globes. Most of all they love all that feral energy when there's a two foot horsecock jackhammering away at their insides sending waves of sexual bliss through every part of their bod... Heeeey... Wait a second. This isn't about animal lovers. It's about perverts! Well that should make for a much more interesting doco right? Eh afraid not.First up this movie looks and sounds amazing. It's loaded with beautifully constructed imagery and evocative music so it's quite a feast for the senses. But that's not enough to make a good documentary. There's a lot of voiceover work from the zoophiles and others but none of it really offers any insight into the subject matter. Much of it is just these guys talking about how they discovered and connected with other folk with similarly rare sexual proclivities. And they talk about loving horses. That doesn't interest me. Hell I like horses I just don't want to have sex with one. And there's never any discussion about the line where this love for animals becomes sexual. So whilst the whole thing is nice to look at ultimately it fails as a documentary simply because I didn't learn a damn thing.One issue the movie does inevitably bring up is the whole morality of the situation. Let's admit it the idea of a guy wanting to be boned by a horse is fairly sick and disgusting. But more importantly it's also really really funny so I wasn't too concerned. There's a minor reference involving a horse giving a blow job to another horse suggesting that these guys trained horses to put on sexual performances for them. That's a touch more worrying but once again the mental image of a bunch of dudes having a circlejerk to some wicked horseonhorse action is just so damn hilarious that I'm unable to work up any moral outrage.Fact is the horses weren't hurt physically or emotionally in any way. Are the actions of these guys any more exploitative than training a horse to run real fast so we can all place bets on it? Nope don't think so. So if you watch this movie then enjoy all the sumptuous visuals but don't judge these guys too harshly because at the end of the day they're just harmless perves. Aren't we all?".

	schema:reviewBody "Please don't let the graphic title of this usercomment mislead you I just couldn't resist writing this as Zoo is  in fact  everything but an exploitative and perverted excuse to finally revolve a movie on the controversial topic of bestiality. As strange as it may sound this documentarydrama is actually very sober tasteful and not the least bit disrespectful towards people with peculiar to put it mildly sexual likings. Robinson Devor the young and clearly promising young writerdirector of Zoo based himself on real events as they occurred in Seattle in 2005. A middle aged and divorced man died there as a result of internal bleedings after  and here comes the kicker  experiencing sexual intercourse with a horse. The media promptly jumped onto this story and in practically no time the authorities unraveled a small but nevertheless fanatic network of people who regularly gathered for a weekend of beer pizza and  animal sex. The shocking news spawned a giant debate and even some riots because apparently there weren't any laws against bestiality in the state of Washington at the time and all sorts of animal rights organizations launched hatecampaigns. Rather than to bluntly categorize the Zoos short term for Zoophiles as sick  twisted individuals as well Devor's film digs a lot deeper into their pasts and personalities. The documentary primarily depicts these Zoos as confused and introverted people with a devoted affection for animals. Of course this doesn't justify their sexual preferences but at least you don't simply label them as a bunch of perverted freaks. In the hands of any other random exploitationfilmmaker Zoo probably would have existed of nothing more than images of slavering rednecks cheering and queuing to bend over in front of a horse. There isn't a single explicit shot to be found in Zoo and the story hardly even hints at sleaze or schlock. If anything you almost feel like Robinson Devor is to blame for patronizing  protecting these Zoophiles too much but then still you don't as they already suffered more than enough scandal in various other media. The narrative and filming style of Zoo is also quite original and refreshing. The on screen characters are with the exception of some supportive ones hired actors but the guiding voiceovers come from actual interviews with the real Zoos. The bitterness and noticeable martyrtone in their voices gives a whole unique dimension of realism to the film. The photography is truly enchanting and the sober music oh my God the music literally sent cold shivers down my spine. Regardless of the questionable subject matter Zoo is a dreamy  highly elegant film that comes with my highest possible recommendation.".

The documentary primarily depicts these Zoos as confused and introverted people with a devoted affection for animals. Of course this doesn't justify their sexual preferences but at least you don't simply label them as a bunch of perverted freaks. In the hands of any other random exploitationfilmmaker Zoo probably would have existed of nothing more than images of slavering rednecks cheering and queuing to bend over in front of a horse. There isn't a single explicit shot to be found in Zoo and the story hardly even hints at sleaze or schlock. If anything you almost feel like Robinson Devor is to blame for patronizing  protecting these Zoophiles too much but then still you don't as they already suffered more than enough scandal in various other media. The narrative and filming style of Zoo is also quite original and refreshing. The on screen characters are with the exception of some supportive ones hired actors but the guiding voiceovers come from actual interviews with the real Zoos. The bitterness and noticeable martyrtone in their voices gives a whole unique dimension of realism to the film. The photography is truly enchanting and the sober music oh my God the music literally sent cold shivers down my spine. Regardless of the questionable subject matter Zoo is a dreamy  highly elegant film that comes with my highest possible recommendation.";

It is an intimate study into human nature and what makes us who we are.Zoo was in no way meant to shock or entice the audience's curiosity with graphic images. In fact if you were to watch the film without the dialog you could be fooled into believing that this was a beautifully photographed and musically scored feature film. Perhaps it is the imagery that softens the story of the zoophiles.There is a definite play on light in this documentary. Light is used to great effect in what we see in lightness or darkness. The use of light in cinematography however is in direct contrast to the story being told. Where one would think that the topic of bestiality is one of black and white Zoo blurs the line. Is it really so hard to accept love for what it is and accept that humans could love animals as they love humans? Perhaps this is the most shocking part of Zoo. Rob Devor has made a film that makes the audience sympathize with the zoophiles.

Sufficiently pleasured by the animal the man returns the horse to its stable and drives back home. Days later the man dies due to internal bleeding the horse's penis having ruptured vital internal organs. We later learn that the man could have saved his life by checking into a hospital but of course he was too embarrassed to have done so. He died alone in his home having been humped to death by a horse.Despite its sensationalist subject matter this is a rather boring documentary. Not wanting to seem exploitative the filmmakers back away from their own material too timid to ask any truly interesting questions.Why for example did horses fascinate the man? What is the appeal of bestiality? Is there such a thing as horse penis envy? Why was the horse not jailed for manslaughter? Is it possible for an animal to consent to having sex with a human? Why did the police charge the man with coercing an animal into sex? How exactly do you coerce such a huge and powerful animal into sex? Either the horse wants to do it or it doesn't. Doesn't anyone notice the irony of a horse mounting a human being? But no this documentary doesn't delve into anything interesting. There is one great shot however of a horse being elevated above an operating table and then later operated upon by a group of masked doctors. With its surreal juxtaposition between hospital gowns antiseptic tiles sterile medical equipment and a giant levitating horse the sequence recalls several scenes in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.610  I watched this film thinking it was Frederick Wiseman's famous documentary also called Zoo which examines the lives of the men and women working within an inner city zoo. But nope it's about a guy who has sex with a horse. Kinky.Worth one viewing.".

With its surreal juxtaposition between hospital gowns antiseptic tiles sterile medical equipment and a giant levitating horse the sequence recalls several scenes in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.610  I watched this film thinking it was Frederick Wiseman's famous documentary also called Zoo which examines the lives of the men and women working within an inner city zoo. But nope it's about a guy who has sex with a horse. Kinky.Worth one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the case of a Boeing employee who died from a perforated colon while being anally penetrated by a horse in Enumclaw a town in rural Washington state Zoo the term is short for zoophilia the sexual love of animals is a brave attempt to address a highly controversial and polarising issue in a dispassionate way that neither condemns nor sympathises with the people involved in bestiality. The film recreates the events leading up to the man's death and its aftermath in a way that's part documentary  part drama with reenactments of scenes and emphasising a soft dreamlike mood with delicately muted wafting music. Director Devor uses four narrators talking to an unseen listener to retell the events from the point of view of the people who knew the man referred to in the film as Mr Hands and this approach thrusts um the viewer right into the twilight world of zoophiles how they found each other through Internet contacts how they organised their tryst and their reactions when the man was injured and when their secret activities became known to the outside world.The film has the air of a noir mystery the majority of scenes are filmed in shadow at night or in dark colours with blue being predominant. The story unfolds slowly and elliptically and anyone who is unaware in advance as to what the film is about may be puzzled at the indirect way Zoo tiptoes around the subject until near halfway when a news report drops its headline in deadpan style. The pace is very steady perhaps too steady and slow and the film often dwells on several still camera shots which look deliberately staged as if for static display purposes. Closeups and landscapes often look very abstract with washes of blue across a background an orchard looks like a misty fairyland beneath a light coating of rain. The mood is even and quite blank until a scene in which police investigators viewing a DVD recording appears the police react with horror and shock watching the act of buggery and only then do viewers feel something creepy crawl up their spines.For all its delicacy Zoo gives the impression of something much bigger than its subject matter struggling to make itself seen and heard the zoophiles give the impression of wanting companionship a sense of belonging a need to share something special that gives meaning to their lives and thinking they have found it. They seek a utopia in which everyone is equal and noone is judged by how much money she earns or how educated she is. The places in rural Washington where many of them live look impoverished and some zoophiles may well be drifters or marginalised people barely managing to make a living and survive. Difficult to tell as many scenes are recreations of actual events with actors playing the zoophiles. If the film had directly addressed the need of the zoophiles for meaning for companionship it might have been able to gain more cooperation from the people involved as it is the level of cooperation it got is very restricted. The dead man's family refused to be interviewed for the film which is a pity as the wife and child might have presented him as more wellrounded than he appears in Zoo.The film also suffers from subjectivity and could have done with a more objective view of its subject. Interviews with psychologists and psychiatrists on zoophilia and perhaps other conditions such as lycanthropy identifying oneself as an animal rather than as a human might have shed light on why some people are sexually attracted to animals and to some kinds of animals in particular. The goals of the project would still be met the issue would not be sensationalised and viewers might come away with a greater understanding of zoophilia and other bizarre philias. Instead the film can only concentrate on the horsetrainer Jenny Edwards who took charge of the horses after the incident became public she admits that after having followed the case in its detail and ordering one of the horses gelded that she's on the edge of understanding the zoophiles' obsession. It appears also that the director and filmcrew were as much in the dark as Edwards was while making the film even after its completion the filmmakers still were scratching their heads trying to make sense of what they'd done. Not a good portent for a film.Yes zoophilia is a difficult subject to talk about let alone film without making it look disgusting degraded or ridiculous and pathetic. Zoo tries hard not to take one side or the other but with a subject like this the attempt to be balanced is a tough act indeed to pull off. Some viewers will be irate that the film advocates no position at all as if it's the filmmakers' duty to tell them what they must believe. I think though that to achieve the balance that Zoo strives for the filmmakers should have pulled back from their subjects and taken a more generalised view of the issue of zoophilia the police officers the courts psychologists and medical who dealt with the dead man and his friends should have been consulted for their opinions about zoophilia.".

I decided to fast forward and see if the movie ever got anywhere and I kind of get the impression that by the halfway point they were still talking around what happened. I could be wrong since it would be insane to do that especially since most people watching would have some idea of the subject matter but anytime I slowed down and took a look it was just more tedious banal talk about nothing in particularly over arty cinematography.This seems less of a documentary than of a musing upon a subject.Normally if I've only watched five minutes of a movie I don't rate it because I think it's unfair to effect the movie's overall rating if I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm making an exception for this one because it's pretentious student film maker approach is just too utterly agonizing to give a pass to.Why is no one else saying this?

Auteur Corneau's metronomic tone mates well with the script's finely balanced rather spare dialogue and with a complex plot not immediately pervious to a viewer the film benefits from the director's ability to weave a diverse cast of characters into a discriminatory dramatic construction. Deneuve earns acting honours while Depardieu is highly effective as a sociopath savaged by paranoia yet displaying a wide range of emotional engagement with disparate characters and Montand is icily persuasive as a retired mob leader who is forced to reenter his past in the hope of achieving safety for him and his wife.

After Serge dies from his injuries Nol has the visit of two cops Sarlat Grard Lanvin and Bonnardot Michel Galabru who question him about Mickey and Serge and Nol affirms that he doesn't know anything about them. And things take a darker turn for because he believes Nol betrayed him Mickey gives him a hard time. Nol has no other choice than to eliminate him.As the heir of JeanPierre Melville and Claude Sautet Alain Corneau brought to French cinema a crop of very well controlled thrillers in their writing and shooting. Le Choix Des Armes is part of this league and a valuable illustration of Corneau's stylish approach of French detective film. Adopting a rather sparse directing and a tight parallel editing the filmmaker takes pleasure in introducing the main characters and as the film progresses to deepen their personality. Like the greatest filmmakers Corneau has his style and his set of themes. Communication is a recurrent theme in his filmography especially the difficulties and absence of it. We learn that the cute little girl is Mickey's daughter and he had it just before he was jailed. The two cops work with different methods which doesn't make their relationships easy. Mickey and Durieux are caught in a vicious spiral that is the result of a happy misunderstanding because Mickey thinks that Durieux gave him to the police Durieux has to come back to his former gangster life to get rid of his protg. As they obey to their respective emotions the two men and especially Mickey get embroiled in a ruthless system that dwarfs them and prevents any reconciliation between them. A permanent feature the infernal system that affects the main characters in Corneau's previous films like in Police Python 357 1976 starring Yves Montand.This somber story is painstakingly built at all levels from the organization of the scenario to the creation of the sequences. Sometimes one shot or a few ones are sufficient to Corneau to present us the persona of a character in the film like Dany a young Richard Anconina's dumb wife or the duo of cops between ambitious Sarlat and seasoned disillusioned Bonnardot. The cast lives up to the demands of the story with Depardieu much better than Montand as impulsive immature Mickey. Horses in Durieux's domain are an evident symbol. One could also hail scenery discerningly chosen that cement the characters' social position either it is Nol Durieux's lascivious mansion in the country or Dany's shabby flat in popular suburbs. At that time in 19801 rare were the directors who dare to shoot in those highrisk outskirts.This is excellent stuff and it's well known it's better not to get bogged down in rut. Otherwise you'll have nothing to say anymore. Thus Corneau proved his ability at weaving prime thrillers. His next film Fort Saganne 1984 will go in another cinematographic direction the epic film.".

The whole setup of the couple played by Montand and Catherine Deneuve seemed to me absolutely unrealistic and absurd. Horse breeding buying the biggest mansion in Southern Ireland while the almost completely unrelated story unfolds come on! It is simply not possible to take that at face value as the movie apparently wants us to. If it was meant as an almost dreamlike fantasy then it was a pretty corny one if you ask me.Montand's acting occasionally had an odd goofball quality which at times came in handy his great performance in Wages of Fear comes to mind. Here the goofball aspect plainly shines through but with him as an ex gangster who has become some kind of landed gentry it is anything but an asset to the quality of the movie. I was really amazed to learn that Montand made Police Python 357 with the same director. It is a much better movie and he is brilliant there.So probably the script is the source of my dissatisfaction. The movie has lengths a long inconsequential sequence of a group of cars following another car an elaborate smashing up of the living room of a fairly unimportant minor character. For Catherine Deneuve this must have been one of the most ungrateful roles in her distinguished career. She mainly drives up and down the access lane of the estate in a little Ford or sits in an anonymous hotel room waiting for her husband to call. Oh yes there is some maretrouble back at the farm but that does not amount to much.It's strange the character played by Grard Depardieu is very convincing as human bulldozer who occasionally has a heart. I feel that this character was somehow let down by the script. He is the only driving force of the whole plot the surroundings seem to be either passive or undecided. So he becomes undecided himself and that's poison for a movie that is based on action. No wonder the guy turned into a raving maniac come to think of it.".

So he becomes undecided himself and that's poison for a movie that is based on action. No wonder the guy turned into a raving maniac come to think of it.";

Depardieu is superb playing Mickey Le Dingue with a subtle touch that none of us were expecting. Guards and inmates alike we cried at the sad parts and cheered on the criminals at the crime parts. French prisons have gotten a lot of bad publicity of late due to the high suicide rate and the beatings or murders by the guards and the knife attacks and that's all true but underneath the squalor and brutality and physical horror there's beauty and art and film and Mickey Le Dingue and Miss Deneuve.

The opening sequence particularly isn't that so often true of early thirties films? is a bravura combination of moving camera imaginative sets and crowd handling to create a sense of a time and place that may never have existed but should have.  The romance of the two lost souls is charming but just a little precious. The pandemonium of the escaped animals at the finale has some well edited thrilling footage and is a satisfying conclusion to a story about characters who have no place in the real world and for whose situation it was hard to see any satisfactory resolution.

Raymond has a magic touch with the animals which includes a lame deer a fluinfected chimp and a very affectionate spider monkey. This is one of the most magically photographed films of the early 30's and features an amazing sequence with animals on the rampage including lions tigers elephants and porcupines. There's not much acting required for the leadsthe true stars are the animals and the camera.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was transmitted in the early hours on the UK's Channel 4 terrestrial channel. 5 Dec 1998. It was an unusual film set in a zoo in Budapest and concerned the relationship between an enlightened keeper Gene Raymond and an escaped orphan Loretta Young. There was a little too much anthropomorphism as far as the animals were concerned but overall that was forgivable. Some of the shots involving the animals were realistic and I suspect the modern disclaimer about animals not being hurt during the making of the picture could not have been made. There was a dream and fairytale air about the film and I wonder if it was regarded as unusual when it was made in 1933. It does not fit easily into any of the usual categories. I would recommend any one having the chance of seeing this film to take that chance. They will be rewarded with a pleasant novelty of a film.".

The film is part love story and part wildlife protection fable following a pair of stray visitors a precocious young boy and a beautiful runaway orphan girl who find adventure and for the latter at least romance while trespassing after hours among the other caged animals in Hungary's capitol city. The setting may not have a convincing Middle European flavor but the film is remarkably free of the awkward sentiment common to many early talkie productions.

Quite a job of miscasting there. Young is lovely  wellsuited for her role  holds up in the acting department a bit better than Raymond does. The film doesn't work very well as an allegory. If the tiger is to represent Raymond or Young for that matter why would it attack an elephant upon its release? Is the elephant to be a symbol of the tiger's oppressor? I don't think so the elephant was locked up just the way that the tiger was.

A somewhat spineless nice girl who can't say no to anyone she has been a bridesmaid 27 times often exceeding her duties in every wedding. For all her romantic yearnings she can't seem to hook her boss George Ed Burns whom she has been in love with for years. When her selfcentered little sister Tess Malin Akerman comes in and manages to snag George Jane once again capitulates to everyone's needs but her own. In comes Kevin James Marsden a newspaper columnist stuck covering weddings who yearns to break out and write about more important things. Under the pretense of covering George and Tess's wedding he really is writing about Jane and her perpetual bridesmaid stints. Complications ensue etc. etc.For me what really made this movie was the performances. Katherine Heigl did an absolutely fantastic job playing the woman that I'm sure everyone has felt like at one time. She brought a lot of spice to what could have been a onenote role. James Marsden is also pitchperfect as the cynical reporter a foil to Jane. It helps that they have good fightandkiss chemistry.Also for me the story line was not as tired and recycled as people made it out to be. It had some fresh spin and I really enjoyed it. I also preferred the ending to this movie to many chickflick comedies which leave things openended and almost unrealistic. 27 Dresses wraps up all the plot lines in one neat sequence that is a truly worthy finale.All in all as far as romances and romcoms go this one shot to the top of my list.".

Under the pretense of covering George and Tess's wedding he really is writing about Jane and her perpetual bridesmaid stints. Complications ensue etc. etc.For me what really made this movie was the performances. Katherine Heigl did an absolutely fantastic job playing the woman that I'm sure everyone has felt like at one time. She brought a lot of spice to what could have been a onenote role. James Marsden is also pitchperfect as the cynical reporter a foil to Jane. It helps that they have good fightandkiss chemistry.Also for me the story line was not as tired and recycled as people made it out to be. It had some fresh spin and I really enjoyed it. I also preferred the ending to this movie to many chickflick comedies which leave things openended and almost unrealistic. 27 Dresses wraps up all the plot lines in one neat sequence that is a truly worthy finale.All in all as far as romances and romcoms go this one shot to the top of my list.";

But it turned out to be not too bad. While it does not exactly rank among the best of its genre it has its own charm and that's one of the few things that make a romantic comedy likable. While the story isn't new McKeena's writing offers some new devices and the dialogues are quite funny. Fletcher's storytelling is quite impressive too as he introduces the characters and then lets the events unfold. The layered characters Jane and Kevin are very real. I also like it when the leads are played by good actors who have hardly attempted to do films romantic comedies in the past and they manage to pull it off. Heigl and Marsden have the required chemistry. Both actors do a fine job. Katherine Heigl brings out the depth of her character with ease while James Marsden is funny without going overthetop. The sizzling Malin Akerman does well as the obnoxious Tess. Edward Burns's role doesn't require much but he's okay. Judy Greer is brilliant and she owns all her scenes. So what makes '27 Dresses' watchable is the chemistry between the actors the funny lines the presentation of the story a nice soundtrack and its unique charm and sense of humour and the fact that it didn't bore me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't expect this movie to be thus thoroughly lacking in intellect. Katherine Heigl's character Jane was meant to be portrayed as a witty and smart warmhearted girlnextdoor type as opposed to her sister Tess the hot but dumb blond. Sadly both of them came across to me as just plain dumb completely lacking the ability to construct a good sentence. The relationship between the sisters I thought mostly seemed to be ripped offand not very well might I add from the RoseToni ColletteMaggieCameron Diaz relationship in 'In Her Shoes'. Edward Burns's character perhaps deliberately was so passive it made me wonder why anybody would fall for him. Heigl's acting is mostly good barring a few scenes in which she has the look of a person just recovered from a coma and her expressions are left to the audience's imagination. The dialog is ridiculous in parts but a few well written witticisms save the daywell almost. Highly unrealistic at times the writers have also contradicted themselves several times with displays of absurd anomalies in the behavior of some of the characters. And may I also say that the word cynical has been used far more than necessary and quite often in the wrong context even. The only redemption factor in the movie is probably James Marsden. His acting is pretty good if not great and his character seems to be the only smart one in the entire movie other than Jane's best friend Casieplayed by Judy Greer who was personally my favorite character and the only one with any substance. The story in itself is highly clichd the typical naive pushover falls in love with the incidentally highly handsome young lad who helps her through the struggle of learning to put her foot down. Too predictable. I'd have liked to watch a romantic comedy that isn't mindless and whose numerous shortcomings I'm not supposed to overlook just so i can enjoy that ohsoheartwarming moment. Romance shouldn't need to be brainless and its audience shouldn't be thus underestimated. Overall I'd give the movie a 2 on 10.".

That's right! I said EVERYONE including guys.Katherine Heigl is great in the film as Jane the optimistic bridesmaid who wants a shot of love for herself someday and feels the the 27 bridesmaid dresses she keeps in her closet is a calling that its time for her to get a dress of a different kind.Judy Greer who's always the best friend in the movies is very comical and sassy as Katherine's friend Casey. At least she knows what she wants but she's very compassionate and supportive to Jane throughout the film.One person though that I think stood out in this film was James Marsden. I've always seen him in action movies XMen series and Superman Returns as a minor or supporting character but I think that he made the male lead of Kevin his own. Although he gets on Jane's nerves half the time he always tends to put on a smile on her face because she knows that he's trying to get her to let go of the past and move on to a possible future where her big day might come. Kevin's the guy you would want to confide in if something's troubling you or if you need to dance to an Elton John song to get your groove back.If you should see any movie this new year make a date with 27 Dresses. You'll be happy that you did.".

I just felt like I had seen this film before somewhere or parts of it in different films. I guess I watched it because I'm getting married soon so I wanted to see the dresses in the film and there are some amazing ones and some interesting ones for those who care about dresses. The audience didn't seem to laugh as much as I thought they would. This is not the same kind of film as Knocked Up and maybe people were expecting that. Otherwise its a decent Tuesdaynight date movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a scene of impromptu karaoke featuring Elton John's Bennie and the Jetsbearing similarities to another romcom I abhorred despite its own brilliant use of song My Best Friend's Weddinga fun cast and some entertaining moments the opening cab scenes as Heigl's Jane attends two weddings in the same night is inspired I have to admit I didn't hate 27 Dresses. Are the obvious clichs and plot evolutions that seem recycled in every film of this genre at work? Yes. But even so those been there done that moments carried enough interest to keep me from throwing the movie out as complete waste.It's that old adage always a bridesmaid and never a bride at work. Jane is a career woman who gives herself completely to those around her whether friends boss or family. She will do anything for Edward Burns' George because she is in lust with him her idyllic image of the perfect man for which she can be the perfect employee and hopefully trick into falling for her she'll organize and break her back in order to give all her friends perfect nuptials killing herself in the process and taking up her closet space as she keeps each dress for the memories they contain and loves her sister Tess so much that even after having helped raise her when their mother died she decides to keep her mouth shut while watching a web of lies spin out of control resulting in baby sis getting the guy she always wanted for herself. If it weren't enough to watch a selfless patsy make everyone around her happy while she devolves deeper and deeper into a self made depression for laughs add in cocky wiseguy wedding editorialist Kevin the always stellar James Marsden and you get that perfect piece of abrasive sandpaper to get under Jane's skin even though you know his volatility only exists to eventually be overcome with burgeoning love.You know how this tale of unrequited love and love unknown will end so it is up to the filmmakers to keep it interesting enough so that your butt doesn't leave the seat. The best way to do so is by creating some humorous moments to alleviate the clairvoyanceinduced boredom you'd otherwise be feeling. A scene like the drunken karaoke is priceless as a result. It's unexpected forging the first glimpse of romantic bonding between Kevin and Jane two opposites that appear to have more fun mocking each other than finding what they have in common deep down. Adding a morally ambiguous best friend in Judy Greer's Casey helps as well infusing the proceedings with some crass fun to counteract the wholesomeness Jane exudes. Even Malin Akerman as sister Tess does a good job at playing the puzzle piece to throw everything out of whack in other words the reason there is even a conflict to create a film at all. While not the greatest actress in the world Akerman excels as the beauty turning heads and causing a wholesale upheaval of her sister's world.27 Dresses cannot rely on its supporting cast to carry it though. Oftentimes these periphery players come and go quickly showing face to advance the plot disappearing when their job is done. While not necessarily a bad thing being that none of them really have a fullyfleshed out role Akerman sort of does and Ed Burns maybe despite his very onedimensional dreamboat humanitarian faade their comings and goings mean that Heigl has a lot of work to do. I think anyone asking whether she would be up to the task is correct to do so. After all she only has two lengthy television credits and a whole lot of forgettable theatrical roles to her name. Can Izzie from Grey's Anatomy carry a big budget romcom expected to bring in huge money? I will never lie in saying I'm a big fan she doesn't quite have the looks and most times comes across as bitchy in the parts she gets but I give her a hand here for doing an admirable job. I do believe Marsden carries her many times stealing some moments with his charm and comic timing but Heigl holds her end well especially since she is on screen close to 100 of the runtime.The premise is ripe for quality comedy pertaining to something we all know that insane pomp and circumstance of wedded bliss manufactured to be more party of the year than the moment when two people's love manifests itself into a union of kindred spirits. Once you get beyond the convenience of having our two leads meet coincidentally at a weddingthe down on her luck bridesmaid and the jaded wedding writer who's flowery words no longer match his feelings about the big dayyou will enjoy the comedy their meeting creates. Besides the opening yellow cab changing room sequence and karaoke extravaganza there is one more crucial moment. It is the scene that encapsulates the entire film Marsden's discovery of Heigl's closet of memories. This one scene has every emotion that director Anne Fletcher is looking to portray. It's the embarrassment of having been in so many without a love for herself the genuine smile on her face as she remembers the good times had in each the morphing of his mocking smile to one of understanding as he sees the true worth of each dress the devastating expressions of both when he takes that final photo of her sad face. His is so apologetic both for taking the photo and knowing what it is he will be doing with it. The rest is all fluff leading up to the conclusion we played in our heads an hour before we saw it. Thankfully amidst all that window dressing lie a few moments of truth where all involved got it right. They may not make 27 Dresses a resounding success but they do make it ever so slightly relevant and worth a glimpse.".

This is in spite of having to sit thru her new movie '27 Dresses'.If the industry predictions are right and Heigl is destined for Julia Robertsstyle zeitgeist popularity the mantle '27 Dresses' will occupy is easy to predict. 'Knocked Up' will be remembered as Heigl's 'Pretty Woman'  a surprise smash that introduced her as an instantly likable utterly lovely bigscreen presence '27 Dresses' will be Heigl's 'Sleeping With The Enemy'  a tired uninspired buttonpushing mess overseen by the actresses agents and managers to ensure their property becomes a big star sooner rather than later.As the eternal bridesmaid having to endure her younger sisters nuptials to the man she's longed for Heigl glows on screen but is reduced for much of the film to a simpering sourpuss. The director Step Up's Anne Fletcher shoots her stars including a lifeless Edward Burns Malin Akerman a criminallywasted Judy Greer and a frankly insufferable James Marsden in static midshots as well reducing the romantic allure of New York to subdued hues and bland framing.Most frustrating is the complete lack of chemistry between the leads compounded by longwinded talky scenes that should bounce and end with a laugh in true romcom tradition but instead drag on and peter out into nothingness.I'm going to assume that the message of the film is lost on me  all I took from the film was no matter how beautiful and intelligent you are you are only really complete as a woman when you find a man that makes you happy. I know its not the first romcom to espouse such traditional values but its the first in a longtime to labour the point so heavyhandedly.Points go to the costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas for the 27 dresses of the title  they display the sense of fun absurdity and spark of originality that the film as a whole sorely needed.I expect '27 Dresses' will open huge and turn Heigl from the smallscreen ITgirl into the star she promises to be. But the star wont really shine until she finds a project that defines and enhances her on screen appeal not just exploits it in the name of a bland lifeless callingcard film shamelessly structured by suits to launch the 'Katherine Heigl' brand.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I was unlucky enough to catch this mess while on a 13hour flight from Shanghai to Chicago along with Fool's Gold and Jumper. Remind me never to fly United again. After the first hour I was ready to throw myself out of the plane somewhere over the Arctic circle. I'm not sure where exactly we were at that moment but I looked out the window and the ocean below was frozen and landing on top of the ice after a 35000foot freefall sounded more appealing than another 45 minutes of this tripe.It's yet another bonehead romantic comedy about weddings where the protagonist is always a bridesmaid but never a bride etc etc etc. She's great at doing things for other people but not so great at going after what she really wants or needs for herself. She has a collection of bridesmaids dresses filling one closet in her apartment to capacity no points for guessing how many she has until one day her collection is witnessed by columnist Kevin Doyle who sees this story about a wedding addict as his key to upward movement at his magazine. Charged with coming up with something fresh and interesting he shocks his editor but not the audience when he gets too involved in the story and realizes that maybe there's something more to it since she his editor feels that it's probably just some throwaway garbage that no one is really going to pay much attention to anyway. Sadly the people who made the movie never realized that that is true of the movie as well. Anyway Katherine Heigl stars as Jane Nichols who attracted the attention of Kevin Doyle on a night when she was on a wedding marathon shuttling between weddings at such at rate as to win the attention of the media. A lot of people complain about her performance but I had no problem with her acting or with James Marsden's or really with anyone else in the cast. The problem is that the movie feels like a child's coloring book where someone just filled in the blanks and gave it a title and sent it to theaters. The formula here is so obvious that the laughs generated by its presence are the most effective part of the movie. James Marsden plays the part of Kevin Doyle. This is a remarkably versatile actor. He is still best known I should think as Cyclops from the XMen films but has also turned in effective performances in romantic comedies including his satisfactory performance as a Mr. Right in this idiot movie as well as his role as Mr. Wrong in the indescribably superior film The Notebook. Kevin is a young professional with moviestar good looks and is impossibly charming while Jane unfortunately doesn't notice or appreciate his charm because she is too deeply in love with her dirtbag of a boss George played with effective repulsiveness by Edward Burns.Later Jane's little sister shows up a bouncy Barbieish blonde without a thought in her head who comes along and charms George off his feet and we are asked to care when this jerk and this bimbo fall in love and ask Jane to plan their wedding. Oh that really pulls the heartstrings doesn't it? These two shallow superficial people getting together leaving poor Jane with nothing but this stunningly handsome man with a good job and bright future constantly professing his true love to her. It is safe to say you can leave the tissue at home for this one.I suppose I don't have to explain how obvious the conclusion of the movie is. Probably the most difficult thing that a good romantic comedy has to overcome is that they are all so predictable except for the really good ones The Notebook as an example. In 27 Dresses it is blatantly obvious from the first frame how the movie is going to turn out except for the instant transformations that George and Tess Jane's little sister make in the last few minutes of the movie for the sake of the Hollywood ending. Everyone involved in the movie has done much much better than this. If you want to see James Marsden in something worth seeing please check out The Notebook. Edward Burns has an extensive list of credits and has had some hits and misses if for example you ever get a chance to see him in a movie called A Sound of Thunder don't and as for Katherine Heigl she has done nothing but better films than this. Under Siege 2 is better than this and that should really be all you need to know".

In 27 Dresses it is blatantly obvious from the first frame how the movie is going to turn out except for the instant transformations that George and Tess Jane's little sister make in the last few minutes of the movie for the sake of the Hollywood ending. Everyone involved in the movie has done much much better than this. If you want to see James Marsden in something worth seeing please check out The Notebook. Edward Burns has an extensive list of credits and has had some hits and misses if for example you ever get a chance to see him in a movie called A Sound of Thunder don't and as for Katherine Heigl she has done nothing but better films than this. Under Siege 2 is better than this and that should really be all you need to know";

This time she sets off to find her own Mr. Right. The story is predictable and a little bit cheesy. It has some nice moments of humor and good drama too. The cast is good Katherine Heigl was good and James Marsden gives a decent performance Malin Akerman was OK I feel her a little overact and Judy Greer maybe she was the best with a role full of irony. One of the good things of the movie is the various landscapes from New York City and the soundtrack is also good In conclusion this is a 100 chick flick women will love it men avoid it".

The term alwaysthebridesmaid has never been more appropriate as she has 27 ugly bridesmaids' dresses hence the title in her closet  one for every cheesy theme wedding she has attended.Jane works for George Edward Burns One Missed Call an environmentallyfriendly but hopelesslynaive boss who seems to be the only one in the office or in the City of New York for that matter who cannot tell that Jane is totally in love with him.Unfortunately for this fledgling love affair Jane's pretty but selfcentered sister Tess Malin Akerman The Heartbreak Kid The Brothers Solomon enters the picture and sweeps George off his goofy feet.While all of this is going on Jane is practically being stalked by Kevin James Marsden Superman Returns the XMen films a wedding writer for a large New York publication. Assigned to cover Tess and George's nuptials for SOME reason he instead turns his attention to Jane and the fact she has been a bridesmaid 27 times.When all of these situations collide we're supposed to be amused but I was just bored having seen this plot or variations of this plot many times before.Katherine Heigl is certainly a beautiful actress and her Jane is very sweet and pure here but she is not a strong enough lead to carry even this lightweight premise. She's no Julia Roberts she's no Cameron Diaz she's not even a Sandra Bullock.Playing opposite comedians such as Johnny Knoxville and Seth Rogan was fine  since she was more of a supporting character  but here she is the main cog of the movie and it's a bit too much for her. There are some scenes in which she is just there to look sad or hurt or angry or rejected and not an integral part of the action.I also thought the love affair was forced upon us because it was expected. A twist at the conclusion would have been nice. Still overall the movie is harmless and inoffensive and will bring out all of the women and many of their dates who do not want to see Cloverfield at the cinaplexes over the next few weeks.".

Granted Katherine Heigl is a talented very beautiful woman but her looks are about the only thing I really enjoyed in this movie.I included that there's a spoiler in my review but that's because it's a chick flick and that alone should tell you what happens Heigl is Jane who helps plan weddings as a hobby and lives in the chick flick capital of New York. She's been in you guessed it 27 weddings. She's waiting for her bosslove interest to reciprocate her feelings. Alas he falls for Jane's younger less morallyrestricted sister. She doesn't know about Jane's feelings for her boss and when George proposes her sister GASP wants Jane to be the Maid of Honor and help plan the wedding.Anyway in typical chick flick fashion along comes the handsomebutpolaroppositeoftheprotagonist love interest who annoys her at first then it's revealed in dramatic irony to the audience that he has an agenda then sets about seemingly pursuing her. Then he falls in love with her and forgets his agenda. Then after an unlikely embarrassing scene which in chick flicks usually involves drinking water fights karaoke some kind of messy food or all of the above they make out jump in bed together and she suddenly loves him. Then his original agenda comes out accidentally she gets ticked and refuses to hear him out. They both go away sad and lonely. She later has a revelation runs across town to find him announces in public that she loves him they kiss marry the end.This movie was just too ridiculous. The beginning where she's racing back and forth between two weddings across town the humiliating her sister at the engagement party the fact that she went to the weddings of just about every ethnicity and culture etc...and the fact that I only cracked a smile at a handful of scenes really brought this down for me.Good I suppose for a girl's time of the month or when the boyfriends and husbands go out drinking or to a ball game but other than that not one I would feel like watching again unless I had to I'm getting married next year so that's a good possibility too unfortunately".

I know it is not meant for straight men but watching this with my wife was pure agony.Yes it is predictable yes it is unoriginal and unfunny yes the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic yes it's clich but all of that's to be expected. My biggest complaint with this film is the character played by James Marsden.So this guy who is supposedly into women actually notices she has a collection of dresses?? then he wants to see her try them all on??? of course he has a sad past that comes up and how does he get cheered up? By shopping???? Oh and that sad backstory he was betrayed by his wife so he decides he hates the concept of marriage rather than the woman herself. How about the fact that his life seems to revolve around this upcoming wedding?? And then after smattering the name of the bride in a popular news paper that we're supposed to believe would run such a pointless story  going as far as calling the bridetobe bridezilla he actually gets invited to another wedding party where the ohsopredictable scene where the lovers come together takes place.This has to be one of the best examples of bad film writing I've come across. I can't even recommend this as a date movie because if the female you're with has any sense she'll find it really stupid as well.".

My biggest complaint with this film is the character played by James Marsden.So this guy who is supposedly into women actually notices she has a collection of dresses?? then he wants to see her try them all on??? of course he has a sad past that comes up and how does he get cheered up? By shopping???? Oh and that sad backstory he was betrayed by his wife so he decides he hates the concept of marriage rather than the woman herself. How about the fact that his life seems to revolve around this upcoming wedding?? And then after smattering the name of the bride in a popular news paper that we're supposed to believe would run such a pointless story  going as far as calling the bridetobe bridezilla he actually gets invited to another wedding party where the ohsopredictable scene where the lovers come together takes place.This has to be one of the best examples of bad film writing I've come across. I can't even recommend this as a date movie because if the female you're with has any sense she'll find it really stupid as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller Zoolander is a very funny movie if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller Meet the Parentstype comedy and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be ridiculous.Derek Zoolander Stiller is the fashion industry's number one male model but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel Owen Wilson provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu Will Ferrell takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented while for Meet the Parents' Wilson it is the chance to play a comedic confident character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein Derek's agent and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller like Wilson always manages to find humor in every role he plays and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies is not stranger to satire either. Wellchosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends and Michael Jackson's Beat It' as the background music for a faceoff between Derek and Hansel any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny Jon Voight Vince Vaughn Andy Dick David Bowie Cuba Gooding Jr. Winona Ryder and even Ralph Lauren's own male model Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd ridiculous and overall an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.".

This movie is not to be taken seriously its for FUN people. The movie's main characters did great jobs and had good charisma between them there were tons of other actors putting in small bits some of which were amazingly funny I laughed out loud in a few parts and I almost never do that. There were some truly funny moments moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said You did?' when I said I liked it they said with even more incredulity You did?!' because I don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos but hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to be humorous. There were a few parts I could have lived without gladly but overall you get what you think you are going to get and more!".

Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this you'll think it's 2 different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do he also helped write and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben and he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a riot. Read the Plot Outline in the details there's not much to it. But you don't watch movies like this for incredible story lines do you?No it's not an oscar winning comedy most aren't. It's not an intelligent look at reallife it's not the greatest storyline driven kind of movie and it doesn't have top notch acting. But it's incredibly funny especially the DVD. The DVD is filled with so many extra goodies it's worth getting. The movie is filled with cameos like David Bowie Paris Hilton Billy Zane AH! There are so many you just have to see the list yourself.Rent or buy it and leave your brain on the table next to the popcorn.

If you can rise above the literal visual interpretation to the gasoline pump fight you'll find it too has an underlying educational or at least helpful message. The characterizations of good guy versus bad guy are whimsical creative colorful and funny. Derek Zoolander Ben Stiller is Ben's wonderfully exaggerated version of the male model one who is offering his best attempt to be Balls Models 4th year in a row model of the year. Sadly he loses to Hansel Owen Wilson a sweet blue green star eyed soft lined model. At the loss quirky carefree and complex Derek questions his reflection in a puddle of water Who Am I? In search of an answer to his question he returns home to the coal mines of New Jersey where his generally reluctant father Larry Zoolander  John Voight and what looks to be his two evidently one Judah Friedlander inarticulate brothers reside. But it is Derek's agent Maury Ballstein Jerry Stiller who encourages him to return to New York so that Derek can take on the assignment as model for Mugato's Will Ferrell Derelicte campaign. Maury is passionate and sincerely wants for his models to succeed at making a living in modeling. Mugato is obsessed with having Derek assassinate Malaysia's prime minister Hassan Woodrow W. Asai one with a fondness for fashion and vogue and a desire to increase pay standards in the production industry. Derek takes the job but little does he know that Mugato's black leathered assistant Katinka Milla Jovovich will be leading him into a day spa that is more like a torture chamber one designed to brainwash him into assassinating Malaysia's leader. Matilada Jeffries Christine Taylor a reporter for Time assigned to reporting on fashion events will soon find herself in the midst of discovering a personal life originating from her professional one. And fortunately Hansel is more than a competitor to Derek but a friend who saves both Derek and the leader of Malaysia from an untimely death.The entire script is so creatively and colorfully articulated and presented that one cannot help but have just so much fun or alternatively be filled with suspense as to whether or not Mugato will have his way with Derek. David Duchovny's scene mystery man on the cell phone as scruffy bearded eye glassed and glass encased hand J.P. Prewitt at the cemetery is really well done. In an interestingly woven monologue he begins by explaining buried models' premature deaths scenes that include butt cheeks and abs sculpted on gravestones. It's very Tim Robbinseque in mood and tone and very well performed.Zoolander was much more rich in plot characterization and development than I had expected after hearing that it didn't get great reviews. And the story still results in a very happy ending. Good wins over evil and good guy hero gets girl. So who is Derek Zoolander? Answer A really sweet guy who is cute funny sensitive articulate although can't say eulogy and instead says ulogee but just adds more to his cute and funny attributes and one who we gather has a terrific girlfriend and cool best friend with whom he pursues one of his true life long passions to open up a school for kids to read really good.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever wondered what it was like to be a male model? Well watching Zoolander probably isn't going to give you any accurate representation of what being a male model is really like but it's definitely a hilarious spoof on modeling and fashion industry.  Zoolander relies heavily on the stereotypes of selfabsorbed male models depicting them as airheads with their senses often limited to strictly fashion. I recommend you completely disregard Stiller's previous comedies Something About Mary Meet the Parents and Along Came Polly when approaching this film as it strays from his usual boyfriend with bad luck who gets into hilariously embarrassing situations' style comedy. His role this film shows character diversity in Stiller not seen in his past films and it works.The sheer stupidity of the main characters Derek Zoolander Ben Stiller and rival male model Hansel Owen Wilson are the primary sources of the genuine laughs found in Zoolander. Set in modern day New York City the plot revolves around a sinister fashion designer named Mugatu Will Ferrell and his plot to brainwash male model Derek Zoolander to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister harms Mugatu's clothing factories run by children by imposing child labor laws angering Mugatu and other fashion designers. Although the plot is farfetched it never tries to be taken any more seriously than a comic book. Once you see the remarks and reactions of the two main characters it's impossible to take seriously and often funny. One example of the hilarious stupidity in this movie Early on in the movie there is a Male Model of the Year' awards ceremony Zoolander being accustomed to winning the award several years in a row runs to the stage despite the fact Hansel's name had been announced to accept the award. Zoolander proceeds to give his cocky award speech when he the host taps his shoulder and points to Hansel standing behind him. Zoolander is struck with disbelief and it makes for a truly funny scene. There isn't much romance in this film but there is a little between a reporter named Matilda Christina Applegate and Zoolander but it's never really explored in the film and most of its referred to with humor. Picture Zoolander as a featurelength Saturday Night Live skit and you should know what kind of humor to expect.As I said before to enjoy this movie you can't take it seriously because you will take it as it was not intended.  This was a movie that caught me by surprise I didn't think I'd like it and thought of myself as being dragged' to see it but was very happy with after watching.  I never thought I'd be interested in seeing something about a male model because I have no interest on the subject but modeling is just what it makes fun of. Zoolander definitely achieves what it sets out to do and doesn't try to take itself seriously at all.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are compliment each others roles very well and are extremely funny together.Bottom Line 7.5 out of 10 Better than fair' but not great lots of laughs to be had but it relies on the same stupid' humor the entire movie. Even though the humor can be repetitive at times it still managed to be funny for the most part throughout the movie. I consider it a solid comedy worth renting for those seeking laughter.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ever wondered what it was like to be a male model? Well watching Zoolander probably isn't going to give you any accurate representation of what being a male model is really like but it's definitely a hilarious spoof on modeling and fashion industry.  Zoolander relies heavily on the stereotypes of selfabsorbed male models depicting them as airheads with their senses often limited to strictly fashion. I recommend you completely disregard Stiller's previous comedies Something About Mary Meet the Parents and Along Came Polly when approaching this film as it strays from his usual boyfriend with bad luck who gets into hilariously embarrassing situations' style comedy.

	schema:headline " Ben Stiller Delivers A Classic Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The complex world of the male modeling profession including the inherent rivalries and the significant impact the industry has had on history is explored and revealed in Zoolander' a brilliant comedy directed by and starring the versatile Ben Stiller.  With chiseled features that bespeak the best of Michelangelo as well as an arsenal of three looks' preeminent of which is the riveting Blue Steel' Derek Zoolander Stiller is poised to win the coveted VH1 Male Model of the Year Award for an unprecedented fourth year in a row.  But this year for the first time he has a rival a newcomer who just may be able to usurp his title  the charismatic and popular Hansel Owen Wilson who with chiseled features of his own has burst upon the scene only this year and threatens to steal Zoolander's thunder in one fell swoop.  And as if this wasn't enough for the seemingly until now invulnerable Zoolander to have on his vapid mind a reporter for Time Magazine Matilda Jeffries Christine Taylor Stiller's reallife wife has written an indepth article about him in which the true nature of the man behind the Adonis is objectively and succinctly revealed and it's scheduled to hit the streets the week of the Awards.  Suffice to say it's a full plate for Derek Zoolander male model who unbeknownst to him has yet an even greater personal vexation awaiting which involves a sinister plot and the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister of Malaysia? And what you may ask does that have to do with the male modeling profession?  Well it's just that kind of movie...Like a toothless attack dog that suddenly lunges at you and chomps down on your elbow Zoolander' has a harmless bite that will grab your attention immediately and refuse to let you go.  And like that dog it will continue to gum your elbow until it tickles your funnybone and you become helpless to do anything other than pet it on the head and want to take it home with you. That's the effect of Stiller's film.  It's an hilarious excursion through a world in which glitz glamor and goodlooks are the commandments by which to live and oneonone walkoffs' and break dance fighting are the realities which mask a degree of shallowness that is nearly unfathomable.  All of which Stiller delivers in his own inimitable style with subtle nuance and an instinctive sense of comedy that really makes this satire work.  No one with the possible exception of Albert Brooks can set up a comedy and put it across as effectively as Stiller who always plays it straight and never fishes for cheap' laughs.  What he gives you is the real deal and it's classic.In Derek Zoolander Stiller has created a character who manifests the myriad facets ironies and idiosyncrasies of pop culture offering a perspective that allows us to laugh not only at Zoolander but at ourselves as well.  And such a perspective is a rare and welcomed gift for too often matters of insignificance are taken too seriously by too many and it is at such times that we need a Zoolander among us to dispel the complexities we foist upon ourselves and to negate the selfimposed burdens that keep us in thrall to the most trivial things in life.  Zoolander holds up a mirror and points out the furrow in your brow that simply doesn't have to be there.  Stiller is a truly gifted artist who can make you laugh think and feel good about yourself all at the same time.  But like Chaplin and Fields before him it will undoubtedly and unfortunately be some time before his true genius is widely and sufficiently recognized.Owen Wilson as well is a talented actorwriterperformer who has demonstrated his own unique style in such films as Bottle Rocket' Shanghai Noon' and Meet the Parents' and here makes Hansel the perfect counterpart of Derek Zoolander.  Hansel is the flip side of the same coin that carries the likeness of Zoolander so different yet cut from the same cloth.  And like Stiller Wilson plays it straight with a subtle delivery that is entirely effective.  He and Stiller in fact are possibly the greatest comedteamwhoaren'tateam in the history of the movies.  Wilson has the driest delivery this side of Gene Wilder his timing is perfect and his quirky looks and the timbre of his voice give him a veritably captivating screen presence.  He brings Hansel to life with facility and makes him a memorable character.The supporting cast includes Will Ferrell Mugatu Jerry Stiller Ballstein Milla Jovovich Katinka Matt Levin Archie and features cameos by David Duchovny Cuba Gooding Jr. Lenny Kravitz Vince Vaughn Jon Voight Billy Zane Natalie Portman Winona Ryder David Bowie Andy Dick and Fabio.  Already the secondgreatest cult film of all time behind Stiller's Mystery Men' Zoolander' like Stiller himself is destined to be initially under appreciated but in time will be recognized as the comedic masterpiece that it is.  It's entertaining and funny at times dark but never offensive and it's the kind of film that gets even better with repeated viewings.  A true classic that will endure the test of time this film is what the magic of the movies is all about and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 1010.".

He really isn't too bright and his stunning beauty is apparent only to himself and a surprising number of admirers He's almost ... too good looking It's like there's a light around him who don't notice that his special facial expressions his looks are all identical. He loses a model contest to a rival Hansel but doesn't notice and accepts the prize anyway. By the time his faux pas reaches Time magazine's cover he is becoming aware that all is not well. There's lots of wacky and grossly outrageous humor situations and action in the film which only loses momentum a bit before the climactic wild and zany grunge fashion show scene with Derek alternately hyperathletically modeling and trying to murder the Prime Minister. When shown a model of a school he proposes to establish for children who don't read too good Derek hurls it to the floor even he knows it has to be at least three times bigger for anyone to fit inside! If you get a laugh from that you'll probably like the movie. Ben Stiller as Derek may be the chief actor whose personality and ability make this film watchable and enjoyable. The DVD has some funny outtakes and an excellent short on modeling from the Derek Zoolander University of Modeling for Men. Tip while on the runway don't be distracted by celebrities to the left and right of you pretend you're wearing blinders like a cow.".

The concept wasn't great to begin with but such terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned this film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few moments that may cause tiny giggles but these moments are also mind numbingly dumb. Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.".

Previously liking the principal cast of this film including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel I was more than a little dissapointed after seeing what a clumsy mess Zoolander turned into. The concept wasn't great to begin with but such terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned this film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few moments that may cause tiny giggles but these moments are also mind numbingly dumb. Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.";

This is the first time I am left scratching my head wondering what exact movie did you people watch to give it such low reviews??!! This movie is what it is and a very good job of it. It is a movie that makes fun of super hero movies. Take a bitter misfit exsuperhero who can't be any less interested in training new recruits and make it funny. Zoom has his reasons to be bitter and they are CLEARLY explained if people don't get the plot they weren't really paying attention. The acting in this movie is very good by a well collected cast. Allen and Chase deliver slapstick one liners throughout the whole movie that are truly reminiscent of their comedic classic styles. If the one liner isn't enough to make you laugh add the highly adorable factor from Ryan Newman as Cindy Collins is tops. The rest of the cast works very well together and even though there is a lot of predictability in the movie it is still very funny and worth the watch. This is not a literary classic brought to life so don't expect it to be. The negative comments about Allen are unjust as his character wasn't' that far off from his style in the Santa Clause movies. This movie was enjoyable and I laughed out loud many times and I don't do that often with movies because they just aren't as funny in the same style. If you want to just relax and laugh at a silly movie the Zoom on over to your video store and pick this one up.".

They enjoy being kids with each other and learn how to use their powers in the right ways and must destroy Conor another former super hero who went bad. Together they all must learn to a team and also a family.Like I said for a kid's movie it's cute and it really wasn't a BAD movie I've seen worse believe me!

It seems to me that if all characters were developed properly that the screenplay had been more carefully thought out that the technical filming of the show had gone better boom mic! that there was cohesiveness to the whole story and that the actual plot had been more fully developed that this movie could have been spectacular. I was even willing to accept the story line until the kids were mysteriously found dutifully waiting in their room when they were supposed to be hiding. After that it went downhill quickly for me.I would have liked to see more exemplary development of the kids' powers  the kind of foreshadowing that is later revealed in how they save the day ie. A scene of Summer controlling the paint balls would have helped me believe better her focused power use in the end. Why spend all that time watching Cindy throw tonweights at a target? How did Dylan's ability with the apple help in the end? What did they do with Tucker to help him learn to control his bloating? How is mind sight related to invisibility? Don't even get me started on Ms. Cox character which I thought she played well.The pacing and development of the two predictable romances was fair but why not let Summer have a little tirade with Dylan for knowing he had seen her dancing?

Zoom needed to grow with each kid to show his own growth and bring out his determination to succeed.Then again succeed at what? I think Tim Allen does a great job with the unknown aspect of the plot. He has no motivation he gives none. But without a believable reason to drive the plot of the kids' training we get what we saw. Also there's nothing socially dangerous about the threat of Concussion  it seems a personal vendetta or overblown fear that Larraby is concerned about  hardly enough to make me feel for him or his cause and unfortunately the movie.Finally let's chew on continuity and technical prowess.

That said allow me to point out that the cute little girl who acts as badly as her speech impediment can't save the film in the same way that the Brady Bunch would not have been popular with a the show devoted to Cindy Brady. There was so much wasted possibility showing us the back ground of these characters the over use of montage and collage editing would not have been needed. Also the film has three apparent villains in the film except none of them are bad and we never know why two of them are necessarily considered bad but that's o.k. because the story was written by someone with ADD or perhaps short term memory loss as significant as the character in Memento.The story has no continuity Tim Allen hates the kids he plays with the kids he feels sorry for the kids no wait he doesn't understand why he's there to train the kids FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!! Nothing in this movie fit together and in the end the super evil villain whom we have waited 90 minutes to see gets a scolding in the last 6 minutes of the movie and then it's over. Didn't Peter Hewitt read the script before filming oh no wait this is the same guy that gave us Bogus Journey you remember the sequel that ended the Bill and Ted franchise. Not to mention the Garfield Movie.. a comic strip so revered for 30 years they made it into a Saturday morning cartoon but the movie that couldn't keep the audiences attention for 90 minutes success based solely on a lack of other children films during its release and parents who grew up with Garfield the previous generation...WHY DOES PETER HEWITT GET WORK why?? Afterallit is the directors responsibility for many things including having a working script and a vision before starting a project  the exceptions being Andy Warhol who's audience base was too stoned to notice and Francis Ford Coppola with Apocalypse Now who had several million dollars to keep his dream afloat. Peter Hewitt should be ashamed of himself for this crap.".

I mean I need to say they introduced the characters like the four kids which was a little six year old girl who could lift up to ten pounds of weight a fat chubby boy who can make his body go even fatter and bigger and can squash anyone in his way a teenage girl who has the power to stare and control any like object or thing with her eyes and a boy who could turn invisible and use his mind to see things from a far distance. The only thing I liked about this movie was just about the end of the film where there was quite a impressive battle with Jack's evil brother Conner and he finally showed off his zooming power to plan on making his brother part of his family again.

When he first appears on screen I was positive he was covered in make up. But as time wore on it became clear that's actually what his head looks like these days. Good Lord...The current state of Chevy Chase's head is actually the most interesting aspect of this movie. The rest of the movie is celluloid child abuse and by that I mean you really need to rethink your parenting skills if you willingly subject your kids to this. It indicates you hate them and punish them severely or you have a desire to warp their minds with absolute crap.Children's movies have a lot of apologists out there. People who will toss out it's a kid's movie what were you expecting? or some equally weak line that makes it seem like stories should treat kids like complete idiots and be poorly structure from the beginning because what do kids know? They're probably stupid enough to buy it.Maybe I was an overly sarcastic child but I know I would have ripped this movie a new one back in the day too. It's garbage heaped on garbage.Why does Courtney Cox have pratfalls? Just because Laurel and Hardy haven't done a lot of work lately there's no need for Courtney Cox to steal their shtick. Nor is there need for her to deliver some of the worst lines in filmed history but whatever. The writer of this film is a demon that needs to be exorcised by a force far greater than me.What abominably forgetful and unobservant nearsighted beast edited this thing? Never have I seen such heinous editing in all my life. Montage after montage is tossed at you and in no way do the events portrayed therein reflect the story that exists when the montage stops. It makes no sense at all. You have Tim Allen just as talentless and unfunny as ever being crabby and pathetic as the wouldbe teacher to these kids then a montage starts and everyone looks like they're having the time of their life then the montage ends and someone whines about how Tim Allen still isn't doing his job and the kids need him and blah blah. All until the next montage starts when everything seems happy again.But wait there's more. Smash Mouth? Are you joking? Who thought in 2006 that a band no one has cared about in 5 years would be good for a soundtrack? A band that has to accompany every single one of the numerous pointless montages. And to keep things consistent all the rest of the songs in the movie are also outdated. But...why? Did they get a deal on a NOW CD or something? Why did they cast a kid who isn't fat as a fat kid and then stuff a pillow down his shirt? Why can I see the boom mic? Didn't anyone at all care about how this movie looked? Why do casting directors always look to Tim Allen when they have a horribly unfunny children's movie to make? I get that he's not funny so it stays in the theme but I can't help but think maybe they didn't intentionally set out to make the movie unfunny.When Rip Torn says I speak Greek not Geek I could almost see all the 4 year olds around the world rolling their eyes as one.I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest the entire end of this movie was improv. It's the only explanation I can think of for why it's so terrible. The entire awful nonsensical movie builds up to this ending with this super villain whose powers are inexplicably nullified by Tim Allen in an absolutely idiotic body stocking and helmet running around him really fast. Then everything is cool again.In a nutshell this is a perfect movie if you want to punish your children for some nameless crime or if you're just an unloving kind of person. For any other reason I can't imagine anyone needs to watch this. Ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is conceivable that a movie about four misfit young people turned superheros could have been made into an enjoyable family film but someone made a serious wrong turn early in the filmmaking process here. To make matters worse rather than abandoning this sinking ship early on or starting over at square one the filmmakers appear to have blindly moved forward producing what can only be described as a disaster that will quickly find a home among the most poorly rated movies at IMDb and leave theaters quickly.The biggest question I have is why? Why was this movie made? Why was no one minding the store? Why was this screenplay ever permitted to see the light of day? I took my five yearold to the movie because the previews looked okay and we love movies. The fact that it took less than five minutes for him to get fidgety after the movie started was probably a good clue to what was ahead. He never did calm down and I'm not sure he paid attention to more than ten minutes of the whole movie.The script and sets are both beyond ridiculous and rarely make any sense at any time during the movie.

	onyx:emotionText "It is conceivable that a movie about four misfit young people turned superheros could have been made into an enjoyable family film but someone made a serious wrong turn early in the filmmaking process here. To make matters worse rather than abandoning this sinking ship early on or starting over at square one the filmmakers appear to have blindly moved forward producing what can only be described as a disaster that will quickly find a home among the most poorly rated movies at IMDb and leave theaters quickly.The biggest question I have is why? Why was this movie made? Why was no one minding the store? Why was this screenplay ever permitted to see the light of day? I took my five yearold to the movie because the previews looked okay and we love movies. The fact that it took less than five minutes for him to get fidgety after the movie started was probably a good clue to what was ahead. He never did calm down and I'm not sure he paid attention to more than ten minutes of the whole movie.The script and sets are both beyond ridiculous and rarely make any sense at any time during the movie.

	schema:headline " Worst movie i've seen this year";
	schema:reviewBody "At first I thought this movie had promise with Tim Allen and Chevy Chase creating some comedic elements. Once you get through roughly 5 minutes of the movie you realize you're just sticking around to see how much worse the film can get Can you say Troll 2?.Obviously this movie is a copoff of Sky High and a very poor one at that. The scenes just look randomly put together and make absolutely no sense at all Like the part where they go into a flying saucer. I honestly felt sorry for some of the cast members Especially Courtney Cox who was legitimately trying to make a poor script work.Basically i'll just give you a synopsis of the plot and leave you to decide if this Cracker Jack box of a plot allures you. Tim Allen is Zoom Or as he likes to call himself Jack. He and his brother Concussion use to fight along side each other with a team of superheroes. The government wanted them to be even more powerful so they shot the lot of them with radiation I think they called it G17 but i'm too lazy to watch the movie to remember. Basically it makes all of their powers go tenfold and subsequently makes Concussion mentally unstable. He turns on his team and his brother and apparently wipes them all out but Zoom. Of course this film is so weak that they don't show that part of the movie at all That would be too intense of action for us PG fans to enjoy.Now go 30 years later. Zoom has lost his powers and is a moody mechanic. You really don't get any character development. He's basically just shown as a washed up loser. Courtney comes in to lure him into a trap Why I dunno as they could've just shot him with a tranquilizer dart to begin with which they do later on anyways. He's basically kidnapped to train a bunch of adolescents with super powers. Don't even get me started on how annoying some of these child actors can be. The girl that calls herself Princess should be banned from film for another decade. What is it with some child actors that they just come across as annoying more then cute and don't have any substance to lend to the film She's definitely no Haley Joel Osment.Anyways rather then train the kids Zoom is bitter and he doesn't even know that his brother is still alive He's apparently in another dimension. All throughout the movie he basically insults the kids and refuses to train them. It isn't until Courtney Cox finally tears through his defenses that he realizes what is at stake and even then he obviously feels betrayed as he is training the teens to combat his brother.The fight scene of the movie lasts a whole whopping 2 minutes. My gosh it was short and very weakly made. Afterwards I couldn't help but chuckle as Concussion gets defeated and just acts all hunkie dory towards the people that defeated him. He doesn't ask why his brother is in his 50's They portray it as him having partial amnesia.Anyways hopefully I didn't offend too many people with this review.Bobby".

	onyx:emotionText "At first I thought this movie had promise with Tim Allen and Chevy Chase creating some comedic elements. Once you get through roughly 5 minutes of the movie you realize you're just sticking around to see how much worse the film can get Can you say Troll 2?.Obviously this movie is a copoff of Sky High and a very poor one at that. The scenes just look randomly put together and make absolutely no sense at all Like the part where they go into a flying saucer. I honestly felt sorry for some of the cast members Especially Courtney Cox who was legitimately trying to make a poor script work.Basically i'll just give you a synopsis of the plot and leave you to decide if this Cracker Jack box of a plot allures you. Tim Allen is Zoom Or as he likes to call himself Jack. He and his brother Concussion use to fight along side each other with a team of superheroes. The government wanted them to be even more powerful so they shot the lot of them with radiation I think they called it G17 but i'm too lazy to watch the movie to remember. Basically it makes all of their powers go tenfold and subsequently makes Concussion mentally unstable. He turns on his team and his brother and apparently wipes them all out but Zoom. Of course this film is so weak that they don't show that part of the movie at all That would be too intense of action for us PG fans to enjoy.Now go 30 years later. Zoom has lost his powers and is a moody mechanic. You really don't get any character development. He's basically just shown as a washed up loser. Courtney comes in to lure him into a trap Why I dunno as they could've just shot him with a tranquilizer dart to begin with which they do later on anyways.

	schema:reviewBody "Will Smith. That's all you've got to say and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well from the looks of it Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film which is what we get in his latest movie Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma charm and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh cheer cry and even root for his character who is a total ass as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer's desk in quite some time. To me what it seems like is that the writers of the film loved the idea started off extremely strong and then began to realize that how hard it is to sustain a simplistic idea over the course of a full length motion picture and it is because of this that Hancock is relatively short. The writers' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing. The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot. The character that serves as Hancock's enemy in the finale isn't even well acted. The person is laughable.This is an action movie so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie. However I felt the effects could have used a few more weeks of polishing in the editing room. The camera is also quite crampy. I also have problems with the film's score as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have. I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film which is not the end. The action scenes while entertaining and original were not long enough to engage the audience like say The Incredible Hulk nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted.The film's strength rides on its three stars. Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual and that should come as no surprise. Smith's charisma is enough to make anyone happy and it's so easy to see why so many people love him. Theron is always a sight to behold except in Monster lol and this film is no different. I enjoyed her performance the most especially in the second act and the beginning of the third. Jason Bateman who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron is great as usual and likable marking a change from his recent turn in Juno. There really isn't another performance to note and part of Hancock's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters. It should also be noted that the kid who played Bateman's son was absolutely adorable.Hancock is the classic case of great idea and mediocre execution. I can see this idea being remade years from now and pulled off even better. It's not a fault of Peter Berg the film's director as the real weakness is in the screenplay which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act. It's not a bad film by any means nor is it great. It's in between okay and good.".

It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kidfriendly summer blockbuster that they are. However both halves have their own merits  the first being the humour and the second being the almost tragic origin mythos.

It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals people will be angry if a vigilante has a bad attitude people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a mask of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun.".

There are many quotable scenes funny moments and good special effects that you haven't seen in other movies before.

It felt like most of the idea came from how in those epic superhero movies the heroes cause a lot of damage to the city and its people. But as the story goes forward the story does become richer and even if I hate the word more epic.It's refreshing to see a character like Hancock. He is like an asshole clearly an antihero it's already refreshing not to see a brooding white man antihero mind you but there's more to him. And what's important we actually can see how he feels about the people kind of hating him even if he tries to save them. It's not just superficially shrugged off. I also love how the music is used so well with the story. When the movie becomes more like a superhero movie the soundtrack feels more like a classic score for that type of movies. Hancock is an entertaining and a surprisingly good superhero movie. I think I would've preferred something simpler something more refreshing but Hancock is good for what it is. Of course it's a bit typical but it has several new elements and it has great cast. And while the story is not great there are a lot of things I like about it. Hancock definitely is worth seeing whether or not you are tired with the typical Marvel or DC movies we get.".

The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the cute button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the Summer Blockbuster and those who enjoy Will Smith.".

This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the cute button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the Summer Blockbuster and those who enjoy Will Smith.";

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps I'm being generous but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the Powers That Be comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the Shadow State comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.Will Smith and Charlize Theron do a great job. The hero is flawed but he's not a wimp. The movie's biggest weakness is the pacing. Some of the special effects go by so fast that you don't get to appreciate them. Some of the drama plays out so slowly that you might be wondering why they don't rush it along. The movie is faithful to the trailer. It's tough writing a spoilerfree review of this since there are some great twists in the plot.".

	schema:headline " A good idea... poorly executed!";
	schema:reviewBody "Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man Jason Bateman who is married to the lovely Mary Charlize Theron and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character his apathy and self loathing  exhibited by his alcoholism are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted black American men have been marginalized over the years but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however examples that come to mind and help to support this theory are such great physical talents like Ed Moses Shaquille O'Neil Carl Lewis Jesse Owen etc some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing engaging and quite plausible given its premise but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky throwing each other across blocks and through buildings and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichs that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed backstory that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty with frantic zooms sharp fastpans and steadycam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock.".

This technique is overused in the last few years especially in action scenes to the point where now it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself what the hell is THAT about? The same lazy sloppy style was used in Constand Gardner another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy angst or action...but doesn't play in others.

Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half with scenes covered in the trailer such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat and some new ones not seen in the trailer Hancock halfnaked his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.After he's changed to be more decent it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.It was rather overt that Mary Charlize Theron was going to be involved with Hancock especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a postparty scene in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.Oh ya that's right. She's a superhero thing too.Then starts the whole lolwut? moment of the film as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock her husband and all of us the whole deal and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD though it is PC never mentioned in pairs and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.Quite frankly that's only my bestguess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stickin the end it doesn't even matter what they are as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other they both lose their powers and become mortal which is why Hancock lost his memory because every time they get too close to each other in history something bad happens and they have to depart until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital not knowing who he was and a nurse asked him for his John Hancock as in signature.The story doesn't seem to change but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off as they start thinking wait they're destined to be together then wait they can't be together or they both become mortal and die then wait they were built together by namelessgod then wait they weren't meant to be together then wait they're bound by fate to always be together and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.The entirety of the movie's secondhalf plot no longer deals with any typical good guy vs bad guy or hero must overcome archetype as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.The entire focus is around explaining then reexplaining then convoluting the entire concept behind these two godly beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plotholes the biggest one being If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again but to leave the entire city and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.The ending is also nonsensical as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquorstore holdup who knows how far away from Mary's house and when he and Mary are in the hospital he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.Ultimately the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plothole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie Because the movie never really does explain why he shouldwould stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia and despite all of this revelation Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good.

A jerk.I like it I like it. He's like a superhero dr. House or something right? Right. Only less witty and more bitter. We can also make him a drunk.Well... I dunno if it would fly. Perhaps if we could get Will Smith to do the role. People dig Will Smith.I'm with you there. Will Smith flying around insulting people.. man this will be great! Right. But we have to go with it somewhere we can't just let him do superhero stuff while being a jerk this would get old pretty fast. How about he somehow gets involved with a PR specialist who will like try to improve his public image? Great idea! And wait..wait.. what if we get that Michael Bluth guy from Arrested Development to play umm... Michael Bluth the PR guy? Terrific! We're seriously up to something. Let's write! scrib scrib scrib... hours pass.. Congrats we have a hit! Let's celebrate!I'll get the champagne! Umm hold on just a minute...What?I just realized.. this script is only good for about 45 minutes of the movie! Hour tops!Oh no! What can we do? Can we pad it a little?No! It's unpaddable! I even added a female lead as Michael Bluth's wife it still only added about 5 minutes of the movie. Nope sorry. This is a dud.Oh come on...Look look..perhaps we can think of something. Think think...how do we further the story along put in like some kind of a twist...They are all dead or something?No no.. how about..scrib scrib.. hours passHmmm... I don't think this will work. No chance.Why?Just look at it! It's stupid insultingly illogical and the ending.. it's horrible. Look I've greenlighted Jaws 4 so I know what I'm talking about.But but.. Will Smith.. Bluth guy.. maybe we can get Charlize for the wife...I know! But this stuff... it.. just does not make any sense! The second half is nothing like the first half. It kills the movie! Yeah perhaps we should just rewrite the whole thing..but..know what?What?Remember I am legend? With Will Smith?Yeees....That one also had a great first half right? Yes. The first half was good.And the second half royally sucked right?Riiight...And it still was a success right? I see.. what you're saying is that a Will Smith flick can have a great first half idiotic second half and still come out a winner?Exactly!Well it IS kind of late and I'm kinda tired.. What gives let's do it. Although it does sound kinda hancock to me. Btw how do we call this thing?".

	schema:headline " Here comes the Hancock!";
	schema:reviewBody "He is alcoholic least bothered about your concerns and doesn't even give a damn about huge property loses the city faces with his heroic stunts. Thats Hancock for all of you!. This is a brand new super hero with a twisted mind and weird lifestyle. Its really good to see some one not coming out of a comic book as an adaptation. So all you other super heroes get aside...here comes the Hancock.What is interesting about this movie is that none of the promotions were focused on highlighting any of his heroic side. A hero is some one who fights for justice and his people but here nothing like that. That triggered lot of excitement and a new set of fanfollowing for this super hero. Well I'm also one of them! I admit I am a big fan of Will Smith as an actor and as a person but this is primarily because he is a real hard working dedicated and confident individual. A hero in reality. The best part about Willie is that you really see and feel the efforts he is putting into his work.Like any other super hero movie this is not about fighting with a super villain and his mission to conquer the world but self exploring of an individual with extra powers. And thats why I like this movie. Something different. The director and script writer has done a good job narrating it. Movie is technically very advanced with some amazing special effects like Willie throwing the whale back in to the water catching some junkies who have stolen money from a bank all his flying scenes stopping the train and fighting with Charlize Theron.The story starts with scenes about how Willie's boozing all day catching some freaks and how people of the city hate him. He is least bothered about any one not even him self. Story takes a twist when he saved life of a PR guy. This PR guy has nothing exciting in his professional life and trying hard to make a good life with his wife Charlize Theron and son. This whole incident of Hancock saving his life hits him with an idea to do a makeover of Hancock. From bad to good from stubborn to be humble and kind to others from 'who cares' to 'I care'. Watching this whole shift is the most interesting part of the movie. How he convinces Willie to go for a surrender to police and Willie's inner fight to stay in the custody with out using his powers and how he eventually takes on the role of Hancock the savior. It's sheer fun watching it all that happening in front of you.Well there are some instances where I feel Hancock as a movie lacks that 100 punch. You think of Superman Spiderman Batman or any other super hero and what comes first to your mind is the image of that hero with a unique background score. In case of Hancock there is no such theme song and that's something the producers could've have done it. Hancock is a new super hero never thought of never ever imagined. He has a different style with unexpected attitude and a theme song or a special background music would have helped in establishing a strong image of Hancock in to audiences mind. As I said earlier its not about fighting with a super villain but still I wanted to see more actions and stunts. Sorry I can't help it! But its a super hero anyways and everybody likes to see his or her super hero doing loads of action scenes. The movie is brilliantly executed till the climax comes. The reason and explanation of who is Hancock and what relates him with Charlize Theron is just too fast for the audience. Director could have taken little more time in explaining all this by providing more meat and content. Especially when you know that its all about exploring the inner you and what are you made of. This thing is very tricky and how you handle it and explain all this to audience is a real challenge. The nameHancock is also bit strange and totally unwanted. I couldn't believe it when I heard this name for the first time! Why Hancock? try something more edgy with more substance loaded with some punch.It's a sheer excitement watching Willie as a super hero and joining the league of Batman and Superman. You will always get appreciation on doing new things with lot of hard work and ideas put into your work. Same with Hancock. Audience have liked Hancock and his fanfollowing will grow day by day to give much needed hype for his second stint on 70mm silver screen. Just to add Willie almost looks like Paresh Rawal One of India's greatest character artists in the poster where they are showing a closeup of Hancock's face wearing dark sunglasses. Its like Babu Bhai of HeraPheri wearing shades instead of his typical glasses!! For those who do not know who is Babu Bhai suggest you should watch a movie called 'HeraPheri' with subtitles. In the end here's a big round of applause on behalf of all Willie fans waiting arms wide open to give him one tight hug! Welcome on board Hancock.".

	schema:reviewBody "The moment I saw the preview for Hancock this just looked like the most ridicules movie that could be made I was sure that it was going to flop or get horrendous reviews. But after talking to people who saw it it was halfhalf of either they loved it or hated it so I guess this was just a movie I had to see for myself. So I watched it yesterday I am dumbfounded I'm the halfhalf I loved it and I hated it. I felt like the beginning was just silly and rushed not to mention that the villain was just under developed and didn't have any depth to why he was so bad. But however I did like the little twist they had which I refuse to give away even though I did predict it sadly it's one of those things you'll have to see. But I also did enjoy the originality it's not just a typical super hero movie with all the stereotypes it was John Hancockwhich by the way should've taken place in Chicago after it's famous building.John Hancock is a homeless bum who just has a bad attitude along with a horrible drinking problem he also is different he is a super hero. The only problem? He causes a lot of damage when he saves the day and doesn't care what people think. But when a failing advertiser Ray Embroy is saved by John Ray offers John a chance to look good and be the ultimate super hero. But Ray's wife Mary isn't so excited and has a little secret about her and John. But Ray is determined and will make sure that Hancock is a great super hero for the whole city.Hancock is over all an alright film it's not bad by any means but I feel like it could have been so much more with a better script. Not to mention some of the camera angles were a little extreme there were times where I thought the cameraman was on a tiltawhirl and I felt sick. But for the story I'll admit that it was original and fun at times Will Smith is a good actor I will always admit that but it seems like his movieswhich are always released around the fourth of July you notice have become like a love letter to him and how great he is. Hancock is worth the look but I'd recommend the rental it's just a notch under a great blockbuster.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Last summer a superhero film stormed the box offices both sides of the Atlantic. It was called Hancock a film about an alcoholic superhero played by Will Smith. A bundle of laughs? NOThe film follows the path of a rude disgusting irritating superhero called John Hancock Will Smith. The public hate him he causes millions of dollars worth of damage is a drunk and makes constantly obscene comments about people. But one day he happens to save the life of a PR Guru Jason Bateman and is offered a chance to save his image. This starts of his avid career as a superhero. Until a chance encounter causes the film to dive bomb into the realms of beyond crap.It slots perfectly into the genre of comedy action superhero adventure romance scifi fantasy and crime. Though this great mixture of genres usually benefits films with Hancock it just doesn't work. The film jumps between the various genres so quickly that you never have the actual time to register what's happening and whether the scene is meant to be sarcastic or sentimental. The style changes drastically too between sad violin music and the latest chart hiphop between big set action pieces and amusing family dinners. This attempt at appealing to everybody fails miserably.Personally I would recommend this film to people who have nothing better to do with their time then watch Will Smith throw cars around and make obscenely offensive comments about people. This is not a family film due to the crude remarks excessive language and unnecessary violence basically if you showed it to your grandma she would have a heart attack and spend the rest of her life in hospital only able to move the big toe of her left foot.The acting in it is frankly amateur or should I say appalling. None of the actors seam to like what they are doing they don't even seam to be trying they're just acting normally. The producers have obviously tried very hard to get people to hate Will Smith and it works he is possibly the most unlikeable character in the whole film. British actor Eddie Marsan plays the bad guy Red he is acceptable apart the slightly dodgy attempt at an American accent. Not Good. If I was being nice I would say that Will Smith shows quite a good performance as the disgusting superhero then I look through his previous films and realise that all his characters are basically the same. Only for really diehard fans.The special effects are disappointing especially when he attempts to land on a pavement in front of some guys house. You feel as if you are watching a 1963 Batman film before they had discovered the wonders of CGI. In fact the CGI is so disappointing it's actually hilarious especially at the end when you just really want somebody to die but they just carry on throwing tea urns and hospital beds around while a giant CGI'd thunderstorm rages outside the window not a good look.In comparison to other films in the genre of SuperheroComedy it looks terrible. Take Hellboy for instance the tongue in cheek humour of Guillermo Del Toro combined with the great fantasy creatures in the style of Pans Labyrinth and sarcastic superhero the film does a really great job. However next to Hellboy the film Hancock just looks more annoyingly terribly irritatingly amateur. If you're looking for a decent superhero film with laughs see Hellboy if you're looking for a dark chilling superhero film see The Dark Knight and if you're looking for a boring arrogant overdone superhero film see Hancock.Overall this film is possibly the worst superhero film of the summer. Only see it if you have to.".

Hancock is yet another movie in what I fear will be a longer and longer line of disappointments. Smith is okay not one of our greatest actors but for the most part entertaining in most of what he does. I read that the part was first offered to Chappelle which probably would not have made this movie any worse or maybe better since no one expects much out of him. Audiences do expect more from Smith and when he fails as they all do we seem to be more harsh myself included. Theron an award winner no less well I wonder what she was thinking when she considered this role. What we have is a downandout super hero who no one likes since whenever he saves someone he seems to cause more damage than if he did not. He's a depressed and lonely guy but we only know this because another character tells us so. Otherwise the audience figures he's just a drunk but does not know why. In the first scene with Smith and Theron we all figure out that something is going on and know that she probably has the same powers he does. The scene where they kiss then she slams him out of the house with a fridge made no sense. Of course we do not find out the why to all of this GO AWAY! from Mary until the end of the movie so you have to sit around until then or do what a lot of people do lately and fast forward. But what really ruined this movie other than a bad script roboticlike performances with monotone dialogue and overdone FX was the jittery camera work. Talk about needing some Dramamine before watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chocolat  out of  Chocolat gives new meaning to one of my favorite film phrases eye candy. As the title would suggest it is a very sweet film and not only for the gobs and gobs of luscious mouthwatering little morsels.  There are parts of the film that look like they could belong to a particularly delectable episode of Martha Stewart Living' but if you can get past the pangs of hunger it will certainly inflict you will find there is a lot more to this seemingly charming and simple story.The film plays in the style of all whimsical children's fairy tales while at the same time blending in a series of very serious adult themes. It chronicles the exploits of single mother Vianne Rocher played as usual to a wonderful effect by Juliette Binoche and her sugary but confused 6yearold daughter Anouk Victoire Thivisol who blow in on a forceful winter wind to the small rural French town of LansquenetsousTannes. There they open a small chocolate shop.  Now this seems innocent enough but the people of the town have different views.  For one the shop has been opened at the very unwelcomed time of Lent a religious fast during which new temptations certainly aren't invited.  Secondly the town's new residents refuse to attend the Sunday morning worship service.  Vianne soon finds herself to be the center of the town gossip and distaste led by the mayor Alfred Molina.  The battle heats up between allegedly pagan Vianne and the highly conservative stuffedshirt townspeople.  At start it seems the Rochers are losing but the fight soon turns as the townsfolk begin to discover the mouthmelting effects of Vianne's wonderful tasteteasing treats.Misadventure after misadventure occur as the couple come in contact with a wide array of colorful characters just when you think he must be an extra in comes Johnny Depp solving their problems while at the same time selling their chocolates.  The moral is left fairly open and can be interpreted in many ways.  My personal views are these  That to be good and righteous doesn't mean you can't be different you should accept everyone not necessarily for who they are but for what they are human beings. Everyone deserves a proper chance.  In the end all characters  realize the error of their ways and live together happily and harmoniously.Chocolat has opened to mixed reviews.  Some critics find it to be overly simple but I think that it is the movie's simplicity that drives it to become so charmingly enthralling.  Granted at times it does become at bit silly but it all ends to a good warm effect.  Apparently the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences share my views as the film was nominated for five academy awards Best Picture Best Actress Binoche Best Supporting Actress Judi Dench Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score.Chocolat is a mouthwatering piece of movie magic.  Definitely worth a look!  It has it's flaws but they are easily covered up by it's great performances particularly by Binoche beautiful scenery giddy musical score and delightful story.

	schema:headline " A Sweet Delight!";
	schema:reviewBody "A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth Chocolat' directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid 50s as if borne on the winds of fate a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France with a young daughter Anouk Victoire Thivisol in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor Comte de Reynaud Alfred Molina with no respite or help even from the town's young and inexperienced priest Pere Henri Hugh O'Conor.  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side and it puts the freespirited Vianne who has something of the gypsy in her to the test. As a director Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer which is to say quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dreamlike sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned though it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast many of whom give Oscar worthy memorable performances beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench Amande meanwhile does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter Caroline CarrieAnne Moss deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son Luc Aurelien ParentKoening and Lena Olin Josephine is outstanding as well as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit. Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina too as the narrow minded Comte gives possibly the best performance of his career while Johnny Depp Roux lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people. Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood Guillaume Peter Stormare Serge and Leslie Caron Madame Audel.  Possibly the sweetest' film of the year as well as one of the best Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark an uplifting entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates after all.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful movie from masterdirector Lasse Hallstrm The Cider House Rules The Shipping News What's Eating Gilbert Grape with wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche Judi Dench and Hallstrm's wife Lena Olin. Chocolat is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a chocolaterie in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale the characters the story the music the whole idea of an old conservative French village I liked the movie a lot. It has everything a laugh a cry a wonderful story and some amazing acting performances. Juliette Binoche is made to play this kind of caring and sensitive women. Although Johnny Depp had a very small part in this movie he was excellent as always. I personally think that Judi Dench gave one of her best performances in Chocolat truly great acting! Maybe not Hallstrm's best I liked What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Cider House Rules more but certainly worth watching.810".

	onyx:emotionText "Beautiful movie from masterdirector Lasse Hallstrm The Cider House Rules The Shipping News What's Eating Gilbert Grape with wonderful performances by Juliette Binoche Judi Dench and Hallstrm's wife Lena Olin. Chocolat is a very beautiful and touching movie about a single mother with a daughter who decides to open a chocolaterie in a very conservative village during Lent. What follows almost looks like a fairytale the characters the story the music the whole idea of an old conservative French village I liked the movie a lot. It has everything a laugh a cry a wonderful story and some amazing acting performances. Juliette Binoche is made to play this kind of caring and sensitive women. Although Johnny Depp had a very small part in this movie he was excellent as always. I personally think that Judi Dench gave one of her best performances in Chocolat truly great acting!

Does it not strike you as a little humorous when someone looks at a menu knows exactly what they want but then decides not to get it for fear they will not only offend their God but offend their own nature?  Lasse Hollstrom's latest film Chocolat knows all about that person.Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne Rosher a chocolate shop owner who not only gets people to talk about their forbidden fruits but also has the ability to make people happily indulge in them.  She along with her daughter Anouk Victoire Thivisol moves into a quiet French village during Lent and opens her chocolate shop. The townspeople look in the window admire the confections for a moment then walk on by. One diabetic woman Amande Judi Dench decides to stay for a little while.  Vianne puts a colorful ceramic plate on the table and spins it around.  She asks what Amande sees in the image. Amande tells her and Vianne presumes to know exactly what kind of confection Amande would like the best. We could only dream of such customer service this time of year.Amande's young grandson Luc an aspiring artist also can't seem to stay away from the chocolate store in spite of the wishes of his churchgoing mother CarrieAnne Moss.  Actually the whole town goes to the same church and it doesn't take long before the Mayor Alfred Molena has his say against the shop since many of the chocolates have been carved into the shapes of naked women and have names such as Nipples of Venus.  The chocolates also seem to be changing people's behavior.  A sexless joyless married couple all of a sudden can't keep their Butterfingers off each other.The nonchurchgoing Vianne eventually becomes the center of the town's controversy but she soon has company after the arrival of the river rats a group of Irish merchants who travel by boat to pawn off whatever they can much to the dismay of the townspeople.  Here Vianne meets Roux Johnny Depp and they become fast friends and well you know the rest.The story of Chocolat could be described in one sentenceFootloose only instead of dancing it's chocolates.  However in this film we have some magic realism to deal with.  Unfortunately the film does not quite develop its own magical' ideas.  It gets bogged down by the usual story elements an d subplots we often see with this kind of story.  We get the battered wife who finds solace in Vianne's shop and we get the burning of a particular place here a boat to further drive home the point that outsiders will not be tolerated.  I would have liked a little more magic.'On the other hand we do get some magic in the form of the performances. Juliette Binoche actually smiles and acts charming as opposed to the sorrowful and pensive roles in which we usually see her.  What a relief to finally see her carrying a picture with warmth confidence and wit as well as beauty.  The guitartwanging Johnny Depp reuniting with his Gilbert Grape director with a ponytail and an Irish accent compliments her with a rugged look and easygoing charm that makes his flybytheseatofhispants character a perfect soulmate for Binoche.I recommend stopping by the candy counter or sneaking in some Fannie May confections before the movie starts.  This film does for chocolate what Big Night did for Italian food. In spite of its flaws Chocolat makes for a far more rewarding and satisfying film experience than Hollstrom's last feelgooder the overrated Cider House Rules.  In the end something about this film won me over.  It could have been the irrisistable theme of great food being as close to Godliness as one could get.  It could have been the sights of chocolates being created and turned into glorious statuesque works of art.  It could have been the enjoyable cast each member dealing with their hidden anguish and repression.  Or it could have been all of the above combined with the captivating and alluring grace of Juliette Binoche.We all have our vices.".

Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time Vianne the owner of the chocolaterie struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others. The major characters include the mayor Alfred Molina of the village who is always trying to do what is right even though his own private world is that of despair. The conflict between him and Vianne Juliette Binoche is very evident. Then the character Roux Johnny Depp is considered a river rat by the villagers but ends up as Vianne's own personal piece of chocolate that opens her eyes to happiness. Josephine Lena Olin is another woman in the village whose husband Serge Peter Stormare is very abusive and when given the opportunity to leave and begin working with Vianne she jumps on it. Armande Judi Dench is the landlord of Chocolatery and is faced with a broken relationship with her daughter. Armande does what she wants and says what she wants and her witty comments immediately draw you in. This movie is much more than romance it's magic through the guilty pleasures of chocolate. The actors and actresses make you feel like you are right there wanting to experience life as they wish to. The costumes and setting throughout the movie is beautiful and make a remarkable contribution to the movie. The setting is important to this movie because it helps you become drawn in like you are truly there in this small village. The village buildings are beautiful as well as many other locations throughout the movie. The costumes are important as everyone wears very dull colors while Vianne the outsider wears red heals and bright colors. The movie is a must see and is very entertaining. The way the chocolate scene's become magical makes you want to be right there with her and become a part of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I borrowed Chocolat from my friend I really didn't know anything about it or really what my expectations should be other than that it's name made me hungry and there was something that was going to be happening about chocolate somewhere in the movie hahaha. Well when the movie started up I got the main concept right away and was immediately interested which they were very satisfactory at material like that by that I mean they weren't trying so hard to get the point through of what they wanted you to understand they just followed the expression go with the flow and that definitely worked out for the unquestionable better for this movie!I immediately fell in love with Juliette Binoche's character Vianne because they do an excellent job at establishing her character to where you really care for her and admire her same for many of the other main and supporting characters like Josephine Armande and Roux. This movie had amazing character structure which in the end benefited it greatly because that is one of the things I look for in every movie that they are able to introduce their characters with strong effective personalities and dispositions you understand what they are basically like right away and magnificently all the actors and actresses were able to do that with their characters as I have already stated and praised a couple of times Juliette Binoche deserved an Oscar and CarrieAnn Moss Johnny Depp Lena Olin Judi Dench Alfed Molina etc. etc. all gave astoundingly awardworthy performances as well!Second of all the plot is absolutely miraculous. I couldn't help but be so mesmerized and entranced by how wonderfully they were able to create this strange but lovable atmosphere of these people not wanting to accept change to their quiet and cardboard little town but then something so simple as chocolate is able to turn all their perspectives on life around all at once which is a great and true message The simplest things sometimes can make the biggest impact and this movie definitely showed that and handled the idea incredibly well.I love this movie and the whole time I was watching I had never wanted to consume chocolate so much in my life! I truly think it is really something special when a movie can just make the audience want to go out and do something or want to cooperate and or feel what the characters are feeling and I mean that in a good sense of course because the whole time I was watching this movie I just wanted to experience these amazing experiences that the characters were experiencing and I even felt jealousy come over me as they obtained these opportunities!This film certainly is nowhere near bad and or mediocre in any way! It is a masterpiece! One of the best films I have ever seen actually no lie there! I didn't find one flaw but it's just I do think it's one of those films where I believe there are overall a few better movies than it and by that I mean while this movie is breathtakingly stunning in it's whole trial there are movies that I surprisingly do enjoy more. Regardless Chocolat is a fun beautifully crafted completely alluring work of art from start to finish and by the end I was astonished at how fantastic this movie really turned out to be. I recommend to anyone who loves an enthralling plot that commingles with unforgettable performances behind unforgettable characters nonstop entertainment and a little bit of a chocolaty sweet touch here and there...".

It made me hungry happy and utterly at home in the mysterious and yet somehow familiar landscapes and plot lines that the author creates for the audience to enter. The writing is almost poetic and the characters are all completely believable and true to type. The chocolate shop is not a shop at all but rather a metaphor we are all drawn into. I was inspired by the courage of the protagonist a strong female role model and the events of the film that never let us rest for a moment. Definitely this one gets two thumbs up.".

For example for the boy with a spicy personality bitter chocolate she offered. And to the woman depressed scarred by lifewith bitter personality she then offered spicy chocolate. The chocolat itself represented some kind of a freedom and liberation of the repressed side of the persons. Very interesting and it's definitely a film to be appreciated. The way the city reacts is also very curious. The characters which appears in the film have special kind of personality and a subtle meaning in them as well. And is up to the viewer to discover what these meanings are.The art direction is also good very suggestive and definitely is important to the film overall. The natural aura that the film exudes has much to do with the excellent work in the lightning and in the scenariowith rudimentary but harmful stores in the small Italian city. The soundtrack is wonderful and fits perfectly each scene. The acting is overall very good Alfred MolinaJulliete Binoche and Judi Dench specifically are stunning in their roles.I highly recommend this film. 8.210".

The characters are well built and very well played.The most annoying thing about this film is the mix of accent real or false. I admit it's probably because French is my mother tongue but still. You eventually get used to it though. Also the ending is just too perfect especially concerning the mayor. I know the whole story has a fairy tale undertone but he completely reverse not only his view on the stranger but also his demeanor and his religious views on the sanctity of marriage. It's too much.Still I recommend to everyone especially if you like a bit of romance and tall tales.".

The costumes and the scenery are very believable really capturing the era and the atmosphere of that time. But the story is good as well without getting boring speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate can turn everything upside down.

Anyway Lena Olin plays a battered wife who is taken in by Binoche's character. Dame Judi Dench plays a 70 year old widow full of life and she earns an academy award nomination no matter what she does in the film industry. Anyway British Alfred Molina plays the French mayor. Scandinavian Lena Olin plays a key role as well. American Johnny Dep plays a rogue pirate who he and his gang of vagabonds wash up on the riverbanks and entice Binoche's character. The film is alright and somewhat above average. OF course some of it at times can be absurd. My favorite moment is the housewife who remarks about her husband's lack of interest in intimacy and she was played by a French actress as well. The film is done well by Lasse Hallstrom but I don't think it's Oscar worthy. American Carrie Anne Moss also has a role playing Dench's daughter who forbids her son from knowing his grandmother. You can figure what happens.".

In a sense the story is a fairy tale about a good witch who turns a town upside down mainly due to the villagers' fear and ignorance and does good for them despite themselves. Beautifully shot wonderfully written and delightfully acted the film is as near perfection among romantic comedydramas as I have seen in a long time. Binoche is most fetching Olin fine as a battered wife who blooms it is magical just for a film buff to contemplate how the actresses and their roles have changed since they were together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being Molina a wonderful villain and Judi Dench as a crusty diabetic landlady somehow made me cry nearly every time she came on screen.

	schema:headline " Very tasty in small amounts but is too slight and obvious to really please";
	schema:reviewBody "In a quiet little French village morals are upheld and restraint is a virtue. So tongues get wagging when Vianne Rocher opens up a chocolate shop  during Lent of all times. The Comte De Reynaud decides to do all he can to force her out of the village although her enticing treats start to win over some of the residents even if her standards don't. With the arrival of some river drifters things become harder for Rocher especially as she tries to help some of the villagers who have been trapped behind the walls of respectability.With heaps of praise for this movie and the cast featuring the promise of the always interesting Johnny Depp I took the chance to watch this film on television recently hoping for an enjoyable time. I did enjoy it but aside from the sweet coating the film enjoys the film failed to have anything like a satisfying centre. The plot is fairly standard stuff where Vianne opens up the village to enjoy more about life and free them from restraint  it doesn't have much in the way of surprises or depth to it and it is telling that an advert recently for butter has managed to tell the same story in about 30 seconds. However it is sweetly enjoyable anyway and I did find it to be quite charming in its own way  only really towards the final third does the lack of depth really become exposed and the film doesn't leave any lasting impression other than a general sense of charm.Depp's involvement is a fine example of this  he is prominent in all the marketing but really he just plays to his looks and his sexy presence without ever adding layers to his character not his fault but that of the script. Binoche is better and does try hard to make more of her character than just being all sweetness and light likewise Moss Stormare Dench Olin and Koenig all try hard to bring out complex characters and dark layers and they nearly succeed but the film seems more interested in being charming and sweet. Molina is very good until the ending forces him down an obvious path but until then he does tend to steal most of his scenes. Depp is very charming and a welcome addition despite representing the failings of the film.Direction is good and the film is charming but I didn't think this was enough. The plot goes just where you expect it to and asks too much of the audience to be won over by charm with no substance. Don't get me wrong it is a nice film and was enough for me to enjoy in front of a nice coal fire on a cold night but by the end of the film I was left wishing it had managed to do more than just be nice.".
