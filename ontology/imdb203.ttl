Those of his generation remember him fondly while those in the younger generations have no idea who he is. He spends most of his time hanging out with his friends Ian also an actor and Donald or visiting with his wife Valerie for who he has great affection but with who he no longer lives. His acting career is virtually over he only taking roles on the odd occasion when he needs the money. Ian has decided to invite his young greatniece Jessie from the provinces to come and stay with him basically to act as his caregiver in case he falls ill but also to be his companion. He envisions listening to Bach with her and her cooking him food to which he is accustomed. Jessie's stay is nothing as he envisions. She doesn't know how to cook she drinks all his alcohol and she has unrealistic visions of what she will accomplish in her life. Maurice however sees in Jessie a person who can help him ...";

Quickly paced sharply written and deftly acted Venus is a movie that unfolds so quickly that one is immersed in the action from the very start. The background is actors living off small pensions and acting jobs in working class London. The cinematography catches the dullness of the surroundings and one is easily transported into this world of sameness peppered by occasional wonderful lapses back into the magic of acting and well written lines. Their world and also the girl's world is turned upside down by meeting one another.O'Toole is wonderful as Maurice the exraconteur who proves that love lust flirtation and marvel are attributes that never go away with age. It's a delight to see these feelings rekindled in the old man and O'Toole is the master of bringing zest and poignancy to the screen. Just going to see him quote Shakespeare is worth it alone. The setting in which he does it is unexpected and moving.Jodie Whitaker is indeed a fresh new face. Without airs this actress expertly matches wits with O'Toole. She conveys the right amount of grittiness insecurity and bravado as a teenage girl thrust into the big city without a concrete plan would. The growth in her character takes place when an event that she has caused takes place and she must either own up to what she has done or forever be stuck in the life as a yob's girlfriend. Vanessa Redgrave and all the others round out an honest cast that isn't afraid to let Hollywood see their age. This is acting sans botox and what a delight it is to see. This is smart writing good thinking and gutsy in a day when actors are expected to look a certain way even in old age. It's a delight and trounces all stereotypes about aging. There are lines here which are utterly breathtaking in their insight and playfulness. The writer is to be applauded for not falling back on the senior citizen stereotype. O'Toole's character swoons he drinks in the quixotic experience of remembering the beauty of a naked body of kissing a woman's neck of the entire and total experience of falling in love of pleasure and of jealousy and of heartbreak as well. Young screenwriters should take note write against type and delve into the real human experience the one that everyone else tries to conveniently box away.Why an 8 and not a 10? There were some choppy bits of editing. I would have liked to see even more growth and recognition in Maurice. Just a bit more from the writers would've brought it all the way home with the same aplomb given by O'Toole. But overall a movie worth seeing a performance worth rewarding. Bravo! Well done. Applause for Mr. O'Toole.".

	schema:headline " O'Toole's Still Got It";
	schema:reviewBody "I strongly suspect that Peter O'Toole in his new film Venus plays a character not far removed from himself. This may prevent his performance from joining the ranks of some of his greatest cinematic achievements since it probably didn't provide as much of a challenge to him but that's not to say that he isn't marvelous in this film and shouldn't be commended for taking on this brave and unflattering role so late in his career.In Venus O'Toole plays Maurice a famous stage and screen actor pushing 90 who's struggling mightily to prevent his days from slipping into the routine loneliness of old age. He's on friendly terms with his wife Vanessa Redgrave who has a couple of wonderful moments in this film who he walked out on years ago but never sees his children who haven't forgiven their father for deserting them. The time he doesn't spend at doctors' offices or willing himself to get out of bed every morning he spends with his cantankerous best friend a fellow actor reminiscing about their best roles.When the friend takes in his niece's sullen daughter as a livein assistant O'Toole immediately finds himself in love with her or at least in love with the idea of her and the two strike up an awkward and at times most uncomfortable relationship of sorts.What distinguishes Venus from other stories like it is the nature of the central relationship. This is no sweet chaste friendship a la Lost in Translation. For one the age difference here is much greater. But beyond that the relationship between Maurice and his Venus is distinctly sexual. It's clear that Maurice would go as far as Venus will allow which isn't far but is far enough to have made me squirm a bit in my seat at moments. For her part Venus uses her beauty and her knowledge of Maurice's desire for her to her advantage receiving gifts in return for her favors. The film establishes both Maurice and Venus as somewhat unsympathetic characters which prevents the film from becoming too maudlin. But there's also a great reserve of kindness in both of them and each enables that to come out in the other. In the end each of these characters is a bit better off for having known the other.Venus is slow moving and it's not a profound film. But it is refreshingly free of pretense and it provides one with the chance to see Peter O'Toole one of my favorite actors showing the world that he's still got it after all these years.Grade B".

Had I not gone I would have made a serious mistake. O'Toole's performance is as good as anything he's done and the whispers about Oscars might just have something behind them. Somehow Roger Michell directed this film so beautifully that nothing that occurred between Maurie and Jessie seemed morally ambiguous whatsoever. Maybe it was the pairing of scenes with poppy Corinne Bailey Rae music that made it seem so natural but I strongly suspect otherwise. O'Toole paired with a beautiful performance by virtual unknown Jodie Whittaker takes us into a world that disregards social boundaries and replaces them with raw human emotion and understanding. Though O'Toole's performance captivates the Oscar attention of anyone who sees the film the supporting role played by Leslie Phillips was essential to the film's success. The relationship between Phillips and O'Toole's character had the entire theater laughing just seconds into the film. Overall a cast of entirely endearing characters and knockout performances by O'Toole Phillips and Whittaker make Venus one of the best films I've seen in 2006.".

This strange take on the Pygmalion story is well supported by Jodie Wittaker as the title character and Leslie Phillips as the friend that everyone needs to either accompany you or drive you to the grave. But it is O'Toole's performance that makes this movie worth the price of a ticket. If he doesn't finally win an Oscar for this I might have to start fundraising to buy him one.".

He is just wonderful in all his scenes. The film is very lovely sweet charming and funny. Jodie Whittaker is just lovely and a very talented upstart. However if any other character deserved an Oscar or a nomination it is the great Vanessa Redgrave who has stood firm in being a great talent and hasn't even started to fade away like O'Toole almost did. Her scenes aren't that big but she leaves a lasting impression. She still looks beautiful at 69 and she still shows the same display of emotion as she did in her star making breakout role as Rosalind in As You Like It to her recent released film The White Countess. She and O'Toole play off each other very well. This is a wonderful first film for them. See the movie I know you'll enjoy it.".

Three years ago he collaborated with writer Hanif Kuraishi of My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid for a film that enters the same fearless territory as this new film Venus the land of age disparities in sex of the bitter realities of decaying bodies and continuing desire. This was The Mother 2003 in which May Anne Reed a woman in her sixties has a brief reviving affair with a thirtysomething builder called Darren Daniel Craig. The Mother's title points to the fact that May has grown children and the film deals with the complexities of family and relationships.Kuraishi brings the same fierce honesty about age and sexuality to Venus. This KuraishiMitchell collaboration is destined for greater fame than the last because happily it chooses to wrap itself around a great star that same Peter O'Toole who 44 years ago became the unforgettable and luminous hero of David Lean's Laurence of Arabia.At 74 O'Toole is Maurice an actor living alone well past his prime the ravages of age compounded in him by too much alcohol and too many cigarettes and the inward marking of a slow decline in roles. Maurice gave up long ago being anybody's husband or father. He lives alone. He and Ian Leslie Phillips and Donald Richard Griffith meet in a cheap restaurant where the older Ian who's having shortterm memory problems and beginning to have more trouble coping for himself announces he's to have some relatives' young daughter a girl from the provinces coming up to London to live with him and serve as an ununiformed nurse.Perhaps Ian is Gielgud only less successful and less elegant. Ian is lordly a prima donna whose delicate sensibilities can't abide an untutored member of the younger generations  and who therefore can't stand young Jessie Jodie Whittaker when she arrives.Maurice can. She's illdressed and badmannered but she's fetching. Maurice sees that. He socializes with her relates with her as a person then as a man then as an aging suitor. For a while they have something to give each other. It ends unpleasantly. Then for a moment it revives and has one last beautiful moment. And it's over. Kuraishi tells this story as much as possible without sugar coating. Some moments are embarrassing and hard to watch. When sweetness comes it's earned and surprises and touches.Maurice hasn't got much of life to live. But he grabs what he can while he can. And he gives pleasure. That's all he ever wanted.Maurice gets Jessie a job as an art class nude model  she wanted to do modeling. Then he spies on her nakedness in the studio and falls in a doorway and knocks over an easel.She likes him  he's nice to her  but she also re buffs him at times. She's a rude girl with low tastes but when speaking of and to her he recites Shakespeare's sonnet Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate. She listens. When he sees her beautiful body her skin her eyes her youth her sex and speaks of that he makes her happy.Maurice enters another theater  the operating kind  and has his prostate removed. He is impotent and wears a catheter. He can't perform any more. But he can touch and admire. He can desire. He has a small part in a costume film and hires a big limo to go to the shoot with Jessie  he calls her Venus now comparing her to a painting  and he almost faints during the shoot. She gets him to pay for a snake tattoo on her hand and has a scrawny boyfriend Bronson Webb and they use Maurice's flat to have sex. He gets angry and kicks them out. There's a scuffle and he's knocked down and the kids run off. Later she comes back find him and calls 911. He's incapacitated. Out of shame she volunteers to care for him. Sick as he is he goes to the beach with her where he grew up and this is his last idyll.There is bravery and intelligence in Kurashi's writing and O'Toole's acting but the richness of this surprisingly complex little film is in the details gestures intonations that must be seen to be appreciated. Maurice has a wife a wonderfully disheveled Vanessa Redgrave. He abandoned her long ago but their relationship is rueful and sweet. In their accomplished ease Redgrave's scenes with O'Toole are a master class in acting. It's had to imagine how two performers could be any better together than this. But it's the scenes between O'Toole and his Venus Whittaker that matter with their honesty and awkward affection without prettiness without fakeness. Kuraishi may seem to try too hard to be raw playing on the shock value of oldster's using fourletterwords but this is a film like The Mother with the painful feel of real experience expanded to the level of a great sad open soul by the remarkable O'Toole.The film ends with Ian and Donald in the cheap restaurant looking at Maurice's obituary. It's a good one  many columns with a big picture of O'Toole when he was young. The waitress comes up and looks at the picture and says But he was gorgeous! and Ian says Yes he was gorgeous!  two of the most profoundly resonant lines in film this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michell tells an unconventional story of an aged actor who's fallen for a very young lady. What makes this story different from other old vs young love stories is that the relationship is very sexual in nature. Maurice clearly sees Jessie as a very sexual being and he would definitely go far enough if she had allowed it. Yet Jessie herself isn't completely innocent. She is completely aware of his feelings and takes advantage of it. While this part of their relationship is uncomfortable to watch there is another side to it. Maurice clearly is infatuated with this girl but he never forces himself on her. On the one hand his despair is understandable as he's a man in the last stage of his life. He's maintained a friendly relationship with his estranged wife but his children won't have anything to do with him. He chats with his friends at a caf. The only roles offered to him are those of corpses. While he struggles getting up from bed to live his miserably lonely life it is the entrance of Jessie that changes that. She's young. She's attractive. She's vibrant though a little tempered. The young Jessie isn't evil either. She too enjoys Maurice's company. Perhaps her feelings towards him were part sympathy part affection. Though both characters are initially portrayed in an unsympathetic way they manage to build a bridge that connects to the viewer.Hanif Kureishi is known for telling stories about unconventional relationships and here too he does a good job. It is well paced. Some might find it slow but I think it works for this kind of film. The dialogues are solid both funny poetic and get you to say 'hmm!'. Also the comedic situations are well executed like the one where Maurice and Jessie go shopping and Maurice only offers to pay 20. The cinematography and score do a good job of demonstrating the loneliness dullness and somewhat carelessness of London.

I'm glad to see that actors like him and Vanessa Redgrave do not shy away from playing such roles of elderly people. He is charming kind passionate with Venus somewhat appalling and sympathetic. Redgrave has two scenes of which she does nothing short of greatness. Confidant newcomer Jodie Whitaker more than just holding her own to veteran O'Toole. She adds a freshness and displays Jessie's growth with great confidence. Leslie Phillips too does a fine job as Maurice's friend.

	onyx:emotionText "Michell tells an unconventional story of an aged actor who's fallen for a very young lady. What makes this story different from other old vs young love stories is that the relationship is very sexual in nature. Maurice clearly sees Jessie as a very sexual being and he would definitely go far enough if she had allowed it. Yet Jessie herself isn't completely innocent. She is completely aware of his feelings and takes advantage of it. While this part of their relationship is uncomfortable to watch there is another side to it. Maurice clearly is infatuated with this girl but he never forces himself on her. On the one hand his despair is understandable as he's a man in the last stage of his life. He's maintained a friendly relationship with his estranged wife but his children won't have anything to do with him. He chats with his friends at a caf. The only roles offered to him are those of corpses. While he struggles getting up from bed to live his miserably lonely life it is the entrance of Jessie that changes that. She's young. She's attractive. She's vibrant though a little tempered. The young Jessie isn't evil either. She too enjoys Maurice's company. Perhaps her feelings towards him were part sympathy part affection. Though both characters are initially portrayed in an unsympathetic way they manage to build a bridge that connects to the viewer.Hanif Kureishi is known for telling stories about unconventional relationships and here too he does a good job. It is well paced. Some might find it slow but I think it works for this kind of film. The dialogues are solid both funny poetic and get you to say 'hmm!'. Also the comedic situations are well executed like the one where Maurice and Jessie go shopping and Maurice only offers to pay 20. The cinematography and score do a good job of demonstrating the loneliness dullness and somewhat carelessness of London. Meanwhile Corinne Bailey Rae's soothing voice highlight the gentle songs.Peter O'Toole delivers a marvelous performance. I'm glad to see that actors like him and Vanessa Redgrave do not shy away from playing such roles of elderly people. He is charming kind passionate with Venus somewhat appalling and sympathetic.

Superlative acting a great script and a touching story. Peter O'Toole acts better with just his voice then most actors can with the entire screen to work with. Jodie Whittaker was incredible in this her first big part captivating the screen with both her youth and beauty as well as her fragile and vulnerable ego. All in all this was one of the finest and bravest films I have viewed in a very long time.The story filmed in parts of London that I have never seen on screen was wonderfully filmed. The cast of veteran actors including Leslie Phillips Richard Griffiths and Vanessa Redgrave work together like the natural lifelong friends. It is the chemistry between O'Toole and Whittaker however that really sets this film apart. The veteran and the young fledgling really light up the screen with such a tenderness and hunger both wanting what they other has to offer and giving what they can to see that happen. Treat yourself to this movie you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " A fine film even if you watch with some discomfort";
	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing this I avoided reading reviews and had seen one trailer which gave a flavour of what the film would be like. But  I am a great fan of Peter O'Toole and of course did not want to miss what has been mooted as the best role of his twilight years and certainly his first leading role in a film since 'My Favorite Year'.Here O'Toole plays Maurice Russell an ageing actor who has had past successes we see his wife watching an old movie of his on TV but is now playing corpses in hospital dramas or ageing rous in costume drama O'Toole himself played the old Casanova on TV recently. Maurice is on his last legs impotent and incontinent after a prostrate op but finds some solace in the greatniece of his fellow thespian Ian played with aplomb by Leslie Phillips. Jodie Whittaker plays this girl Jessie Maurice's 'Venus' with some skill  it cannot have been an easy role and I believe she is something of a newcomer.The best moments however for me were not the relationship between Maurice and Jessie  that because of the huge age gap was funny at times poignant at others and plain distasteful at some points I felt his attraction to her could have been treated with more sensitivity although audience sympathy does go with him and not with her  but rather his scenes with Ian and with his estranged wife Vanessa Redgrave excellent as ever. Here there are scenes of friendship of life affirmation of tenderness that cannot even be approached in the slightly seedy 'theroretical' interest Maurice has in Jessie.Does O'Toole deserve his recent Oscar nomination for this role? Absolutely. He dominates the film with ease and even frail elderly and ravaged there are flashes of the vibrant blueeyed heartthrob who wowed the screens in the likes of 'Laurence of Arabia'. Interestingly once Maurice has died as we know he must his friends peer over his Guardian obit jealously noting the number of columns he's got and show an old photo to the caf waitress  not the best vintage O'Toole photo they could have got but enough to show that Maurice had a life before old age got him. And whether Maurice is frustrated with his age 'Come on old man!' he chides himself or regretful with the passing of time and his libido either with his wife or with Jessie dancing with Ian in the actor's church or having his last paddle in the freezing sea O'Toole is never anything less than mesmerising and that is the mark of a true actor.I imagine this film will grow with repeated viewings. The script has a few profanities it was amusing hearing Leslie Phillips utter the f word but is largely literate as you would expect from Hanif Kureshi who last wrote 'The Mother' for the screen where Anne Reid and Daniel Craig had a rather more physical relationship  which would have been totally wrong in every respect for 'Venus'. The music is perfectly suited to the film and works extremely well.In all a good effort. And in places extremely funny  but it is the two old men dancing which you will remember and this was rightly the image carried by the film festivals which first presented this charming and unusual film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This immature slice of geriatric epiphany was largely overrated when it came out mainly due to the lead being film legend Peter O'Toole. Critics and even the Academy awards must have mistook this manipulative and silly little tale for something entirely greater. While Venus does have some potent themes which deal in lust and mortality Hanif Kureishi's script is just too showy for any real effect to take hold. His plot revolves around O'Toole's latelife inspiration as he sleazily attempts to win over a young nurse newcomer Jodie Wittaker doing little more then filling out a pair of jeans nicely. This was no Lolita and the underexplored dynamics of their relationship does little to illuminate anything opting to artfully exploit the premise instead. Many have praised the script's handling of this potentially scummy plot line insisting Venus has far more class and substance then it's raunchy foreground would suggest but I saw very little indication of that.Rather the film serves to highlight one dirty old man in all of his crusty glory as we watch unbelievably as this young young lady begins to offer more of herself to him. While not plagued with the indecency that would have felt more pronounced had the project belonged to more sinister minds Venus is little more then the vapid glorification of an old horndog having one final hurrah. What is particularly annoying is how O'Toole and his onscreen elderly buddy continuously mug the camera with an awkward rawness that I suppose was instilled for comedic value and also for appealing to a younger demographic but only came across as unrealistic and laughably off. It is as if director Roger Michell fearing the small boxoffice turn around had his lead utter ridiculously foulmouthed phrases in order to catch some tiny spark of edginess. Instead these lines come off as painfully selfaware and completely counterproductive in proving to us that these old men are still hip.Venus may have enough appeal to lure a certain crowd as it had certainly pulled a fast one over many of our respected film critics but the majority of this film felt like a tedious chore. Rare moments of cinematic sincerity occur and when they do one will only realize what potential the film could have had if calibrated with a little more finesse. Rather Venus let's the venerated O'Toole celebrate 50 years in the biz by having him gently chew the scenery with dentures. His much touted performance masterfully intuitive yet still somehow stale and predictable was overstated from stature.".

	schema:headline " Refreshing hardcore horror!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen an Indonesian film before and the last film I'd expect from there is some gory horror film as I know they're a very conservative country who even reject Lady Gaga! Macabre is much more sickening than Gaga. The formula has been used many times before but to me it's far from tired. I love horror films that take place in a house run by a demented murdering family. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Frontiers come to mind both are favourites of mine and Macabre offers quite an impressive and thrilling spin! We've all heard the story before but a lot of films tend to get it very wrong focusing on way too much exposition before getting down to the horror. Macabre gets down to it quite quickly giving us an interesting half hour build up before all hell breaks loose! The great thing about Macabre is that it is never boring there is always something going on very much like the remake of Mother's Day. One big problem with Macabre is that it's overpopulated with way too many characters who all look very similar or don't really have much character to them. Macabre lacks the character development that is needed in the slasher department however that's not to say that aren't some character's to root for.At one point the film becomes so overpopulated it's nay on impossible to tell what's going on! However part of Macabre's entertainment value lies in its chaos. Make no mistake Macabre is an extremely solid and very rewatchable horror film that would be perfect for those nights where you have a little party! It's a nonstop rollercoaster ride which serves up some extremely nasty treats. The character of Dara is memorably creepy and she's certainly a person you would not like to mess with. Her wide eyes scrapedback hair and slow mechanical voice makes her a fantastic villain and one that you're not likely to forget.Another great thing about Macabre is that it has a very similar idea to blood and gore as French horror. That means it doesn't hold back! I think every scene features some pretty horrific gore which all adds to the entertainment and thrills. There are some really great practical effects and inventive kills that should have horror fans drooling at the mouth. Macabre has been likened to Inside but I personally don't see that other than there being a pregnant character in both films and both showing a liberal idea to the use of blood Macabre is much more Frontiersesque. However I don't think that Macabre is up to Frontiers' perfection.Frontiers exceeds in every way possible. Through the directing writing character development music and editing. Whilst Macabre is pretty solid on the writing front some of the directing is slightly offkey although most of the time it's pretty impressive with the Mo Brothers being sure not to film the action too shaky or too close so we can't see what the hell is going on! Macabre is quite choppy on the editing front and some of the lighting is also quite amateurish. However I don't want to dwell too much on the negatives because this is actually a really good film and one which I enjoyed very much.Whilst Macabre may not be the horror masterpiece the trailer would suggest it still serves up some hardcore horror thrills that makes a good substitute for French horror. It's way better than most American stuff to come out and is never boring. In fact I would've liked to have seen even more! The ending is creepy and the supernatural ideas also add an original and quite disturbing quality to the film. My only real gripe is that I bought the UK version and it might just be my DVD but it seemed incredibly blotchy to me making the blacks appear more greyishblue than black which is a shame with the film spending the majority of the time in the dark! It kind of spoilt the experience for me. Hopefully the film will get a well deserved wider release with a better transfer. Highly recommend to all you horror lovers!".

	onyx:emotionText "I've never seen an Indonesian film before and the last film I'd expect from there is some gory horror film as I know they're a very conservative country who even reject Lady Gaga! Macabre is much more sickening than Gaga. The formula has been used many times before but to me it's far from tired. I love horror films that take place in a house run by a demented murdering family. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Frontiers come to mind both are favourites of mine and Macabre offers quite an impressive and thrilling spin! We've all heard the story before but a lot of films tend to get it very wrong focusing on way too much exposition before getting down to the horror. Macabre gets down to it quite quickly giving us an interesting half hour build up before all hell breaks loose! The great thing about Macabre is that it is never boring there is always something going on very much like the remake of Mother's Day. One big problem with Macabre is that it's overpopulated with way too many characters who all look very similar or don't really have much character to them. Macabre lacks the character development that is needed in the slasher department however that's not to say that aren't some character's to root for.At one point the film becomes so overpopulated it's nay on impossible to tell what's going on! However part of Macabre's entertainment value lies in its chaos. Make no mistake Macabre is an extremely solid and very rewatchable horror film that would be perfect for those nights where you have a little party! It's a nonstop rollercoaster ride which serves up some extremely nasty treats. The character of Dara is memorably creepy and she's certainly a person you would not like to mess with. Her wide eyes scrapedback hair and slow mechanical voice makes her a fantastic villain and one that you're not likely to forget.Another great thing about Macabre is that it has a very similar idea to blood and gore as French horror. That means it doesn't hold back! I think every scene features some pretty horrific gore which all adds to the entertainment and thrills. There are some really great practical effects and inventive kills that should have horror fans drooling at the mouth. Macabre has been likened to Inside but I personally don't see that other than there being a pregnant character in both films and both showing a liberal idea to the use of blood Macabre is much more Frontiersesque. However I don't think that Macabre is up to Frontiers' perfection.Frontiers exceeds in every way possible. Through the directing writing character development music and editing.

	schema:reviewBody "My first review was not accepted and I do not know why. So here it goes as I submit another review and hopefully it will get posted. This is an Indonesian Horror Film that came out in 2009 but wasn't made readily available in till 2013. It is subtitled and if you do not like subtitles I still have to insist you give this film your full attention. Directed by the Mo Brothers most known for their short in VHS 2 called Safe Haven which was arguably the best in the whole series both 1 and 2 everything from the cast to camera angles works great in this movie.So let me jump in and give you the basic story and why this is one of the best horror films ever in my opinion.The story follows 6 people who are friends in a restaurant. As they are leaving they run into the beautiful Maya who says she has been robbed.They decide to take her home and are invited to stay for dinner after meeting Adam and Arman who are her brothers and we also meet Dara who has the scariest stare I have ever seen and there is something that gives you chills watching this woman. Dara is the mother and that is the family.Soon after a nice 25 minute build up the group is killed off one by one. That is all I will say and I admit that it probably took some cues from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But while that movie was good this movie is something special and I'll explain why.First when it comes to movies like this one of the important questions is the kills and pacing. While some of you might be turned off by the slowbut entertainingbuild up. However it sets up everything nice and lets you get attached with our group of friends. Once the fun starts it never lets you go but keeps getting crazier and crazier all the way in till the surprise ending. This movie makes you question if this family is even something normal and while there is only a slight background on them when we finally understand why their doing these killings it's nothing short of insane. Do not read the story from anyone and just watch it you will be blown back by the why.As for the kills I have to admit that they are really well done. I have seen a lot of over the top movies and then movies with barely any gore even though they should have more. Very rarely do movies like this land in the middle and everything is done right. Every kill in this movie is so memorable. There is a lot of blood and decapitation. You feel their pain and everyone in the family is an expert killing machine. It just makes for a lot of fun and I will admit this is one of the few movies that has actually grossed me out in a long time. If you aren't into gore there is more than just a lot of gore in this movie and you should still give it a chance. Dara is absolutely terrifying and a lot of people are saying unlike TCM who had LeatherFace this movie doesn't have a memorable character. I am sorry to say Dara is one of my favorite villains of all time now and Maya I believe is the craziest woman ever. Arman is just plain nasty and Adam is a killing machine. The camera angles used in this movie are great and we actually get to see the kills instead of the usual technique used which is to show the start of the kill then jump ahead to the end result. They really aimed to let us see each kill fully instead of using that editing technique which is something we don't see to much. Dara makes this movie very special and what is freaky is how much she really does care for her family which I picked up on after watching it a third time. Which leads to one of the best things about this movie.This is one of those rare horror gems in which each viewing is better than the last. You pick up on things you didn't notice before and it just stays so entertaining you can't help but love it. If your a true horror fan then this movie is an absolute must watch because I promise you will never look at another horror movie the same. The only flaws for some people might be how little is explained about the family. I honestly would love to learn more and I believe there is talk about a prequel. But one of the nice things about this movie is how it leaves mystery and you WANT to know more about the family and the people they are involved with. Also as I said earlier if you do not like subtitles that is your only option to watching this movie. Besides those two things this movie really nails everything else which is so rare to see.I believe that no movie is ever perfect and everyone has different opinions. Well I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because everything just works so well together in this movie. It is blended together and gives you a fun and sick ride throughout. Some of the kills are so well done you cant believe what you just witnessed. The secret behind the family is never expected and you will want to watch it again after you learn it just because it changes everything. This is a must watch movie for any mild horror fan. You can watch this on Hulu.com also. Side note ABC's of death segment L was done by the Mo Brothers. Keep an Eye on these two.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film to be released under the Singapore label Gorylah Pictures set up by Eric Khoo and Mike Wiluan Darah or Macabre as it is known internationally is a one of a kind slasher film from this part of the region written and directed by the Indonesian duo Kimo Stamboel and Timo Tjahjanto collectively known as The Mo Brothers who actually had a short film version of this made back in 2007 which was simply called Dara also starring actress Shareefa Daanish as the Mother of all Evil.As a horror film it did take its time to set up the premise rather than to jump headlong into flat out bootactics. For about 20 minutes we're introduced to a group of 4 guys and 2 girls and their relationship with one another some by blood some estranged. They meet in a pub in Bandung and are supposed to go on a road trip to Jakarta until they are stopped by the beautiful yet mysterious Maya Imelda Therinne and in playing the Good Samaritan decided to drop her off along the way.So there you have it a nice handful r of people some of whom you'll grow to dislike a road trip a mysterious lady and a house in the middle of nowhere. Soon we're introduced to the cool and emotionless Dara Daanish and the entourage will soon find themselves in a horrific situation where survival is of the highest order. As I mentioned it does take a while to build up the premise and you can feel the calm before the storm with the incessant ticking clock in the audio background as if counting down the moments where first blood gets drawn. The eager beaver in me though found it a tad excruciating in the wait especially when you don't really get to learn much of Dara and her family's background apart from some rapid shots. The directors went straight for the action and Kimo in an interactive session after the film had revealed that more of the background of Dara could be explained in the next film which they hadn't decided whether to set it forward or backward in time.Alas the rating of the film at M18 meant that the editing was a tad choppy where enough scenes were jarring just because they had lingered on far too longer than the comfort zone afforded. This has a slight impact on the narrative flow as one minute you see the death blow being applied and the next you're faced with a jump cut that shows the few seconds after. Thick crimson blood was also the order of the day from set design to makeup where everyone gets drenched thoroughly in coagulating plasma no thanks to the insanely violent bloodbath. Genre fans should take delight in watching howCharacterwise the creators went for the rather contemporary femalesuperiority style where guys are made to look really bumbling and sheer tenacity comes from the females instead such as Ladya Julie Estelle who demonstrates extreme spunk and quick thinking to ensure she comes out of each ordeal as best as she can. You're likely to cheer her on as she takes on the villains and her solo battle with Dara is a highlight in the film. Dara herself too gives you the creeps especially since Shareefa Daanish put in a measured performance balancing composure and that mad frenzy baying for blood. It's no wonder she was handed the Best Actress award at the genre Puchon International Film Festival not too long ago.It's not all blood and gore however as there were ample time devoted to some slight comedy especially when the cops come knocking. Serving two purposes in providing light entertainment before the going gets heavy and also to add to the body count this episode was perhaps the most fun of the lot and became a catalyst for the bloodbath to follow in a relatively quickened pace with dismemberment slashes stabs and strangulation being the norm with The Mo Brothers keeping things tight.Darah should appeal to the patient horror fan who can sit through a build up and celebrate when the madness start to descend on the poor victims. It's a little unfortunate though that the real horror was the way this rated version was edited.".

A group of friends pick up this seemingly terrified and disoriented girl and this girl claiming that she had been robbed ask the group if whether they'd be kind enough to take her home. They decide to do so and once they reach the girl's house they are invited inside and are eventually greeted by the girl's mother who then offers them dinner. But while they have dinner they get drugged and soon afterwards they find themselves stuck in an unbelievably hellish nightmare.......The film has quite a slow start but as it progresses it intensifies into an utterly savage bloodbath that will have you guessing as to who lives and who doesn't. The acting cinematography direction is all perfect and the film lives up to its name entirely. Don't miss it.".

They decide to do so and once they reach the girl's house they are invited inside and are eventually greeted by the girl's mother who then offers them dinner. But while they have dinner they get drugged and soon afterwards they find themselves stuck in an unbelievably hellish nightmare.......The film has quite a slow start but as it progresses it intensifies into an utterly savage bloodbath that will have you guessing as to who lives and who doesn't. The acting cinematography direction is all perfect and the film lives up to its name entirely. Don't miss it.";

It's a story that has been told a hundred times but it has a good suspense building pace some good acting great in terms of Maya Adjie Dara and Adam despite mostly cardboard characters and some great make up special effects. In fact outside of the steady build into chaos the gore may be the best part of this movie. That and that deep wideeyed stare of Dara's that truly is creepy. Some of the movie is pretty perfunctory and formulaic some of it is clich most of it is predictable and there are some parts that you can't help but burrow your eyebrows and frown thinking Well that was just stupid... Still the directing here is very well executed and the cinematography is spot on. Plus again the make up is great. Who doesn't like seeing several people slipping around in ankle deep puddles of blood while being chased by a mad woman waving a roaring chainsaw at their face? Solid Slasher Cinema.".

	schema:headline " More Thrilling and Violent Than I Thought It Would Be";
	schema:reviewBody "There were a few things that kept me from putting Macabre 2009 on my high priority list. This movie is a feature length spinoff of the Darah short film that was originally part of the horror anthology entitled Takut Faces of Fear 2008. I wasn't particularly fond of the short film. It had some good violence but the protagonists irritated me a bit too much especially their moronic decisionmaking. Obviously I put off watching the spinoff for months. Another factor is that I'm still timid with regards to Indonesian horror films due to the scarce number of online reviews and ratings that make the selection process analogous to walking in a mine field. There's really no way to predict whether you're in for an instant classic like The Forbidden Door 2009 a cool flick like Kuntilanak 2006 or a total turd bomb like Hantu Perawan Jeruk Purut 2008.I finally ended up watching Macabre tonight and I must say that it was more entertaining than I thought it would be. Within the opening five minutes I already felt at ease once I saw the lovely Julie Estelle grace the screen. Even when she's in a bad movie like Kuntilanak 2 2007 she still makes it somewhat watchable so her unexpected presence automatically raises my rating of this film by 1 or 2 points. Now fans of Julie's ghost movies are in for a shocking experience when watching Macabre because her role here demands a much more physical emotional performance. She pulls it off very well and this is likely the best performance of her young career.The plot is basic and involves a group of friends who help a young woman by giving her a ride to her home. Things get nasty when her family turns out to be homicidal maniacs. In this sense Macabre follows a similar route taken by films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 and House of 1000 Corpses 2003. There's nothing new here but in this genre it's the execution that counts and in this film there's a healthy dose of gritty nasty bloody violence and gore to keep most horror fans satisfied. It doesn't reach the glorious blood overload of Inside 2007 one of my top 10 favorite horror films of the decade but it holds its own. After the brief setup this is a nonstop mix of suspense and bloodshed. A few of the death scenes are certainly memorable and will help Macabre to carve out it's own little identity in the genre.One major problem that I have with loony murderous family movies is obnoxious antagonists. Just because you're a ruthless sick family unit doesn't mean that you have to yap your mouths all the time and act like juvenile lunatics. One of the reasons why I'm not a huge fan of Rob Zombie's movies. I much prefer the quiet intelligent menacing killers who calculate and go about their business with a twisted calmness. You know the seemingly normal folk that are serving you tea and biscuits one minute and then slicing you in half with a chainsaw the next minute. In Macabre that's exactly what they are and in some ways those quieter qualities help to muffle the bad decisionmaking that frequently creeps its head in movies such as this. What I mean by this is that the intelligent antagonists quickly handicap the protagonists which limits their options and creates an entirely realistic scenario. The filmmakers loosen the reigns later on though and eventually the sense of realism recedes until you're left with some unrealistic elements. There are a few boneheaded decisions but not enough to significantly detract from the positives. In addition some of these characters take an incredible amount of brutality without kicking the bucket. On the positive side this provides for some longlasting showdowns as well as some sweet death scenes.Macabre is definitely worth seeking out and would make a great Indonesian horror triple feature with The Forbidden Door 2009 and Kuntilanak 2006. Actually you can add The Raid 2011 and The Raid 2 2014 as well to mix up the evening with some fantastic martial arts action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Macabre is a rather customary and derivative horror movie the type of which there are thirteen in a dozen but with the notable exception of two little characteristics. First of all this is an Indonesian movie honestly how many of those do you encounter per year? and secondly it's an excruciatingly cruel and sadistic viewing experience with a nihilistic tone and relentless bloodshed. Speaking in terms of cruelty this sick puppy easily lives up to the French flicks Martyrs and Inside and thus leaves the vast majority of nowadays American produced slasherhorror movies miles and miles behind. It's actually regrettable that the plot is so clichd predictable and commonplace otherwise Macabre might have become an instant cult classic and groundbreaking new genre films like the aforementioned French titles perhaps. Now this is sadly just a gem that will probably score big in the festival circuit and amongst obscure cult purchasers but remain largely unknown and unloved. Six friends including an eight months pregnant woman and a couple of continuously arguing siblings are on a long road trip to Jakarta when they stop to pick up a seemingly disorientated girl who  according to her own confusing story  got carjacked and left behind in the middle of the road. They reluctantly decide to do the right thing and bring her home but obviously this is just the girl's routine to lure unsuspecting people to her remote backwoods house and meet up with the rest of the deranged homicidal family. The head of the family Mother Darah seemingly found the secret to eternal youth but petrifies with her sinister stare and asocial behavior. The guests are brutally tortured and slaughtered one by one and for no apparent reason except maybe mother Darah's unusual interest in Astrid's unborn babyThe roughest thing about Macabre is the film's stoic and agonizing ambiance. Some of the characters honestly didn't deserve to die or at least not as barbaric as displayed on the screen. But that's genuine horror I acknowledge. Together with the ambiance the biggest quality of the film is Shareefa Daanish's downright terrifying performance as Mother Darah. The poster of the film is simply a portrait of Darah wearing a blood red dress and staring straight into the camera with a fork in her hand but it's one of the most effectively unsettling horror movie posters I've seen in a long time. Well together with the poster for Orphan which pretty much looks exactly the same. Macabre is unoriginal occasionally a bit slow especially in the beginning and leaves an overall unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth but in case you're looking for an oldfashioned GrandGuignol accomplishment that truly repels and shocks this is it!".

When the group arrive at secluded house of their pickedup stranger they are met by a Lucy Liu looking mother figure that looks as creepy as she will prove deadly as the story progresses.Unsuspecting that their hosts which also includes two male figures are murdering cannibals the five guests enjoy a meal with the seemingly thankful clan before they are drugged bound and tortured resulting in plenty of the red stuff being sprayed liberally in almost every room in the house. All put up a fight but few survive in what becomes a very bloody evening with a body count that reaches the double digits.Horror films which circle around a group of friends ending up in a remote house where a sadistic and murdering family reside are nothing new. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Tourist Trap Silent Scream House of 1000 Corpsesthere have been countless horror titles that could be summed up with the same synopsis.So what separates Macabre from the rest of them? Nothing really. When stripped to the bone Macabre is just another stupid horror movie where stupid people do stupid things which eventually get them killed.

People drop weapons after inflicting nonfatal wounds people stay when they should run and fall when they do decide to hightail it a drinking game of taking a shot every time someone falls down or slips in Macabre would lead to alcohol poisoning and why would anyone go back to a house of death if they had a chance to continue running through the woods until they find safety? These elements are all too present in Macabre and take away from some pretty good scenes of blood soaked gore. It is sometimes hard to judge the acting when you are busy reading the subtitles but everyone involved seemed to be doing their part with the elements of the predictable script.As you can likely ascertain Macabre will not get a recommendation from this post.

Shareefa's striking features add to the character her wide eyes and stonefaced expression until the climax her unhurried movement and otherworldly tone of speech are intimidating. The rest of the ensemble do their best with what's handed out to them. The violence is gratuitous easily on par with Rob Zombie's films dialogues are sparsely used to convey the intentions and emotions of the antagonists. In fact a lot more is conveyed through expressions and actions than through excessive babbling. This helps 'Macabre' carve out a niche of its own in the slasher genre.

Lots of blood here and a good amount of scenes that will make you squirm.Secondly then this movie is really intense and the Mo Brothers Kimo Stamboel and Timo Tjahjanto really stepped up and delivered a great movie here under their directorial skills. And it was a great breath of fresh air to the Asian horror genre.The story is about six friends on their way from Bandung to Jakarta when they stop to help a distressed young woman named Maya. Inviting them back to her home to show her gratitude the six friends are introduced to Maya's mother Dara and they are in for a night that will abruptly change and end their lives forever.The acting in Macabre was really good and everyone were doing really great jobs. But one stood out more than the rest Shareepa Daanish in the role of Dara. She was simply phenomenal.Macabre is a wellworthy addition to any horror fan's movie collection. And it most definitely is worth watching because it is a very unique Asian horror movie. And with this movie the Mo Brothers definitely put Indonesia on the horror movie map.".

The graphics are cruel crude and certainly not for the fainthearted.The slashing and the blood spilling continues right until the end. The wideeyed Maya the woman who eats human flesh to stay immortal is downright creepy. But the person who takes the credit for being brutal is the babyadult an adult which dresses like a child bespectacled and looks retarded. He is brutal chopping heads from the body and looking creepy without even trying.I commend the effort of the directors which takes the road less traveled. Nowadays Indonesians film are littered with sexoriented themes and this film tries to run from the perceptions.A cool 1010 for its effort and the punches it delivers!".

One of the more entertaining efforts to this one is the fact that there's a wholly engaging and stylish setup that offers a lot to really like.

That feature in the film where it starts getting fun in the second half once the family starts in on their plans.

In reality would anyone scream and writhe in apparent agony when the killer has done nothing to you but just stand there? This movie has a lot of the clich stuff abundance in horror movies of the 80's where someone sees her friend being killed in front of her eyes and she does nothing but whimper and slow mo her way to the nearest door.The victims are portrayed as dimwits who when given an opportunity to escape simply returns back for more or with so much abundance of weaponry in the house only walks through it blood and all yelling out to their compadres hoping that their friends will hear them as well as the killers.The portrayal of Darah would be so much creepier if she had not had that wig and perfect makeup on. The directors were hoping that Darah's signature cocking of head to one side while speaking in a monotonous voice would stick with audience. It sure stuck but for the wrong reasons because after the movie I found many people mimicking her to great hilarity. Basically every villain in this movie is too coiffed and good looking even the fat guy! If they were living in a wooded area away from civilization would they actually look like models? The movie also does not seem to know what it wants to be. Coming into the cinema I was expecting a supernatural horror  it went from supernatural to natural to comedy and then to downright Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The mix in genre may be welcomed but it has to be smooth not pop an overweight cop in the middle of the show and have him juggle.That being said the director's eye was impressive and some of the cinematography were unusual. It is just the script and makeup that needs to be thought through more thoroughly than just let's have her do this so we can end up doing that. Think international but more precisely think how YOU would be scared before making a movie that is supposed to scare others.".

We're talking seriously bizarre gory violence. The film is basically about a group of friends that pick up a girl stranded on the side of the road and take her home where her unusually young looking mother invites them to stay for dinner. That's all you need to know because as you can imagine after that point things get nuts. If you've seen many horror movies from any of the Asian countries the subject matter will be familiar. The story is nothing super original it's still good but it's definitely been done before. The gore on the other hand is pretty gnarly. Especially the last 20 minutes If you have an appetite for gore and an iron stomach you're gonna want to drop this one in your Netflix queue.Please like me on Facebook!

	schema:headline " Good but very much a copy job of recent French horror";
	schema:reviewBody "I admit there were moments of fun but if you have seen Inside or Frontiers you will instantly recognize the elements reimagined from both. This is the Indonesian version of those two movies with some nice gore but unfortunately not much originality. I would imagine if this was new to some it could stand as a worthy horror entry but just pales in comparison to the films from which it borrowed. So recommended but with an asterisk at the bottom.Frontiers was no doubt a French take on Texas Chainsaw but there were enough nuance elements to make it interesting  the Nazi bloodline the pigs the original death scenes all made it entertaining. Inside IMO was simply brilliant.

This is the Indonesian version of those two movies with some nice gore but unfortunately not much originality. I would imagine if this was new to some it could stand as a worthy horror entry but just pales in comparison to the films from which it borrowed. So recommended but with an asterisk at the bottom.Frontiers was no doubt a French take on Texas Chainsaw but there were enough nuance elements to make it interesting  the Nazi bloodline the pigs the original death scenes all made it entertaining. Inside IMO was simply brilliant.

The circumstances separate them and they have to struggle to keep their love alive.For me the best part of the movie was the beginning when Sae and Kohei meet and gradually fall in love. It was innocent and sweet a beautiful portrait of two teenagers in love. As the story continues the plot either progresses too slowly or has some farfetched twists like the almostmeeting in Canada so the film is mostly kept together by the performances.Tma Ikuta gives a brilliant performance as Kohei.

	schema:reviewBody "'Impulsive' is a word that is thrown frequently about in this romantic drama presumably aimed towards a teenageyoung adult audience especially since themes of teenage angst and jealousy crop up within the narrative. Ironically many who use this particular term prove to be the most impulsive of all. Kouhei Kiuichi Toma Ikuta is one such individual who fits this description a young fisherman who is spontaneously abrupt. The film begins with him as an adolescent who by chance encounter meets Sae Hirasawa Yui Aragaki. Sae is far more adept at study wishing to eventually leave the fishing town they occupy for Tokyo while Kouhei's future is already predetermined  he's going to inherit the fishing business his family has been committed to for several generations.Though Kouhei's father Kenjiro Yutaka Matsushige has a massive role in his life's decisions Sae's father is little more than a memory having spent much of his life in Canada the country where Sae was born before she and her mother Ryoko Hiroko Yakushimaru moved to Tokyo. Her father however returned briefly only upon discovering he was ill so he might spend his last remaining time with her. Though Sae feels Japan is her home she has often dreamed of traveling to where she was born her dreams existing far outside the reaches of the fishing town she originally occupies at the film's beginning while Kouhei's dreams do not.Though the two leads are able to find a romantic connection together Sae's dedication to her study sends her on a journey to Tokyo with the blessing of her mother. Kouhei on the other hand drops out of highschool to pursue life as a fisherman working alongside many of his friends including Ritsuko Misako Renbutsu a young woman with a crush on him. Although a long distance relationship is successfully orchestrated it is not without its pressures its problems and its temptations resulting in the question can these two characters really remain as one? Set over the course of many years from adolescence into young adulthood the film efficiently articulates how life has a way of happening while we who live it simply travel along for the ride.The imagery is especially startling scenes depicting oceans horizons and floral beauty are exceptionally captured one of the most memorable scenes depicting Sae beside a lighthouse in Canada. The beauty of the world is potentially accentuated by Junichi Kitami Osamu Mukai a photographer whose images occasionally grace the screen.The contrasts between the scenes in Japan and those in America and Canada are very astounding to behold however as a slight criticism the American characters in the feature appear too nice. Don't get me wrong almost all of the Americans I've met have been plenty nice however these characters seem unnaturally so as though they are the impromptu interpretation the writers had of how Americans are their formality and respectfulness having being based upon Japanese culture.Imagery aside the song the film is based upon Hanamizuki from You Hitoto is especially brilliant while the soundtrack that accompanies many of the scenes is equally astounding the melody sweeping viewers along. However it's during the scenes that experience the track's absence where the intensity of the drama is effectively played out.The acting across the board exceptionally allows audiences to believe in each of the character's who appear incredibly realistic Ms. Aragaki's credible English deserving mentioning. One of the best aspects of the film is the tone and duration the narrative never feeling forced or out of place there being a number of great scenes when the audience will undoubtedly hold their breath in preparation for what happens. Much like the small ornamental boat which is passed back and forth between the leads over the course of the feature we hope they will find their way back into each others hearts one day.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are three central characters in this film and three central stylistic devices that we must become accustomed to in order to better appreciate the concept of the film as Godard sees it. The first of these particular devices is a literal slowing down of time in which the action of the film freezes and then advances one single frame at a time at seemingly sporadic points throughout. The second is Godard's continually jarring use of sound design and editing taking dialog from one scene and placing it over shots taken from somewhere else entirely or indeed occasionally having the audio from one scene continue into the next one before having it cut out abruptly. The third and final technique is much more transparent and involves the director manipulating the events of the film into recognisable chapter points decided by theme. This creates an often jarring and confusing rupture in the film's linear timeline making the film more of a formal essaythematic rumination than an actual identifiable narrative. At any rate if you're familiar with Godard's work then some of these techniques will be fairly recognisable. However the film is still one of the director's most challenging and enigmatic experiments filled with subtle elements of almost Buuelian satire and some deeply flawed and often detestable characters.With this in mind the film can be interpreted on a number of levels not least as a visual essay on the creative process itself. However one recognisable strand of the film deals most plainly with human relationships frailties and fragilities and the idea of escape. The way the layers of theme character and events are woven throughout the film  combined with Godard's bold experiments with structure and presentation  is truly fascinating though it certainly isn't an easy film to enjoy or comprehend without the benefit of repeated viewings. The satire used throughout is incredibly subtle with references to society as prostitution the role of the director as a selfish deviant and the mechanics of society in relation to the sold out 60's generation cast adrift in the 80's consumerist abyss all hinted at through the bold combination of character dialog scenario and the actual presentation of the film. Instead of presenting this colourfully as someone like Buuel might have done  as evident in films such as Belle de jour 1967 The Phantom of Liberty 1974 and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1972  Godard's presentation of the film seems incredibly straightfaced with a largely unstylised and matteroffact approach to the cinematography shot composition and production design going against the more iconic and imaginative films that he produced in the 1960's.This was effectively the beginning of the third phase of Godard's career following on from his more aggressive experimental and politicallythemed films of the 1970's and seeming to show a greater level of intelligence and emotional maturity than his much more successful work of the earlytomid 1960's. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a masterpiece but it is at least a thoughtprovoking and fascinating idea and one that is conveyed in Godard's typically jarring and alienating approach to editing sound design and direction. It is also notable for the two incredibly bold and effective performances from Natalie Baye and Isabelle Huppert who act as the principal anchors to the film's central thematic preoccupations. Both of these characters share similar qualities though ultimately seem to come from completely different worlds. Baye's character works in television is in the midst of an onagainoffagain love affair with a jaded television director and seems to be struggling to reconcile her once defiant need for independence and that 60's sense of individuality in favour of a comfortable life in the country.On the other side of the fence we have Huppert's character a young prostitute also looking to make an escape of sorts though not quite on the same emotional level as Baye. In exploring Huppert's character Godard creates his most pertinent scene of satire and indeed the most iconic scene in the film. Here Huppert's prostitute is involved in an elaborate sex game with a highranking business man his young assistant and a second prostitute that never speaks. The scene is shocking uncomfortable and incredibly funny all at the same time much like the film itself. More importantly however Godard uses this scene to make his most explicit comment on the notion of industry and the foundation of society at the dawn of a new decade. It also ties in with certain implications of the title Sauve qui peut la vie 1980. At its most simplified level the title can be translated as Save Your Life Who's Able  Run for Your Life If You Can which suggests certain ideas that Godard himself talks about in the film with the character of the television director played by Jacques Dutronc a man whose selfishness and volatile relationships with the various women in his life make up yet another facet of the film's complicated emotional design.The title can also be seen as an ironic judgement on the once radical 60's generation that Godard was very much part of a generation now consumed by commercialised consumption greed and pointless selfabsorption guilt and examination. The title more commonly used in the UK Slow Motion is also alluded to by Godard not only with the film's deliberately slow pace but with the idea of slowing down moments in the attempt to see beyond the surface action and instead to see whether or not there is something else happening behind the facade of this ever moving tableau. Ultimately Godard's ideas remain vague forcing the viewer to question the intentions of the characters and what the filmmaker seems to be suggesting by their presentation within the film.".

Paul Godard Dutronc is the fearfuldependent side of most of us he's afraid to leave the city but can't live without Denise.

The scene with the two hookers in the businessman's office is wonderfully funny in its deadpan way it recalls Deux ou trois choses que je sais d'elle. The use of sound is more imaginative he isn't using the montage of Beethoven quartet snippets that he often relies on. His camera moves more than in the past there's a great slomo of Dutronc jumping over a table to tackle Baye then they both collapse laughing onto the floor.

His 'melting pocketwatch' The Persistence Of Memory was not just a silly timepiece bent out of shape like wax melting off a table. It was the fluidity of time how we perceive time in different ways. When we have fun for instance and time seems to speed up. When we're bored and it slows.Our inner experience of time is affected by our perception. Our focus our mental state it makes a big difference. We are similarly affected by how things are presented externally. Trees flashing past so quickly they are almost a blur. Have you ever been on a train as it traverses a wooded hill? But see the same trees from the hilltop and their majesty and poetry become evident. In both cases perhaps there is no absolute 'reality'  only different ways of perceiving it. At any one second our senses are overloaded with more data than our consciousness allows. It is less a case of 'seeing what is really there'  but of exerting control over our selection process our filtering and deciding what data to take time to consciously process and what our conscious mind ignores.Perception is for Godard an enduring theme. Speed it up slow it down. The camera mimics the process of visual perception. It chooses what to observe and how. It 'tells' us what to think. Can cinema by its careful control of simulated perception increase our understanding of 'how' we perceive things? Or alert us to the possibility that there is 'more' in front of our eyes than we might have assumed on that busy day? The nominal plot revolves around a three characters. A filmmaker called Godard. Denise a writereditor trying to make a career change. And Isabelle a prostitute Isabelle Huppert trying to better herself. Godard and Denise are in the painful process of ending a relationship. He is also going through a tough time with his exwife and daughter. Denise sees Isabelle being abused in the street. Isabelle sleeps with Godard after going to a movie with him. She wants to get a new place to live  even phoning about a flat during a bizarre sex scene  and she wants to work for herself instead of the pimp. Not knowing Godard is the landlord she visits their cottage up for rent as Godard throws himself across the table at Denise.Three wildly different life trajectories. Intersecting in ways that allow the film to challenge accepted notions. Toying with the nature of perception. And even asking how we get to where we want to be in life  or not. Separate chapters  after the intro sequences  for each character. Then 'Music' brings all three together. Look out for unusual sound tropes as well. Slow Motion  by whatever name we call it  is almost as conventional as Godard gets. While the narrative is far from mainstream it is a more recognisable cinema experience than much of his most challenging or didactic uncommercial work. And it provides material to sustain many repeated viewings.The film includes about 15 'stopaction' shots where the image is stopped completely slowed down replayed andor speeded up. We don't just analyse images outside of their diegetic function we are able to invent a parallel diegesis. It is almost like the breakup of a relationship where a man and woman see 'reality' from totally different perspectives. Godard deconstructs his own maxim of 'truth 24 times per second' by varying the speeds. Outwardly hollow moments contain more than might otherwise meet the eye. It is not the subject matter and characters that demand Brechtian analysis to become aware of our spectator involvement so much as the process of perception itself. In a scene where an executive orchestrates a scenario with two prostitutes and another man we are again confronted with complex metaphor Okay he says we've got the image now we'll take care of the sound. But here the symbol of prostitution is not playing into the Marxistbourgeois analogy so commonly used by Godard in films such as 2 Or 3 Things I Know About Her. In the debauchery we can see the construction processes and their perception the images the sound used to no specific purpose other than gratification  thus mimicking the production of mindless entertainment in Hollywood consumerist cinema.Compounding such stopmotion tropes is the use of interior dialogue. Isabelle plays out another life in her head while having sex with clients. What do we choose to 'see'? To hear? Comparison of the prostitution scenes and the scenes where natural spontaneous sexuality is apparent or implied coupled with the 'selection' process we make when determining how we 'see' things might reflect not only on how men and women or any two people can be 'in tune'  but also with different emphases affecting the dataperception process the very gender difference apparent when we look at how men and women might typically view things differently. There might be life apart from the diegetic one. We might choose what we perceive to be 'real'  but ultimately we make our own reality.Dehumanization occurs when a person is not able to order their life according to their will. At that point the individual has become a slave to the senses rather than their master. One might not be able to change the territory in which one finds oneself  but by standing back far enough to discern the wood from the trees one might at least find new perceptions that can be converted to reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Godard is fearless. Of that there is no doubt and if that were enough to warrant him as a master of filmmaking then countless filmmakers would be labeled masters for making films not for the audience but for themselves. Every director to an extent is making the film for themselves. But in the process of making it for themselves they come into contact with and then disseminate elements that later speak to someone who might be watching the film. With the majority of Godard's films it feels as though he is laughing at an injoke or propagating an antisocietal agenda with elements only he is capable of deciphering. The result at least for me is almost always a drunken flurry of images incongruous sounds and inexplicable character actions that show me method in madness but distance me from feeling the madness in the method. Every Man for Himself is a perfect example of this. It jumps around and gets inside as all Godard films do a number of different characters many of whom have nothing to do with anything other than perhaps preach a shocking aphorism here or there. The film starts with a woman shows her in various countryside locations riding her bike and standing with wind in her hair. These are not actors but models and NOT in the Bressonian sense. Bresson used his actors as models true but he still somehow was masterful at imbuing them with a sense of purpose even if the purpose is dealing with purposelessness and a sense of orientation. Godard fails at this and perhaps because he WANTS to fail. It's clear watching any of his films that he is a man who cringes at the slightest hint that his art might be compared to another's or that an audience member dares understand his film. I understand this impulse but not Godard's execution of it with the exception of his work on everything before and including Pierrot le fou. In those films Godard reached us with his passion for cinema particularly American films and his daring vision of contemporary life at odds with itself. It just seems at a certain point that Godard's filmmaking offers us little pieces of insight little moments of cinematic ingenuity that do nothing to enhance the raw impact of his films but instead commend him as what he primarily is a theorist and critic with more thought than execution going on in the majority of his post60s films.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of film a cinephile or took film classes in school you probably did an entire section on the iconic director JeanLuc Godard. You might have heard your film buff friends or professors show you why Godard is one of the best filmmakers to ever grace the big screen. And if you've seen any of his films you would have to agree which is why Criterion loves releasing his films under the brand.His 1980 film titled 'Every Man For Himself' was nominated for the Palme d'Or Award at Cannes that year and was almost nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars that same year. Prior to 1980 Godard's films were very experimental in nature and mostly done and a very small budget with small name actors. Godard himself has said that 'Every Man For Himself' was like being reborn again as this was considered his return to mainstream filmmaking with a decent sized budget and wellknown actors.While this film had those new aspects Godard continued to revert back to his experimental ways with the use of movement and music particularly using slow motion to elevate certain scenes. What Godard tries to convey and tell us with 'Every Man For Himself' is that no matter the choices you make in life or the paths you decide to go down you usually end up looking after yourself only. Godard even said that a better title for this film would be 'Save Your Ass'. 'Every Man For Himself' plays out like three separate oneact plays that centers on a certain character in each act. We all know that Godard has influenced tons of directors one of them being Quentin Tarantino so it shouldn't be a surprise that each character here and story line cross paths at some point in the film much like the characters did in 'Pulp Fiction'.We meet Paul Godard who is a filmmaker who has been having a long affair with a woman named Denise. This ultimately led to his divorce from his exwife. Since Paul is a moody sonofagun and doesn't want to put in the time emotional effort to make Denise happy she decides she needs move out and live in the country. But Denise also struggles with leaving the unhappy life in the city that she knows in order to make a change for the better. Meanwhile Paul tries to appease her but at a distance as he seems to sabotage himself and relationships because he wants to be alone.This is conveyed by his very unorthodox conversations and thoughts towards young girls which is fairly creepy. Paul ends up meeting a prostitute named Isabelle where after their session she continues her evening of work with several other clients who are not above abusing her. But she doesn't seem to mind her line of work or life. Even when her sister comes to town to look for help and money Isabelle convinces her to become an escort instead of helping out. And while Isabelle looks over the girls under her tutelage and the clients that abuse them she never breaks but instead basks in her life choices. Godard perfectly weaves each of these characters into literally running into each other where each person is forced to make a life decision and get on a better path.As we see Paul who seems to be his own worst enemy try and be the better father and exhusband he should be it's just inevitable for dire consequences to catch up with him. It's quite a brilliant style for Godard too as he uses the slow motion technique to upgrade these choices we make that influence the rest of our lives. 'Every Man For Himself' might not have the indie look or raw feel as his earlier films but Godard sure made a great film that makes us look at our own lives and think if we've made the right choices.".

They learn they are stranded on Mars while Lowell returns to Earth to bring a rescue team. Meanwhile Luca calculates the oxygen water and supplies and concludes that there are enough for only two of them to survive the twentysix months before an eventual rescue team reaches Mars. It's decided that Luca engineer and Jenny doctor should be the ones to stay in the spacecraft due to their specialties while Susan Rodrigo and Sagan set out to explore the planet before their inevitable death.

The underlying logic drives the film not c.g.i. and that is why the originality. If you enjoy the thrill of discovery and the deliberate pace is not going to be a problem then this is a must see.

We spend a good chunk of the film watching the crew crashlanded on Mars without enough supplies trying to figure out what to do. It takes a long time before we get to the mystery and for once we don't get to see the dwarf behind the curtain. If this were a Hollywood film all of Stranded would be cut down to about 15 minutes and the rest of the film would be an action film where the surviving crew are being chased by some lame baddie maybe a crew member gone mad or some rusty martian janitorial robot with a few screws loose.I like the film. Make no mistake it has a lot of BAD things about it. A few awful casting choices amateurish directing and absolutely awful voiceover narration. The first five minutes are so awful you wouldn't believe it. But once the film gets underway there's enough good to it to let you ignore the bad.If you like Hollywood scifi don't watch this film because you'll absolutely hate it. But if you like films such as 2001 Solaris and THX1138 then you might want to give this film a chance. By no means is it up to the standards of such masterpieces but it's far more memorable and interesting than any other Marsflick made in recent years.".

Here's a modest little film that doesn't depend on huge special effects and gratuitous action sequences in order to tell a cracking little story with enough twists and turns to keep an old scifi fan like myself guessing until the end.The premise is certainly nothing we haven't had before think Mission to Mars or Robinson Crusoe on Mars but this particular storyline was dense and well paced no loose ends everything for a purpose.The other aspect of the movie I liked was the atmosphere that it managed to build through what I think are all the things that people have criticized it for. It had a sense of calm otherworldliness to which the nonUS accents and at times offbeat delivery by some of the actors contributed. The dialog is more naturalistic than in a bigbudget Hollywood action scifi flick and this may be why some people found it weird.Some of the dialog was a bit corny but I think deliberately  a little tip of the hat to earlier tales of that ilk one of the characters conspicuously starts quoting from John Carter of Mars at one point and we feel we're in an entirely different movie for a momentThe sedate narration from the main actress the gorgeous locations shots and even the interior of the Martian complex with its mysterious technology all contributed to a dreamlike and alien quality invoked by this movie.Great fun!Rating  10 out of 10.".

And this is the problem I have with almost every movie that depicts real people such as in this case astronauts and scientists. Real people actually do talk all at once hesitate talk in monotone when they're trying to mask their feelings etc etc.That brings me to this movie which surprised me with its honest attempt at realism the voices sounded authentic as distinct from other movies in this subgenre such as 'Mission to Mars' and 'Red Planet' where dialog was all acted and the astronauts seemed like the writers' idea of an astronaut rather than a real astronaut. However in this movie I suspect the almost documentary realpeopletalking feel of it was a deliberate instruction on the director's part.'the story did not explain everything that happened' hey welcome to the real world people! The fact this movie did not neatly tie everything up struck me as one of its best features.

I found it a totally satisfying movie experience.The voting clearly shows this movie is not for everyone! Only a small minority gave it ten as I did and the most frequent choices were either 1 or 6. Still I wonder if some of the sixers at least might not reconsider on a more thoughtful viewing looking at it as a highly nonformulaic work?I note the director who also took a lead acting role here 'very badly' of course has one other movie to her credit apparently with a documentary style to it.

I completely disagree.Stranded is far better than the other Mars movies of late.  Red Planet Ghosts of Mars Mission to Mars... all of which are ripoffs of other movies anyway....  This movie is so much better!Ask yourself... What would it REALLY be like to be stranded on Mars? What would you have to consider?  What would your motivations be to carry on? What would you do if you were faced with having to die for the sake of others?  How would personalities clash when under pressure?  All these issues and more are considered in this film. What?!  No laser beams???  No green aliens hiding around the corner??? No technological boobytraps left behind by a race that's moved on???  No rock'n'roll soundtrack???  No big name Alist actors???Sorry folks... how about some realism instead?  How about some tough decisions being made by people under pressure?  That is what makes this a great movie.Slow paced Wordy?  Hmmmm what do you think it WOULD be like stranded on Mars for what is likely to be years?  I think they would take the time to discuss life altering decisions like they do in this movie.  I think they would have conflict and argue every point... WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO? When it's time for some to make the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of the others what would they do?  Why not head out to see if they can make it to a nearby anomaly?  It's what they would do.Unrealistic discovery?  So what!  This is still sciencefiction although by this time we may have understandably forgotten the fiction part. They find that there was life on Mars!  Come on!  Every Mars movies finds some evidence of life.  At least this one doesn't turn into a shoot'emup or special effects fiasco.  Can't explain the findings in a quick nutshell? Of course not!  They have nothing but the suits on their backs to help them. They are not going to understand it.  Why should the movie reveal it to us any more than to the characters?  It doesn't need to.  It's not what this movie is about.Bad ending?  How would you want it to end?  It ends at a point where you can consider the possibilities for yourself.  What would you do?  What do you think these characters whom we have come to know a little about would do?  It's left up to you to decide.  They don't know yet... we don't know...Bad dubbing bad acting?  Come on!  This is a foreign movie.  Haven't you come to expect dubbing when foreign people are trying to say English lines? As for the acting it isn't that bad.  It's a very dialog driven movie of people under pressure... I think they handle it well enough.  I guess most aren't expecting a dialog driven movie when they pick this up but that doesn't mean it is a bad movie... just not what you expected.I could go on and on... Even the subtle things like the last two who leave their helmets on because they didn't discover the breathable atmosphere until they are told about it all done without a word spoken... Great stuff.Definitely take a chance on this movie.  For those that can appreciate a thinking scifi movie that doesn't end up in a big blow up action finale I think you'll be glad you did.  If you are disappointed relax.  You took a chance and would have just wasted the same amount of time on some action movie that would have left you with nothing to think about anyway.I would pick this up again long before any of the other three films I mentioned even though it is FULLSCREEN.  Therefore I'm giving it 810.".

Stranded is a very good psychological study of a group of astronauts who crash land on Mars have very limited resources and no expectation of quick rescue.The activity is driven by perfectly reasonable dialog not sure if Hollywood remembers how to do this  much harder than the typical action stuff. The acting is perfectly adequate to support the dialog and deliver the story. The strain associated with the circumstances is effectively communicated and the frictions here and there are entirely appropriate. As mentioned elsewhere the cinematography is very well done and I had no problems at all with the closeups  nice job.I would suggest that anyone who doesn't appreciate the classic film Lifeboat by Alfred Hitchcock definitely wouldn't like Stranded. Sure Lifeboat is clearly the more powerful of the two but Stranded has a similar character.".

This movie is essentially documentary in form distinct from a true documentary in that it describes purely fictional events and people. On one level this is refreshing on another tedious but on any level it is not clich.To succeed with this approach however a film's realism with all the details that go into it must be virtually flawless so that wellscienceinformed viewers  who are likely to be the only people audience to fully appreciate and enjoy such a film  do not have their suspension of disbelief abused by such impossibilities as space helmets with visible gaps in their supposedly airtight seals etc. Failure of such critical details effectively ruins the film beyond redemption even if it succeeds brilliantly in other areas such as the rendering of a convincinglooking Martian landscape.Another area it can fail is if some or all of the characters fail to behave according to the wellinformed viewers' expectations of how welltrained astronauts  or the viewers themselves  would behave. Though the interaction of the characters in Stranded seems genuine and realistic on occasion it often doesn't and upon discovering the incredible these supposed scientists and adventurers seem devoid of even normal curiosity. The only line of characterization that consistently feels real is the awe they feel at the beauty of the Martian surface and sky despite the lethality these threaten.I believe that the right technical consultant could have made this movie a classic on a par with 2001 A Space Odyssey  while clearly made on a tighter budget Stranded avoids the confusing metaphysical finale that many feels marred 2001. As it stands I expect this movie will be lost and forgotten in the worlds discount DVD bins with barely a ripple in science fiction fandom. Even with its inevitable movie channel rotation I will be surprised if it gathers 1000 votes on IMDb.".

I must admit that I wasn't impressed by the acting. Generally I'd expect people who consider themselves doomed or people making the greatest discovery in the history of the human race to show just a little bit more emotion.But compared to most current SciFi movies today I think this is clear above average. I think the basic story isn't great but it isn't bad. Unlike some others I liked the ending. Given that you accept the aired regions on Mars then leaving the remaining crew in the 'life bubble' for want of better words to attempt to survive in that landscape is a great way to end. I hope the people who didn't like the ending would not have preferred Bruce Willis to have flown a converted 747 from Earth to swoop in and save them at the last minute. Nor for the crew to find a sole remaining alien spaceship fully fueled up so that the crew could master the controls in five minutes and fly it back. Nope the ending was the best choice IMHO made in the movie.As for the rest of the movie it was fine. Not great but OK. The effects weren't groundbreaking. But they were sufficient. The plot wasn't that original but it was OK. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in SciFi and don't expect every movie to be the best ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you dislike slow pace and needs lots of explosions or adventure in your sciencefiction films avoid Stranded. You won't enjoy it.But if you like slow realistic thought provoking scifi films like 2001 or Solaris with a twist of psychological drama then give Stranded a go.On a tiny budget I believe the makers of Stranded have achieved a deeper more interesting Mars film than any other to date.Six Astronauts aboard the first mission to Mars crash their ship when landing and the only hope of rescue is a potential 3 year wait for another ship from Earth. With not enough air water or energy to last for 3 years the film asks  what would you do? The settings are believable the acting a little varied some accents might even be dubbed and the special effects merely OK. It looks like a mere BBC TV special. But try not to be distracted by these quibbles.Apart from an initial space travel shot or two special effects aren't needed. The film's real strength is the tension between the characters as they sit huddled in the wreckage of their ship and the harsh reality of their situation.Even a science fiction twist at the end remains believable thanks to it's understated nature.I went into this film expecting a terrible bgrade scifi film. Instead I found myself on the edge of my seat from beginning to end and was frankly blown away by it's mature effort on such a tiny budget to portray a scifi scenario on Mars.Highly recommended for lovers of sincere and realistic scifi drama.".

You won't enjoy it.But if you like slow realistic thought provoking scifi films like 2001 or Solaris with a twist of psychological drama then give Stranded a go.On a tiny budget I believe the makers of Stranded have achieved a deeper more interesting Mars film than any other to date.Six Astronauts aboard the first mission to Mars crash their ship when landing and the only hope of rescue is a potential 3 year wait for another ship from Earth. With not enough air water or energy to last for 3 years the film asks  what would you do? The settings are believable the acting a little varied some accents might even be dubbed and the special effects merely OK. It looks like a mere BBC TV special. But try not to be distracted by these quibbles.Apart from an initial space travel shot or two special effects aren't needed. The film's real strength is the tension between the characters as they sit huddled in the wreckage of their ship and the harsh reality of their situation.Even a science fiction twist at the end remains believable thanks to it's understated nature.I went into this film expecting a terrible bgrade scifi film. Instead I found myself on the edge of my seat from beginning to end and was frankly blown away by it's mature effort on such a tiny budget to portray a scifi scenario on Mars.Highly recommended for lovers of sincere and realistic scifi drama.";

So Earthlings who are all from Spain which is coincidentally where the film was made send a group of explorers to see just what it all means if anything. From the title it's pretty obvious what happens to these pioneers when they arrive at the Red Planet.More of the film seems to occupy itself with character study than a study of Mars. There's a lot of arguing between the marooned crew members until your ears start to bleed. Luka says three must die which makes everybody mad for some reason. As annoying as he is on that issue his request of a fellow astronaut will prove this clown a total schmuck. One of the funniest lines is Dr. Jenny's rebuke to this gloomy Eeyore goof ball. Just as you've had enough of the mono tonal banter of that genius Luka to choke on the film finally concerns itself with exploring Mars.The imagery inside the spacecraft isn't bad and the acting is decent enough. The exteriors seem based on the then recent photography from the Martian surface and are pretty impressive an endless desert imbued with a red hue. As the explorers embark on what will probably be a suicide walk things start to perk up and get interesting. After diverting from a space exploration story to a survival story the film makes a welcome return to the spirit of wonder that the mysterious Martian world offers. What the astronauts encounter poses more questions than it answers. This is the essential scifi approach and it works fairly well in this film.This movie may have gotten overlooked in the shuffle of movies about Mars that came out around the same time. It may not have had a budget equal to some of the others but it stands on its own pretty well. Not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "By reading most of the  reviews for this movie posted here im starting to think that i must have seen a diferent movie for sure ! I cant believe the bad things people say about it. How can this be ?!!The reviews under this movie seem totaly surreal !!! What movie have these persons seen ?!! Or better what movie were this persons expecting STRANDED to be ? Another Hollywood special effects crap for teenagebraindeads ?!! Well im sorry people this is not that kind of movie STRANDED is definetely not RED PLANET and thank God it doesnt even try to be Matrix !Lets get one thing straight here STRANDED is  one of the best modern scifi movies that anybody interested in serious sciencefiction could watch nowadays. And if you like Mars believeme this is the movie for you.STRANDED is one of the rare movies that truly can be called sciencefiction.  At a time where almost everything that comes out into the mainstream is just a bunch of crappy MTV movies design to please moronic teenage audiences im glad that someone somewhere in the world is still producing sciencefiction movies based on intriguing ideas and not on dollar bills ! Movies that make us dream by stimulating our imagination movies that still allow space for the audiences to  imagine things instead of showing us videogame designs pyrotechnics  and explaining the plot in detail at the end. Its fantastic to still find a movie that right up until the last moment makes us wich we could see more of it. STRANDED is that kind of movie. A movie for people with imagination who preffer good ideas to videogame designs. Who preffer a good unsolved mistery that captures the imagination instead of long special effects battles and asteroide chases. A movie for people who love to read a good scifi novel instead of watching reruns of SWEpisode II like crap all the time untill they have no more brain left and the only thing they want in life is to go out and buy the merchandise.STRANDED is a movie for anyone who ever dreamed of walking on Mars. Forget RED PLANET that is almost not even worth mentioning. STRANDED is the next best thing to be walking on Martian land and exploring the unknown. And forget MISSION TO MARS because STRANDED is the Archeological scifi story you were expecting when you went to see that. STRANDED manages to produce that feeling of wonder regarding archeological Martian misteries without looking like a Walt Disney movie for all the family and filled up with american family values throwned at your face every frame of the movie.STRANDED is a brilliant little spanish movie which proves that you dont need to have millions of dollars to make audiences dream and you sure dont even need flashy special effects to do it. Just a couple of brilliantly designed sets which look totaly real and a good simple premise. You dont even need a story. Not in that Hollywood sense of what a movie story should be.In STRANDED you wont find good guys bad guys treasons fist fights laser guns acid for blood Aliens  love stories car chases sex light sabres and Matrix style Mtv special effects. And ObiWan is not in this movie. In STRANDED you will find human charaters who act like real persons and not like Hollywood depictions of real people you will find totaly realistic Martian atmosphere you will find a great exploration feeling and some intriguing ideas that will make you dream. And if youre up to date regarding the archeological controversy about the hypotetical Martian ruins you will absolutely love STRANDED because im sure you will recognize some things that are used as a basis for the story. If you dont have a clue about the subject then go back to your multiplex and eat your popcorns before even saying that the ending of this movie is unrealistic. One thing is for sure i can bet that Arthur Clarke himself if he saw this movie he  loves it to death. If you know what im talking about youll get much more out of this movie than the uninformed audiences. If you dont know anything about the subject keep an open mind and enjoy the wonder. Just dont expect an action movie. The suspense in STRANDED is not in the action but on the ideas and sense of wonder that it conveys right up until the end. If you think a movie based on ideas and characters which has no Hollywood action is a boring and pointless movie dont bother its not for you.STRANDED is for everybody who preffers a good story instead.And to those people who might think this is a boring movie because of the bad reviews in here believe me those people couldnt be more wrong. In fact its obvious that theyre more angry at the movie simply because they dont understand it. If they did they wouldnt be calling it boring and pointless. Its not its full of imagination and sense of wonder. And that is what science fiction should be about. Not about product placement cgi efects and mtv style.Good direction excelent design and an excelent story with a great ending which leaves us wanting to se more. What more can you want from a scifi movie ? Ok it has its weaknesses. The actors very between the excelent and the terrible. But all go through that so i guess its not their fault. Maybe the movie lacks a better actors direction. And dont forget this is not an american movie these are not american actors except Gallo so its obvious the movie would sound weird to the american ears. So what ?!Give this movie a chance people. Its a brilliant movie not in an artistic way its not even Art House but in a global sense of the finished product. Its one of the best scifi movies in recent years and mark my words one day this will be a very  very well known movie and one that everyone will want to check out for its accuracy in the story of human History. Laugh at will.The best Mars movie ever and everything Red Planet and Mission to Mars should have been and failled miserabily. STRANDED has everything in its right place. This is what scifi movies should be all about. I have bought this three days ago and ive already seen it 3 times. I have no problem at all in rating it 10 out of 10.Dont believe any of the bad reviews in here. These people obviously were expecting more of the usual Hollywood crap and wanted to see some aliens and laser battles. They didnt got them and got angry at the movie. To me anyone who claims to like sciencefiction and doesnt like this movie then the definition of scifi for that person must be anything Lucas related. I can bet that the same people who attacked STRANDED are the same type of audiences who think 2001 and Blade Runner are boring movies because they dont have a plot.If you live in R2 regions buy the spanish edition of the DVD because its very good and contrary to the bad R1 edition the european one is 169 anamorphic and not full frame.By the way my email above is no longer valid the new one is l.peresnetcabo.pt. Any threats comments send it there. ".

It's obviously lowbudget and the space suites could have been more realistic but despite this it is still a movie worth seeing if you are a SciFi buff. The acting style throughout the film is quite different and somewhat odd for this type of movie however this is really one of it's strongest features and makes it a unique movie. The way the lines are delivered seems more like dialog of a play rather than dialog in film if that makes any sense. Almost as if it is a live production. The characters are far more flawed and realistic than most movies especially Vincent Gallo's character which seems to be something he does rather well. I loved Maria de Medeiros as Jenny she's a presence just with her eyes. Joaquim de Almeida is probably the best actor in this film and portrays depth without really even knowing much about the character. Mara Lidn does a great job but is also the most odd with her delivery of the dialog and monologue throughout the film. It's a slow paced movie but not overly long in length which makes it able to stay interesting throughout. The music is especially good in this movie which adds a lot to it's power.

The movie is set almost as a documentary that focuses on the logical progression of events rather then searching for cheap dramatic climaxes.Overall worth a watch if your a scifi fan it offers a new and unique perspective to the mysteries of mars and is overall enjoyable.".

Some will not like it automatically because it is a foreign film. Some won't like it because a couple of characters were dubbed.If you simply look at this film you can recognize the beauty of the storytelling. The tension of the sequence in which the astronauts are assessing the situation and slowly learning what their fate actually is it's hypnotic. The feeling of complete helplessness of the pilot on the station as Herbert says to be so close and be unable to do anything.Now I will say that the second half of the film deviates and becomes a different film. It becomes a bit of a docudrama of sorts showing the supposed final hours of these stranded explorers.This film is categorized as a scifi film but really it is a study of human nature and survival. How do these people deal with their fate how do you deal with deciding who lives and who dies. What do you do when you know you have hours to live. What drives people to put themselves in the danger of exploring an alien world.Please give this film a chance. If you watch it with an open mind you may be surprised.".

It's a joy to see James Robertson Justice take centre stage for a change whether bashfully admitting his childhood nickname of 'Porker' or visiting a health farm he never fails to raise a smile.To be honest Bogarde is largely wasted in this film still it is nice to see Simon Sparrow for one final time. Indeed 'Doctor In Distress' does have a feeling of closure to it with Sparrow no longer a hapless young medic but instead an established colleague and friend of Sir Lancelot.  It is a real pleasure to see these two fine actors reunited once again.Sadly there would be eventually two more 'Doctor' movies made of variable quality but 'Doctor In Distress' sees out the classic 'Doctor' movies with style.".

All great fun.Justice is excellent in a role that he owns Bogarde gives us a professional confident and sophisticated Simon. It was very interesting to watch his performance since I had just seen the first Doctor movie a day or two earlier when Sparrow was young and wideeyed. Bogarde as Sparrow still maintains his gentle quality which makes for a nice followthrough of the character.Not the greatest film but an amusing one.".

	schema:reviewBody "During a stonelaying ceremony for a new wing to the hospital Sir Lancelot Spratt takes a fall and ends up with a slipped disk making him a patient in his own hospital. Unsurprisingly for such an old curmudgeon Spratt is as difficult a patient as he is a surgeon and is determined to make life difficult for anyone daring to treat him. However when he is treated by physiotherapist Delia Mallory he finds himself cured and a tad smitten by her. When he starts sleepwalking he turns to Dr Sparrow who diagnoses a psychosomatic cause and advises Spratt to turn to Mallory for his cure!I've never been that bothered by the Doctor series simply because they are a gentle affair that fall below the Carry On series in regards laughs and tone. Here the film focuses on Spratt rather than the usual character Sparrow. The latter is given a rather dull subplot while occasionally getting him to stick his head in with Spratt to keep some vague connection to the main story. This approach is good for those that like the character Spratt which includes me because I have always found his gruff character a rather nice distraction from the bland humour that it mostly churns out. Although it is nothing special this does make it quite a light and enjoyable film. The plot is contrived and generally dull but it does have a matine feel to it that may satisfy some viewers.Justice naturally dominates the film thanks to the material. He doesn't do anything new or exciting but having a bit of variation to his character seemed to give him something to work with. Bogarde sort of drifts around the edge of the film on his way out. He still has the same touch in his scenes as he always had in the series but for me personally that doesn't mean a great deal. Support is generally wasted from the few familiar faces there are and none of them including the main female cast members made enough of an impression on me to even stick in my memory even as far as this paragraph.Overall this is a light matine affair that has no real laughs plot or interest. However this seems to be its intension and if you like the light slightly comic touch of the series then I see no reason why you will not like this. For most viewers though I imagine it will be frothy to the pointless of boredom and light to the point of not having a point. Wet Sunday afternoon stuff but will not do much beyond that.".

It's really James Robertson Justice's performance that makes this film with his wonderful fruity bark and seeing him given the chance to show off other sides of his acting ability coming over as a rather affable chap now and again.Like a lot of these British comedy films the plot is waferthin you really have to suspend your disbelief and ultimately it isn't really very funny at all.But for me I came away with a satisfied smile on my face having enjoyed the film for other reasons. The supporting cast is a real who's who of British screen acting with people like Timothy Bateson John Bluthal Donald Houston and many others. Being a fan of Flanders and Swan it was a nice surprise to see Michael Flanders as the food writer at the health farm.My favourite scene is at the railway station where rail buffs can ooh and ahh at British Railwaysera carriages and locos the history buffs at the posters for milk and rail rovers. There's also lots of street shots full of classic British cars blackandwhite striped sign posts and cafs where you can get beans on toast for 10d and fried egg beans chips and fried bread for the princely sum of 26! Not a great film you sometimes find yourself pushing the fast forward button. But for James Robertson Justice and as a kind of time capsule of early 60s Britain it's perfect.".

DOCTOR IN DISTRESS is a likable if slight effort that's better than it ought to be thanks to the actors involved.The film sees Dirk Bogarde and James Robertson Justice playing friends and rivals working at a top hospital. Justice falls in love and much of the film follows his character as he attempts to make himself presentable for his love interest. Bogarde doesn't have a great deal to do other than romance a youthful Samantha Eggar. Most of the humour comes from the characters and has dated a bit although there are a few slapstick moments.Much of the fun here comes from seeing the cameoing stars as there are a lot of them. Donald Houston is a wheelchairbound patient and Joe Robinson a typically imposing boyfriend character. Fenella Fielding plays a frightened lady on a train. Leo McKern has a one scene cameo as a flamboyant artist. Dennis Price manages to be sinister in a couple of minutes. Amanda Barrie looks great in a bikini. The likes of Derek Fowlds Richard Briers and Johnny Briggs play medical students and Ronnie Barker has a little cameo at the train station.

Annie and Hannah were roomates in college for 4 years after they graduated Annie returned to her hometown and now 6 years later she's visiting her old friend in London for the first time in those 6 years.

After the night set pounding bleakness of something like Naked Career Girls is the morning after  a desire for everything to remain quiet and somewhat subdued a film with people more often than not inhabiting cleaner more cleansed locales and speaking on more grounded humanised terms as they remember the past and laugh at things from times gone by instead of look ahead to a future of the impending disasters that are readily incoming.In some regards the film is about the addressing of one's past the acknowledging of what it is that made oneself in terms of one's experiences and being unafraid to confront them or indeed revisit a proverbial place in which one felt one's identity was forged. For the most part the two female leads of Career Girls flit around a sunny London encountering people from their past and recalling them via stories and whatnot the key difference arriving in the form of the women being able to recognise and relive certain memories and engagements those of whom they meet and are able to speak with at length often coming across as seemingly oblivious to such interactions  a result which has them appear as disturbed or as arrogant or with any other previous negative characteristics that they always had. We sense the two women however have advanced from their jittery restless natures that once imbued their lives back in the day.The two women are Hannah and Annie respectively played by Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman Annie the one occupying the frame when we first see either of them  a train journey down to London from the north to meet with Hannah. Hannah and Annie were university students in England's capital back in the 1980s their demeanour back then far more different to a primmer more proper attitude to appearance and social behaviour than is evident in the present our entrusting that they are university students firstyear freshers maybe hand in hand with their general incarnations which calling to mind two certain Harry Enfield characters of a teenaged ilk. Hannah is better off in life than Annie a well dressed woman with a company car and apartment whereas Annie is on the verge of chucking in her job. Where accusations they of a frivolous and false sort of misogyny blighted criticisms of the aforementioned Naked Leigh splits a film that is all about women and these two women specifically down the centre page in telling an if only occasionally interesting tale that is light on story but is instead a somewhat charming account of these two recalling the faces and places which had the impact that they did on these two.In the 1980s they live a grimy existence with a third girl named Claire Byers a small accommodation above a Chinese takeaway shop encompassing the three of them in messy living rooms and shared bedrooms. The film chops between the two strands either of the strands with enough in them to make decent films shorts or otherwise as stand alone pieces but here somewhat uncomfortably spliced together as the nature of the chaotic and unhinged past tense clashes uneasily indeed ineffectively juxtaposes with the brighter and more 'grownup' present tense strand of the two of them taking trips down memory lane. Leigh proves he can rack up a certain sense of unease the initial coming together between the two women is we feel fraught with mites of tension. One instance sees a flashback to an altercation involving some mugs following one of the women's present day mentioning of them a past instance that brings back a negative memory which ends undesirably that arrives with a good use of panic and pulsating musical tones.It's too bad the rest of the film is not up to as much as this brief excursion during which seeds of antagonism or whatnot are alluded to the film lacking a cutting narcissistic edge and instead plumbing for these people generally getting along swimmingly with one another in their gliding from one place to the next frequently recognising someone of old but sometimes not. At one point we observe the film open up for an extended venturing of the two from apartment to apartment as Hannah looks for somewhere new to live something encompassing odd interactions with shady realestate folk but it's nothing in fact the two girls downplay the situations  where conflict seems apparent Leigh stays in sync with the film Career Girls is and manoeuvres us around it for laugh and frolics as they merely exiting accordingly.Where tension and a fair amount of drama is maintained lies with the ambiguity surrounding just how much of the past either of these characters can actually recall. A great deal of 1980s content gives way to the present day stuff more inclined to lending time to these people uncovering places and people of old which while looked back upon with nostalgia in that fashion nostalgia often brings about what actually unfolded back in the day was often quite grotty and rough. Not for a second are we entirely sure precisely what it is either woman remembers and what they don't and if they laugh and joke about times and people of old how much can we invest in the past strand if the resultant drama leads them to where they are now? In spite of everything there is an endearing quality about proceedings it may not be particularly noteworthy but it has a charm to it.".

Lynda Steadman is also superb.The film is partly in flashback to college days in the 1980s and partly set in the present of the 1990s.  I see the exaggerated twitching and accents of the characters in the 1980s scenes as part of the flashback genre. Perhaps I went to University with exceptionally twitchy people or perhaps the memory pitches collegedays memories at 30 framespersecond but my own flashbacks to such times feel a bit like that.  I thought it was intriguing cinematography but the majority seems to be against me.Where the film does grate a little is in the coincidences that lead them to run in to their past several times.  Two of the coincidences are necessary for the plot and interest.  One seems like a coincidence too many and it goes nowhere  maybe there was an intended plot thread that got dropped  well the coincidence should also have been dropped in that case.It's a short film and it held our attention from start to finish.

	schema:reviewBody "Having caught a glimpse of Leigh's High Hopes on television a few years back I remember how the simplistic unpretentious subtle hilariousness and dramatic realism stuck with me. I then caught All or Nothing on IFC and immediately noticed the similarities in style between these two films. Then I rented Career Girls and so far Mike Leigh is 3 for 3 with me. I intend to watch all of his films. These movies are not for the easily distracted as they tend to move at a very slow pace and plots are not the main focus of the filmaking. However the characters are all wonderfully portrayed and the acting is remarkable. Career Girls is no exception. Often hilarious this movie also touches the heartstrings but in a very careful manner.

	onyx:emotionText "Having caught a glimpse of Leigh's High Hopes on television a few years back I remember how the simplistic unpretentious subtle hilariousness and dramatic realism stuck with me. I then caught All or Nothing on IFC and immediately noticed the similarities in style between these two films. Then I rented Career Girls and so far Mike Leigh is 3 for 3 with me. I intend to watch all of his films. These movies are not for the easily distracted as they tend to move at a very slow pace and plots are not the main focus of the filmaking. However the characters are all wonderfully portrayed and the acting is remarkable. Career Girls is no exception. Often hilarious this movie also touches the heartstrings but in a very careful manner. Unlike Love Actually a British film that is as contrived as it is sickeningly patronizing in it's presumption that anyone would find it remotely watchable. I look forward to watching Leigh's Secrets and Lies next!9 out of 10";

And it are the characters that almost make you feel like you are watching a documentary that make them so special. This story is again a story with nothing much interesting. Two roommates that meet again. Half of the time in real life and the other in sort of flashbacks. But this time the acting is so very much overdone that it is almost like I'm watching an American comedy with just the fake laughs in the background missing.

	schema:reviewBody "I quite enjoy replaying Mike Leigh's older films this time reviewing them and admittedly Career Girls was far from being my or it seems most other people's first choice.I'd recorded mine from Film4's broadcast just before the release of his latest 'Another Year' the advantage being Mr Leigh introduced it himself and said that it was often overlooked and he wasn't quite sure why. I had seen it myself on a couple of occasions before most probably on the same channel and always quite liked it. It's not my favourite but always found it better once fully immersed.Is that because I'm a bloke who never went to Uni and never had to flatshare but there again the 80s and 90s were formative years for me too.Anyway as is usual with almost Leigh films the opening few minutes always seem to have annoying characters that we really rather not share any time with doing their best worst? to put us off. However once we get used to them and their strange odd ways they become part of our screen lives and as if they were people we actually know we put up with their annoying aspects and revel in their good Leigh's folk are very human almost TOO much so.So Leigh's purpose was to show how passages of time circumstance and education plus friendship can follow in both predictive and unpredicted ways with the reunion of two Uni classmates ten years later with frequent but obvious flashbacks to the student years we can see how people can change. Side by side the contrasts are very marked almost too much so but as we usually witness our friends forming slowly year by year who's to say that Leigh is not right?There's a smaller pool of main characters than with the better Leighs and as with say the later but even less good Happy Go Lucky there is less respite from the obnoxious and smaller variety in which to spice up the story.Oddly considering it's the female lead characters that Leigh is championing it's the two male leads that we see regularly on TV and cinema screen these days  Mark Benton as the twitchy overweight Goth who gets to know them in student digs but always finds solace and comfort in food instead of confronting fears including women these two women. And Andy Serkis who Leigh says he made as an opposite to Benton's sweet nature as possible and in Serkis we have a 'disgusting pig' as Leigh refers to him. Both chauvinist and arrogant he could be seen as the ultimate product of the Thatcherite Yuppie years and again typically Leigh he doesn't portray this subtly and quite rightly we want to leave his company as quickly as possible but perhaps more importantly want our 'girls' to as well. There are lots of comedic takes on Serkis' lifestyle 'choices' and this does lighten the emotional load.The two female leads Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman though do not seem to be gracing our screens at all right now though Cartlidge did feature in Leigh's Topsy Turvy 1999 and previously in the excellent NakedLeigh's best film probably from 1993. Steadman seemed to have been in TV dramas about then but  all according to IMDb  nothing since 2003.Maybe Mike Leigh has made too much out of political and economic markers to make us really care for any of the people here. Yes they're engaging with their character traits and whilst we sort of feel a part of their world albeit briefly we don't necessarily want to be. However there are some nice down to earth and more reflective moments they are just a bit too far between to be make the film totally enjoyable.".

The story is ludicrous it centers around two exroommatesfriends who meet again after six years. Their lives have changed they've become more mature. We can see how they were years before through a series of flashbacks.This is a film by Mike Leigh who has been praised for making such strong character studies in which the story is less important than the people. SECRETS AND LIES was in the same style and is maybe his best known film. Although this was also an uninteresting and cold film it had something of a story in it. You got in a certain way a chance to know something about the characters. But this film is a total disaster. What did these actors for example eat were they on speed or what? why did they act this way? The Rickycharacter for example is good for a few unintended laughs  but I think the director told him to say whatever words came to his mind so that he could mumble through the film.But the true uninteresting even irritating characters are the main ones the two girls. You never quite get to know them so you never get to care about them. The fact that they act as lunatics and talk the same way doesn't help either. It's almost impossible to understand the conversations especially in the beginning. And what do they actually talk about? Does this have a meaning? The film is filled with such a stupid dialogue.I can't recommend this film to anyone. It's simply to dumb. And if you would choose to watch this filmand sit through it! you got to ask yourself the question in the end why in God's name do we need such a film?

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler may be hereI enjoy Mike Leigh's movies.  Sometimes you get the feeling you are watching an awkward moment on somebody's home movies.Career Girls follows the six year reunion of college roommates and unlikely friends Hannah and Annie.  We see Hannah and Annie now refined in their older age but as they flashback to their flat mate days we see two spastic girls.Annie visits Hannah in London and in the first flashback Annie recalls meeting Hannah as she moves into the flat.  Hannah is mean and outspoken and you wonder why Annie would ever want to be her friendespecially as Hannah makes fun of Annie's eczema on her face.  But they soon become friendssometimes it is hard to watch these women.  Annie jerks her head to the side and shakes with shyness while Hannah talks on the top of her lungs and flings her arms about.  And if you watch carefully both revert to these nervous behaviors as adults in certain scenes.I was waiting for the big revelation but it was nothing really.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoiler may be hereI enjoy Mike Leigh's movies.  Sometimes you get the feeling you are watching an awkward moment on somebody's home movies.Career Girls follows the six year reunion of college roommates and unlikely friends Hannah and Annie.  We see Hannah and Annie now refined in their older age but as they flashback to their flat mate days we see two spastic girls.Annie visits Hannah in London and in the first flashback Annie recalls meeting Hannah as she moves into the flat.  Hannah is mean and outspoken and you wonder why Annie would ever want to be her friendespecially as Hannah makes fun of Annie's eczema on her face.  But they soon become friendssometimes it is hard to watch these women.  Annie jerks her head to the side and shakes with shyness while Hannah talks on the top of her lungs and flings her arms about.  And if you watch carefully both revert to these nervous behaviors as adults in certain scenes.I was waiting for the big revelation but it was nothing really.  Hannah and Annie run into ex roommates and boyfriends during their weekend reunionand one ex doesn't even remember them.  Everybody their age has married and moved on.  But these girls are outcasts.  And in the end you can see life has been unfair to them except in their careers.This type of movie is not everybody's cup of tea and there is some thick English accents here.

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got around to watching Loft after a year of owning the DVD If you find a copy play it loud because the sound really makes the movie. The director is Kiyoshi Kurosawa and I'm a huge fan of his work. His films are just so often unable to be defined in one genre or ANY genre for that matter. The first 2 thirds of the film are filled with so many haunting and hypnotic scenes. It is macabre and yet beautiful. I couldn't look away and just sat there glued to the TV breathing shallowly like only Kiyoshi Kurosawa can make me do.His films have a pace that makes drying paint seem like an adventure sport. But what that means is that every shot of the film is studying something or someone or something that isn't even there. As with all of his films that I haveseen in Loft I felt a kind of voyeuristic feeling like I was there in the scene too. It is hard to describe but this quality is clearly what alienates some people. What some viewers considere painfully boring had me on the edge of my seat until the last frame. Watching with empathy projecting yourself into the shoes of the characters the film's real depth come to the fold.And sound really does make all this live or quite often the lack of sound. Silence is one of the scariest things you can ever hear as paradoxical as that seems. Kurosawa perhaps knows just how unusual silence actually is in our lives and when it occurs in his films the effect is haunting. And it also the abruptness of sound in his films. A crescendo of tension in the audio can just suddenly cut off into silence with a change of scene or angle. In many ways it is subtle sound design like this that keeps the viewer on edge and off guard.Visually no KK film would be complete with out decrepit buildings in which to fill with shadows but also this film is incredibly green being set in a forest. So much of the film isn't in the dark but that doesn't seem to make a difference. The beauty of a KK suspense piece is that it knows that noises and the dark are just cheap thrills. A horror film doesn't need to have them to get under your skin and into your mind and Loft certainly did that for me.Is it scary? Well if you are of very sensitive disposition. I would say that it is atmospheric mesmerising and macabre and ends up in a place quite different to where it starts out. It is a difficult film to classify and probably because it was made by KK. The film is full of his various trademarks including awkward tonal shifts mid movie and manipulation of perception and reality but it works though you might not think so at first.Loft is a film that left with me with the sensation that what I had just witnessed was so much more than what I had managed to surmise from it. It had the aftertaste of something allegorical that had me feeling that I had understood the message even though I couldn't put into words what it was. It is a film that expects a lot from the viewer however if you put in the effort and just let the film draw you along into its dark and twisted logic Loft is a very rewarding film.Kiyoshi Kurosawa once said that the ghosts in his films are very Japanese in that they often don't do anything. Just the fact that they are in these people's lives is horrible enough.".

His new film English title Loft twists slowly on your skin early on digging deeper and deeper. And then it sort of just stops. The shallow breathed fear that he creates having you flinch at every movement in delicious tension What's that! Oh it's a TV. Wait! What's THAT! Oh just a shadow is unique. His mastery of composition in the frame of scene setting character movement sound are unparalleled. And in this he sets himself up. There would have to be one hell of a harrowing finale to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion. As it is Loft creeps up on you hypnotizing you in fear and then it just waits a while and creeps back away. Not to say that the lengthy conclusion is poor in any other movie it would be great. He twists several clich horror staples in unique ways and even finds some delirious humor. But it just doesn't work well enough. You almost feel the plot stumble and come close to falling. Kurosawa's brilliance with horror is that he does not scare you with sudden movements grotesque images and stunts. He creates dread primal and powerful. His horror slowly leans over your shoulder until it stares you in the eye. Unfortunately in Loft the audience wins the staring contest.".

	schema:headline " A Strikingly Original and WellMade Horror Film To Be Promptly Rejected By The Masses";
	schema:reviewBody "I find it quite pathetic that most moviegoers are unable to experience anything remotely original in terms of cinematic style or content. I'm appalled by the mere thought of feeding upon the commercialistic trash of mainstream American horror cinema  almost all of which is completely worthless unimaginative boring and unintentionally hilarious. In like manner I simply cannot understand why so many people indulge in studio controlled massproduced garbage on a whim yet find it so difficult to appreciate a strikingly original wellmade horror film. Loft is one such film and its current 5.5 rating is more a condemnation on IMDb voters than the film itself.I don't like to include a long plot synopsis in my reviews but when other reviewers insult the film for being a mess I am forced to explain things to persons who apparently have a prescribed limit to the number of brain cells they're willing to use while watching a movie. I certainly hope that these people aren't quite as stupid in their daily lives.In a nutshell Reiko pukes up black mud as a foreshadowing of her interactions with the 1000yearold mummy's spirit which was preserved in the same kind of mud and possibly drank the mud during its lifetime to preserve beauty. Makoto the anthropologist takes the mummy to the deserted house because it causes sideeffects to those around it Hino describes his nightmares and Makoto himself drives his car off the road. The ghost girl is the spirit of the mummy as manifested through the identity of a girl who was killed a few months earlier. Makoto witnessed the murder but the mummy's spirit possessed the girl's body thereby forcing Makoto to kill her again in selfdefense. Plagued by these images Makoto suffers a fractured psychology and begins to believe that his act of murder was a hallucination.Let's cut right to the coolest scene in this movie Makoto's murder of the girl. The key to this scene is the positioning of the body before and after Makoto's tangle with the mummy's spirit. First the editor kills the girl leaving her body in a particular position. While the editor is briefly away the body is possessed by the mummy's spirit and attacks Makoto. In an act of selfdefense he murders the girl a second time but accidentally leaves the body in the same position that the editor left it. The editor returns and takes the body away obviously ignorant of everything that recently transpired. What makes this scene so clever is that it provides a perfect metaphor for Makoto's fractured psychology. Maybe he killed her maybe he imagined it  but the evidence can work for either scenario. Brilliant! It's no understatement to say that this particular scene is an instant classic for viewers who are actually willing to figure it out. It convincingly blurs the line of illusion and reality. If Makoto did kill her he would certainly assume that the editor would react to the movement of her body from where he left it but because the body is in the same position it throws everything into uncertainly. Only a truly masterful filmmaker could pull this off with such perfection. Welcome to the world of Kiyoshi Kurosawa.Now that the dimwitted have been enlightened I'd like to discuss other elements of this film. As far as style is concerned I've heard some fans of Dario Argento who claim that his set designs and lighting are practically characters in his films. It's interesting to note that Kiyoshi's location settings and architecture are employed in the same manner. I have no idea where he finds these places but his films are driven forward by mesmerizing environments decrepit buildings natural settings and expert use of lighting. Ironic it seems that someone such as I an antisnob to the grave would be captivated by Kiyoshi's atmosphere as much as I am. Props to the filmmaker indeed.While true that Loft panders to lovers of slowpaced atmospherics by having Reiko walk slowly through moody environments the fact remains that I need more than a pretty painting if I'm to be entertained for two hours and Loft provides much in the way of entertaining events. The aforementioned murder scene is an obvious choice but Reiko's interaction with the mummy's spirit is good stuff. The gradual disintegration of the ghost girl on the foggy dock flies in the face of your typical Onryo the ghoulish teleportation scene from one side of the room to the other is devilishly nice and the creaky ceiling scene was wellexecuted. This is not pretentious tripe like Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. On the contrary this is expertly crafted highly enjoyable cinema that is destined to be promptly insulted and trashed by those with no taste in film  of which there are many.This is not a perfect endeavor mind you. Some of the acting is hokey at times but there are so many positives here that they far outweigh any negatives. Yet somehow this film has not met the ultra low standards of your typical IMDb mainstream moviegoer. This film has been trashed to the point where I have seriously questioned the sanity of the world. Have you people really devolved back into a primordial state where quality execution of originality is not only ignored but derided and insulted? Perhaps the conflicts were not explicitly referenced and explained to the point where a person with an IQ of less than 50 could understand them. Perhaps the pacing should have been sped up and supplemented with a few dozen jump scares to keep viewers awake. Perhaps the characters were too old for teenieboppers to identify with and should have been revised to include a bunch of potsmoking sexcrazed highschoolers.Well whatever this film was missing I certainly didn't miss it.".

You have a writer Reiko which seems to be the occupation of choice for spirits to haunt experiencing weird bodily phenomenon of spewing black gooey mud and facing a writer's block requests her editor to help her relocate to a nice quiet place read huge house in the middle of nowhere with opportunities for things to go bump. Throw in an anthropologist whose latest project involves preserving a recently found mummy  a taciturn man living next door and you have something interesting set up together with side show characters for red herring purposes.Alas despite the usual craftsmanship of Kurosawa in setting up the mood Loft seemed to present itself like a one trick pony. It beats about the bush exposing a lack of control with material and suggests cluelessness and runs out of ideas in moving the story ahead. You'd come to expect certain plot twists and characters with their ulterior motives and is plagued by extremely bad editing which I do not understand how it passed even the basics of quality control. It limps towards the end and when it finally showed signs of redemption it shoots itself in the foot with an extremely cheesy ending bad dialogue which is amazingly spouted by the cast with gusto and the sudden decision to make this a cheap hokey romance.Plagued by inconsistencies and bad effects at one point in time someone should outlaw superimposed backgrounds in those driving shots  go on location for heaven's sake the movie looks and develops as if it was an amateur at the helm. I suppose I could come up with something of this quality and for it to be in the filmography of Kurosawa it is indeed a nasty shock.All in all a very dismal effort from the writerdirector one which seemed to be a very rushed effort on the themes of dreams and delusions coupled with bad onedimensional acting either the I'msoscared or I'msoanal look.

	schema:reviewBody "Eldorado starts out as a quirky low key comedy along the lines of Jim Jarmusch Night on Earth Down by Law. Perhaps slow and uneventful by some people's tastes but pretty humorous if you let the absurdity soak in. The story is about a couple of unlikely travel buddies who embark on a crossBelgian roadtrip alternately showcasing the gorgeous countryside and the bizarre characters they encounter.But as you can guess by my title for me and I believe for most American audiences the film was upstaged by an unsettling sideplot about a dog being brutally killed. After watching the movie I immediately googled the director trying to figure out why he would include this terrible juxtaposition in an otherwise playful film. You're not going to like what I learned.According to an interview this director's hallmark is to use a dog in his films. In this case he decided to use a dead dog. It was not intended as a major plot point but merely to express the contradictions in humans. In the scene one character says and does something absolutely vile but as the director says in the interview we are supposed to excuse him because he later shows that he is just human because he had a dog once.Um. No. Perhaps blame it on a transAtlantic difference in how we love our dogs but most civilized Americans will not under any circumstances excuse or condone the idea of a dog being tied up thrown over a bridge and left to die whimpering.That's what my title refers to. Immediately I was so sickened by that scene and the characters' blas reactions that I lost all respect and empathy for the lot of them. Ultimately after watching an 85 minute film I was left wondering why I should care about anyone in the story. Of course this was not the director's intent I suppose we were supposed to take the jarring scene more in stride. If you're a dog lover or even a casual fan of animals I guarantee you'll be very put off by the unnecessary brutality of that scene. I sure hope they didn't use a real dog though it looked like they did.".

It takes on the guise of a road film after Yvan Bouli Lanners agrees to take Didier Fabrice Adde back to his parents' home this after the recovering addict is found burglarizing Yvan's house. There are some unconventional characters that the pair come across along the way but in it's attempt to be quirky these chance encounters seem to be more contrived than accidental. The one scene that's played for poignancy involves Didier's mother longing for some semblance of an emotional attachment to her son but thwarted by an off screen husband who has no use for his shiftless son. Yvan conveys a rare insight into familial relationships that he imparts to his fellow traveler while insisting they tend to an overgrown garden of weeds. This appears to be what's at the heart of the story as Yvan despairs over the loss of his own younger brother and now has no one left to call family. For the viewer one is left to make what one will with the way the story ends as there is no resolution in the traditional sense. If seen in the company of others there will no doubt be an endless supply of possible explanations for how the story ends or continues as it were.".

But Midnight Cowboy was a great film and Central Station was worthwhile. There is almost nothing of lasting interest in this movie either inside or outside the two characters. The scenes at Didier's parents' house are an exception. There are not only one but two conversations that are literally of the Yes. No. Yes. No form which are not particularly amusing suggesting instead that the writer had nothing much to say. The random wackiness that he occasionally attempts to pump into the action is a poor substitute because there is no followthrough. Yvan gets his hair taped to the ceiling of his car to keep himself awake but later he crashes without any even cursory shot to show us whether the tape gave way his hair was pulled out or he fell asleep still attached to that ceiling. And though the car goes off the road and drives through trees it reveals itself as magically unharmed when a nudist appears from nowhere to tow it and give them directions then disappears from the action. A dog is dropped from a bridge crushing the roof of a car but the ceiling is intact when we see it immediately thereafter.This lack of consistency and consequence compromises the character development that is supposed to occur as well. Yvan who is supposed to be demonstrating a growing feeling of responsibility to assuage his guilt for not being present for his family in the past abandons his plan to take the suffering dog to a veterinarian. Why? How expensive could it be to have a dog put to sleep by even a private vet let alone a shelter and has Yvan ever shied away from expense in the past? Instead he indulges ElieDidier in his plan to ostensibly buy heroin to euthanize the dog though he suspects correctly that the money will not go to that end. In the meantime the dog whimpers uncomforted and unseen in the back of the car until it finally dies. That thankfully is also the point at which the movie expires.".

The pair is impossible enough to make for some very funny events and the pace of the film is high enough. Some things that happen don't make much sense at all but it never gets to the point where it becomes an irritation. With each passing mile the link between the two becomes stronger even though it is very clear that they will never be real good friends. The film is a tiny bit predictable but that doesn't work against it. It could have been stretched a bit longer though without turning less intense which would have given some space to build on the characters a bit more.7 out of 10 stolen moments".

The pair is impossible enough to make for some very funny events and the pace of the film is high enough. Some things that happen don't make much sense at all but it never gets to the point where it becomes an irritation. With each passing mile the link between the two becomes stronger even though it is very clear that they will never be real good friends. The film is a tiny bit predictable but that doesn't work against it. It could have been stretched a bit longer though without turning less intense which would have given some space to build on the characters a bit more.7 out of 10 stolen moments";

	schema:reviewBody "So Big did a lot to salvage Barbara Stanwyck's career. Apart from Ladies of Leisure which had prestige many of Stanwyck's early films were potboilers and often her's was the only performance worth watching. This story of mother love and self sacrifice was dear to people's hearts at the time struggling through the Great Depression and Stanwyck's honesty and earthiness made her a natural for Selina Peake. Warners surrounded her with the best talent they had  William Wellman directing George Brent as the male lead although his part lasted barely 10 minutes and the studio's new ingenue Bette Davis in an interesting role as a young artist who tries to guide Dirk back to his roots. There were also two of the better child stars of the day  Dawn O'Day was Selina as a child five years later as Anne Shirley she would play Stanwyck's daughter in the acclaimed Stella Dallas and the very cute Dickie Moore as So Big as a child.In many of Edna Ferber's books the male characters didn't hang around they either abandoned their family or were killed off Ferber never married and many critics felt she didn't really understand men and So Big was no exception. Selina's beloved father Robert Warwick is shot he has a gambling house a fact that all through her childhood has been kept secret. The only friend who hasn't deserted her secures her a job as a teacher in High Prairie but her first impressions of the town are not favourable. She finds the Pooles her host family ignorant and crude the mother another thankless role for Dorothy Peterson is worn out and old at 31. The one ray of hope is Roelf who is eager to learn and when Selina arrives is half way through reading the dictionary. He also departs after a time to make his way in the world.Selina marries Pervus DeJong Earle Fox a decent farmer but someone who is mired in the past and won't learn new ways or experiment with different crops  asparagus for example. Life is going to be a long hard struggle but his death gives Selina the opportunity to try new methods. All she has left is Dirk Hardie Albright but he is a bitter disappointment to her. Not only is he materialistic and worships money he is also going about with a married woman who convinces him to give up architecture for the lucrative field of advertising. With his new executive postion he is slipping further from Selina's values but he then meets Dallas a young artist who convinces him to find truer ideals. Roelf has just returned from Europe where his renown as a sculptor has made him a celebrity and he is eager to see Selina who he regards as his inspiration. Together they all return to the farm and the film ends with Dirk's realisation that he had been misguided and Selina has known all along the answer to true happiness.So Big is just So Wonderful. One of the nicest scenes I think is when Selina newly widowed takes So Big to market. There they meet two ladies of the night one of them Mabel strikes up a friendship with So Big. Another small role for Noel Francis she always played shady ladies but she had the bearing of a Duchess.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "So Big did a lot to salvage Barbara Stanwyck's career. Apart from Ladies of Leisure which had prestige many of Stanwyck's early films were potboilers and often her's was the only performance worth watching. This story of mother love and self sacrifice was dear to people's hearts at the time struggling through the Great Depression and Stanwyck's honesty and earthiness made her a natural for Selina Peake. Warners surrounded her with the best talent they had  William Wellman directing George Brent as the male lead although his part lasted barely 10 minutes and the studio's new ingenue Bette Davis in an interesting role as a young artist who tries to guide Dirk back to his roots. There were also two of the better child stars of the day  Dawn O'Day was Selina as a child five years later as Anne Shirley she would play Stanwyck's daughter in the acclaimed Stella Dallas and the very cute Dickie Moore as So Big as a child.In many of Edna Ferber's books the male characters didn't hang around they either abandoned their family or were killed off Ferber never married and many critics felt she didn't really understand men and So Big was no exception. Selina's beloved father Robert Warwick is shot he has a gambling house a fact that all through her childhood has been kept secret. The only friend who hasn't deserted her secures her a job as a teacher in High Prairie but her first impressions of the town are not favourable. She finds the Pooles her host family ignorant and crude the mother another thankless role for Dorothy Peterson is worn out and old at 31. The one ray of hope is Roelf who is eager to learn and when Selina arrives is half way through reading the dictionary. He also departs after a time to make his way in the world.Selina marries Pervus DeJong Earle Fox a decent farmer but someone who is mired in the past and won't learn new ways or experiment with different crops  asparagus for example. Life is going to be a long hard struggle but his death gives Selina the opportunity to try new methods. All she has left is Dirk Hardie Albright but he is a bitter disappointment to her. Not only is he materialistic and worships money he is also going about with a married woman who convinces him to give up architecture for the lucrative field of advertising. With his new executive postion he is slipping further from Selina's values but he then meets Dallas a young artist who convinces him to find truer ideals. Roelf has just returned from Europe where his renown as a sculptor has made him a celebrity and he is eager to see Selina who he regards as his inspiration. Together they all return to the farm and the film ends with Dirk's realisation that he had been misguided and Selina has known all along the answer to true happiness.So Big is just So Wonderful. One of the nicest scenes I think is when Selina newly widowed takes So Big to market. There they meet two ladies of the night one of them Mabel strikes up a friendship with So Big. Another small role for Noel Francis she always played shady ladies but she had the bearing of a Duchess.Highly Highly Recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "SO BIG is a lovely little gem that's only problem is it's much too short just 81 minutes given the story's scope. Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by the usually critically underrated Edna Ferber famed in the era for her epic novels GIANT one can blame Warner Bros. for their reluctance to make longer pictures in this era but at least give them credit for filming this tale it's impossible to imagine this bleak setting being filmed at either at glamorous and elegant MGM or Paramount.Barbara Stanwyck stars as Selina a motherless girl who lives a welltodo existence with her professional gambler father in big city hotels. Despite his rather shady calling her father has taught her the finer things in life and raised her properly. Her father is shot and killed when she is a young woman over an apparent gambling dispute which leads to having to go to work as a schoolteacher in a small farming community. There she befriends a young preteen named Rolf the wonderful Dick Winslow in a superb performance who is forced to work on his father's farm instead of go to school giving him books and encouraging his artistic endeavors and his dreams of life beyond farm work. Barbara marries a young farmer and gets trapped herself in the hard life of farm work particularly after she is widowed young with a little son Dirk to raise on her own. Dirk benefits from his mother's sacrifices and becomes a young architect but is bored and impatient and fails to share his mother's love of beauty and a good work ethic that she successfully installed in Rolf.The cast is generally superb  this is one of Barbara Stanwyck's finest early roles and she is quite moving at times. She has fine support from teen Dick Winslow whom I don't recall seeing before and from some generally unnoticed supporting players like Dorothy Peterson as Winslow's prematurely aged mother Robert Warwick as Stanwyck's loving conman of a father Earle Fox as the rather goodlooking but common man she marries and Blanche Fredrici as the rich old spinster who pines for Fox herself. There's also a delightful appearance of the much loved character Elizabeth Patterson dressed to the nines in period costumes as Stanwyck's city landlady and excellent work by a startlingly beautiful young Bette Davis as the young artist the adult Dirk fancies. Alas the adult Dirk Hardie Albright is not particularly good and there's a particularly bad scene in which he and Mae Madison as his married paramour are not able to carry by themselves but at least George Brent as the adult Rolf is better than normal if not quite capturing the fire intelligence and drive Winslow did as the younger Rolf. I'm surprised no one has noticed the young Selina is played by lovely Anne Shirley who would go on to her greatest fame as Stanwyck's daughter in their classic STELLA DALLAS five years later. Talk about superb casting for a young Stanwyck!! This story really cries out for a film of a least two hours with it's multidecade scope it really jumps years much too often much too quickly but still it's a highly satisfying often quite touching film that's well worth seeing. This movie also makes me want to seek out Ms. Ferber's rather forgotten novel which surprisingly is still in print.".

It's a place for people who work hard with little frivolity in their lives. Education is a luxury the work on the farm comes first.Barbara Stanwyck in her first lead in an A budget film on loan out from Columbia to Warner Brothers plays Selina. It's a challenging role requiring Stanwyck to age 40 years. She marries farmer Earl Foxe and she has a son who eventually grows up to be Hardie Albright. Albright is trained as an architect but decides to go into a bond selling firm at the entreaties of Mae Madison wife of the firm's head who has other interests in Albright.Stanwyck has as much interest in the land as Scarlett O'Hara does in Gone With The Wind. She wants to impart that to Albright and fears she has not.Bette Davis and George Brent are both in the cast of So Big. It's their first film together. Brent plays the grown son of Alan Hale a neighboring farmer who Stanwyck boarded with when she first arrives and whom she encouraged to take education seriously and pursue his dreams. Davis has a role as an artist that Albright engages for an advertising campaign for his bonds.In a recent biography of Barbara Stanwyck there was friction on the set as Stanwyck took note of Davis trying to upstage the cast. Bette wanted the lead role herself and probably would have done a good job. It's similar in many ways to what she did in The Corn Is Green. But there was no DavisStanwyck feud as their would be with Miriam Hopkins and Joan Crawford. Simply because Davis just didn't have star prerogatives yet.There was another version of So Big made in the 50s with Jane Wyman in the lead and a silent version that starred Colleen Moore.

And while you might immediately assume I am a heartless soul for not particularly liking this film I do occasionally like tearjerkers and sentimental films. However to me this film went way over the edge to the territory of sappy.The scope of the film was not badshowing the evolution and life of this character over time. And technically it was a very pretty filmthe cinematographer did a wonderful job of filming the star and making her seem at times radiant. But it was so heavyhanded and lacked subtlety when it came to her child. In some ways for this very same reason I am not a huge fan of another Stanwyck film STELLA DALLASthough it's MUCH better than SO BIG!. Sorry to be the dissenting voice but the film just didn't do it for me.".

And while you might immediately assume I am a heartless soul for not particularly liking this film I do occasionally like tearjerkers and sentimental films. However to me this film went way over the edge to the territory of sappy.The scope of the film was not badshowing the evolution and life of this character over time. And technically it was a very pretty filmthe cinematographer did a wonderful job of filming the star and making her seem at times radiant. But it was so heavyhanded and lacked subtlety when it came to her child. In some ways for this very same reason I am not a huge fan of another Stanwyck film STELLA DALLASthough it's MUCH better than SO BIG!. Sorry to be the dissenting voice but the film just didn't do it for me.";

In this picture Stanwyck plays a woman who was very close to her dad who was a gambler and once he died she had no choice but to take on a teaching position in Kansas and wound up married to a farmer. This is a wonderful story of a woman who raises her children against all the set backs that life has to offer and how she deals with each problem that seems to face her which she calls Velvet. Barbara Stanwyck and Bette Davis never got a long together when making a film and they both made very few. Stanwyck was always outgoing with the stage hands and crew and Bette Davis just did her acting job and no socializing with the regular people. I must say that Bette Davis looked fantastic in this picture and of course she was a great actress.".

It's a PreHays Code film so there will be some moments when you gasp and ask How did they get away with that? before you remember the release year of 1932. And you'll get to see a young Bette Davis and George Brent as well as Alan Hale who joined Barbara Stanwyck in Stella Dallas.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't let Barbara Stanwyck's big city accent fool you in this rural drama about a veteran farm woman who becomes the poster child for earth mother. Her character was raised in Chicago the daughter of a gambler so obviously she'd have some tough sounding voice just like the Brooklyn born Stanwyck had. This was a turning point in Barbara Stanwyck's career because after being in several truly bad early sound films she had training from one of the masters Frank Capra in the art of screen acting and by 1932 was able to gain some of the best available roles through the rarely heard option of studio free lancing.This film version of Edna Ferber's best selling novel shows her determination to make a new life for herself after the death of her father moving into the home of a hard working farmer and teaching school. Marrying local farmer Earle Foxe she is soon a widow with a young son Dickie Moore to support nicknaming him So Big as he gets older even referring him with that name when he's all grown up and handsome played by Hardie Albright yet not necessarily the idealistic boy he once was. Stanwyck's former private student played as a youngster with an obvious crush on Stanwyck by Dick Winslow having run off to get away from cabbages returns for a visit now played by George Brent. An idealistic young artist Bette Davis befriends Albright and reunites him and Stanwyck with Brent home from working as a famous artist in Europe hopefully waking Albright up to the babbity little phony he may turn into if he continues his affair with the married Chicago socialite Mae Madison.Why this doesn't get a higher ranking is based on the fact that this was greatly edited because so many important details are obviously missing. One classic still from the movie shows screen legends Stanwyck and Davis meeting while in the final print the camera only pans from Davis praising Stanwyck to Albright for her earthiness and Stanwyck and Brent reuniting. For fans of two actresses I consider in the top five of all time screen legends it is a major disappointment. Brent second billed has what is nothing more than a cameo on screen for maybe ten minutes. The detail of the first half of the film is truly outstanding showing Stanwyck's enthusiasm at being out in the great outdoors and how the local farmers teased her about her fascination with the local crops especially cabbages. A hysterically funny scene has her jelly sandwiches getting more attention at a local picnic basket auction than some old crone's roast duck and the pickle faced widow's fury at being passed over by some young interloper.There are touching performances by Dorothy Peterson as the wife of the farmer Stanwyck moves in with an obvious fragile woman who puts on airs of strength Noel Francis as a down to earth street walker in Chicago who opens her big heart to Stanwyck and Moore when they arrive at the stockyards to sell their crops and Robert Warwick as Stanwyck's father who teaches the young Selina Anne Shirley how to make even the smallest things in life a huge adventure. It's ironic to see young Dawn O'Day who soon changed her name to Anne Shirley playing Stanwyck's character considering that they played mother and daughter later on in Stella Dallas both receiving Oscar nominations. Under the direction of William Wellman this really had the makings of a classic and one that would have been remembered at award time had it not cut out so much of the meat. The Jane Wyman remake in 1953 featured a bit more detail and for years was the only version of this story out for viewing. But the restored print of this early production is neat and clean but unfortunately too streamlined for such a potential epic of Cimarron caliber.".

	schema:reviewBody "So Big! 1932  out of 4 Disappointing adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel about a young woman Barbara Stanwyck with big plans who have to put them on hold after the death of her father. She ends up traveling to a small town where she fulfills her dream of becoming a teacher but she then puts this on hold to marry a farmer. After he dies the woman makes her life goal to raise her son the best she can and make sure he has a place in the future. SO BIG! was apparently one of Stanwyck's favorite roles and I think it's easy to see why but the end result is a real mess and never has any spark or imagination. I was really surprised to see how flat the movie was but I think it's safe to say that this material certainly wasn't right for Wellman. I know he worked in many different genres but it really seems like he's struggling to get any of the emotions on the screen and I'm sure sure of this has to do with the screenplay. The screenplay is a major mess because it never really gives the viewer any time to get to know the characters or start to feel for them. The first fortyfive minutes of the movie just seem to go on and on and for no reason because at the end of them you realize that everything you've just seen could have been told in less than twenty. The problem is that everything happens so quick that you simply don't have time to connect with any of it. One minute Stanwyck is married and the next thing you know the husband is dead. One moment Stanwyck is going to live her dream of teaching but then that falls apart without any explanation. Stuff happens at various times without any reason so one has to wonder if the film had a lot taken out before being released or perhaps the screenplay was simply trying to capture various aspects of the novel and just came out very sloppy. Another major problem is that Stanwyck ages about a total of fortyyears but there's never an added wrinkle to her. The only thing that changes is her hair color and this simply doesn't work because she looks very silly at age 70 or whatever and seeing that she pretty much looks the exact same as when she was a teenager. Stanwyck is good in her role but the screenplay lets her down. George Brent Dickie Moore and a young Bette Davis have small parts scattered throughout the film. Stanwyck and Davis appear in the final sequences yet they're never shown in the same frame which should tell you something. SO BIG! isn't a complete disaster but at the same time there's very little to recommend.".

SO BIG! isn't a complete disaster but at the same time there's very little to recommend.";

	schema:headline " One of Stanwyck's rare boring and not so inspiring films";
	schema:reviewBody "So many viewers have found this film wonderful that I would hate to spoil the pleasure for those who have not seen it yet and might find it the same so if you are intent on viewing the film anyway maybe just watch it and make your own opinion before possibly coming back to mine afterwards. On the other hand if you are not quite sure yet whether you want to watch So Big rather than another one of the myriad of outstanding or just pleasant Barbara Stanwyck's movies of the period then you might compare the following dissenting viewpoint with others and decide. First let me state that I am an unconditional admirer of Stanwyck. She has been one of the strongest talents of Hollywood if not the strongest with a very wide acting range which enabled her to play mostly everything and never to be dull. So big! was certainly not a film beyond her capacities  actually there is not really much to reproach her apart from the simple fact that she is not so credible as bright city girl Selina supposedly enjoying for years the dullest possible farm life. And apart also from the fact that while she seems to age like twenty years in the very first first few years of her married farm life after that she appears to have aged not even a bit more when we meet her again twenty long years later  she is without a wrinkle and with the smooth velvety face and hands of the twentyfiveyearold actress she is not of the hardand longtoiling farmer lady she is supposed to be. Possibly asparagus farming is a secret recipe for some wonders? Anyway so good for her glamour but so much for making us believe that she really is that nice grannylike lady. But these are indeed very minor qualms. The serious ones are with the film itself. And for that blame probably the oldfashioned views of author Edna Ferber on women's condition and the admirability of their sacrifice but blame also sad to say the for once unsteady hand of generally admirable director William Wellman. First for such a short film it has a long and boring start. All the time taken to introduce the heavilycaricatured hick family she lands into then the equally laughable hick village community is really misspent everything there is to understand about it being clear after only two minutes  and not much fun rather embarrassing in its patronizing way to depict the poor farmers' community. And then the husband yet one more uneducated slowwitted though rather nicer hick but definitely not an even remotely inspiring person for Stanwyck to fall into his arms at least out of any more positive feeling than sheer resignation to her fate. Second about three quarters of the film has already elapsed until something really happens  but almost immediately after that whoops unexpected fast forward twenty years. As mentioned earlier Selina has not changed a bit but her infant son Dirk is now a tall handsome young city professional. And unfortunately the film mostly stops paying much interest to her and moves to Chicago to deal with the uninteresting professional and sentimental life of this uninspiring young man. The unintended reaction being did she really sacrifice the best years of her life for this young jerk and is this supposed to be an example?. Therefore the last quarter of the film while very different would be even slightly more uninteresting if it was not saved from complete boredom by the arrival of a young and sprightly Bette Davis who puts young Dirk back in the right track of following the hard but inspiring life of an architect rather than the prosperous but soulstifling one of a bond trader. Not that we care very much about him going one way or the other but at least it confirms belatedly that Selina' life of admirable sacrifice has not been spent in vain. And that's the third issue. The life of Selina is indeed supposed to be so admirable and therefore so touching as well as so inspiring. As to touching hard to say  after the first part when Selina has landed in exactly the wrong place and with the wrong husband we do not her spend the next twenty years and come to terms with that life  we understand she did it all for the sake of precious Dirk but with no means to know whether enduring or eventually enjoying that life. And as to inspiring  if a young lady who makes a silly choice of job location then doubles it with an even sillier choice of husband then trebles it by making countless sacrifices for a son who seems to be a spoiled and rather ungrateful jerk  if the value of such a sacrifice is measured only by its price then Selina is indeed an inspiring role model. I have my doubts about that. Stanwyck will land a similar role a few years later in the much better Stella Dallas the big difference being that her sacrifice is shown there as pathetic not admirable. However Selina is supposedly an example because she takes to heart the life motto of her late gambling father more or less take gracefully whatever life serves you and then just follow your heart to make the best of it. Why not  this is what Selina teaches to her pupil Roelf and her son Dirk. Except that for them boys this means following one's envies to become a sculptor or an architect whereas for Selina it means submitting to the rather dirty hand that fate as well as your own decisions has dealt you housewife then widow and selfsacrificing mother and forgetting about any other hopes. Not much of a real choice there actually. Unless one believes she really stayed as she once asserted for the unsung beauty of cabbage fields?".

As presented here So Big is a runofthemill story of the tedium of rural life during the depression saved only by the luminous presence of Barbara Stanwyck. Although a Warner Bros. production they didn't surround her with a distinguished cast or any noteworthy production values as though her starpower would carry the picture all by itself.Well she nearly pulls it off. She is pretty close to the suffering queen bee role she played in Stella Dallas a few years later but here she races through adolescence marriage motherhood and then widowhood at breakneck speed in a picture which must have been edited to death. The pace of the picture makes it impossible for the viewer to adapt to Stanwyck's circumstances before changing them radically. She becomes a mother then in almost the next scene 'So Big' is an adult  and Stanwyck is saddled with Hardie Albright one of Hollywood's most uncharismatic actors.Since this is 1932 we get to see young starlet Bette Davis and George Brent minus mustache in support roles. I could have rated this underproduced slog through the underbrush lower than I did but for the sheer radiance of the star that was Barbara Stanwyck.".

First a play the following year that starred a young Ruth Chatterton than film versions with Mary Pickford as a silent and an early sound film starring Janet Gaynor. There was even a Dutch language version in the Thirties and a couple of years back South Korea filmed a version of the story. Still the best known one is the one with the singing and dancing of Fred Astaire and Leslie Caron.Johnny Mercer who can well lay claim to being the greatest lyricist America ever produced occasionally wrote the music as well for some songs an example being I'm An Old Cowhand. Another one he did both music and lyrics for is Dream which was interpolated into this otherwise original score and sung by the Pied Pipers. Mercer did music and lyrics for the rest of the score as well which included the Oscar nominated Something's Gotta Give for Best Song. It lost in 1955 to Love Is A Many Splendored Thing.I've got a feeling that Jean Webster took as her inspiration for the Daddy Long Legs Story the marriage of Grover Cleveland. The future President of the United States was practicing law in Buffalo New York when his law partner one Oscar Folsom was killed in a carriage accident leaving a widow and small daughter. Cleveland took over the guardianship and raised young Frances Folsom and when he was president in his first term he married young Ms. Folsom when she came of age in the White House.In this updating of the story Fred Astaire is a millionaire diplomat on a trade mission to France after World War II. The car breaks down near an orphanage and while there spots and becomes enchanted with young Leslie Caron. He becomes her unseen benefactor putting her through college in America and she calls him Daddy Long Legs. Of course like the Clevelands the MarchJuly romance commences.Daddy Long Legs gave Darryl Zanuck an opportunity to try and respond to MGM's classic ballet in An American In Paris where not coincidentally Leslie Caron danced with Gene Kelly. In an incredible generosity of spirit it's not Fred who dances but Caron. In her fantasy Astaire just ambles through. It's a nice number but doesn't come close to what Kelly achieved. It's interesting to speculate what might have happened had Fred danced here.Thelma Ritter has some nice lines herself as the usual wisecracking girl Friday and for once Fred Clark is a good guy as Astaire's factotum. That must have been a welcome change for him.If you should be with your beloved watching Daddy Long Legs you can bet as sure as you live Something's Gotta Give Something's Gotta Give Something's Gotta Give.".

Yet DADDY LONG LEGS is perhaps the most beguiling of the Astaire musicals and quite possibly captures the purest romantic sensibility of them all. However few admirers of the legendary dancer ever seem to cite this wonderful motion picture as being among the most shimmering of the Astaire nuggetsand it remains a mystery why that is so.Directed by Jean Negulesco the film is the Cinderella story of a wealthy New York playboy Jervis Pendleton Astaire who stumbles upon a beautiful young orphaned girl Julie Andre Leslie Caron while on a trip to France. He decides to bring her to America and sponsor her college education while keeping his identify unknown. From the beginning Caron idealizes the benefactor she never sees and identifies him as her Daddy Long Legs. Writing hundreds of letters to him in an attempt to establish a relationship she receives only the depersonalized anonymity of continuing financial aid. Eventually the two do come face to face at a college prom through Astaire's niece Linda Terry Moore who is a classmate of Caron. But Caron still has no idea that Astaire and Daddy Long Legs are one in the same. Of course Astaire falls for Caron after the couple spend a whirlwind night on the town but then severs all connection to her after Ambassador Williamson Larry Keatinglectures him on the public scandal of his being a Sugar Daddy.The musical numbers choreographed by Astaire are fresh colorful and romantically vibrant. The dance ballet inspired by the music of Dream in which Caron fantasizes over the identify of her Daddy Long Legs shifts through a series of tempo costume and musical changes and is inescapably reminiscent of the Gene KellyLeslie Caron 20 minute masterpiece in AN American IN Paris. In the night on the town number after meeting at Linda's college prom they swing through Johnny Mercer's Acadamy Award nominated SOMETHIN'S GOTTA GIVE. It is the turning point when the two realize they are falling in love though Caron is still not aware that Astaire is her benefactor. Not to be missed is Astaire's performance of Slew Foot with Caron at the prom where Jervis Pendleton shows the younger set a thing or two about what a man over 50 can do on a dance floor. It's one of the most entertaining sequences in the film and contains some very funny moments.The veteran supporting cast works wonderfully well Terry Moore as Pendleton's niece Fred Clarke as Griggs Pendleton's assistant and Larry Keating as Ambassador Williamson. But it is the sympathetic Thelma Ritter who shines as Pendleton's secretary Alicia. She is the one who has been reading and filing all the Julie Andre letters for years until she takes it upon herself to be the only friend at Caron's graduation and instigates the pivotal meeting between Pendleton and Andre at Astaire's Park Avenue office. It is there that Pendleton's identity is unmasked and Andre discovers that Astaire is after all her Daddy Long Legs.DADDY LONG LEGS may not usually be thought of as reigning near the top of Fred Astaire's films but it surely must be included among his best musicals. The Phoebe Ephron script of a MaySeptember romance is fresh and colorful the musical numbers are beautifully and artfully choreographed and the 1950's Technicolor cinematography memorably filmed.Trivia Fred Astire was 56 years old when he made the film Caron was 24...DADDY LONG LEGS was not one of Astaire's MGM musicals it was released by 20th CENTURY FOX...Both Fred Clarke and Larry Keating played Harry Morton next door neighbor to George Burns and Gracie Allen on the BURNS AND ALLEN show of the 1950's. Clarke came first beginning in 1951 then in 1953 George Burns actually announced the cast change in the middle of an episode as Clarke exited and Keating stepped in and took his place!...Leslie Caron never wanted to be in movies but when Gene Kelley offered her a part in the MGM legendary musical AN American IN Paris in 1950 she gave in to her mother's demands and flew to Hollywood...Johnny Mercer was nominated in 1955 for best original song for SOMETHIN'S GOTTA GIVE.

The VHS version with a DVD version probably not on the immediate horizon no doubt does not duplicate Leon Shamroy's elegant CinemaScope framing.

The movie would have been a dud with anyone else but Leslie in the ingenue role. She is just darling. The best scene is Something's Gotta Give. That is one classy song and one classy scene. It has more sex appeal and chemistry than most modern romantic movies can muster.Just one more note Fred Clark and Thelma Ritter are quite funny together and apart. I like the interplay between them and Fred's character Jervis and some of the dialogue makes me burst out laughing each time I see it. Overall good 1950's musical. I liked it better than Funny Face because the character Audrey Hepburn played in that film rubbed me the wrong way. Leslie is just as sweet as a sugar plum fairy in contrast.".

Fred Astaire was 56 and Leslie Caron 24 when this film came out so it stretches the age thing a bit but I suppose we can write that off as cultural differences among the French.Simple story executed very well.  I didn't read the book nor do I think it is relevant. This is a movie and it should be appreciated on its own merits. It is wellestablished that the author of this screenplay changed the story quite a bit for purposes of this Hollywood production so comparing it to the book is moot.Wealthy American AstaireJervis is on an economic mission to France when their vehicle gets stuck in a ditch. He wanders upon a French orphanage looking for a phone or ride and spots the 18yrold orphan CaronJulie so lively bright responsible attending to the younger orphans. He becomes an anonymous sponsor and sends her to a college in Mass. The only stipulation is that she write a letter weekly to Mr Jones to keep him informed of her progress. The letters never get to Jervis intercepted and filed by his staff. Until over two years later when he had forgotten about her but her letters are called to his attention. Finds out his niece is one of her roommates he goes to a college dance to visit his neice but really to see Julie. They meet hit it off despite their age difference dance marvelously. Later Julie visits NYC alone ambassador to France is on next patio at breakfast overhears what he thinks is hankypanky persuades Jervis to quit seeing Julie.Julie eventually graduates is lonely because she has never met Daddy Long Legs and has no place to go to after graduation. She insists on meeting her benefactor who lives in a mansion sort of museum that even gives art tours to the public.  There she realizes Jervis is in fact her benefactor he proposes she accepts.First the story is very plausible. A rich man seeing a talented person and wanting to help out anonymously. So I naturally find the story compelling. Second Astaire and Caron were two of the best dancers and also very good actors that ever lived. Dream scenes were concocted to showcase each alone and both together in production dance numbers. For its genre it is an almost perfect film. It gets its name from the small orphans telling Julie they saw him not distinctly at night and his shadow cast on the orphanage's wall made him look like he had very long legs.".

For those who prefer the '50s dance style this movie will be super.Caron also does a few ballet numbers. She plays an 18yearold which was a little unrealistic because she doesn't look that young although I think she was only around 24. Astaire even though he was in his mid '50s the same year as the movie was still agile and very talented. The dialog is very dated especially with the college girls of the day. Even though I don't own it I am glad to see this is out on DVD. The formattedtoTV VHS picture cuts off a lot of the colorful dance scenery so the disc is a must over the tape.".

A fantastic number! I noticed one hilarious comment about an uncredited appearance by Cary Grant. I remember my mom telling me how much Ray Anthony resembled Grant  I guess she was right!".

But I think there's a nightandday difference between this film and say 'Charade' or 'Entrapment' when the leading man is grandfatherly and the leading lady is a sweet young thing and we're not supposed to notice. The brilliant thing about DLL is that the age difference or discrepancy is front and center at the plot of the film. But the film broaches this rather sticky material in a very chaste and innocent way. After seeing her from afar as a teenager Astaire's courtship with Caron becomes anonymous. For two years. The film's first masterstroke comes in the guise of Thelma Ritter acting as an armchair Cupid. Through a gentle push on her part we begin to see the pair finally interact. And when they first dance together it isn't even real. Astaire also attempts nobility several times!! But everything is in an elegant and tasteful courtship leading up to the stunning rooftop turn of Something's Gotta Give. I didn't like the Roland Petit ballet towards the end of the film as much as others did just because I felt that the point of loss had been beaten to death. But the ending is especially fine because two love stories resolve instead of just one. And how cool is it to dance with someone on your roof terrace step into your hat spin into your wrap and dance out the front door?!!".

The 56 year old Astaire and the 24 year old Leslie Caron though dancing well together were just a tad creepy. These forced AprilDecember romances ... kind of ugh ! A BIG plot hole for me that I could not get around was that Daddy insisted that Julie write him a weekly letter and then for three years never read a single one of them ? What the heck was that ? The supporting cast of Fred Clark Thelma Ritter and Larry Keaton carried the show for me. All interesting characters.I never fast forward a Fred Astaire film until now. The dance sequences were too long and not engaging... for me. Judging from other reviews I am in the minority here.It might be worth a rewatch but maybe better to keep the memories unless you know you absolutely loved it.BTW Thanks to the IMDb pages I now know that the story was originally a novel and that it was filmed previously in 1919 Mary Pickford 1931 Janet Gaynor and 1935 Shirley Temple's Curly Top. One of Astaire's songs  the Texas one was actually sung by Tony The Tiger ! Thanks for the info IMDb. The trivia section rules once more.".

	schema:headline " Incredible dance sequence  where Fred Astaire does not dance!";
	schema:reviewBody "Daddy Long Legs was one of those movies that were made again and again in the teens up to the 1930s sometimes under it's own original name the name of the novel it was based on and sometimes like in a Shirley Temple version called Curley Top under a different name. Although Mary Pickford was in a silent version the best known early version was a 1931 film with Warner Baxter and Janet Gaynor. However aside from Temple's Curley Top which had a plot difficulty changed by a rewrite the most successful version to modern audiences is this one that starred Fred Astaire and Leslie Caron in 1955. It was one of Astaire's last musicals and was one of the series of musicals from An American In Paris through Lili that led to Caron's best remembered musical starring role in Gigi 1958. The plot of Daddy Long Legs was about a millionaire who sees a young girl in an orphan home and secretly adopts her. His shadow on the wall is noticed and he is referred to as Daddy Long Legs The girl grows up and meets the man when she is reaching adulthood and her secret guardian falls for her and eventually marries her. It is a kind of wish fulfillment plot  and it's unintentional overtone of twisted sexual relations between an adopted father figure and and adopted daughter figure has been commented on. In fact it really gets a going over in the current version from the American Ambassador to France Williamson played by Larry Keating who points out how really scandalous the matter is to Astaire. It causes a bump on the road to a happy conclusion but it is a big bump. Only in Curley Top was this avoided by having Shirley Temple have an older sister who could be romanced by the millionaire.Oddly enough the 1931 version has an unintentional eerie footnote to the strange sex issue. When that version came out one of the people who saw the film it is apparently one of the last films she ever saw was the illfated Starr Faithful whose still mysterious death murdersuicideaccident? is debated to this day. Starr had been having an affair with her mother's older cousin Andrew Peters the Mayor of Boston in the early 1920s which somewhat looked like the relationship between the guardian and the young orphan in the story. Whether Starr went to see Daddy Long Legs for that reason or not is a minor mystery in the last days of her life.I've never seen the BaxterGaynor version. This 1958 version was shown on the 20th Century Fox Cable network this afternoon. Forgetting the central problem mentioned above about the twisted relationship it is a good musical. There are several good musical numbers such as the sluefoot dance at the college prom that Astaire does with Caron to the music of Ray Anthony's orchestra. There is also the use of two popular tunes Dream which becomes a type of theme tune for Caron while thinking of Astaire and Something's Got To Give which unconsciously summarizes their odd relationship Astaire being the old unmovable object hit by the unexpected force of Caron. But the major musical number of the film is rather odd.When after his unfortunate conversation with Keating Astaire breaks with Caron on a sexual level she has a dream sequence which in design reminds one of Caron's earlier danceballet sequence with Gene Kelly in An American In Paris. She dreams she is back in the hallway of the luxury New York City Hotel that she was in when Astaire was romancing her but all the rooms have 3203 her room number on them. But the hallways and doors are all drawn they are not solid wooden doors. It's like the backdrop of Paris that Kelly stands in front of when he begins his dance sequence regarding Caron in An American In Paris. It gets weirder as Caron changes styles of dancing  first ballet then tango than carnival  as she enters rooms representing Paris Buenos Aires or Rio. What makes it weird is that Astaire does not dance with Caron or alone  he appears as an onlooker either in an operaballet box a table on the side or a tourist looking at the carnival. It is the only time I can recall Fred Astaire in a musical number where he does nothing!The cast is good particularly the outspoken personal secretary Ms Pritchard Thelma Ritter trying to get Fred to reveal himself and the long suffering lawyerbusiness adviser Griggs Fred Clark trying to keep Astaire aware of what he should be doing and what he is doing all wrong. It's a good musical once you swallow that odd sexual connection between the principals. Due to the cast the musical numbers even the one where Fred does nothing and the light touch of director Jean Negulesco I would say it gets an 8 out of 10.".

Whether Starr went to see Daddy Long Legs for that reason or not is a minor mystery in the last days of her life.I've never seen the BaxterGaynor version. This 1958 version was shown on the 20th Century Fox Cable network this afternoon. Forgetting the central problem mentioned above about the twisted relationship it is a good musical. There are several good musical numbers such as the sluefoot dance at the college prom that Astaire does with Caron to the music of Ray Anthony's orchestra. There is also the use of two popular tunes Dream which becomes a type of theme tune for Caron while thinking of Astaire and Something's Got To Give which unconsciously summarizes their odd relationship Astaire being the old unmovable object hit by the unexpected force of Caron. But the major musical number of the film is rather odd.When after his unfortunate conversation with Keating Astaire breaks with Caron on a sexual level she has a dream sequence which in design reminds one of Caron's earlier danceballet sequence with Gene Kelly in An American In Paris. She dreams she is back in the hallway of the luxury New York City Hotel that she was in when Astaire was romancing her but all the rooms have 3203 her room number on them. But the hallways and doors are all drawn they are not solid wooden doors. It's like the backdrop of Paris that Kelly stands in front of when he begins his dance sequence regarding Caron in An American In Paris. It gets weirder as Caron changes styles of dancing  first ballet then tango than carnival  as she enters rooms representing Paris Buenos Aires or Rio. What makes it weird is that Astaire does not dance with Caron or alone  he appears as an onlooker either in an operaballet box a table on the side or a tourist looking at the carnival. It is the only time I can recall Fred Astaire in a musical number where he does nothing!The cast is good particularly the outspoken personal secretary Ms Pritchard Thelma Ritter trying to get Fred to reveal himself and the long suffering lawyerbusiness adviser Griggs Fred Clark trying to keep Astaire aware of what he should be doing and what he is doing all wrong. It's a good musical once you swallow that odd sexual connection between the principals. Due to the cast the musical numbers even the one where Fred does nothing and the light touch of director Jean Negulesco I would say it gets an 8 out of 10.";

The full vibrant color in the dream dance sequences especially added to my enjoyment of the film really noticed the wonderful set designartwork. The color schemes in Caron's dream ballet seemed to predict those common in the psychedelic 1960's.A couple of people here say Fred Astaire's wife died during filming I'm fairly sure that is incorrect. She died in 1953 I believe while he was filming The Bandwagon at MGM. I remember reading that Arthur Freed walked with the grieving Astaire to calm him down when he got the news. Also it's doubtful that DLL would have been filmed in 1953 and release held up til 1955. And the reason Astaire was not in White Christmas he was to have had the part played by Danny Kaye filmed and released in 1954 was because he was still grieving from his wife's death in 1953.I'm sure some will disagree but I carefully watched Caron dancing with Astaire and saw that she was one of his weaker partners. Ballroom and tap were not her usual style and she lacks the facility and panash of Rogers Charisse Hayworth. I've never been impressed with Caron's dancing anyway but she was a very talented actress both comic and dramatic and was always charming on screen. And Astaire is so good in their partner dances that you have to really pay attention to see she is not anywhere near his caliber in that sort of dancing.".

It's one of those overlooked gems like his golf routine in Carefree 1938 where he does a little tap whilst driving a few 300yarders. Innovative dance routines like these are what made Fred Astaire so great and what make his movies so entertaining.I'm not really a Fred Astaire Fan in fact Daddy Long Legs and Carefree are the only two films of his that I've seen. But if they're any indication I'm going to start hunting for more. I watched Daddy Long Legs mainly because I really enjoyed the 2005 Korean remake Kidari ajeossi which is not a musical. Now that I've seen the original I appreciate both films.My only gripe with this film is that it didn't seem to get personal enough. We rarely get any closeups of the stars which is a crime considering how stunningly beautiful the leading lady Leslie Caron is. But if it's any consolation she does a lot of twirls and each time she does it we see her dress fly up. Yeah babay! Spin! SPIN!! Oh sorry I got carried away there.

Now that the trivia is out of the way how could Johnny Mercer's score have been so butchered in this film? The only song properly presented is Something's Got to Give. It became an instant standard. In his tribute album to Fred Astaire it is the only contemporary song recorded by Mel Torme. The rest of the songs came from the 1930s. With this said all of the other songs in the film are given the short shift. Astaire's opening song The History of the Beat is truncated to one stanza. Mercer's lyrics are extremely witty but are nowhere to be found in the film. CAT Spells Cat is buried under dialogue and what can be heard is butchered by Leslie Caron's out of tune singing. Where was Carole Richards or Betty Wand when you needed one of them? The beautiful theme song Daddy Long Legs is ruined by having it performed by an offscreen choir. The lyrics can hardly be understood. Maybe they tried having Leslie Caron sing it but it didn't work. Welcome Egghead is destroyed by poor staging and truncation. Sluefoot almost works. Had Astaire sung it in the film as he did on the recording it may have become a standard. The Skyliners handle the vocal and it is almost lost to the superb dance that follows. Texas Romp and Square Dance is part of a ballet dream sequence and it probably wasn't meant to stand out in the first place. Two more songs written for Astaire by Johnny Mercer Dancing Through Life and I Never Knew were cut from the film. Even the Mercer standard Dream is given substandard treatment. Astaire and Caron perform a pleasant dance to it but where is Astaire's vocal. It is sung by that offscreen choir who hid the title song. The two Roland Petit ballet pieces show Caron off well but Astaire is somewhat out of his element. Alex North's ballet music is unmemorable. The film is a bit long and a bit overplotted and there are some who probably find the idea of the film disagreeable. To me it's a sweetly innocent story that needed less dialogue and better presentations of the Mercer songs.".

Vilaine is of the 2nd kind as you must have guessed.Mlanie Lupin is the perfect actress for this so much she seems to be born for the role. She's not that ugly but the way she walks talks and acts is what makes she darn... unpleasant. And that is enough for making her evil... in a very funny way.Beautifully ugly Frdrique Bel from Petits meutres en famille Drle de Nol! and others is here again a hateful dumb leggy blonde. Blandine is even better with her shrill voice and the most kitsch of museums as her legacy. And Jessica my God. The dumbest being around vulgar and pretty nice an explosive combination ! If you are familiar with French TV it's particularly funny to see her participate in the popular TV questions programs like Des chiffres et des lettres with the real life conductors being put off by her utter stupidity. Jonathan the hunk Aymeric the coveted eligible bachelor Martinez! as the crass stingy boss who is really just a sorry chap. Melanie's mother and grandma are also great. My favourite scene is probably Blandine's nightmare with the pensioners as the Night of the living dead a good metaphor of the sorry state of old people even in advanced wealthy democracies. Same goes for ugly people.Like on most well told stories nothing is in vain. Innocent Drogba has no legal residence and can't read? Bear that in mind. An elephant ran away on Saint Valentine? It will be important later believe it or not . Creativity abounds in this film like few others. Music is extremely well chosen it shows subtle knowledge and a great sense of humour.Thanks to an IMDb reviewer I learn that Berry is a daughter of a well known actress and it's no wonder. Don't miss the end credits during the credits she shows she's really capable of doing ANYTHING funny !Not for everybody but don't miss this odd comedy!".

I had no expectations and it was a comedy so I brought those low expectations to an impossibly low level not a fan of french humor. However I was still disappointed and here's why The lead character is a cold heartless and overall meanspirited bitch. Okay so maybe she's been wronged in the past in ways that are already too cruel to be realistic but then she goes to the extreme treating EVERYONE like a pile of crap. The only reason why you'd want to motivate her is because ALMOST everyone takes advantage of her and so she only gets revenge on those who wronged her right? Nope she throws a kitten into the garbage can barfs into he garbage can after eating too many chocolates which were delivered by a boy who she slapped in the face along with other forms of abuse which should get her arrested tying her neighbor's dog to a bus because the neighbor made the lead character walk the dog every morning so shouldn't the neighbor be getting punishment not the helpless dog who doesn't understand what's going on? and many other terrible things. The problem is that we're supposed to root for her but the title makes it very apparent that SHE is the villain. Her behavior has no middle ground she's either far too nice or just way too evil. Besides for the most part most of what she does isn't even justifiable so she loses any form of sympathy we might have had for her. This film is absolute trite the bare minimum of what can be achieved with film. In other movies like Taxi Driver the character's surroundings are harsh and unwelcoming but the character is likable enough to pull us through the experience. This is just an amateur effort truly an awful and despicable experience. I'm surprised by some of the user reviews all two of them because they actually say that this was an above average movie but let me tell you I only got a few chuckles out of this film and only because of how horrible the lead character was.".

Aurore who acts as the leader of friends is getting married soon. The others Blandine and Jessica go along for the fun of it. One day Melanie decides to put an end to the cruel jokes she has endured from the three bitches and decide to get her own revenge which is nothing more than asserting herself proving to her socalled friends she put one over them.

	schema:headline " Disturbing Profound and Very Entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "Dennis Potter was a unique and profound talent who wrote many great pieces of work for television. His work was entertaining witty satirical innovative and challenging for both viewers and those involved in the television industry. Brimstone and Treacle is perhaps the most difficult piece he wrote which is reflected in the fact that the BBC banned it for 11 years. I recently watched it again and I found it to be as fresh and as shocking as ever. Viewed in the light of what British TV has become in the last 10 years it was particularly refreshing to be reminded of the quality it was once world famous for.I really can't speak highly enough of this remarkable work. Firstly there are the superb performances of the three main leads. Michael Kitchen is breath taking to watch and Denholm Elliot was in his element playing a sleazy little man racked with guilt. Patricia Lawrence was also perfect as the downtrodden mumsy. Dennis Potter's script was perfect and gave them wonderful lines. The story is disturbing and sick but at the same time incredibly funny. I couldn't help laugh at the demented sight of Michael Kitchen wheeling the mentally handicapped Patty around the living room before having his way with her. There was also what were at the time very innovative uses of lighting and camera which are still highly effective even today. There is also the Dennis Potter trade mark use of music.What really offended people about this play apart from the fact a mentally handicapped girl is raped is a that demon comes into the lives of three people in a desperate situation and turns out to be their saviour. Not that he intended to or could care less about them but through his actions he saves Patty from her terrible state and frees mumsy from both the tyranny of her husband and having to look after Patty. The only one who comes worse is the father who as it turns out is the truly guilty one.Early in the play a quote from Kierkegaard is shown on the screen There resides infinitely more good in the demonic than in a trivial man. Tom Denholm Elliot's character may not be evil but he is sentimental dishonest cowardly and racist. He has no real good in him and no real bad in him. He's an ineffective and frustrated little man and lacks the courage and conviction to be good or bad. This is why he is trivial. Martin Michael Kitchen's character is a thoroughly wicked demon but is far from trivial and lives a remarkable life. Perhaps the message from this is that it is better to be who you are with total conviction whether that is good or evil than to live a crippled pointless life in which you are neither.However the exact meaning and message of this play could be debated for years and that is at least in part what makes a truly great and profound piece of work.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dennis Potter was a unique and profound talent who wrote many great pieces of work for television. His work was entertaining witty satirical innovative and challenging for both viewers and those involved in the television industry. Brimstone and Treacle is perhaps the most difficult piece he wrote which is reflected in the fact that the BBC banned it for 11 years. I recently watched it again and I found it to be as fresh and as shocking as ever. Viewed in the light of what British TV has become in the last 10 years it was particularly refreshing to be reminded of the quality it was once world famous for.I really can't speak highly enough of this remarkable work. Firstly there are the superb performances of the three main leads. Michael Kitchen is breath taking to watch and Denholm Elliot was in his element playing a sleazy little man racked with guilt. Patricia Lawrence was also perfect as the downtrodden mumsy. Dennis Potter's script was perfect and gave them wonderful lines. The story is disturbing and sick but at the same time incredibly funny. I couldn't help laugh at the demented sight of Michael Kitchen wheeling the mentally handicapped Patty around the living room before having his way with her. There was also what were at the time very innovative uses of lighting and camera which are still highly effective even today. There is also the Dennis Potter trade mark use of music.What really offended people about this play apart from the fact a mentally handicapped girl is raped is a that demon comes into the lives of three people in a desperate situation and turns out to be their saviour. Not that he intended to or could care less about them but through his actions he saves Patty from her terrible state and frees mumsy from both the tyranny of her husband and having to look after Patty. The only one who comes worse is the father who as it turns out is the truly guilty one.Early in the play a quote from Kierkegaard is shown on the screen There resides infinitely more good in the demonic than in a trivial man. Tom Denholm Elliot's character may not be evil but he is sentimental dishonest cowardly and racist. He has no real good in him and no real bad in him. He's an ineffective and frustrated little man and lacks the courage and conviction to be good or bad. This is why he is trivial. Martin Michael Kitchen's character is a thoroughly wicked demon but is far from trivial and lives a remarkable life. Perhaps the message from this is that it is better to be who you are with total conviction whether that is good or evil than to live a crippled pointless life in which you are neither.However the exact meaning and message of this play could be debated for years and that is at least in part what makes a truly great and profound piece of work.";

Of course once the devil suggests that we should kill them all leave no black brown yellow people alive he sorts of thinks twice about his racism and realises the implications of his hatred.The wife Patricia Lawrence is downtrodden with no life of her own looking after and bickering with her husband and caring for her daughter but the devil brings a little meaning to her life. As to the brain damaged daughter he cures her by attempting to rape her which is the element of the story that left the film unscreened for so many years and of course is the most disturbing especially as he wheels her around in anticipation of the dark deed.Kitchen is charming infuriating and shady as Martin the devil incarnate.

	schema:headline " A rewarding but disturbing film which deserves to be better known";
	schema:reviewBody "This film originated in a play with the same name written in 1976 by Dennis Potter for the TV series 'Play for Today' produced in the U.K. by the BBC. Its theme is straight black Gothic horror and before the production was aired the BBC decided that it would be too shocking for many of its likely audience so it was mothballed. Ultimately this TV presentation was not aired until 1987. I have been told that there was an earlier public release in the form of a stage presentation but I have been unable to confirm this. Long before this Dennis Potter rewrote the play for the cinema and the film version was released in 1982. Basically the story is the same but the film provides a little more fluidity than the play in which the action takes place almost entirely in one room. There is however one important difference which can be discussed without creating a spoiler as it relates to a scene that Dennis Potter deleted from the play when creating his film script. The cast of the play features a typical suburban middle class family comprising parents with an adult but paralysed and brain damaged daughter who receive an unexpected visitor claiming to be a former friend of the daughter. I understand an early scene in the play showed the daughter becoming paralysed by a road accident when she ran out of her home in horror after finding her father having sex with her best friend. This immediately created layers of guilt which were quite significant in the TV play but which the author decided to minimise in the screen version where the only reference to the accident comes later in the story as part of a dream sequence experienced by the father. The story evolves around the visitor Martin  a part played in the film by Sting who was formerly a soloist with The Police the group responsible for most of the sound tracks associated with the film but who has now established an independent reputation as a film actor. At first Martin provides friendly and helpful support for the family but later and seemingly innocently he opens up troubles and problems which had been papered over and thoroughly disrupts the normal tenure of the family's life. The dialogue is effective sharp and pointed and the film which is quite short rapidly progresses to its final horrendous climax.Ultimately the message is religious but whilst the film raises plenty of questions no solutions are offered. The parents consist of a somewhat disillusioned religious publisher and his wife who shows a deep but simple faith. Their visitors conversation gradually but increasingly disturbs the faith of both of them as well as that of the woman's club in the couple's church. In the original play hints were given that the mysterious visitor was Satan himself but in the case of the film it was probably wisely decided to remove these and by the final climax the viewer is left  according to personal religious convictions  to conclude that the visitor was Satan himself an ordinary person possessed by the devil or a naturally evil person behaving in his natural way. The horror of the film is intensified by the fact that nothing in any way supernatural takes place we are just observing a segment of ordinary human life. Ultimately this becomes a very rewarding but deeply disturbing film to watch.Those interested in comparing the film with the original play may wish to note that both may be more readily available in PAL format from the U.K.  its country of origin. DVD's of the film are currently listed there and I believe that a BBC videotape of the televised play released following its eventual screening is also available.".

Like much of Potter's work it shows how good television can be when put in the right hands.  Provocative and at times disturbing it uses the devices of a moral fable to question our commonsense idea of moral judgment.  A mysterious young man Michael Kitchen insinuates himself into the household of an unhappy suburban couple whose life centers around caring for their paralyzed and mute grown daughter.  He has a plan for these people and in the implementing of it he crosses the line into the unethical and the criminal.  Yet we're being asked to look beyond appearances because Martin is not an ordinary human.  There's something demonic about his perverse toying with people  not to mention his affinity with thunderstorms.  As the film reaches its climax another order of truth is revealed one that stands our comfortable certainties about right and wrong on their heads.".

As the devil here called Martin Michael Kitchen is menacing and also very funny while Denholm Elliott plays the father very well. Michelle Newell and Patricia Lawrence complete the cast as the girl vegetated by a car accident and her putupon mother destined to care for her forever.Banned by the BBC for nine years mainly because the basic message of the play is that as the devil rapes Pattie so her restores her power of speech and the quality of her existence. But the play is much more profound than that although some of its message is muddled and not fully developed.

It isn't just all about poker although that's most of it  culminating in the World Series of Poker  but about the mentality of people who make gambling their life.This film was far better than I figured it would be and was rewarding in the end without being predictable.

	schema:headline " Good movie for Vegas fanatics. Don't know about anyone else";
	schema:reviewBody "No movie in recent memory has sent me more mixed prerelease signals than Lucky You. The film is directed and cowritten by Curtis Hanson who has made many films I've admired in the past including 8 Mile and L.A. Confidential. The screenplay was also cowritten by Eric Roth the screenwriter of The Insider and Munich. And it features three very likable actors in lead roles specifically Eric Bana Drew Barrymore and Robert Duvall. These signs should have filled me with confidence but there was also the knowledge nagging at me that the film had been sitting on the studio's shelf for almost two years and had been shuffled through numerous release dates. Now that I've seen the film I can say that the film is certainly not all bad but is nowhere near what it should be given the talent both on and behind the camera.The film is set in the high stakes world of professional gambling in Las Vegas. We follow a man named Huck Cheever Eric Bana who could be one of the best players in the game but he is compulsive and often loses as much as he wins. His estranged father L.C. Robert Duvall is also a professional player on the circuit and it doesn't make things any easier for Huck. While trying to gather the money needed to participate in the World Series Poker Championship he happens to meet a sweet young newcomer to Vegas named Billie Offer Drew Barrymore. Billie's a singer at a local bar and knows nothing about gambling but when she starts to get attached to Huck she can see the compulsiveness that he cannot. This begins a rocky onagain offagain relationship between the two where Huck will have to determine what is truly important in his life.Most of the time while I was watching Lucky You I felt like I was watching an advertisement for the Las Vegas tourism board or perhaps one of those professional Poker games you sometimes see on TV. That's because the film's narrative is hardly there at all and a vast majority of the film is devoted to the game itself. The rules are explained early on when Billie sits down with Huck to watch him play in one scene and then the movie takes off with one game sequence after another. I'm sure there's an audience out there who finds this thrilling but I personally never got into Poker games and found my interest somewhat waning as the film went on. To be fair the film's climactic game at the Championship can be pretty tense at times but the numerous smaller games that take up the film's two hour plus running time just never build to much. Because the movie is so heavily concentrated on gaming the story and the characters never come across as interesting as they should be. Huck and Billie never get developed beyond their most basic traits and never even come across as a couple we can get behind. Huck's seeming inability to listen or reason made me wonder what Billie was thinking each time she hooked back up with him. I suppose this is supposed to be about a love story about two people who never learn. I can certainly see a good movie being made off of that story but this movie never lets us get close to them so we don't feel anything whether they are together or apart.That's not to say the movie is all bad. Lucky You is handsomely shot and the cinematography by Peter Deming really captures the excitement and thrill of Vegas quite well. And even if the Poker game sequences get somewhat tedious they are filmed well and manage to keep things moving. There are also some good performances on display. The three main leads are all strong particularly Eric Bana and Robert Duvall during their scenes together. The fatherson relationship they share often felt more genuine than the romance Bana shares with Barrymore. There are also a number of enjoyable supporting roles featuring many of Huck's friends who are equally compulsive with their gambling. One memorable cameo features Robert Downey Jr as a man who runs multiple 1900 number services at the same time as he switches back and forth between a selfrun depression helpline and a relationship counseling line. The only problem is that all of these positives are being employed by an emotionally hollow screenplay. The narrative is shaky at best and we never get to know these characters as much as we feel we should. There is enough drama and ideas here for a compelling romantic comedydrama but the film never takes charge. It's too interested in its setting and not enough in the people who inhabit that setting.Lucky You is not quite the disaster that should have had its release delayed for so long but at the same time I can understand why the studio was somewhat nervous about it. Despite the big names and the romance angle this movie is really all about professional gambling and it speaks to a very limited audience. I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. With a screenplay that focused more on Huck and Billie this maybe could have been an interesting story about two people who fall in love despite the fact they're probably bad for each other. As it is I often found myself trying to guess which hotel or casino they shot the scene I was watching in and was thinking back on my own visit to Vegas a couple years ago. The movie brought back some fun memories but not much else.".

As he is pawning a camera and his mother's wedding ring he is hoping for his luck to change. In truth he is a great player but does not know when to walk away from a table or a bet. One night after leaving the gambling establishments he goes to a local watering hole and meets a nice looking lady named Billie Drew Barrymore. As she is being pestered by a loser Huck comes to rescue her from his attentions. They make a connection. However Billie's sister Debra Messing persuades her sibling to walk away saying she knows Huck well and that he is all hustle and no commitment. Yet Huck persists and convinces Billie to go on a date After a lovely evening and night together Huck promptly takes money from Billie's wallet to take to the gaming tables. Ouch. Oh and Huck's father Robert Duvall a prize winning poker player is back in town to compete in the high stakes games. Will Huck win big? And will Billie ever speak to him again? This is a good movie with a few flaws. It has a somewhat slow pace and also suffers from some incredulity as far as Huck's poverty despite his obvious great talent for cards. Nevertheless Bana is certainly a large part of why the film is so worthwhile as his Huck is a very charismatic person indeed. Barrymore is probably miscast as Billie although that is not to say she performs badly just nondescriptly as the role does not call for a display of her comic abilities. Then too someone decided to give her the hair styles of a bowling alley queen and the costumes of a dork. On the other hand and surprisingly the Las Vegas setting looks gorgeous even away from the sparkling lights. If you like Bana and who the heck doesn't you will not want to miss a showing of this movie. Anyone with a hankering for highstakes poker will be perfectly enthralled as well.".

Cheever two worldclass poker players with many unresolved fatherson issues between them. Huck resents the fact that he's had to live virtually all his adult life in the shadow of his famous father who with his constant carousing stealing and gambling made life a living hell for Huck's mother virtually till the day she died. What Huck doesn't realize  and this is where Doctor Freud comes in  is that he is pretty much following in his father's footsteps both in his choice of profession and his relations with women. Meanwhile L.C. hangs out around the casinos and coffee shops of the city trying to reconcile with his boy while at the same time doling out unaskedfor advice about how the young man should be living his life both at and away from the poker table. Drew Barrymore completes the cast as Billie Offer a young morally upright ingnue from Bakersfield who has come to Sin City to begin her career as a singer and who winds up falling under the spell of the ethicallychallenged Huck. Or could it be that the beatific Billie is really an angel of the Lord come to lead the iniquitous Huck out of this modernday Sodom and Gomorrah? The scenes between Bana and Barrymore are probably the best in the film and one wishes that more time would have been spent developing that relationship instead of sitting around the poker table. For whenever the story moves into the casino the movie stops dead in its tracks proving once again that poker by its very nature makes for one of the least compelling sports ever to be depicted on film. Anyone without a thorough working knowledge of the ins and outs of Texas Hold'em in particular is going to find himself lost in all the arcane trivia of the pokerplaying scenes which take up quite a large chunk of the movie's overall running time I might add. Even worse is the fact that the fatherson angle is so clichd and hackneyed at this point that even actors of the caliber of Bana and Duvall and they are both excellent can't be expected to really pull it off.There are some quality elements in Lucky You. Director Curtis Hanson who cowrote the screenplay with Eric Roth proves yet again  as he did in LA Confidential and 8 Mile  that he knows how to extract the essence of a locale to build atmosphere and mood. Moreover the interactions between Huck and Billie are often flavorful and intriguing which is more than can be said for those between Huck and his dad. The performances are uniformly impressive with Barrymore in particular showing a bit more range here than she has in most of her previous roles.Hanson has populated his film with a number of real life poker playing celebrities which may be of interest to the aficionados but won't mean much to the rest of us. Sad to say but the lackluster Lucky You is unlikely to appeal to anyone not already passionate about professional poker  and unlikely to garner the sport itself many new fans.".

The fatherson relationship was a fairly accurate and believable portrayal of a strained almost completely broken family connection. This is the meat and potato's of this movie. My friends and co viewers had led me to believe this was going to be a Chick Flick but it really wasn't. It was a father and son flick. It seems that it wanted to be but it never really got there. Sorry to say that Drew Barrymores part ended up playing only the catalyst to the relationship between father and son. It was fine by me that the boyfriendgirlfriend relationship didn't seem to really work and was forced too much. The good stuff was all centered around Eric Bana. He played and played the heck out of every thing he could get his hands on. Robert Duvall was fun to watch as always. There are no Oscars here but fine performances all around. Hats off to all the real poker players who played themselves Good job! It was strange to see the bit Parts played by Robert Downey Jr. Jean Smart and Debra Messing all given either too much time and dialog or too little. I would love to have seen Jean Smart play the love interest of Duvall instead of I believe Yetta Gottesman. It would have brought in a little more comedy to and otherwise dramatic movie. I could have done without Debra Messing's part not that she wasn't fine I just felt it was unnecessary. There were some good one liners but it wasn't a lot of laughs. I have to say the technique employed throughout the movie allowed even novice poker players to enjoy the high stakes action. The audience collectively oohh'd and ahhhhh'd at some of the hands. It was well filmed and directed. This was a solid offering that teaches a few of life's little lessons worth learning. I liked it and recommend it.".

Despite the title Lucky You is really about an down and out poker play Huck Cheever trying to get into a famous poker tournament. A big part of the movie is Huck's rivalry with his dad who beats up in the poker table. We see Huck have a lover Suzanne Offer. However eventually he falls for her sister who is a singer.Barrymore hasn't looked she's aged much. Her performance in this is memorable though it's not that different from other roles she's played. Eric Bana is convincing as the woeful Huck Cheever. Likewise Robert Duvall by this point is a master in playing the stuffy arrogant but tough old man role. In a way this is one of those movies where the major character as hard he tries is an underachiever who can't cut a break. Nothing ever seems to work for him including relationships. This movie also has the familiar boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl then loses her again plot that audiences will eat up.I remember the audience though did love it and the movie does manage to blend in comedy and drama and shows you a bit of what's like in the card playing world of poker.The release of the movie in May just seems totally illogical. With all the summer blockbusters coming up it seems destined to be a movie that might be forgotten amidst the hype of the other movies. Still it's a decent movie and the acting is fine. The movie may not do huge at the box office but if you want a perfectly decent movie to watch that will leave you satisfied at the end then see it.".

Yet as in so many limp forgettable films the problem is...THE SCRIPT. The story is utterly without merit and there was no reason to tell it except that it tries to exploit the recent fascination with bigtime poker tournaments.Unfortunately poker which is probably quite interesting and challenging to play is wretchedly boring to WATCH since winning depends in part on having a BLANK pokerface. The only cathartic part is thousands and even millions at are stake but otherwise its no more interesting to watch than gin rummy or even your granny's bingo night at church.Huck yes short for Huckleberry Cheever a young poker player in Las Vegas with no other job or means of employment. Not a very good player as he is always broke or losing at the last minute. It becomes painfully obvious that that Huck really is a GAMBLING ADDICT so addicted that he repeatedly blows money he needs to pay to get into the Big Game money he owes other people...even money he STEALS from the innocent girl he is dating.That's not a clever talented poker player on the rise  that's a pathetic addict who is about two steps from life in the gutter. We are supposed to think Hank who is losing stupidly left  right is a brilliant worldclass player. Hank's dad L.C. Cheever Duvall excellent as always even in a thankless role is quite obviously a much better craftier player.There is a very slight romance with Billie a wannabe lounge singer played by Drew Barrymore. She can be very charming but here she seems miscast and shrewish as she lays into the messed up Huck about his life. The romantic parts are leaden and devoid of romantic charm or even erotic appeal there's no nudity or sex since Bana and Barrymore have zero chemistry together.Looking back to what I thought the first time I saw Bana in The Hulk he is handsome but really does not have acting talent. He probably rates off the charts with female audience testers but simply cannot carry a film. I wish there was some way to tell filmmakers that you need MORE than a pretty face or a ripped body to connect with the audience.The film wraps up with Huck and Pops at The Big Poker tournament the only exciting aspect of which is that the prize is several million dollars. I understand there are also cameos by a number of genuine poker champions I wouldn't know.Huck throws the game  and several million bucks  to his dad. WHY???? There is nothing up to this point to demonstrate that L.C. a two time champ couldn't deal with losing or that he needed the money for an operation or something. In fact it's Hank who is poor and screwed up and losing his furnitureless but posh home. It's Hank who really needed the win so he could continue his career as a first rank player.The whole film would have made more sense if the father threw the game...helping his son for the first time and moving aside for the next generation and perhaps if Hank thought he won for real but then realized his father's gift. But that ain't this film. Hank's decision makes no sense and there is no reason to believe that the fatherson relationship is really healed.Heck even though the movie ends with Hank and Billie smooching anyone with half a brain quickly realizes Hank will probably be rifling through Billie's purse by midnight and screwing around behind her back and that this is no romance this is a tragedy for poor naive Billie. And how come nobody remotely suggests that Hank and some of the other idiot gambling addicts in the film including a humorous lunkhead who has had BREAST IMPLANTS to try and win a bet have even thought about getting help for their tragic destructive behavior.So aside from being about as exciting as a hygiene class filmstrip the movie doesn't make much sense and offers appallingly bad advice keep gambling keep taking money from innocent people do anything to win etc..It's a loser that much is for sure. In conclusion presumably nobody saw it at the box office so no  loss there but this is not even worth a rental and for god's sake do not purchase it even on clearance where it is destined to end up...not even your most pokerlovin' pals will tolerate it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the middle of all the hype other films get here is a finely crafted small film that treats us with another great performance by Eric Bana as the selfdestructive poker player who might get another chance at redeeming himself. As one discovers when the film reaches its shocking conclusion Bana has slowly descended into a pattern that is not very healthy or practical.Bana plays a Huck an obsessive compulsive player always out to beat the others. He has little self control and sabotages whatever lucky deals he might have or the skills taught to him by the father who deserted him. Along the way he meets a sweet ingnue played by Drew Barrymore and this trio's interactions is the gist and delight of the film.The film doesn't have any new revelations but it feels fresh because it allows the humanity of the players to come through. These are not faceless gamblers but real people who happen to live in places like Vegas. It is also good to see that some of the darkness and the underworld references have been toned down in order to allow the more intimate moments to take precedence.Bana deserves an entire separate review and it is only fair that he becomes a major star in the future.

I rank it up there with Rounders as far as the intensity of the poker play. It's not a romantic comedy! Drew Barrymore is an important prop in the movie but only slightly more important the cards and less important than Huck's mother's wedding ring see the movie to know what that means. See this movie for the poker not because the queen of romantic comedies Ms Barrymore is in it. Bana is excellent as the obsessed poker player scion of Duvall the patriarch of the Cheever Poker Family. The problem with Duvall is he's digging into his bag of characteractor bits for some more of the grizzle he does so well. Note Duvall was suppose to be an English professor before he became a poker proI didn't see it. This movie is an excellent study of obsession and those affected by the obsessive person.

The scriptwriter of 'The Postman' no less wants us to sit through endless games of poker the variation indicated by helpful signs at convenient intervals on the strength of Eric the Wooden standing to lose 351.50. At least that's as far as I got before I turned it off. Well all right it's the WSOP but aren't all poker movies about that? The rest of the film that isn't poker operates on the level of a beach party movie  complete with indoor volleyball.

I expected something between the atypical Bergman plot of The Serpent's Egg and the disturbing social violence of From the Life of the Marionettes. I finally tracked down a copy poor in quality and expected mediocrity at best when I put it in.After having just finished watching it I can say I was very pleasantly surprised with the film. A lot of the things said about it are just plain false  the plot is very much in keeping with Bergman's other material. A married woman Karin Anderson falls in love with a disturbed architect David Gould and the two begin an emotionally confused love affair. Karin is caught between her happy bourgeois life with her husband Sydow and children and her passionate unconventional relationship with David. Acting in bad faith Karen refuses to choose between her two lives though both David and her husband eventually push the decision on her. Like most Bergman films its a psychological roller coaster and a bleak portrayal of the coarseness of human relationships.Bibi Anderson does a wonderful job in a very difficult role and Max von Sydow plays the part of the honest and good intentioned husband very well playing hard on the viewer's sympathies. The stiff performance of Gould echoes that of Carradine in The Serpent's Egg so it must unfortunately be attributed to Bergman's struggle with directing in English not on Gould himself. If I recall the film was made in both Swedish and English both versions filmed at once which poses obvious production difficulties which might account from the some times mechanical treatment of the script.The film has an excellent pace to it and moves very swiftly and smoothly wonderfully shot by Nykvist in a way very similar to The Passion of Anna. Unlike a lot of Bergman's depressing work in the 1970s I felt good about the film when it was over.I don't know why this film has such a poor reputation  I'm very much baffled after having seen it. My guess is the obvious mistake of having made it in English accounts for most of this.Its seems a lot like Bergman's other work in this period. Very Good.".

	schema:headline " Underrated this is one of the more potent Bergman romantic dramas I've seen...";
	schema:reviewBody "...and I think part of the reason for that is aside from some notable uses of symbolism some subtle some not so subtle in part due to the photography the story is rather simple. This gives Bergman room to try and get us to understand these characters. In lessor hands or rather hands not as proficient in the soulsearching drama as Bergman is this could be almost a TV melodrama. But I would disagree with some critics notably with Ebert that Bergman has lost his tone with this picture. In some ways it is more modernly set than some of his other films and that it is in English sets it apart from some of his trademark Svensk Filmindustri pictures however it doesn't hurt it terribly so. There were times while watching the film mostly in the first fifty minutes that I thought this was one of Bergman's best by giving his control somewhat over to the actors who are all sensational. While it doesn't quite live up towards the end and feels abruptly finished the climax doesn't feel too compromised. The Touch is like the Adrian Lyne film which draws itself from a Chabrol film Unfaithful only this film seems a little more steeped in reality than outright sexuality.Karin Bibi Andersson one of Bergman's key actresses lives a rather calm routine life with her husband Andreas Max von Sydow and their two children. After her mother dies which I suppose sets up her emotional indecisiveness for the film she meets David Elliot Gould and the two slowly begin an affair. But David is not the most stable of people and it shakes Karin up at first. Soon they fall in love but are separated the sort of usual machinations with an infidelity story begin to unfold and yet not losing the emotions from before. The three key actors of the film Andersson Von Sydow and Gould seem to live in these characters and especially Gould for whom this would be his only role with the director conveys a sort of double nature that is also within Karin. His performance is one that I would put in a list of his best you can tell everything he wants and fears in his face and actions within the careful framing this is a man on the edge. Bergman had once described Gould as a difficult actor to work with but that tension came out the right way on screen at least from my perspective.As I mentioned in lessor hands this could become a further melodrama and part of the films refusal to subvert to that category is a credit to not only Bergman but to cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Whenever I see a film with their collaboration or even if it's Nykvist with perhaps a lessor director I always watch for how Nykvist moves the camera. How seamlessly he follows these characters and in their darkest recesses he lights them like the light and control on their faces is part of the writing. A lot of times appropriately so one may not even feel the presence of the camera as if Nykvist doesn't even have a technique. But it is here where not only does he and Bergman go with their touches of light and dark they also go for a documentary feel in the production.Basically this is an experiment for Bergman as it is for his fans to endure. He's experimenting with a genre done hundreds of times he experiments with music unlike some of his dramas which includes Bach or Mozart here it's kind of popsounding for the period and he experiments with his cast this time around. Is it as powerful and aweinspiring as his trilogy or his other great works? Probably not. But it is unfortunately panned down as a lessor work of his which isn't necessarily true. The film also needs to be seen by more people of today as it is virtually impossible to buy on video or DVD. A".

	onyx:emotionText "...and I think part of the reason for that is aside from some notable uses of symbolism some subtle some not so subtle in part due to the photography the story is rather simple. This gives Bergman room to try and get us to understand these characters. In lessor hands or rather hands not as proficient in the soulsearching drama as Bergman is this could be almost a TV melodrama. But I would disagree with some critics notably with Ebert that Bergman has lost his tone with this picture. In some ways it is more modernly set than some of his other films and that it is in English sets it apart from some of his trademark Svensk Filmindustri pictures however it doesn't hurt it terribly so. There were times while watching the film mostly in the first fifty minutes that I thought this was one of Bergman's best by giving his control somewhat over to the actors who are all sensational. While it doesn't quite live up towards the end and feels abruptly finished the climax doesn't feel too compromised. The Touch is like the Adrian Lyne film which draws itself from a Chabrol film Unfaithful only this film seems a little more steeped in reality than outright sexuality.Karin Bibi Andersson one of Bergman's key actresses lives a rather calm routine life with her husband Andreas Max von Sydow and their two children. After her mother dies which I suppose sets up her emotional indecisiveness for the film she meets David Elliot Gould and the two slowly begin an affair. But David is not the most stable of people and it shakes Karin up at first. Soon they fall in love but are separated the sort of usual machinations with an infidelity story begin to unfold and yet not losing the emotions from before. The three key actors of the film Andersson Von Sydow and Gould seem to live in these characters and especially Gould for whom this would be his only role with the director conveys a sort of double nature that is also within Karin. His performance is one that I would put in a list of his best you can tell everything he wants and fears in his face and actions within the careful framing this is a man on the edge. Bergman had once described Gould as a difficult actor to work with but that tension came out the right way on screen at least from my perspective.As I mentioned in lessor hands this could become a further melodrama and part of the films refusal to subvert to that category is a credit to not only Bergman but to cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Whenever I see a film with their collaboration or even if it's Nykvist with perhaps a lessor director I always watch for how Nykvist moves the camera. How seamlessly he follows these characters and in their darkest recesses he lights them like the light and control on their faces is part of the writing. A lot of times appropriately so one may not even feel the presence of the camera as if Nykvist doesn't even have a technique. But it is here where not only does he and Bergman go with their touches of light and dark they also go for a documentary feel in the production.Basically this is an experiment for Bergman as it is for his fans to endure. He's experimenting with a genre done hundreds of times he experiments with music unlike some of his dramas which includes Bach or Mozart here it's kind of popsounding for the period and he experiments with his cast this time around. Is it as powerful and aweinspiring as his trilogy or his other great works? Probably not. But it is unfortunately panned down as a lessor work of his which isn't necessarily true. The film also needs to be seen by more people of today as it is virtually impossible to buy on video or DVD. A";

	schema:reviewBody "It's the story of a married woman falling in love with another man. The married couple  Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson  does live in fine rapport their personalities matching well. Both are quiet contemplative and very rational persons not liable to act spontaneous. The intruder  Elliott Gould  on the idyll which they embody together with their teenaged daughter is in contrast an impetuous man uncompromising overbearing and tormented by inner contradictions and compulsions. Andersson tells him at one point that he hates himself. The two clandestine lovers aren't appropriate for each other. They have difficulties to accept the other's social behaviour and stance and don't like it to lie to their environments. But soon they cannot live without each other anymore.The point of the film cannot be to show how two contrary characters complement each other as Andersson was even more happy with von Sydow before and because it's all told in such a detached manner. The portrait of a love would like to involve the spectators to convey the joy and pain of it. Instead the question why Andersson turns away from von Sydow toward Gould seems intentionally perplexing. The dialogues and acting of the lovers is cerebral and cold as if they were reciting dazedly on a stage astounding themselves with their actions and feelings. As if they were actuating on an impulse isolate from their personalities. This impulse or drive is not eros as especially at the beginning of their affaire sex is more a problem than a fulfilment to these two diffident lovers. Maybe love or the need to feel and give love is itself such a drive an autonomous thing asserting itself regardless of the circumstances and the characters involved.The central metaphor of the film is a medieval wooden statue of Mary recently excavated after being buried for centuries  like Gould's and Andersson's potential to be lovers or man and woman. But with the disinterment of the Mary there also come alive insect larvae inside her corroding her from within. Before they meet Gould attempted suicide and Andersson was reduced to a wife. They flower in their new love and it destroys their lives.Civilization means in many ways the domestication of our impulses. Therefore Andersson realizes that she must not harm lastingly her family and Gould's hidden wifesister. This is true. But Gould is telling her that she is lying to herself by not eloping with him and he's right too.".

But it was better than I'd heard it was and it beats All These Women and The Serpent's Egg any day. The Touch is wonderfully shot by Sven Nykvist no surprise as Nykvist's cinematography was always striking complimenting the gritty yet beautiful locations just as well. There are moments where Bergman's inexperience in bilingual shows but he still directs capably and most thoughtfully with not many signs of heavyhandedness or pretensions if any at all. The music is appropriately atmospheric and takes care not to be intrusive. The story for the first two thirds is touching and mostly compelling with themes and plot strands that are relatable to anybody going through the same thing it didn't come across as heavyhanded to me and have a sense of Bergman's style. Bibbi Anderssen is superb in a very nuanced portrayal if there was a pick for the best thing about The Touch it would definitely by Anderssen's performance. Max Von Sydow is as enigmatic and stoic as ever with facial expressions and eye contact that speaks volumes a very sympathetic performance. The Touch is sadly hurt by mainly Elliot Gould as a rather stiff lead and the awkward dialogue written for himAnderssen and Von Sydow are not as badly affected though though they have had much better material and padding in the final third particularly that leads to literally nowhere are just as problematic. That is personal opinion though. Overall not a bad film at all in fact it is an interesting one especially for Anderssen and the cinematography but Bergman has done much better than this. 710 Bethany Cox".

Yes it's Bergman and Bergman as we know him but this time in English at least for a good deal of the time. The film was largely dismissed on release but has since built up something of a reputation. Gould is miscast it''s hard to accept him as an intellectual and you keep feeling his character would sound better in Swedish but in any language both Andersson and Max Von Sydow as her husband are superb. There is nothing new here this is Ingmar doing what Ingmar does which is either up your alley or it's not. As one of his many scenes from a marriage it's certainly more than adequate if hardly groundbreaking. Sven Nykvist was once again the cinematographer so it looks terrific. A masterpiece?

	schema:headline " The Boredom Below";
	schema:reviewBody "Unter dir die Stadt or The City Below is a German 105minute movie from 2010 so this one has its 7th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Christoph Hochhusler and it is one of his more known works. It is basically the story of a woman who struggles with married life in a new city and ends up having an affair with a much older married man. The central character is played by Nicolette Krebitz and while her good looks especially for her age are undeniable I must say her performance did not really win me over this time. This may also have to do with the way the character was written though. It is not really a problem that there are no likable characters in this film at all it is much more crucial that none of them feel really interesting or relevant in a way where I would care what happens next to them. Or their relationships. The rest of the cast is probably not too wellknown but German movie buffs may recognize one face or the other. All in all you could perhaps divide this film into 2 segments the personal life segments involving Krebitz' character and the business life segments involving many more characters than her husband. The latter was probably even weaker than the former I guess as none of the central characters received proper characterizations and elaborations in a way I would have liked it. The runtime is not too little so lack of screen time was not a problem at all. The major problem was instead that Hochhuser perhaps lacked the right focus. Maybe he should have centered the entire film around Krebitz' character and kept it at 7580 minutes max as the business parts were mostly nothing more than loud and selfimportant without having any kind of substance to them really. Oh yeah the title is also a bit on the pretentious side. I don't mind poetic references like these but you have to make a connection with a title like that too and homesickness that is not really at the very core of the film even won't cut the cake here. This film is not a failure by any means but I personally found it uninteresting for the most part. Not recommended.".

This film Wild is the Wind has a great script filled with forceful characters clearly defined but developed with such precision that I would think of it as a model of what a dramatic characterization should be. The choice of cast was perfect with each actor having a talent that matched the dimension necessary to make this movie a mixture of drama and powerful social content. The movie has many layers of reasoning that should be enjoyable for any movie buff. Anthony Quinn is at his best always in character. He delivered one of the best performances of his career. It is sad that it is a performance so rarely mentioned not even in his biography. But such a find for those who appreciate his strong and insightful performances. Anna Magdalena did only a couple of American films. Most remembered for the Rose Tattoo. I would love to see some of her Italian films she is a very dynamic actress. Her talent as a dramatic leading lady is worth watching the movie. If you appreciated the strong character and wonderful performance of Meryl Streep in Madison County you will enjoy this character. Anna Magdalena was incredible. The film was unfortunately ahead of its time by American norms in the film industry at the time of its presentation. If released today imagine the reception. Films such as this were definitely an influence on the American film industry the success and need to expand a film past a current film formula script was then only in its infancy. So if you want to see it for history social moral content dramatic performances its fantastic artful presentation or the sheer enjoyment of a great story well done by the most talented artists of our time see it.".

Finally  in her eyes we see how she made  Open City  Rosselini a memorable film. Produced by the best...Hal Wallis CP".

Finally  in her eyes we see how she made  Open City  Rosselini a memorable film. Produced by the best...Hal Wallis CP";

	schema:reviewBody "Cukor's Wild is the Wind seems to be a kind of tribute to Fellini's classic La Strada. He made his film just a couple years later and sets it up along very similar lines. He selects Antony Quinn Zampano for Fellini to be his male lead Gino. And chooses the forceful Anna Magnani Gioia to equal Guiletta Masina's rather astonishing performance in the central role of Gelsomina in La Strada. Gino the Nevada ranch owner is the same kind of brutish brooding hunk as is the strong man performer in La Strada. They act in the masculine mode determined gusty sometimes cruel and in different senses heroically alone. It is perhaps the poverty of the former and Gino's outsider status Italian in Nevada that open each up to change and redemption. Each however is hardened against the actual womanwhoseservice he demands and whose body he exploitswho offers that change.Gioia like her parallel Gelsomina is a replacement for a dead sister. Zampano purchases Gelsomina after his Rosa dies. Gino orders Gioia as a mail order bride to replace his wife who died after several desperate attempts to give him a child. Both women find themselves trapped in a feelingless cold abusive relationship removed from human response and the natural world. They are ownedbody and soul and are of course interchangeable with their sisters.But Gioia's resistance like that of her predecessor is central. Each woman is engaged through a compelling range of small acts and facial expressionsthey are FACES above all elsein a form of survival which doubles as opposition. What the man denies they affirm what he kills they save. Each is strongly in touch with the needless suffering endured by humans and animals and are sickened by the acts that cause it . And each is more bold than pleasing more spirited than spiritual and more troubling than tamed.Both women have one or two male allies who bear some similarity. Bene Tony Francioso seems related to La Stradas tightrope walker Richard Basehart both men serving as alternative male's who have understanding and sympathy for these held women and for the natural world they defend. They create space an breathing roomBene's lust seems out of character. And then too each in the end leaves these women to the mercy of their oppressive situation. Alberto Gino's older brother is perhaps a more practical ally than these two however it is his unusually direct and touching challenge to his brother that forces him to perceive Gioia as a person. All the major roles of La Strada are more convincing and consistent and thus the ending is more powerful. Gino's redemption is also secured at a much lower cost than Zampano's which has to do with the weaker scriptplot than and not his less rigid nature. However Wild is the Wind given Cukor's Hollywood models and restraints measures up quite well to Fellini's classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wild is the Wind is a torpid melodrama directed by George Cukor attempting to keep Anna Maganni and Anthony Quinn off the furniture. Quinn looks the role of an aging Italian sheepherder that made good in North America but his character is all my way or the highway stubbornness that Quinn over emotes every other sentence. Maganni plays Goia his wife and sister of his widow with an exhausted look but is also prone to temper tantrums. Cukor is more a less a referee allowing both free range in his interpretation of the Mediterranean personality. It's strictly tourismo neorealismo.Goia is treated callously and feeling like a stand in for her dead sister takes up with Bene Tony Franciosa whose been like a son to Gino. With implications of necrophilia and incest one would think Cukor along with his hot blooded cast would be able to get the story up to a passionate boiling point.

	onyx:emotionText "Wild is the Wind is a torpid melodrama directed by George Cukor attempting to keep Anna Maganni and Anthony Quinn off the furniture. Quinn looks the role of an aging Italian sheepherder that made good in North America but his character is all my way or the highway stubbornness that Quinn over emotes every other sentence. Maganni plays Goia his wife and sister of his widow with an exhausted look but is also prone to temper tantrums. Cukor is more a less a referee allowing both free range in his interpretation of the Mediterranean personality. It's strictly tourismo neorealismo.Goia is treated callously and feeling like a stand in for her dead sister takes up with Bene Tony Franciosa whose been like a son to Gino. With implications of necrophilia and incest one would think Cukor along with his hot blooded cast would be able to get the story up to a passionate boiling point. Instead we are given shrill rage and tepid desire culminating in a cop out ending. Wild is the Wind calls for high heat but is mostly lukewarm and fails to pull the wool over any one's eyes in its attempt to be more than it is.";

There's a pace to this movie a speed at which the story unfolds that is rarely seen in contemporary films. Seems we just don't have the patience anymore for such a natural unfolding.Make that a 1 cent contribution though. I don't have enough of a context to intelligently comment on this film beyond a thought or two. In a way I see the points made by both the positive and detracting reviews. The one thing I can say though unequivocally I love any movie or TV show shot on location! This one is. They didn't try to pull off a sheep ranch on a Hollywood back lot. Thus we get some nice spring vistas of the Eastern Sierras.So anyway just a couple of thoughts....1 I had never heard of Anna Magnani. She is a fine actress. She emotes so well through her face and body language she would have made a wonderful silent film era actress. She sure generates a lot of power in this movie. As a man I would NOT want her character on my case! But I loved watching her torture someone else. And of course she too was tortured. Women kind of don't like it when the husband calls them by the name of his first wife.2 There is a moment when she comes to Tony Franciosa's room... the first time she approaches him as opposed to him approaching her. What was played very well here is the inevitability of the two of them connecting. Neither of them want this! But they are drawn to each other and sooner or later... and it took a while here in keeping with the pacing of the film... sooner or later as long as the two of them lived on the same ranch they were going to end up in bed. There was just no fighting it. It was as though they were marionettes and the puppet masters had decided they would join together. And even though they each knew the consequences they had no choice. You see it her face. That moment of surrender when she accepted the inevitable fate.Oh man. I've been there. Have you been there? When you literally cannot stop yourself? This is the kind of love that Plato termed a serious mental disease. aahhhhh.".

	schema:headline " An ode to the love affair between Bollywood and Switzerland!";
	schema:reviewBody "Tandoori Love is the story of an Indian cook Raja and his series of misadventures in the Swiss mountains. These include leaving his Bollywood troupe to starve as he starts working for a Swiss restaurant delighting people with his Indian delicacies stabbing a man singing and perhaps most significantly falling in love with his boss Markus' fiance Sonja.It is a tender story of a man who falls in love pretty much at first sight and his attempts to woo the girl that has so captured his imagination. It is the story of a girl who finds herself torn between her egoistic and selfcentered fianc and a kind and gentle cook whom she's increasingly attracted to. Above all this is a story of prejudices and the unintentional hilarity ensuing from it. From the unassuming folk in the Bernese Mountains who regard the Indian film troupe as a bit of a nuisance to the Indian film crew who expect only cheesiness to flow from the Swiss landscape to Sonja who approaches Raja's advances with trepidation to her fianc who at first brands Raja condescendingly as a refugee but later more than wholeheartedly buys into his Indian cooking the film deals with the clash of prejudices and stereotypes. It makes for some fun viewing as the two cultures are introduced to each other and slowly start to get to know each other better.With Tandoori Love director Oliver Paulus offers his tribute to the frothy Bollywood song and dance routine. The brilliance of this move is best reflected when Raja utterly smitten by Sonja as soon as he lays his eyes on her breaks into a song. So far so good except that he does it right in the middle of a Migros Supermarket a complete antithesis of the snow capped peaks in the Swiss Alps. The director also displays enough knowledge and understanding of Indian film crews and depicts it with his tongue firmly in his cheek. Most importantly however Paulus portrays the love triangle between Raja Sonja and Markus in a disarmingly natural manner and that is where he scores. This is first and foremost a love story and Paulus manages to keep us hooked onto it as we make our way through a few songs some moments of humor and others of sheer madcap brilliance.As far as actors go Vijay Raaz is superlative as the smitten cook who would go the extra mile to woo the girl of his dreams. He may be average looking but more than makes up for it with his utterly natural performance. He character goes from madly in love to bewildered to slowly becoming confident in a foreign environment and Raaz excels in every scene helping the film along as we warm up to this golden hearted chef. Lavinia Wilson and Martin Schick lend depth to their characters as Sonja and Markus respectively and special mention has to be made of Shweta Aggarwal as the typically spoiled unprofessional Bollywood leading lady. All the supporting actors do a fine job. be it the restaurant regulars in the Hirschen or members of the Indian film crew. The songs are also very short in the film so that their freshness is retained and never once coming across as cumbersome.This is one of the better films to come out of Switzerland in recent years and director Paulus and his team have to be applauded for coming up with a refreshingly entertaining piece of cinema. Go watch it!!".

These include leaving his Bollywood troupe to starve as he starts working for a Swiss restaurant delighting people with his Indian delicacies stabbing a man singing and perhaps most significantly falling in love with his boss Markus' fiance Sonja.It is a tender story of a man who falls in love pretty much at first sight and his attempts to woo the girl that has so captured his imagination. It is the story of a girl who finds herself torn between her egoistic and selfcentered fianc and a kind and gentle cook whom she's increasingly attracted to. Above all this is a story of prejudices and the unintentional hilarity ensuing from it. From the unassuming folk in the Bernese Mountains who regard the Indian film troupe as a bit of a nuisance to the Indian film crew who expect only cheesiness to flow from the Swiss landscape to Sonja who approaches Raja's advances with trepidation to her fianc who at first brands Raja condescendingly as a refugee but later more than wholeheartedly buys into his Indian cooking the film deals with the clash of prejudices and stereotypes. It makes for some fun viewing as the two cultures are introduced to each other and slowly start to get to know each other better.With Tandoori Love director Oliver Paulus offers his tribute to the frothy Bollywood song and dance routine. The brilliance of this move is best reflected when Raja utterly smitten by Sonja as soon as he lays his eyes on her breaks into a song. So far so good except that he does it right in the middle of a Migros Supermarket a complete antithesis of the snow capped peaks in the Swiss Alps. The director also displays enough knowledge and understanding of Indian film crews and depicts it with his tongue firmly in his cheek. Most importantly however Paulus portrays the love triangle between Raja Sonja and Markus in a disarmingly natural manner and that is where he scores. This is first and foremost a love story and Paulus manages to keep us hooked onto it as we make our way through a few songs some moments of humor and others of sheer madcap brilliance.As far as actors go Vijay Raaz is superlative as the smitten cook who would go the extra mile to woo the girl of his dreams. He may be average looking but more than makes up for it with his utterly natural performance. He character goes from madly in love to bewildered to slowly becoming confident in a foreign environment and Raaz excels in every scene helping the film along as we warm up to this golden hearted chef. Lavinia Wilson and Martin Schick lend depth to their characters as Sonja and Markus respectively and special mention has to be made of Shweta Aggarwal as the typically spoiled unprofessional Bollywood leading lady. All the supporting actors do a fine job. be it the restaurant regulars in the Hirschen or members of the Indian film crew. The songs are also very short in the film so that their freshness is retained and never once coming across as cumbersome.This is one of the better films to come out of Switzerland in recent years and director Paulus and his team have to be applauded for coming up with a refreshingly entertaining piece of cinema. Go watch it!!";

Nothing is ever really resolved and the ending is more resonant with Crocodile Dundee 1 than coherent within the film. If you just want lightasfluff entertainment for about 90 min go for it.

	schema:reviewBody "Tandoori Love is bright colorful musical romantic slightly violent and best of all contains extreme closeups of beautiful delicious Indian food. This is fusion filmmaking at its best and most hilarious and you will leave the theater desperately searching for the nearest Indian restaurant.Sonja lives in the Swiss Alps and is engaged to Markus. Well he hasn't actually proposed yet or given her a ring but he has already announced the engagement to their families. Markus seems like a nice guy if a bit of a mama's boy and Sonja is a gorgeous Swiss Miss with very long legs and red hair.All is going well until a Bollywood film crew sets up camp next to their chaletrestaurant. Spoiled Priya is a Bollywood diva who loves Raja the crew cook. But Raja only has eyes for the Swiss beauty in the chalet. Markus unaware of Raja's love for his fianc hires him to be the new cook for the restaurant.And now the fun begins. The arrival of the film crew has turned all of Switzerland into a Bollywood movie. Raja makes an impromptu marriage proposal to Sonja in the supermarket and suddenly is singing a love ballad while all the Swiss customers start dancing in sync. After every declaration of love or rejection we cut to an overproduced Bollywood music video. And of course we have the standard boy meets girl loses girl accidentally stabs a man in the back and then wins girl in the end. But you never know which boy and which girl will end up with whom.This movie is just pure enjoyable fun. There are no deep messages here no thoughtful quandaries to think about later it's just a fun and quite beautiful SwissBollywood movie. Definitely one of my favorites at Cinequest Film Festival this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deadly Friend should probably be good for fans of cult horror films and this is nothing like some of Wes Craven's past and present films such as Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream but it does have a good combination of both the horror classics Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. However the script is rather weak and seemed poorly adapted from Diana Henstall's more effect short novel Friend. Deadly Friend does have some good scares and above all gore and a good solid cast from teen stars Matthew Laborteaux Michael Sharrett and a young beautiful Kristy Swanson in the title role. Both Russ Marin and Anne Twomey provide a warm feeling to the younger cast and the audiences while Richard Marcus and Anne Ramsey both as usual looking wickedly evil in their roles. Above all Ramsey's classic decapitation by basketball scene is the highlight of the film. One year before she was seen in Steven Spielberg's The Goonies and a year after this she got an Oscar nomination for Throw Momma from the Train before dying in 1988. I whould say Deadly Friend gets 810 for a classic cult horror favorite.".

Matthew L something brings warmth and charm to his role and his relationship with his mom is cute and wholly believable. Kristy Swanson is pure delight as his girl next door love and her robotic moves are surprisingly well executed. Like in A Nightmare on Elm Street Wes Craven is able to create characters who you actually give a damn about and that's what makes this silly premise actually work.The film is pretty funny at times and the graphic horror is sure to delight gore hounds. The basketball scene alone is outstanding. For the most part Deadly Friend is more actual fun than suspenseful although it does have a few well timed shocks.All in all A nice effort from Craven. Pretty inventive and overcomes it's weaknesses by being just a plain old fun flick.".

	schema:headline " Mixed Feelings";
	schema:reviewBody "My girlfriend told me of a movie she saw when she was little about a robot who starts killing people. She couldn't remember much of it but as I searched for it she kept telling me how much it impressed her... Obviously this is as with a lot of child's movie memories a film which is overromanticized but in actuality less good then you remember... Though after seeing it I was not really impressed it left me with some mixed feelings..GOOD FEELINGS Positive aspects of the film are in my opinion the idea behind it Kristy Swanson Wes Craven and the sometimes eerie music score by Charles Bernstein. Not really knowing what to expect the film's opening of a car thief being stopped by BB the robot made me laugh immediately. The movie made me sad in a way especially when BB gets blown to bits and the scenes with Kristy Swanson in her zombie form desperately longing for Matthew Laborteaux' love. Wes Craven's signature is all over the film. With some scary dream sequences I WAS scared when the father squirted blood all over the place while laughing like a madman and some sets which looked extremely familiar to me the cellar in which the father dies for instance did anyone else got flashbacks of A Nightmare on Elmstreet?BAD FEELINGS On the other hand there were numerous things which I found annoying. A at times very laughable plot a basketball as a murder weapon and most of all an extremely lousy ending... I've read that Wes Craven wasn't particularly happy with this wanting another ending and less mindless gore for gore but the President of Warner Bros. thought differently. Too bad as it doesn't do ANY good to the movie which could have been so much more...CONCLUDING Mixed feelings... Deadly Friend could have been a real cult classic but doesn't reach for it in my opinion. Though there are some memorable moments though the basketballmurder is absolutely ridiculous I'll probably remember it for the rest of my life and some good emotional moments how did I feel for poor Kristy Swanson. The BB robot is cute and you really feel sorry for Matthew Laborteaux when it gets destroyed but all this barely saves the movie. Though I do not blame Wes Craven who probably did everything he could to make the best of it Deadly Friend is JUST good enough... The ending is a real downer as it left me with disbelief and almost made me forget all the positive aspects of the film and I think the added gore doesn't add much to it as well... 5510!".

	onyx:emotionText "My girlfriend told me of a movie she saw when she was little about a robot who starts killing people. She couldn't remember much of it but as I searched for it she kept telling me how much it impressed her... Obviously this is as with a lot of child's movie memories a film which is overromanticized but in actuality less good then you remember... Though after seeing it I was not really impressed it left me with some mixed feelings..GOOD FEELINGS Positive aspects of the film are in my opinion the idea behind it Kristy Swanson Wes Craven and the sometimes eerie music score by Charles Bernstein. Not really knowing what to expect the film's opening of a car thief being stopped by BB the robot made me laugh immediately. The movie made me sad in a way especially when BB gets blown to bits and the scenes with Kristy Swanson in her zombie form desperately longing for Matthew Laborteaux' love. Wes Craven's signature is all over the film. With some scary dream sequences I WAS scared when the father squirted blood all over the place while laughing like a madman and some sets which looked extremely familiar to me the cellar in which the father dies for instance did anyone else got flashbacks of A Nightmare on Elmstreet?BAD FEELINGS On the other hand there were numerous things which I found annoying. A at times very laughable plot a basketball as a murder weapon and most of all an extremely lousy ending...

	schema:reviewBody "Deadly Friend is a largely unknown film from acclaimed director Wes Craven who became famous for movies like The Hills Have Eyes and The Last House on the Left. But if you give a chance to this thriller you will find something very original and scary...very scary!Deadly Friend is a genuinely frightening experience it has such a great story that catches you from the beginning to the end. First of all the plot is original and interesting  Deadly Friend isn't just another horror film it's in parts a love story and in others it works as an oldfashioned gripping thriller that would make Hitchcock or De Palma proud of. Paul is a new kid in town and he is a genius in computers and robots. He falls in love with the kind sweet and vulnerable girl next door Samantha but everything ends up bad when Samantha's abusive father kills her. The guy freaks out and steals Samantha's body. He uses all his knowledge in machines and computer chips and achieves to bring her back...as a killer robot!he takes her to his attic but she soon starts to kill the persons who used to humiliate her.The Cast the cast is great terrific performances are delivered by the main actors. Kirsty Swanson is outstanding as Samantha in the first hour of the film she is so sweet you may fall in love with her in the last hour she is scary as hell. She is an excellent young star and in certain ways she reminds a lot another great young actress Reese Witherspoon she has that quality of delivering truetolife real performances and like Reese she has an innocent beauty.Mathew Laborteaux makes a believable character Paul is a guy who isn't a bad kid he just is desperate to help the girl he loves but doesn't know how to deal with the consequences of his acts.The Director Wes Craven once again hits big time!this is one of his greatest films but it will be a surprise for his fans because instead of what they saw in The Hills Have Eyes and in most of Craven's films Deadly Friend isn't so violent. Of course you get some blood and guts here but the deaths are relative low. If you want to see a body count go rent Hellbound Hellraiser 2. Craven's goal here is that he sustains some kind of genuine suspense during the whole film with mastery something that just Alfred Hitchcok used to do well.The Story in just one word  OUTSTANDING!this is a different compelling story it's a gripping tale that mixes such elements like love and horror it's an appealing and charming material.If you want to watch something really good rent this great movie!here you will find suspense humor horror and love. It's a great job from great professionals!".

	schema:headline " Your typical midlate 80's comic horror flick from Wes Craven";
	schema:reviewBody "DEADLY FRIEND is written by Bruce Joel Rubin who has also written films like Deep Impact Mimi Leder 1998 and Ghost Jerry Zucker 1990. DEADLY FRIEND is directed by Wes Craven the horror maestro behind films like A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 The Serpent and the Rainbow 1988 and the 90's boxoffice hit Scream 1996. Craven has done many mediocre or even bad films and especially in the 1980's. Fortunately DEADLY FRIEND isn't among the worst ones.The film stars Matthew Laborteaux as teenager Paul who moves to a new town with his mother. Paul has a self made artificial intelligence robot called BB and he spends a lot of time with BB and even talks about its structure and other elements in the school for students. Soon he meets the neighbor Samantha played by Kristy Swanson. Samantha is abused by his father and BB is abused by their angry old lady neighbor who indeed looks like a nightmare on your street. Soon something happens to BB and something happens to Samantha and what our teen genius develops is something we've seen at least in Frank Henenlotter's trash classic Frankenhooker 1990 among many other more or less serious Frankenstein themed horror films.DEADLY FRIEND is little like Craven's other late 80's film Shocker 1989. Both films try to be teen drama horror and comedy at the same time and it is of course pretty difficult to achieve a totally satisfying result with so many ingredients. DEADLY FRIEND is surprisingly restrained and drama oriented and Samantha really becomes pretty sympathetic girl and the two central boys as well. They're not overthetop smiling and beautiful adolescents one can find from any of those disgusting Hollywood produced teen horrorsslashers that spawned after the success of Scream. In DEADLY FRIEND the teenagers are pretty natural and realistic and so they're easy to feel sympathy for.Craven has the talent to keep his tongue in cheek while directing these films just remember the outrageous finale in Shocker! and that helps a lot. He doesn't take himself too seriously and if he does it happens very rarely. DEADLY FRIEND makes me smile a lot but it's all intentional and I don't smile because I feel ashamed or sorry for the makers which is the case when a film really takes itself too seriously and becomes laughable. The outrageousness in DEADLY FRIEND is taken as far as possible in a Warner production like this when the infamous and often heard among horror fans basketball murder comes and I must say it feels quite gruesome in an otherwise lame and harmless film like this. The gore in that brief but memorable scene is close to that of Tom Savini's in films like Maniac William Lustig 1980 and The Prowler aka Rosemary's Killer Joseph Zito 1982. I kind of doubt would this film get an R rating nowadays.The main problem in DEADLY FRIEND is that it is too straightforward and has huge holes and easy solutions in its plot and screenplay. When writer Rubin decides they're going to do something it just happens and there are no problems at all as if they were completely alone in the city the hospital and so on. Also the Samantha's father is totally unnecessary as a character. He is there completely in vain and the violence he commits towards his daughter without any motive or explanation feels quite tasteless and unnecessary in a film like this. Samantha's fate could have been arranged without the character of her father and definitely ten times more satisfyingly and with a more noteworthy result and final film.The shock epilogue we could expect from Craven is this time very effective and really has to be seen to be believed. It is as shocking and surprising as the ending in Elm Street but I would say it is even more gruesome and even surreal this time. The effects required for that ending are handled fine as well as throughout the whole film. The BB robot is quite nice and never irritating. The result which comes after Paul's operation on BB and Samantha is very close to that of Henenlotter's Frankenhooker and they both are equally demented!DEADLY FRIEND isn't as great and noteworthy horror comedy as it very well could have been in the hands of this director but still I prefer this over Shocker for instance but this is far away from the masterpieces Elm Street Serpent etc. of the director. I give DEADLY FRIEND 410 and will watch out those basketballs for sure.".

Although the undertone of Deadly Friend is downright comic there are quite a lot gruesome moments and bloody sequences.

Wes Craven makes good horror movies. He did a great job with this movie. It's really worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now we know where Johnathan Davis of Korn gets his inspiration for the strange animallike sounds he makes  from B.B. the robot!I caught this movie on TV in the late 80's. It's a pretty nightmarish disturbing movie because of the different emotions involved but it's not so annoying as some movies where the dream sequences just tick you off. You feel for boy genius and understand the lines he crosses. Things are pretty happy throughout the beginning of the film. Then boy genius Paul gets his first kiss from Samantha one fateful night which happens to be the same night Samantha is killed by her abusive alcoholic father. You know this has to be traumatizing for Paul who will probably never have such a grand opportunity to have a girlfriend in his nerdy lifetime. So Paul devises a plan to bring Samantha back to life by putting B.B. the robot's computer chip in her brain it's a movie go with it. The plan works but there's a catch. Samantha is a palefaced vegetable who moves like a robot. This is pretty disturbing to me since you know Paul wants her like she was before but things sure aren't the same. In a sense this movie is very much like Stephen King's Pet Sematary and sometimes dead IS better...While resurrected Samantha goes on a killing spree avenging her death as well as B.B. the robot's via the basketball scene! Paul tries to hide Samantha's wicked ways. It's emotionally tugging. Can you imagine if you were trying to hide that you know something about the deaths of people around you? It's gotta be stressful for Paul.Finally things get too far out of hand. Samantha is shot by the police and laid to rest during a dramatic scene when it appears she is finally turning into her normal self. I would have thought they'd lock Paul up after all of this  nope. Paul goes back for more! I think the ending is great! Though unrealistic the ending is a good emotionally sucker punch to cap it all off. It's a good movie to watch by yourself when you can't sleep hehe.".

It's a coming of age story mixed with elements of Frankenstein and it really does for one reason or another work surprisingly well. A young boy moves to a new town with his mother and falls head over heels for the girl next door. Unfortunately this girl has an abusive father right out of an after school special and things turn tragic when he accidentally kills her. Not being able to let her rest in peace the young boy uses his brilliant mind to replace her brain with a robot brain and things of course don't go as planned. One can feel that Craven was forced to bloody things up a bit for Deadly Friend. After all this was his next big film after A Nightmare on Elm Street and I'm sure the studio wanted a hard R film to capitalize on that film's success. This makes some of the bigger gorier set pieces feel a bit out of place in what is otherwise a charming and sweet family horror film. I could imagine it being PG with a few small trims here and there which I feel must have been Craven's original intention. Besides these small nitpicks Deadly Friend is a charming slice of 80's horror that's worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it has very over the top plot and some scenes are both crazy and funny but it's still one of my fave movies ever. For very long time now i am huge fan of it and i don't care about all the crap i might get i'm not gonna change my opinion.I know this movie has lot of problems with mixed direction and forced horror scenes but i don't think that it's as bad as some of the Craven's other work like Hills Have Eyes 2. And it's important to know that most of the problems that Deadly Friend has is not because of the director but because of the Warner Bros studio. But getting back to the movieScreenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin did a good job with script even though it's somewhat obvious that some of it was changed and added because of studio requests. Rubin also wrote scripts for two great movies from 1990 Jacob's Ladder which i am a huge fan of and Ghost.As for movie i think that actors did a good job with their roles script works for about 90 of the movie heyi have to be honest right? horror atmosphere is quite good jump scares are sometimes predictable but they work gore scenes were not really needed more on that later but even though some are laughable i think that they are actually well done with solid makeup effects and infamous basketball kill is definitely one of the funniest kills ever and one of the best head explosions i ever saw in movie along with the ones in Scanners Maniac and Prowler. Nightmare scenes from movie are often called stupid but i think that they were quite creepy to be honest specially one where Sam dreams about killing her dad. Hey if Wes Craven is directing a nightmare scene then you know it's a good one.Some people would probably disagree with me but i think that ending at least first part of it is quite sad. But that second part with ultra stupid and idiotic she's a robot! ending is one thing that i absolutely hate.After doing some research i found out that movie was originally very different then what was released. It was originally meant to be more of a love story then horror but producers from Warner Bros had different ideas and Craven was told to make the movie bloodier. I think that it's damn shame. If all gore was taken out movie would still be solid horror and with like they originally wanted interesting and dark love story.You can actually see that there was more to this film with the romance subplot and few of those scenes between Paul and Sam after she's been brought back to life are very well done both by director and actors. And i'm not talking about scenes when he tries to hide her or when he runs into the murder scene i'm talking about scenes like when Sam is looking at photos of her and Paul and when she shows him one of those photos. Movie would probably benefit more from those scenes and original cut probably did have more of that.Instead what we got is movie that jumps from kids horror to usual over the top 80's horror. More serious subjects that it touches like child abuse are almost overshadowed with gore scenes that really don't feel like they fit anywhere.I can see why Craven and Rubin disowned the movie which is too bad cause i would really like to see how different original version was before they had to changed it. I'm a sucker for movies that have been tempered with in post production from one reason or another so maybe that's one of the reasons why i appreciate this movie for what it could have been or for what it originally was.I know that i'm probably one of the few fans that this movie has but either way i still love it and i would recommend it to everyone who are interested in entertaining fun horror movie.".

Although after settling in tragedy hits hard when during a Halloween prank his paranoid neighbour across the street shoots BB to pieces and his good friend  neighbour Samantha falls victim to her father's alcoholic rage which leaves her in a coma. Deciding there's nothing they can do they decide to turn off the life support but Paul plans to steal her body and place BeeBee's computer chip in her brain. Sure thing it worked but she isn't who she uses to be.Oh Wes what were you thinking? Now what to make of it. Yep it's feebly dumb but slightly diverting with a few memorable scenes and not much else. Well I guess I would be lying if I didn't add Kristy Swanson to being one of the draw cards. Her robotic turn where she's brought back to life was facetiously done.Taken from the novel Friend by Diana Henstall this starts off like a Short Circuit ripoff than transforms into a modern day Frankenstein retelling. Craven really overplays his hand in overplotting the film with elements of a family drama with moralistic babble which then suddenly skyrockets into cheesy daftness and steers it into horror territory with mostly minor results. The simple story feels sparse with many redundant avenues that dig many more holes in the unbelievable developments and flawed material. Circulating through the flick is an easygoing sense of humour that fits in naturally well. It never really takes itself far too seriously and oh the infamous basketball decapitation is a real scenestealer and purely a riot. What else is a scenestealer has got to be the film's enticing gimmick BB the robot. Although at times I didn't know what the heck it was mumbling about but it was a likable inclusion nonetheless. You should listen to the catchy or maybe drawn out tune that plays over the credits for a chuckle.Mechanically dicey direction by Craven lends the film to have quite a languid pace and junky set pieces with wilted suspense. Despite some effectively unpleasant jolts and the use of splatter it just feels like they have thrown a spanner the mix in hoping it would take off. Instead it's pretty much a hasty and fumbled attempt. This goes for the daftly incompetent climax which leads to a hopelessly idiotic if unpredictable conclusion. The soaring music score in the film strangely has energy and roughly tugs on the emotional chords. The performances were handled in a tolerable manner. The young cast Kristy Swanson Matthew Laborteaux and Michael Sharrett are sound in their roles and never let the overall silliness affect their performances. Anne Twomey was pleasantly engaging as Paul's mother and Anne Ramsey is superb as the stingy neighbour Elvira.This was a lean period for Craven and it shows up here in this pretty middling offbeat failure. Not his worst but it's not too far from the bottom. But better was to come with the voodoo horror piece The Serpent and the Rainbow.".

Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is better than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular.

Unfortunately she now seemingly has the robot's personality and that isn't too good.  All the deaths you see coming though the one with the basketball is rather good in fact the highlight of this overly predictable movie.

When the horror started to kick in I loved the fact that it was so 'tounge in cheek' and was able to mix laughs with gore. I agree with the statements that it is a laughable film but I feel it makes it that much more special as it doesn't take itself too seriously and therefore becomes a pleasure to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh where do I start? I remember catching this on television at some ungodly hour a few years ago. From the beginning it screamed crappy 80s horror film but the plot was so strange I couldn't turn it off.Here's the basic idea it's been a while remember.... Paul and his family have just moved to town and he has no friends. That's because he just moved in but also because he's a child prodigy that spends his time performing brain surgery and building robots.Paul's only friend is a robot he created named B.B.. By today's standards B.B. is laughably primitive and at the same time impossibly advanced. See Paul's so intelligent that he bases the brains of his robots on the human mind so even though B.B. looks like a clunky cheap barelymobile toy from the deepest darkest part of the 80s it's highly intelligent.Anyway Paul gets picked on at school and is pitied only by a pretty girl named Samantha who decides to be nice to him just like in real life. Everything looks good until some bullies try to break B.B. and instead shortcircuit him. Paul gets B.B. to run but something is not quite right with our school busyellow rotund mechanical friend. And then the movie gets REALLY ridiculous.Paul is forced to dismantle B.B. because of angry neighbors or something. Later Samantha's abusive father kills her and Paul devastated by the loss of his young crush decides that he can reanimate her BY PUTTING B.B.'S MAIN CHIP IN HER HEAD. No power source is required nothing like theat. Just a trip to the morgue a little surgery and Samantha is as good as new. Except for her complete lack of emotion and her odd mechanical movements. Paul keeps her in his garage because you know Samantha's supposed to be dead and everything but she starts committing acts of revenge against anyone who mistreated Paul Sam or the robot itself.Like the other reviews mention there are only three good things about this movie The scene in which roboSamantha decapitates a mean old woman with a basketball I'm not a big horror fan but that was too cool and odd to ignoreThe fact that the role of the mean old woman is played by that mean old woman from GooniesKeeping in mind the material she had to work with Kristy Swanson does a good jobI realize I've summarized most of the plot but I'm not going to give away the ending... it's too hilariously out there. You just have to see it.So yeah Deadly Friend is a silly movie from a decade that gave us a lot of silly movies but it's a decent way to kill some time if only for a few scenes and laughs.I said there was something horrifying about Deadly Friend and I wasn't lying just saving the best for last the screenplay was written by the same guy who penned the screenplay to JACOB'S LADDER one of the finest films I have ever seen!".

	schema:headline " Obsessive ambitious flawed...and thoroughly fascinating!";
	schema:reviewBody "All right all right so Un Flic is flawed and not on the same level as Le Samoura  but then how many films are? Yes it's flawed obsessive ambitious made by an artist who was on top of the world after a succession of critical and boxoffice hits and probably felt like risking more  and he did! It's also unique mesmerizing to be watched over and over again. And as always with Melville it's cinema in its purest most uncompromising form.Un Flic was Melville's last film made one year before his sudden fatal heart attack. It's ambitious all right it stars France's top stars of the 1970s Alain Delon and Catherine Deneuve she in a supporting role at a time when she NEVER did supporting roles and for the first time  probably with an eye on the US market  Melville uses an American star Richard Crenna who delivers his lines in absolutely fluent French though postdubbed for accent reasonsTalk about ambition and risk Melville includes not one but TWO 20 minutelong nodialog nomusic heist scenes! The first one at the bank by the rainy seashore is a masterpiece of efficiency and atmosphere. Sadly the second one with the helicoptertrain is THE major flaw of the film with its phony Thunderbirdlike miniature models especially difficult to accept in these our times of eyepopping CGI effects. It's also too long it should have stayed out though one can argue that it's probably the bestlitminiaturemodelheistscene ever filmed!The plot in Un Flic is a pretext to present the duel between the two complex male characters Alain Delon's ideal cop made in Noir Heaven and Richard Crenna's mastermindthiefposingascharmingnightclubowner. They're on opposite sides but Melville wants us to notice their similarities their striking physical resemblance they could be brothers their camaraderie Delon can only relax at Crenna's classy joint their sharing the same woman Deneuve. They're both cool elegant efficient gentlemen who use violence only as a last resource though the violence here is implicit with hardly a drop of blood in view unlike bloodbath fiends and pseudo Melville fans Scorsese Tarantino and Woo. They're both art connoisseurs and sensitive to beauty Crenna goes to the Louvre admires Van Gogh's selfportrait and wears top fashion Delon plays jazz on the piano proficiently dresses impeccably for a cop and recognizes a Maillol sculpture when he sees one. But they can also be tough as hell Crenna doesn't blink when he plans the death of his wounded sidekick at the hospital and Delon coldly waits for a man to commit suicide instead of preventing it.Tough as they are they're surprisingly openminded when it comes to sex Delon treats the robbed old homosexual and his teenage loverthief with unflappable professionalism and even politeness and is perfectly aware of the transvestite informer's crush on him the transvestite's makeup and hair color resemble Deneuve's insinuations galore. And in a revealing silent scene at the bar we can tell that the Deneuvesharing is not an issue yet. But in Melville's world affinities friendship and modern sexual morals collapse when the code of honor between males is broken. Delon is OK with gay people and mnagestroi but not with Crenna betraying his trust and fooling him professionally. The Melville code comes from Westerns and Samurai movies the price of betrayal is death. When Delon realizes he's been doublecrossed there's no place for mercy or compromise in his heart revenge is the only way out AND he has the law on his side.A word about the acting perhaps Delon doesn't seem very excited to play a cop  who does?  but his last 15 minutes are simply magnificent just watch his face at the bar when he realizes Crenna is lying it melts down with painful disillusion. And in the last scene over the closing credits he drives his car drained of all life he's broken inside terribly lonely an empty carcass. Crenna is subtle and properly sympathetic cophater Melville clearly wants us to root for him. Apparently Deneuve is there just to parade her amazing beauty but check out the hospital coup de grce scene no angel of death was ever colder blonder more efficient or gorgeous. It makes us think once again what a shame she never worked for Hitchcock!The visual pleasures in Un Flic are so many that multiple viewings are required the elegant decors the fabulous cars that silver Jaguar! the chic wardrobe and the city of Paris at its most stunning. There's a telling scene at the Louvre where Melville seems to be comparing himself to the great impressionists his camera lingers on a painting with a very similar palette as his own icy blues pale gris cold grays. It's a coup de vanit from a man who  like the greatest visual artists  managed to create an instantly recognizable world of his own through his obsessive themes unique visual expression and fabulous technique.The only way you can dislike Un Flic is if you're addicted to hyperactive loud chopped films if you can appreciate moderatopaced subtlety and unique visual sophistication you can do no wrong with this film. Melville's flawed work towers over thousands of brainless spineless bloody thrillers  after all Un Flic is signed by the one and only King of Cool. Enjoy enjoy enjoy.".

But in Melville's world affinities friendship and modern sexual morals collapse when the code of honor between males is broken. Delon is OK with gay people and mnagestroi but not with Crenna betraying his trust and fooling him professionally. The Melville code comes from Westerns and Samurai movies the price of betrayal is death. When Delon realizes he's been doublecrossed there's no place for mercy or compromise in his heart revenge is the only way out AND he has the law on his side.A word about the acting perhaps Delon doesn't seem very excited to play a cop  who does?  but his last 15 minutes are simply magnificent just watch his face at the bar when he realizes Crenna is lying it melts down with painful disillusion. And in the last scene over the closing credits he drives his car drained of all life he's broken inside terribly lonely an empty carcass. Crenna is subtle and properly sympathetic cophater Melville clearly wants us to root for him. Apparently Deneuve is there just to parade her amazing beauty but check out the hospital coup de grce scene no angel of death was ever colder blonder more efficient or gorgeous. It makes us think once again what a shame she never worked for Hitchcock!The visual pleasures in Un Flic are so many that multiple viewings are required the elegant decors the fabulous cars that silver Jaguar! the chic wardrobe and the city of Paris at its most stunning. There's a telling scene at the Louvre where Melville seems to be comparing himself to the great impressionists his camera lingers on a painting with a very similar palette as his own icy blues pale gris cold grays. It's a coup de vanit from a man who  like the greatest visual artists  managed to create an instantly recognizable world of his own through his obsessive themes unique visual expression and fabulous technique.The only way you can dislike Un Flic is if you're addicted to hyperactive loud chopped films if you can appreciate moderatopaced subtlety and unique visual sophistication you can do no wrong with this film. Melville's flawed work towers over thousands of brainless spineless bloody thrillers  after all Un Flic is signed by the one and only King of Cool. Enjoy enjoy enjoy.";

This puts them on a par with most of the cops and perhaps illustrates Melville's epigraph from pioneer French private eye and former thief Franois Eugne Vidocq The only emotion men awaken in a policeman are ambiguity and derision.

If it's true as Jack Mathews of the Daily News wrote about the reissued Le Cercle rouge that Melville's crime movies are really about wearing raincoats and lighting up Gitanes and saying very little while being very loyal then plot inconsistencies and even visual disparities not withstanding it's still all good.

There are elements that seem to have evolved or devolved whichever you prefer in Melville's work with the three films going in descending order Le Samourai Le Cercle Rouge and finally this film. As this very loose trilogy progresses a trilogy I mark just by the presence of Alain Delon nothing more in common aside from the genre one may notice how Melville progresses with his stylizing how with each film he goes a little less with characterization and dialog. With Le Samourai it's half a character study in Le Cercle Rouge there are snippets here it's all based on the timing of the cuts and subtle reactions. In fact there is so much of the film that goes without dialog that Melville proves himself to be an opposite of Tarantino instead of being clever at dialog he's clever at the plot twist and more importantly at making note of the 'leftout' detail letting the audience figure it out. While one can say this is not a great place for someone not familiar with Melville's work to start it should not be a big disappointment.The story is one you may have seen before only here in far more calculated circumstances. Simon Richard Crenna in one of his better turns is one of four who rob a seaside bank on a rainy foggy afternoon. In one of Melville's most polished sequences things go good and bad for them when one of the men is fatally wounded. Edouard Coleman Alain Delon not his best but always keen at being icy is on a case that coincides with another scheme Simon has involving a suitcase heist on a moving train during the night. Not everything goes as planned and the presence of a mutual love interest for the two Catherine Deneuve practically onesided emotionally only complicates things further if not on the surface. This story is told very very simply and without anything aside from the injection of mood onto every scene.From the opening heist on Melville still has his chops technicallywise almost all the way through the picture. And after reading an interview with him something about the look of the film made sense which he said before this film was made My dream is to make a color film in black and white in which there is only one tiny detail to remind us that we really are watching a film in color. One feels that is what Melville is successfully experimenting with in this film that the methods to which he and cinematographer Walter Wottizm get the scenes are not conventional. To correspond with some of the characters the colors are cold or distant corresponding almost to the unforgiving underworld of Paris some colors seem to almost blend together the browns going along with the grays and the brighter ones sometimes merely in the background feeling diluted. That and the crafty editing pulled by Patricia Neny the suspense gets laid on thick in some scenes make up for a couple of big liabilities that Melville on tight a budget that he was on used models for the exteriors of the train sequence and some scenes don't have a 'newwave' feeling i.e. filmed directly on location but rather cheaply in the studio. Not to mention that the performances from Delon and Deneuve are not really at their peak Crenna is another matter.Still the most pleasurable thing about a Melville film whether its the poetic Les Enfants Terribles or the bittersweet Bob le Flambeur is watching the story take on a life of its own. Some things you practically wait on if you've seen Le Cercle Rouge or Le Samourai like a wild dancing number at a nightclub here abridged or a detail to remind everyone who the outsiders are in this world here portrayed by Gaby. As another tribute to the oldstyle crime films of the 30's and 40's its still tightly held together with the pacing almost impeccable. In short it's not a masterpiece of a crime film Melville's last before his fatal heart attack but it remains gripping thirty plus years later with memorable qualities.".

	schema:reviewBody "Un Flic translated as A Cop but rather known in English as Dirty Money is essentially cool guy movie about man's men who are cops or robbers who smoke cigarettes hang out in bars do cool poses with guns and wear cool suits. But it is among the cream of that particular crop and the reason is its stylistic subtlety and storytelling economy. It is not a featurelength music video like the Guy Ritchie films or an epic patchwork of references like those of Quentin Tarantino. It is utterly confident in its simplicity.Plenty hold that master French crime filmmaker JeanPierre Melville had reached his pinnacle long before this his last film and he definitely did. But Un Flic plays exquisitely with all his signature muteness austere faces and bleak colors. Cinematographer Walter Wottitz eschews gloomy soliloquies and melodramatic dialogue for his steely color treatment. What few colors that do breeze in appear to exhale from the poignant grays. The characters barely speak most conspicuously during the movie's twentyminute intrepid train robbery sequence in which the robber is dropped onto a moving train via helicopter performs the robbery and gets back on. The film spotlights two strikingly constructed heists the other one in a bank. The first is the holdup of an isolated Riviera smalltown seacoast bank. Melville painstakingly films the unlawful act and how it goes awry when a ballsy teller declines to be robbed without a fight.Melville's moody idiosyncratic swan song is an ascetic inkling of the young though despondent headstrong Paris police chief played by a volatile willful Alain Delon who is going after bank robbers and a drugsmuggling ring among his everyday quota of crimes to which he has grown apathetic. But these two crimes as he discovers later on are link and affect his personal life. The gang leader is indeed his counterpart Richard Crenna an underhanded nightclub owner he became acquainted with while having a prevalent liaison with his coldly gorgeous wife Catherine Deneuve. She shows no fervor for either of her lovers the impervious ice queen. Crenna plays the civil competitor with played by Crenna with the chivalrous air of a frequenter of coffee shops and theatres. Deneuve plays her character as someone not interested in dividing her lovers by good and bad but by charming or tedious. And Delon remains Melville's trademark tenacious individualist.It's a dismally ambient film noir with Melville linking his characters to the quiet panorama around them as it is set in a neonlit moist city outlook of despairing crooks who are getting old and need one last score to go out with dignity. Police brutality is understood casually as a truth of life as are doublecrosses among thieves. The film is shot in minimalist style with the dialogue and the sets being scant but not rawboned. Melville was a man of simple tastes but idealistic zealous philosophical tastes at that. Un Flic or Dirty Money held my engrossment all through with a feeling of a dreamlike serenity before the brewing outburst.".

Police brutality is understood casually as a truth of life as are doublecrosses among thieves. The film is shot in minimalist style with the dialogue and the sets being scant but not rawboned. Melville was a man of simple tastes but idealistic zealous philosophical tastes at that. Un Flic or Dirty Money held my engrossment all through with a feeling of a dreamlike serenity before the brewing outburst.";

	schema:reviewBody "Career criminals wear fedoras and trenchcoats like its 1945 and they're attending a Robert Mitchum impersonation competition. Rain isn't weather it's sexytime music for a cocaine heist. The world is covered in an uncompromising azure mist that squeezes the life out of every possibility of beauty whether that beauty is reaching Catherine Deneuve's white blonde demeanor or an enticingly French city street. A JeanPierre Melville directed crime film rests in a middleground of romanticization and adamant realism it climaxes at the nearest sight of a Humphrey Bogart photograph but it's also interested in telling a story where a robbery can be delivered with seamless perfection ... but that doesn't mean that a pessimistic cop won't catch up with you in the end in a hazardously bloody fashion. Un Flic is a relatively minor Melville film especially putting Bob le Flambeur and Le Cercle Rouge into consideration but it's ravishing all the same. Like the problematic comprehensibility of The Big Sleep it isn't worried about tight narrative. It's about temperament and atmosphere and it's safe to say that the ambiance of Un Flic is penetrative enough to make your bones break. There's something uneasy that leaks from the ghost blue of the cinematography and Richard Crenna's depressed eyes the placid slickness of it all can only reach so far before someone is shot. Telling the interconnecting stories of a tireless cop Alain Delon and a nightclub owner Crenna who pulls off massively intricate jobs with big payoffs Un Flic is squalid enough to make us squirm criminals walk right under the noses of the police while the police as wellmeaning as they are are confined to a purgatory of lawbreaking with payoffs that brings no one pleasure. In so many other crime films there's a notion that once the main villains are locked up the heroes are left satisfied ready for their next big adventure. But Un Flic exists in an entirely different universe. The chasing and capturing of criminals is tiring redundant even. Who is having more fun the sinners or the rule followers?Initially the film seems as though it's going to transform into a full fledged exercise in film noir style. Cigarettes are tossed around liquor is spilled and femme fatales are easy to come by. But the closer we get to the conclusion we begin to realize something Delon's character Edouard Coleman isn't a James Bond or a Frank Bullitt or a Harry Callahan. He is a man a man who was intrigued by enforcing the law many moons ago but is finally growing restless from the unavoidable sleazy details he sees on a day to day basis. Behind his eyes is a glassy emptiness if he were to throw away his badge this very moment what difference would it make?I suppose Un Flic's melancholy edge is what gives it such a lasting impression. The story is too complicated to easily follow and the style is one and the same with Melville's other films. But that blue that blue is disturbing. Unlike blackandwhite it gives reality a grit never seen by the naked eye. Crime doesn't pay and don't we know it but in Un Flic even renowned actors like Alain Delon and Catherine Deneuve can hardly live in a world this hopeless.".

	schema:headline " Fashion and architecture";
	schema:reviewBody "For a police thriller this movie chose the strange angles of architecture and fashion from which to tell the story. Throughout the film actively tries to showcase a new modern France. In the weird opening sequence we see a seaside resort with an endless row of brandnew apartment blocks totally void of human presence in a foul winterweather. Strangely from afar a shop in one of the buildings seem open. Because of the abundant lighting we might be tempted to think it's a bar but it's a bank about to be robbed. The police headquarters is another modern building given lots of cameraattention by Melville who seems to juxtapose this 'new' France to the old the contrasts with scenes of the 'old Paris' such as the closing scenes at the Arc de Triomphe are great.The male characters seem to spend an inordinate amount of time to groom their looks. Both Alain Delon and the excellent bad guy Richard Crenna Simon are given lengthy shots showing them combing their hair. They parade around in flawless suits slick ties lush bathrobes gold cuff links. These are sharp dressed men vain and selfobsessed misogynist and gaybashing. The gorgeous cancan girls are there like in so many other Melville movies but noone seems to notice them. Delon manipulates a beautiful transvestite into thinking he might fall for her charms only to beat her up when she fails to deliver on a promise.Catherine Deneuve on the other hand seems less well served sartorially speaking I was not very impressed with her acting performance in this film but perhaps my judgment is influenced by the ugly earrings she wears throughout. The closing titles highlight that the black dress worn by 'Mademoiselle Deneuve' was by Yves Saint Laurent. I don't know why this was pointed out since the dress is hideous. Deneuve's finest moment was when she plays an angel of death wearing a haute couture caricature of the nurse uniform. Quentin Tarantino must have been directly inspired by this to create Daryl Hannah's nurse look when she is set to murder Uma Thurman at the start of Kill Bill vol 1.All in all the plot was not that interesting but since the male actors were all in terrific form it was a very pleasurable movie to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Dirty Money' was JeanPierre Melville's last movie and many people find it to be a great disappointment. Me I quite like it. Sure it isn't the masterpiece we'd all wish it to be but it's definitely worth watching. Alain Delon the star of Melville's 'Le Samourai' regarded by most fans as Melville's best movie along with 'Bob Le Flambeur' plays Coleman a detached cop who is having an affair with his friend Simon's girlfriend Catherine Deneuve. Simon Richard Crenna is actually a thief the leader of a small three man team. We see them commit two robberies one is a bank near the sea in the brilliant opening sequence the other an ambitious heist on a train involving a helicopter. This scene isn't as exciting as it should have been with budgetary constraints letting Melville down. The first robbery is a real stand out however and I recommend 'Dirty Money' for this if nothing else. The movie's dialogue and characterization are very minimalistic and this is probably the main reason why many find it to be unsatisfying. The relationship between the three main characters is never explained or explored. Neither is the Coleman's with his informant a beautiful transsexual. Melville doesn't spell things out the viewer has to do the hard work but I don't mind that at all. 'Dirty Money' is far from Melville's best but I still think there's a lot to admire about it. Melville is an acknowledged influence on Truffaut Jarmusch Woo Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson and his movies deserve to be better known.".

In time their lines of work will shake their friendship like nothing else not even Coleman's affair with Simon's wife Cathy Catherine Deneuve.Un flic A Cop also known as Dirty Money is a film about the dehumanizing nature of police work. Coleman is suave but conflicted willing to slap around a suspect or even a suspected suspect but not so hardened as not to be conflicted about that.This job makes us skeptical his deputy Morand Paul Crauchet notes as the pair leave a morgue.Especially about skepticism Coleman replies.Director JeanPierre Melville was a leading light of the New Wave movement and his commitment to impressionistic pure cinema is on strong display right at the outset. We open on the sound of crashing waves filling the screen with blue. The car with Simon and the other robbers moves slowly into position. With rain crashing around them on an empty street three of the four men wordlessly get out in turn to take their positions in the bank.A short but portentous scene is played out through their eyes. Simon's are committed but apprehensive. The old pro who joins him first Marc Albouis Andr Pousse reads cool and empty. In the car a former bank manager named Paul Ricardo Cucciolla hesitates while the driver Louis Michael Conrad looks at him hard. You can see the fear in Paul's eyes as he reluctantly leaves the vehicle to play his part.What is up with this scene? It features four French robbers only one of whom is actually played by a Frenchman. Here and in many other ways Melville was clearly doing things his way establishing meticulous realism in some scenes only to abandon it in others most notably in a later train heist which features some fine suspense work but was clearly filmed with models.The weakest element for me in this movie is not the Tyco episode itself but how it is integrated into the rest of the film. We have little idea how the train heist is being done or why it leads to the final act the way it does. Yet its aftermath proves central to everything by which time Melville is giving us not riddles but koans.Though employing real locations and realtime sequences Melville doesn't seem nearly as interested in telling a solid crime story with motives and meanings laid out. His film like the dialogue sprinkled through it remains elliptical all the way through.We're doomed victims the prey of actual pros is something a blackmailed homosexual tells Coleman which serves as a kind of motif for the film. I don't think Un flic sells the idea as well as it thinks. If Coleman is a victim it's of his own hard code.But Un flic keeps you watching and makes you think. And while casting an American as the lead crook and another as his key partner seems a strange conceit dubbed as they necessarily are both Crenna and Conrad make it work playing their parts with the same elegant drabness that underscores every scene. Crenna's Simon is one character you come to care about if only a little. Delon may be a trifle too mopey but makes for an enigmatic center.As a crime story it's pretty decent. As a cinematic tone poem it's much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Un Flic is a French gangster caper film with many intriguing qualities. Visually it is really interesting. The color choices demand repeated viewing. I like how there are seldom light colors seen except for Deneuve's platinum hair and the smuggled cocaine. The muted color scheme generates a lot of gritty atmosphere to help draw you into Melville's nightmarish vision.The plot is difficult to follow. I'm not really sure about several key points. For example police officer chief? Coleman Alain Delon learns the name of the gangster the others had killed in a hospital. From that piece of information they quickly trap the driverhelicopter pilot at a restaurant? Also with the physically imposing driverpilot in police custody how does Coleman manage to break his spirit sufficiently to nab the rest of the gang? Torture would be needed but no information is supplied to confirm it was used.Much has been said about the obviously fake model train and helicopter that Melville shows for the second heist scene. I'm fine with it. Gosh only knows how much it would cost to lease a train a helicopter and pilots for a day. The relationship between Delon's Coleman and Richard Crenna's Simon is a major theme. Coleman is a worldweary and cynical policeman who will employ brutal methods to solve crimes. Simon is an energetic and brave gangsterbank robber. Coleman is more romantically interesting to Catherine Deneuve's Cathy. However Simon's courage during heist 2 probably wins the audience over. At the film's end we tend to like Simon more than Coleman.Deneuve's Cathy is one of the richest small roles in screen memory. She's not on the screen for many minutes but when she is Cathy is a devastatingly enthralling femme fatale.For a gritty Hellish view of police and crime life with three strong performances along with a few toy trains and a helicopter 'Un Flic' is One Crime Flick worth seeing.".

Delon lacks his usual presence and appears to be on autopilot in total contrast to Le Cercle Rouge and Le Samourai it's a competent performance but I've rarely seen an actor look so bored.  Perhaps he was unsure about the almost total lack of dialogue in the film which is a shame as this is one of its few interesting plus points.  Many of the scenes take place against obviously painted studio backdrops which is especially grating given that the opening is so well done.  And most laughably of all the highlight of the film a daring robbery in real time in which a thief is dropped from a helicopter onto a moving train and then picked up again is done with models and looks like an amateurish version of Thunderbirds.If someone could steal the opening sequence or 'reference' it and do the helicopter robbery properly there's a good remake waiting to be done.

However Marc is seriously wounded and they leave him in a clinic after hiding the money in a sophisticated scheme. Meanwhile the cold Police Inspector Edouard Coleman Alain Delon is investigating the murder of a woman and his informer the travesty Gaby Valrie Wilson tells about a shipment of heroin carried by the mule Suitcase Matthew Lon Minisini by the train to Lisbon. Then Coleman heads to a nightclub owned by Simon who is his friend to meet his mistress Cathy Catherine Deneuve. When Simon learns that the police force is tracking down the wounded thief in hospitals and clinics and the dragnet will certainly find Marc he goes with the gang and Cathy to kill him. Then Simon plots the robbery of Matthew's drug in the train using a helicopter. When Coleman intercepts Matthew he does not find the drug shipment and believes that Gaby is not giving good information to him. But when Coleman discover that Marc Albouis is dead he connects him to Louis Costa and then to the unemployed middleaged banker Paul Weber and Simon. They bug Simon's telephone and Soleman heads to confront his friend. Un Flic a.k.a. Dirty Money is a gritty police story and last movie by JeanPierre Melville. The story is cold with few dialogs and the bank and train robberies are very well detailed through long scenes. Inspector Edouard Coleman is an emotionless character near the thin line between right and wrong. He sees his investigation of drugs entwining with the bank heist and the leader of the gang is his friend. Further Coleman and Simon share the same mistress that is capable to kill a man injecting air in his vein and this weird threesome seems to affect his last attitude. My vote is six.Title Brazil Expresso para Bordeaux Express Train to Bordeaux".

Not long ago I bought the 6 DVD set of his flicks from 1956  1972. All masterful but this is the one I keep coming back to and I do think I think of it as a pinnacle of his metier.What does Melville mean by invoking Ambiguity and Derision over the opening credits ? It's as though he's talking to himself all through the narrative from beginning to end. The initial scene is one of the most hypnotic I've ever seen. Charged with palpable palpitating tension yet at the same time unnervingly surrealistic  not Dali more reminiscent of Magritte or Giorgio de Chirico  it leaves Hitchcock standing in the suspense stakes.The action begins with the Mystery and Melancholy of a Street. It is virtually certainly the Esplanade de la Mer on France's Atlantic western coastline abutting the Bay of Biscay known throughout history as a stormy quarter of the ocean. That esplanade is near St Jean de Monts between Brest and Bordeaux and not far from La RochesurYon. Nowadays there's a golf course just north of St Jean de Monts. The names of these real places are supplied by the cinematography. Realistic surreality is also supplied by the vast condominium block presumably only just completed in 1971 and still unoccupied. Although there was perhaps one inhabited window.The fagend of the day's weird financial activity in the corner BNP not the British Nazi Party of course bankshop is bizarre. Who are these glum people executing enigmatic transactions ? Where do they live ? How did they get to be there on what appears to be one of early January's most miserable afternoons ? It's riveting.Skip now to the sequence on which so many have hanged themselves up. This is the insanely planned and impeccably executed robbery from a suitcase minded on a moving train by Bagman Matthieu of a large number of plastic packages filled with a powdery white substance. All film plots are completely phony riddled with holes but except for here they fake reality. Melville however is deliberately saying that he knows you ought to know it's completely ridiculous take a good long very long look at the dinky toys the Hornby train set the plastic manikin. Verfremdungseffekt as one perceptive commentator puts it. Why ? But then why not ? It's just a movie. Think about it. Flickering images in two dimensions.What a phenomenal masterpiece this film is. You can see it must be when you read the numerous failed reviews. Here's something for chewing on By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and 'fictive' qualities of the medium the viewer is alienated from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the action as mere 'entertainment.' Instead the viewer is forced into a critical analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse him of the notion that what he is watching is necessarily an inviolable selfcontained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it teaches the viewer not to take the style and content for granted since the medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions. Why use five words when fifty will do ?".

He seemed to do everything to get caught by the police and then the movie ended in contrived fatalism. I hadn't seen such sloppy storytelling and characterization in a while.Were it not for JeanPierre Melville's technical skills I wouldn't have bothered with Un Flic. Fortunately Melville's visual style appealed to much to me I just had to watch more of his movies. After watching Un Flic I don't regret that decision.Melville not only has improved his technical craftsmanship but his storytelling abilities too. He shoots the movie with a washedout blue look in a Paris beset by neverending rain. It's a dark cold world much like his characters cops criminals and prostitutes. He takes time to set up scenes doesn't abuse the editing allowing scenes to drag out so the viewer can absorb all the details. Even better he doesn't abuse the dialogue his characters are introspective men of action who communicate with looks and actions. Most of the movie is told through visuals the dialogue is sparse succinct and the point.The story itself is ordinary four robbers heist a bank one of them gets wounded and is dropped at a hospital This sets up the eventual downfall of the group as they prepare a new heist unawares that the cops are slowly closing in on them. To make things more complicated there's an awkward love triangle between the criminal mastermind Simon Richard Crenna Cathy Catherine Deneuve and Comissioner Coleman Alain Delon.I don't doubt Alain Delon was the main pull he was a popular star in France at the time. But he does nothing for me. It's really Robert Crenna an otherwise mediocre actor in his own country who delivers an amazing performance as an intelligent daring likable criminal who runs a nightclub and organises elaborate heists. Fascinating as he may be though I give Melville credit for not glamourising criminals. Following these men around one realises they're lonely hopeless people who have nowhere else to turn. That's especially obvious in one of the criminals a 60yearold jobless husband who lies to his wife about going out to look for work. How distant he is from the modern movie criminals who flaunt themselves as media celebrities.Another thing I give Melville credit for is for making this movie truly fatalistic. in Le Samourai I never thought Jeff Costello had reached the end of the line he just gives up when he had many ways to get out. But in this movie Simon knows his end has arrived and still he fights on. For me that's true fatalism fighting against the certainty of failure.With a renewed interest in Melville's movies I can't wait to watch the rest of them.".

The scene with lame special effects toy train and helicopter is problematic not so much because of those effects but because it's 20 minutes long 15th of the movie however that scene's sound design is effective. A short scene in what is apparently supposed to be the Louvre looks a bit faux as well. Deneuve's presence on screen is brief but she's the Ice Queen you gotta love.

	schema:reviewBody "Of JeanPierre Melville's earlier masterpiece Le Samouri Roger Ebert described it as nothing absolutely original... except for the handling of the material. This is certainly true of nearly all of Melville's films who was fascinated with American crime dramas and noirs right down to the very essence of the details. His protagonists or antagonists of sorts frequently dress as Bogart or other Hollywood lead men with their fedora hats khaki trench coats complete with smoldering looks and hardboiled attitudes. Much like Le Cercle Rouge and Bob le Flambeur Melville obsesses over the details of his characters far more interested in those than their overall motivations or actions. Indeed frequently Melville douses us with very long sequences in Le Cercle Rouge it is almost 30 minutes of dialoguefree situations that crank up the tension of the film simply by indulging us with every movement these characters make. Often it is depicting a crime of sorts such as a jewelery store or bank robbery which only heightens our interest in what is going to happen next. Because Melville was much more concerned with tension than action the payoffs of these scenes often feels deflated and a letdown most notably because American audiences are so used these days to being pummeled with all action and little to no tensional buildup that we sit there waiting for the action that never comes. This is exactly what Melville desires. Overall this is perhaps the most ambitious of Melville's films and unfortunately his last. The lead actors are quite good especially American star Richard Crenna and French legend of cool Alain Delon. Catherine Deneuve also makes a small appearance although the film could have benefited greatly had she been used more extensively. Still Melville is able to wow us simply with his crisp editing sharp and focused direction and the wonderful cold existential characters we come to expect from his work. Nowadays Melville is beginning to be recognized further as one of the great French directors and a direct forefront of the French New Wave. Even without that great distinction he still is an author that needs to be remembered and revisited.".

Stir of Echoes was somewhat similar to Sixth Sense but it was also in many was DIFFERENT. First of all it SOE is dealing with hypnosis and has a more 'criminal' as well as supernatural theme. This movie is spectacular and the reason it was not recognized as such is because it was released just a few weeks after The Sixth Sense  a movie which had already satisfied the audience with its supernatural theme. And because The Sixth Sense was such a hit Stir of Echoes was shoved aside and didn't get the recognition it deserved. Don't get me wrong! I loved Sixth Sense but this movie is also very good and if you liked The Sixth Sense I highly recommend you see it!".

This movie is spectacular and the reason it was not recognized as such is because it was released just a few weeks after The Sixth Sense  a movie which had already satisfied the audience with its supernatural theme. And because The Sixth Sense was such a hit Stir of Echoes was shoved aside and didn't get the recognition it deserved. Don't get me wrong! I loved Sixth Sense but this movie is also very good and if you liked The Sixth Sense I highly recommend you see it!";

This is the start of a suspenseful psychological thriller that sucked me in and did not let go until the credits rolled.The acting by all the lead and supporting characters is more than adequate. Kevin Bacon is right at home in his role of a somewhat bitter individual who undergoes heavy changes throughout the film. He does a great job as do the other actors. The film is shot in a sober and downtoearth way giving it a serious tone. Plot wise the movie is also more than decent with only a few small plot holes which will only bother the most scrutinous of viewers.The movie's plot does however remind some viewers of other thrillers mainly The Shining and The Sixth Sense another 1999 release which overshadowed Stir of Echoes with a larger marketing campaign and larger overall budget. Some aspects of the story are indeed less than original but the movie as a whole feels different and is very enjoyable.Overall the movie falls just short of greatness in its genre. I found the quality and depth of the story to be good but not quite as good as some of the afore mentioned greats in the thrillerhorror genres. even still I recommend this film to every fan of thrillers and suspense.".

From the likable fishoutofwater guy who trips the lightfantastic through a piece of fluff like FOOTLOOSE to putting everything on the line to play a pedophile in the unnerving THE WOODSMAN there's hardly anything he can't  or won't do  to show his amazing range.That being said STIR OF ECHOES still holds what is for me one of his alltime Top Five performances.He plays Tom Witzky a regular mug living with his family in a workingclass suburb of Chicago. Though he loves his family hotterthanhot wife Maggie Kathryn Erbe and precocious son Jake Zachary David Cope he's also a man becoming bored with his life. He wants to do and be something more than who and what he is.Obviously the old adage be careful what you wish for went right over Tom's head.At a party for family and friends Tom volunteers to be hypnotized by his flaky sisterinlaw Lisa the always excellent Illeana Douglas who makes a powerful suggestion to Tom that his mind takes literally. What happens next will change his life and everyone's around him forever.A 'doorway' has been opened inside Tom's head that allows him to communicate with the dead and for them to reach out and touch him...whether he wants to or not. When the nightmares that he's been having begin to intensify Tom knows he must find a way to close that doorway for good before he loses his family...and his sanity. The urgency is heightened when he discovers how sensitive he was before the hypnotic suggestion in the most chilling way possible...it seems that son Jake can see and talk to the dead as well.In the tradition of THE CHANGELING LADY IN WHITE and THE SIXTH SENSE the focus of Tom's visions comes from one apparition in particular who won't leave him or his family in peace until he can figure out what it wants and why. The situation provides fodder for one intense and terrifying performance and with help from a strong supporting cast Bacon comes through like a champ.When movies like this are adapted from older works by classic authors I usually proceed with the greatest caution. But Richard Matheson's creepy novel has been skillfully transformed by David Koepp a man who knows a little bit about balancing thoughtful plotting and dialogue with outright terror as in APARTMENT ZERO and the outstanding job he does here will make you think twice the next time somebody wants to 'put you out' at a party with something more than just shots of Captain Morgan...".

Sets special effects and cinematography are all very good  nothing flashy but solid. It has shocks and suspense especially in the first half and although it could be accused of being a little clichd it never strays too far into the 'seen it all before' category. The second half of the film turns into a more traditional thriller but still holds up well unlike similarly themed movies such as 'What Lies Beneath.' This is because it is pleasingly short lasting around 90 minutes the correct length for a film of this type. There are some plot strands that aren't explained but this can be forgiven because of the film's running time.Although not mind blowing it has a decent payoff at the end and left me satisfied that I'd just watched a good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1999 the media was in a frenzy about a new film that used real things to terrify and excite its audience. Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability and while Stir Of Echoes had this the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax writeoff for that year.I have not read the novel by Richard Matheson so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more bigname competitor at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era thus saving a few dollars since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.Kevin Bacon is in fine fine form as the film's central hero a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sisterinlaw Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable layered character. Indeed director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary Kathryn and Kevin.I do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding needed better resolution. One moment Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment not only are details like the job forgotten so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.In the end however Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit. If nothing else it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil's demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.".

The thing that compares favourably to The Sixth Sense is that Stir Of Echoes is thoroughly entertaining from the first minute. Kevin Bacon Stars as a father who is hypnotised by his sister in law which results in the opening of his mind to the spirit of a girl who was murdered in his house. His son already had the powers to speak to dead people and together they try to solve why the girl keeps contacting them. The young boy is brilliant in the roll as is Kevin Bacon and the whole film keeps you on the edge of the seat.

It was an huge hit and the movie was the talk of the year. It launched a totally new genre of movies. Every movie of the same 'type' released after The Sixth Sense was considered by everyone lame unoriginal and a ripoff and a movie to quickly cash in after the success of The Sixth Sense. Stir of Echoes was released only a month after The Sixth Sense and people wanted to know nothing of it. Completely unfair also since I thought that the script was even being written before The Sixth Sense was and I also thought that filming completed earlier but yet it was released later in cinemas. Who knows what would have happened to this movie if it was released before The Sixth Sense...It surely would had been appreciate more than it was now.I'm glad that the movie by now is finally starting to receive the credit it deserves.You also have to remember that in 1999 these type of movies were still fresh and new so everything about it was original. However by todays standards the movie perhaps doesn't really seem that original anymore since dozens like this sort of movie are being made every year now.The story is greatly written by David Koepp who really is one of the best writers in the business. Everything is build up perfectly slowly and mysteriously. You never know what is going to happen next and the movie offers more than enough surprise. In the beginning you really don't know what the movie is going to be about or were its trying to head to. You don't know if its real what is happening or is it just the main character imagining things. It provides the movie with mystery and an uneasy atmosphere.The movie above all is a supernatural thriller that also definitely has some similarities by the way with The Sixth Sense which also might be a reason why it was received so coolly but the movie also features some real horror elements. And remember again this was all quite new and refreshing for 1999 standards. I was actually quite blown away by the movie when I first saw it which must have been in 2000 or something.Kevin Bacon is really know for being the biggest Hollywood lead and he normally plays supporting roles especially before this movie. This movie is perhaps the first one that truly allows Bacon to shine and show his skill as an actor and proof to the world that he can really carry a movie. It was nice and refreshing to see Kathryn Erbe in something different than Law  Order Criminal Intent for a change. She plays such a different character. It shows how good as an actress she actually is.The movie is well directed by David Koepp himself and he knows how to bring his own story to the screen. The movie further more features some nice special effects that are used only in the right places. The movie is still definitely much better and more refreshing than most genre movies being released today.Deserves to become a real genreclassic!910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Kevin Bacon is credible in his part and so do Illeana Douglas. Kathryn Erbe however is stuck with nothing to do for large chunks of the movie. Effectively and atmosphericly shot with some effective jolts that made me jump. To some the conclusion may be a little simple and drawnout but I thought it was satisfying and filled to the brim with suspense. I find that the digging in the cellargarden is a nice buildup for the finale not that it goes on forever as a previous reviewer stated. It's only one thing that bothers me about the ending and it is that too little is explained and a few threads of the story are totally abandoned. But that's only a minor complaint. For the most part this is a creepy interesting wellmade scary  and well played little thriller.".

To some the conclusion may be a little simple and drawnout but I thought it was satisfying and filled to the brim with suspense. I find that the digging in the cellargarden is a nice buildup for the finale not that it goes on forever as a previous reviewer stated. It's only one thing that bothers me about the ending and it is that too little is explained and a few threads of the story are totally abandoned. But that's only a minor complaint. For the most part this is a creepy interesting wellmade scary  and well played little thriller.";

It's like when you watched Dr Who as a kid and hid behind the couch because you couldn't bear to watch. Kevin Bacon is fantastic and loses his mind quite convincingly. The 'Dig' sequence along with the total madness that follows reminds me of Stephen King's The Tommyknockers. And that book was spooky enough. Zachary David Cope why do all kids have three names nowadays? is also brilliant as little Jake although Kathryn Erbe as Maggie leaves a little to be desired. She's too flat  not enough emotion. And I love the way all the little things are tied up especially the end sequence with Jake in the car...If you liked The Sixth Sense this is not quite the same standard although it's pretty close. If you didn't like The Sixth Sense because you didn't think it got personal enough this one's for you.

What a wonderful talented actress she is and deserves to be more widely known  she can act rings around the Julia Roberts of the world.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is an intelligence and honesty to Stir of Echoes that doesn't exist within Sixth Sense  the entire movie doesn't rest on a singular easily deducible device either.  It took me about thirty seconds to realize in The Sixth Sense that Bruce Willis' character was in fact a ghost  but in Stir of Echoes nothing is revealed ahead of its time.There is a humanity and sincerity in the relationships as well  no stereotypical strained single momdifficult kid relationship like in Sixth Sense but in fact an honestly written and acted relationship with genuine tensions and joys and hardships.Ileana Douglas deserves a special mention for a fantastic performance in a supporting role  as usual.  What a wonderful talented actress she is and deserves to be more widely known  she can act rings around the Julia Roberts of the world.";

This movie tries very hard to create creepy and scary moments but its far away from suspense. Okay there were some scenes to remember that this movie should be a scary thriller. I expected simply more from the writer the director and even Kevin Bacon couldnt save this disaster. I had the impression to watch a normal creepy cable movie. My wife and me vote 410. Too overrated.

	schema:reviewBody "Stir of Echoes is more than just your average ghost story it's a thriller that weaves together mystery intrigue murder and love of family into a very memorable film. Adapted from the novel by the late great Richard Matheson the story centers around everyday man Tom Witzky Kevin Bacon his wife Maggie Kathryn Erbe and their young son Jake Zachary David Cope. They seem to have the perfect life in their Chicago suburban home until one night at a neighborhood block party Tom ever the supernaturalotherworldly skeptic agrees to be hypnotized by his mysticminded sisterinlaw. He doesn't remember much about what happens during the hypnosis but what follows next is anything but child's play as strange images involving a ghostly teenage girl and past events of the house they live in start appearing in his mind. It turns out Tom has become a receiver someone whose mind is open to visions of the future and communication with the dead and that's not all. Tom's son Jake already has this sixth sense if you will and he too has visions of the girl he calls Samantha. It doesn't take long for Tom to discover that Samantha was a real person who disappeared from the neighborhood but no one in the community knows why or seems to care. From there it's a race for the truth as Tom tries to uncover what really happened to the young girl who haunts his mind before it tears him apart.I had heard of Stir of Echoes through this site long before I saw it. It was not until recently I finally got my chance to see it and needless to say I was not disappointed. The story is beautifully crafted right from the beginning where we first meet Jake taking a bath and seemly talking to his father in the next room. It's only after his father leaves the room and he's drying off that we find out I won't reveal exactly how we know as to not spoil it he's talking to someone else. The scene gives me chills just thinking of it and there are plenty more to come. Writer and director David Koepp should be congratulated for being to combine scenes that scare and disturb with a good strong story. As for as characters each of the actors give solid performances be it Kevin Bacon as skeptic turned almost dangerously obsessed believer Kathryn Erbe as Tom's devoted wife Illeana Douglas as the sisterinlaw Kevin Dunn as Tom's friend and neighbor Frank or Zachary David Cope as young Jake Witzky. Mr. Cope's performance has to be one of the most brilliant I've ever seen from a child actor or in general due to his ability to be sweet but also a bit other worldly due to his ability to see things we can't. Plus there's a whole lot of amazing supporting actors and actresses such as Jennifer Morrison as young Samantha that should be congratulated for their work. I'm not sure what Mr. Matheson thought of this film but as for me I can't praise it enough. Stir of Echoes is a film that works not only for the reasons above but in addition it will make you wonder how well do you really know your neighborhood or the house you live in? And on that note don't let this gem of a film pass you by. Watch and be prepared for some unsettling truths.".

Most of these films have a disappointing back story when it finally gets revealed but that's not the case here  the narrative remains gripping throughout. And when it does descend into clich at the climax you can forgive it for the quality that's come before.Kevin Bacon is one of those underrated actors that Hollywood doesn't really know what to do with and he's rarely given the chance to shine. Yet when he does he burns up the screen with an energy like no other and he's on top form as the mildmannered husband and father who finds himself channelling a kind of supernatural vengeance. His mania is both convincing and frightening. Kathryn Erbe is also very strong as his putupon wife and child actor Zachary David Cope is excellent in a creepy kid role.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film back in 1990 we still have the VHS tape we recorded it on back then and although I'm now 13 years older the film still makes for an enjoyable viewing.The story involves the Thompson family whose farm has just survived a drought and are in dire straits and risk losing their farm if they can't pay the mortgage off.  Their only hope lies in their horse  Prince  who will be competing in the New Years Day Cup and if he can win they'll have enough to pay off the debt.  Unfortunately 2 bumbling lowlifes called Bill and Sly steal Prince and head off into the bush where they hope to escape and use Prince to make a fortune.  Upon realising this the 3 children in the house Helen John and their English cousin Michael set off into the bush after the 2 thieves along with Manalpuy an Aboriginal who lives on their farm.The story is pretty simplistic but considering the target audience is primarily children it's decent fun.  This film is special being that it was Nicole Kidman's first starring role in a movie at the young age of 17.  Australian TV viewers would probably also be interested to know that also starring was an actor named John Howard not the prime minister who today is now wellknown for his roles in the Australian TV series 'SeaChange' which he won a Logie for and 'Always Greener'  here he plays one of the horse thieves Sly and its interesting to see the way he looked 20 years ago he looks a lot thinner  and taller  but the face has remained the same.Since seeing the film in 1990 I have never seen it screened again on television nor have I seen it anywhere in any video store so good luck to anyone who might want to catch it as it may be another of those 'hardtofind' films like too many older Australian films.  Still its worth a watch if you can  if only to see a young teenage Nicole Kidman with curly brown hair and freckles on her face.".

Upon realising this the 3 children in the house Helen John and their English cousin Michael set off into the bush after the 2 thieves along with Manalpuy an Aboriginal who lives on their farm.The story is pretty simplistic but considering the target audience is primarily children it's decent fun.  This film is special being that it was Nicole Kidman's first starring role in a movie at the young age of 17.  Australian TV viewers would probably also be interested to know that also starring was an actor named John Howard not the prime minister who today is now wellknown for his roles in the Australian TV series 'SeaChange' which he won a Logie for and 'Always Greener'  here he plays one of the horse thieves Sly and its interesting to see the way he looked 20 years ago he looks a lot thinner  and taller  but the face has remained the same.Since seeing the film in 1990 I have never seen it screened again on television nor have I seen it anywhere in any video store so good luck to anyone who might want to catch it as it may be another of those 'hardtofind' films like too many older Australian films.  Still its worth a watch if you can  if only to see a young teenage Nicole Kidman with curly brown hair and freckles on her face.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yellow Earth by Chen Kaige Farewell My Concubine Life on a String was the first film of the socalled fifth generation of filmmakers who introduced a new aesthetic and social awareness to Chinese cinema. It is set just before World War II in Shaanxi province in Northern China near the Yellow River an area referred to as gian shan wan he thousands of hills and ten folds more gullies. Based on Ke Lai's novel Echo in the Deep Valley the film shows the struggle of the peasants in the area known for its unyielding harshness and the folk traditions they drew on to express their anguish. As the film begins cinematographer Zhang Yimou creates a feeling of desolation with panoramic shots of the vast landscape as a soldier from the Communist Eighth Route Army Gu Qing Wang Xueyin walks over the barren hills to a small village. He says he is there to collect folk songs for the army to use so that the people will know why they are suffering why their women are beaten and why they should rise up.Comrade Gu stays with a poor family that includes 47year old widowed father Tan Tuo his 13year old daughter Cuiqiao Xue Bai and almost mute son Hanhan Liu Quiang. Rather than relying on traditional narrative to convey the film's message Kai ge uses long static shots and songs of the people to express mood and tone. The father has become embittered with his life of constant deprivation and sings Life is hard for seasonal workers. They are hired in January dismissed in October. Conditions are tough and the farmers pray for rain to alleviate the drought but there is no rain. At a wedding the serving of wooden fish figures covered with sauce underscores the lack of adequate food. The film also dramatizes the sorry condition of women showing how they had to carry heavy buckets of water on their backs for miles and how they were forced into arranged marriages at a very young age. Gu is seemingly confident of the fight he is waging. He lets the family know that in the South there are no longer any arranged marriages and tells Cuiqiao about women who cut their hair fight against the Japanese and can read and write. She hears about her older sister's unhappy marriage and does not want to endure the same fate. Of all us poor folk she sings girls are the saddest. Cuiqiao is infatuated with Gu and wants to leave home and join the Army 200 miles away in Yanan. She knows that if she stays she will be forced to marry an older man in an arranged ceremony. When Gu leaves to return to camp he promises to return in April. Promises alone however cannot change Cuiqiao's growing feeling of entrapment or the terrible consequences that follow. In its heartbreaking portrayal of people caught in lives of quiet desperation that even Communist ideas or marching songs cannot redeem Yellow Earth speaks a universal language.".

All  the editing patterns the quick cuts and the long stretches and the masterful  composition are strands that are woven as the viewer wills them to be.  The ways to  interpret everything this movies gives us are endless.  Speculation on the film is a task  never ending.

Steeped in archaic traditions and KMT rule many areas of China especially in poorer northern areas such as the upper half of Shanxi province still existed in a premodern time without having being enlightened by the changing times occurring in the south. Although pitied by the Communists there was also a begrudging respect for some of the customs held by the peasants. In Yellow Earth the custom brought to the fore is folk singing.A Communist soldier brimming with enthusiasm for the teachings of Chairman Mao and belief that the said teachings will revolutionize China and bring equality to the downtrodden classes Gu Quing or Brother Gu travels to Shanxi in order to gather folk songs that can be sung by the Communists to inspire others of the plight of the poor peasants. Arriving at a time in which a wedding is taking place Brother Gu witnesses what he believes to be the oppression of tradition on the populace fourteen year old girls being married off to old men in which sustenance and dowries are more important than true affection.Despite his differences of opinion Brother Gu is quite an amiable fellow and takes residence with an old weatherbeaten farmer and his children. He works with the farmer and helps plow the fields while attempting to engage in conversation with the farmer. Most of his conversations center upon the changing times and how girls are now becoming soldiers and are learning how to read and young couples are able to marry out of affection instead of being matched together. The farmer listens politely but his concerns primarily fall within practical matters such as if it will rain soon and the engagement of his young daughter Cuiqiao. However the words do have a greater impact on Cuiqiao a hardworking girl with an incredible singing voice. Through the kind being of Brother Gu she learns that there is another world where girls can read and men know how to sew. Engaged to a man many years her senior Cuiqiao desires to join Brother Gu when it is time for him to return to his home. Yet because of the Communist party's strict rules she cannot join the party unless asked to do so. Therefore she must wait for Brother Gu's return. However can she wait long enough? The only two Chen Kaige films that I have watched before Yellow Earth are the magnificent Farewell My Concubine and the magnificent travesty The Promise so I was quite interested in viewing the respected director's landmark debut film. Like seemingly most Chinese films that have been released in America Yellow Earth is quite a sad film that shows a people torn between two conflicting times. However like many of the other films created by the 5th generation film directors which also includes the luminary Zhang Yimou who was the cinematographer for Yellow Earth oftentimes the new and modern revolution of the old is just as bad as or worse than what was before. An important film for those interested in Chinese film and modern China Yellow Earth does not make for an enjoyable film experience but it does make for a poignant one.".

Most of his conversations center upon the changing times and how girls are now becoming soldiers and are learning how to read and young couples are able to marry out of affection instead of being matched together. The farmer listens politely but his concerns primarily fall within practical matters such as if it will rain soon and the engagement of his young daughter Cuiqiao. However the words do have a greater impact on Cuiqiao a hardworking girl with an incredible singing voice. Through the kind being of Brother Gu she learns that there is another world where girls can read and men know how to sew. Engaged to a man many years her senior Cuiqiao desires to join Brother Gu when it is time for him to return to his home. Yet because of the Communist party's strict rules she cannot join the party unless asked to do so. Therefore she must wait for Brother Gu's return. However can she wait long enough? The only two Chen Kaige films that I have watched before Yellow Earth are the magnificent Farewell My Concubine and the magnificent travesty The Promise so I was quite interested in viewing the respected director's landmark debut film. Like seemingly most Chinese films that have been released in America Yellow Earth is quite a sad film that shows a people torn between two conflicting times. However like many of the other films created by the 5th generation film directors which also includes the luminary Zhang Yimou who was the cinematographer for Yellow Earth oftentimes the new and modern revolution of the old is just as bad as or worse than what was before. An important film for those interested in Chinese film and modern China Yellow Earth does not make for an enjoyable film experience but it does make for a poignant one.";

Maybe because it's a little TOO close to the experience of real life. Here we have a film that's a window into the life of Cuiqiao and her tiny family of peasants in a northwestern province of China during World War II. The music is a motif and the main thematic element of the film expressing the misery most eloquently. The plot sees a lowly Communist officer trying to catalog or find folk songs for the Communist footsoldiers to sing as moraleboosters. The best singer in town is the shy and depressed Cuiqiao whose life is pitiable. I won't go into details but it is depressing for reasons that are equally social and economic. The officer seems nice but he seems like another pawn in a bigger power game  a guy who really isn't so sure of his faith in the party beyond a means of escape. He's just another guy staying one step ahead of the virulent poverty the main characters suffer through.Seriously the stuff is really affecting and memorable. The funny scene or two in this movie is all the more smileinducing because you're just so glad for the break in the bleak atmosphere. And the songs  mein gott what grating stuff to spoiled western ears but simultaneously so gutwrenching! I'd call this a period piece but the experiences of rural western villagers in China are probably pretty timeless. I mean the landscape is certainly changing but there are a lot of places that are still like this.Watch it you spoiled punks!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yellow Earth is a rare film of exceptional caliber a film that captures the brutal simplicity of traditional Chinese life in northern China. Directed by Chen Kaige with cinematography from Zhang Yimou Yellow Earth tells the story of a village family visited by a communist soldier who has come to collect folk songs he hopes might motivate his fellow soldiers to fight the Japanese. You could definitely say this is an arthouse movie so if you are looking for high drama it's probably not your cup of tea. However for the patient and attentive viewer the emotional impact is powerful. Chen Kaige manages to show us life in the village in a minimalist style where the bare earth and mountains of north China provide a most unobtrusive background. A lone tree on the mountain is both an anomalythere are no other trees in the landscapeand a symbol of the isolation of the individual in a society bound by tradition and codes which permit no variation. The young girl Cuiqiao hears the soldier's description of life in a modern communist world and dares to dream she might escape her fate in the village where young women are given as brides to older men before they can fully know themselves let alone aspire to a selffulfilling life. Dialogue and overt emotion are sparse in this film while traditional folk music provides the chorus that foretells the fate of its characters. It is the contextual environment that provides us with the clues to the person's feelings. In this maledominated society the young girl sings a song that pleads for pity for the life of a woman. While the setting is north China circa 1937 the problem it depicts remained a vexing social concern in Chinese rural villages well into the 1990's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yellow Earth is a classic film which reflects that the situation of peasant's life is in yellow earth. At the beginning of the film with a folk the screen shows audience the background of this movie which is a soldier came to yellow earth for collecting folk. With the development of story the viewer can find that the situation of local environment is poor and austere their thought is conservative and antiquated and local people is humane and ignorance. However through the soldier's describing you can make comparison between yellow earth and the South in thought education and so on. Although these traditional rules and culture were the same before many years ago with the development and changing of society China was changing. However local people still live in the primitive China their life is poor cannot get education and keep the old traditional custom.In Yellow Earth there are some details reflecting thought of Confucian. The girls must obey parents' order and have matchmaker making match which is the traditional thought for marriage. For example when the soldier told them that girls can own choose husband and marriage by themselves in South now and people claim loving in freedom Cui Qiao's father cannot accept this thought. He still thinks that daughter's marriage need traditional rules. If not he thinks that it is not good for the girl. It not only reflects that thought of Confucian but also shows that local people' thought is antiquated adamant and old fashioned. In the film although Cui Qiao's father knows that Cui Qiao is not willing to marriage he cannot change mind and persuade Cui Qiao agree. Except for this When the soldier asks Cui Qiao's father about his daughter's marriage the man told him that couple do not need premarital feeling which means they do not need love each other. This action and thought is like in the antiquity. At the antiquity girls do not know who will be her husband and what his appearance is. And Cui Qiao's father says this marriage was confirmed when Cui Qiao was a child which is another traditional culture. Second in the film it reflects that the position of women is low and the position between man and woman is not the balance. Girls cannot choose husband and have liberal love. Except for this generally the man can be older than girl and the differential of age is big. Like Cui Qiao and her husband. The reason why Cui Qiao will marry with her husband is when she was a child her home is poor and for his brother her father agree this marriage. In the local place it is the common phenomenon. However this kind of marriage is cruel and cannot be accept for girls. In the film the bride does not have smile including not only Cui Qiao but also the bride is at the beginning of the film. For marriage girls are not satisfied but they have to accept for their family and themselves. At yellow earth girls have only one way that is marriage. However only one way is that they cannot decide and choose by themselves which is dolorous.Third it is conflicted for local people to see yellow earth. In the film a shot is Cui Qiao' father stand on yellow earth he looks at sky and feel helpless sad because there is no rain for a long time. He told the soldier that no one want to farm in yellow earth because this sod is not suitable to farm but they cannot give up yellow earth because they depend on this sod to live. This is a conflicted emotion. Local people know the problem of sod but they think this sod feed them so they cannot give up yellow earth. And Cui Qiao has the same conflicted emotion. She cannot accept her marriage but she cannot oppose for her brother and father which reflects that she is a humane and dutiful daughter. Except for these through film I find that local people have not good education at that place so it causes that they are unknown and thought is antiquated. When the soldier wants to write a couplet Cui Qiao refuses him because no one knows words. They cannot get education it caused that their thought is antiquated and do not want to know new information and rules. They still keep to tradition. And in the film there a lot of time having no dialogue. Local people are silence. They do not talk with others only when they meet difficulty they can sing a folk to say about the difficulty of their life. At the end of film Cui Qiao wants to change her life she try her best to find the new way. She wants to get freedom. So she leaves her home cut her hair and find to the Red Army by herself. It means the girl aspire to freedom. Thus I think that this film  Yellow earth is good film. It lets the viewer know that farmers' life in yellow earth at that time and a traditional custom.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather sad and melancholic Chinese musical sett in late 30s. A young communist soldier is sent to farmers near Yan'An which is considered the origin of the cultural revolution to collect folk songs for the party. The idea is to find happy songs they can use in their war and revolution. The problem is that the farmers only know suffering so all their songs are sad. But even if he does not bring anything back to the army he does leave behind new ideas of equality of the sexes and the right to choose your own spouse. These revolutionary ideas give hope to a young woman called Cuiqiao. The question is is hope of any use to the oppressed?The music is heavenly and the cinematography and the editing is very poetic. This is like a musical version of a Japanese film called The Naked Island Kaneto Shind 1960. Quiet meditative and full of compassion. One could argue that the film is some what pro communist party but I do think the intention was to make it look like it was while at the same time delivering a very harsh criticism. SPOILERS! The film ends with a song about how communism is going to save the people but the fact is that the farmers are not much better off today and even less so back in the 80s when this film was made. Then consider the fact that something between 18 million to 45 million died in the Great Leap Forward many of them farmers and the last shot of the barren landscape while we listen to the promise of communism gets a new meaning. Cuiqiao's death is also quite fitting in the light of what would follow. END OF SPOILERS! This film needs to get a proper DVD or preferably BLU RAY publication. It is one of the best and most beautiful film I have ever seen. As a musical it is simply revolutionary. The music does not only serve the story well it elevates it gives it a soul. And it is quite surprising how well it serves the dramatic theme of the film. Gone is the happy go lucky atmosphere of the classical Hollywood and Bollywood musicals and in stead we have a musical steeped in realism and poetic drama. You could say that this is a musical for people who hate musicals. In fact I'm sure many who watched this did not even realize they were watching a musical.".

The film shows you what it looks like to literally eke out a living. Life for the peasants of Shaanbei is about survival in its most primal sense staving off hunger. Children exist solely to provide labor and as a form of currency to be traded to other families through marriage. The peasants' existence is so stark that there is almost no need for language. The family rarely speaks to each other. However though little is said much is felt. The peasants express their laments through songs the only way they know how. Yet though songs can liberate Cuiqiao's feelings they ultimately cannot free her from her bondage as she notes in her last song. And as the ceremonial rain ritual at the end reminds us no one in the village can free themselves from their bondage to the earth. The vast dry timeless landscape dominates the frame in many shots the people are helpless before it as they have been since time immemorial. The earth is what drives them to look up toward heaven as they do at the end of the film. An alternative direction is Communism symbolized by Gu Qing standing on the horizon whom Hanhan struggles toward against the current of the masses. Yet Gu Qing's figure disappears before Hanhan could get to him and the camera ultimately points down and settles its view on the yellow earth. The power of the film owes much to its economical editing. On Cuiqiao's wedding day we never see her getting onto the sedan chair only her father picking up the empty straw seat Ciuqiao used to sit on after the wedding procession leaves. In her bridal chamber we see the dark arthritic hands of Cuiqiao's groom but never his face. The effect is all the more chilling and poignant.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to talk about this movie beyond its cinematography and the artistry of its visuals. Not because there's nothing beyond those two but rather because those two are just so unbelievably welldone that it's hard to concentrate on anything else. This is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen if that's in any way possible. Because if you manage to do so you will be sucked in from the very first frame. The vastness of Shanbei's landscape is capture beautifully in this film and at some points I found myself totally ignoring the dialogue and what was going on with the characters in favour of just admiring the scenery.Though that isn't really a compliment. As I said in the beginning this movie has a cinematography that's almost too good. The story only barely manages to keep up which is a shame because it's not a bad story. I found myself liking these characters their unique characteristics and their actors who were all very talented and natural for their roles. And I kind of liked the music and all of the songs as well. The latter ones took some getting used to as they were so very different from what I usually listen to but they had their own charm and power of emotion going for them.So I really liked this film. Is it a masterpiece? No not really. Cinematography alone doesn't make a masterful movie and while the story is good it's not that good. Still I'd definitely recommend this one to almost anyone. It's a bit slow and nothing much actually happens but it's a powerful piece to witness.".

Chen Kaige has one immortal quote saying something like I don't care about the public I do artsorry if it's not the exact words I had the quote in french. That's wrong that's terribly wrong. You can't do art without people to watch and appreciate it. That's what art is about. Art is about things being seen and appreciated. I appreciated Yimou's camera work but everything else I hated. Poor acting poor exploitation of a good idea annoying Chinese traditional signing...and this damn Chinese obsession with doing nothing. It's like Kaige's characters were frozen up by Mao's broken promises. I know that was Kaige's idea to show that but all in all it gave a pretty boring movie  targeted to a very slim audience. Word is that even the Chinese didn't liked it.".

Therefore the film attracted controversy in China. Havis added that the film was also equivocal about the Communist Party's ability to help the peasants during the Communist revolution a position which differed from that espoused by the propaganda films that were produced after 1949. I understand the importance of this film and can understand why it is so highly rated but it really had no appeal for me. None. I had difficulty getting through it to be honest. Maybe some time I would give it another chance but it just seems to have so little plot and was full of odd singing that was not pleasant for the human ear.".

Of course it would promote the toy line in SOME sense that's only logical considering the movie is a PRODUCT of the toy line but it does not revolve around that aspect. The character's features were altered to take on a more lifelike state yet without straying too far from their familiar appearances that fans have come to know them by. As far as expressions go the characters display emotion beautifully. The way that the masks were designed as they were to suit the film allowed for obvious expression that the actual toys could not replicate. Overall the film was an excellent rendition of the Bionicle world  characters amazing soundtrack smooth flowing animation and rich in design. Bionicle has been around for some years now. This movie didn't just POP UP from a new and showing story. Development of the characters  the legends has evolved greatly.

The story line is a bit young but the over all effect is fantastic! The characters each have their own unique personalities which can be related to while watching. The animation is absolutely brilliant I would love to work on something like that.If you loved the movie then I suggest reading the books of Bionicle. Their short and easy to understand but they are a good read.My favourite character would be Tahu and Jaller. Tahu the brave but impatient hero leads the group but can cause trouble along the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though I can enjoy this movie at certain bright points in the acting it is not an original storyline. The whole conclusion of my fandom for the first Toa was not very satisfying but I liked it. I hope Lego can do better in story and in acting in the future. I must say the visual fireworks were amazing. I don't think anyone could boast of doing better. If criticism was cattle I'd have a herd for this movie. But there were bright points that were worth the painful while. Michael Dobson probably had the best vocal performance out of all. His Kopaka was what balanced the good and bad performances in the film. Here comes the criticism. My main animation criticism is the gestures mostly of Tahu. Tahu was very womanly in gestures and lines and I found it a little amusing. Pohatu and Onua seemed to wait a little too patiently for each others lines. Gali overacted by minor degrees. Lewa was good and basic and a little Matanui religious. Takua was a little over dramatic at times but that was expected. Kopaka had a few flaws at first meeting. Music was cunningly Bionicle and it is one of the highest rises and you forget it is there which smooths out rough spots. All of it together makes a feast for longing fan eyes but not always their ears. This is a story for the faint of heart. This is Matanui's Lord of the Rings.".

The problem with this film is people look at the CGI and think it looks awful at todays standards it kinda is. However back in the day this CGI was AMAZING for its time! I will admit that this movie is nowhere near perfect as it has its downs. I definitely recommend this one. I've noticed how when people upload this film on YouTube the quality is not the same. In fact the quality is usually much more worse. If you want to watch it with better quality than I recommend buying the DVD instead of the watching the poor quality uploads on YouTube.

	schema:reviewBody "Title Bionicle Mask of Light Directed by Terry Shakespeare Storyline From the get go we are thrown into a spoken narrative to give us the exposition of who the Bionicle are not necessarily what they are but who they are. After the narrative we are introduced to two Matoran Takua and Jalla they will be the main focus for the movie but you also hear a reference from Jalla at the start that will not make sense unless you know the franchise and think about it. The way to explain a Matoran is they are basically the children versions of Bionicle whereas Toa as the adults and Turaga are the elders Jalla is looking for Takua and finds him but Takua sets off a trap to get a mask and ends up having to be rescued by Toa Tahu. They then start playing a interesting variant of hockey until the mask is revealed then the old wise Turaga send the two matoran on a quest to find its owner. The big bad of the movie Makuta finds out about the mask and the 7th Toa and sends his dark minion children to go to hunt down the mask. Toa Gali finds out about Makuta's dark forces and has to get to Ta Koro before they do but for some unexplained reason they can hover while she has to swim. She gets to TaKoro in time and is able to get them to sound the alarm before the attack in which the Tahu and Gali get beaten around before the Rahkshi Makuta's children leave after poisoning Tahu. Takua and Jalla make it through the jungle with the help of Toa Lewa and make it to the ice fields where they are ambushed by Rahkshi again but Toa Kopaka steps in at the last minute and freezes the Rahkshi solid. They make their way along OniKoro highway which are tunnels where Makuta tries to get inside the head of Takua to make him feel like he isn't worthy. This then works as he then splits away from Jalla and heads for OniKoro through the tunnels whereas Jalla goes somewhere else. This is where Takua is ambushed by the second set of Rahkshi which are much more capable at taking out the Toa than the last set. A mixture between a blast from one of the Rahkshi and the poison from earlier causes Tahu to start attacking his own side while the rest are trying to deal with the Rahkshi. They are able to save Tahu and get him back to normal as Takua meets back up with Jalla after having a change of heart. But just as Takua and Jalla get to where they need to be both sets of Rahkshi are waiting for them but the Toa arrive in time to fend them off. Jalla makes a heroic sacrifice to save Takua who finally decides to embrace his destiny and becomes the 7th Toa the Toa of light which was expected and no expected at the same time. He then heads down into the darkness to confront Makuta instead of a final fight they play another game of interesting hockey this leads to the Toa of Light putting his mask on Makuta and combining the darkness and light to create some odd abomination of a being. They are able to awaken Mata Nui but the Toa of Light has to sacrifice himself to do so but he is then brought back from his Disney death by the Turaga and Toa holding hands in a circle and saying a few words... Acting The voice acting was OK nothing all too special about it but everyone did their partAnimation The whole movie was made using CGI and it works well and holds up decently for a cartoonish mechanical look. They did a good job giving the characters emotion especially as it would be quite bland and boring without the ability to convey emotion. But just as with normal movies there are a hell of a lot of continuity errors. Length 70 minutes Overall Feel This isn't a movie for beginners this isn't a movie for the people who only casually play with the toys. This is a movie for the fans only fans and dedicated collectors would get any of the references made or understand who the characters are and what they are like. A non fan could grasp the concept of Bionicle they might not understand it fully but the movie would give them a standard concept of what they are who they are and who is the villain. The movie is a good movie but generally it would take a fan to understand who everyone is and what their role in the franchise is. But thankfully even a not so dedicated fan could know it it isn't a movie which only the biggest of fans would understand whats happening. A nonfan would be treated to a liner coherent storyline which a few action scenes which they can enjoy a fan would be treated to a big screen adaptation of the Bionicle franchise's story. It is a good film but not one you should go out of your way to see if you're not a Bionicle fan. A word of the wise would be not to see the sequels as it'll only get more confusing from there onwards".

I know their names their skills where they come from you name it.  You can't go into any room in my house without stepping on a Bionicle. Anyway I of course had to get the dvd the day it came out and was as excited as my son to watch it.  The animation is first rate for a directtovideo movie.  Of course it's not Pixar but it wasn't supposed to be.  The storyline is somewhat juvenile and you definately need to know the backstory to know what the heck is going on but the target audience is juveniles who know the story. All in all I liked it.  After repeated viewings I'm getting a little tired of it but my son and our other kids do enjoy it and I think it's a well made movie that delivers what it promises.  It never claims to be more than it is and from what I've seen on tv and the web they aren't trying to push it on anyone other than Bionicle fans.  I have to give LEGO some credit for that. They know who is going to like it and they're happy with that.If you or your kids like the toys then the movie is for you.  If you don't well wait for Finding Nemo.".

I could barely follow the story which annoyed me since it was so simple that it hurts. The plot is OK but unless you're a fan of Bionicle you won't really care about it it spends too little time telling us who these characters are or giving us reasons to like them or care for them. I realize that this is a children's movie but it should have been better most Disney movies give you characters to care about. The acting varied from decent to very bad. The characters were OK but too many of them seemed to be there just for the sake of comic reliefon a sidenote why did one of the Toa's talk like Yoda?. The CGI is mostly OK but at times it descends into mediocrity. Something I found repetitively annoying was how the animators kept trying to give these characters with barely any facial features at all emotion it just doesn't work when the eyes are lights and the face is a metal surface. Light and metal can't convey emotions like human actors can. They should have realized that and put more action in it instead. With all that said the action was the most entertaining thing in this movie especially the fight at the end. Apart from that this movie has very little to offer to nonfans of Bionicle and if you get around to watching this you'll be happy that it's only 70 minutes because you won't be able to sit through any more of it when it's done. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Grew up watching and loving this movie. While the lore was kind of overly forced which left my parents totally confused I was able to follow it no problem as a five year old. This is a wonderful tale of friendship sacrifice and drama all tied together by lovable characters. I feel motivated to write this after seeing the truly shocking mess that was 'Bionicle 2' and after seeing that the user reviews for THAT were overwhelmingly positive and better than this I felt compelled to intervene here. The sequel confused and messed up all the lore put out in this movie and had none of the heart or friendship. Watching Bionicle mask of light will be an utter delight for young children and adults alike. Assuming you are willing to buy into the lore and universe without resistance which a child isthis film will be an utter hoot. With the fun and exciting concept of 'Koli' at the beginning right up to a cool half and half fused Bionicle at the end the simple and exciting plot will enthrall both young and old. Don't bother trying to watch the confusingly numbered prequel before going into this as it will only leave you bored.I have seen many people here comparing this movie to Lord Of The Rings which I am pretty sure they are only saying because IHE said it. This could be slightly true I suppose but this is far more entertaining action packed and fun than LOTR. It is an abridged version with all the boring scenes removed. The scene in the cave with the blue plants still gives me goosebumps to watch with the cool villain's voice. If you want a fun silly and entertaining time watch the only true Bionicle movie THIS ONE.".

This is a wonderful tale of friendship sacrifice and drama all tied together by lovable characters. I feel motivated to write this after seeing the truly shocking mess that was 'Bionicle 2' and after seeing that the user reviews for THAT were overwhelmingly positive and better than this I felt compelled to intervene here. The sequel confused and messed up all the lore put out in this movie and had none of the heart or friendship. Watching Bionicle mask of light will be an utter delight for young children and adults alike.

My least favorite Toa was the rock one because who the hell wants power over rocks you already have a Toa of Earth and rocks are apart of the Earth what the hell just fuse the two together. Actually wait after reading the Wiki the rock one is way better than the earth one because all the earth one does is control the soil. What the heck kind of power is that? Hey wait a minute there's also a water Toa and an ice Toa... What the hell Lego ice isn't even an element it's quite literally just water that got too cold.Anyways give this a watch it taught me many things as a kid like how sand and fire makes glass.".

But as sweet as those memories maybe now I am older I can truly understand the complexity of the amazing storyline that Greg Farshtey author of the bionicle books and comics managed to craft together here. It is ashame that the complexity of the storyline is halted by some rather poorly directed scenes which involve Takua and Jalleryet to be Toa InikaMahrijust aimlessly searching for the7th toa when Takua is thee 7th toa! Yes I agree this is the most kiddiest and most fun of the bionicle movies because at that time the directors didn't expect adults to enjoy bionicles just as much as children do. This film is great in terms of a nice style of animation which improves throughout the films and lots of great locations to ponder on in the great island of Mata Nui as well as the brilliant storyline and imaginative characters. What also stuns me about this film is the vibrant colours and sounds which make it so fun and wonderful too watch. However every good has its bad and there are just as much bads in this film as goods. For instance the rahkshi are horribly wrong and look completely different from the toys and the voice acting is so annoying! Plus the ending goes on too long and the director just hasn't made it interesting enough with not enough action and too much just standing there doing nothing pointless scenes. The Toa Nuva aren't in it enough and Takua is too annoying for a 7th toa so I was glad when he didn't appear in future bionicle storeys. Now as I finish these comments I am left to ponder on the annoying drone of Takua! Takua!".

It was weird how this set up all this new mythology in something that was originally just goofy and nonsensical. Now I do appreciate what they tried to do with this movie. They're taking a story driven toy franchise and adapting it. The thing is this movie comes off as so clichd.I couldn't remember any of the characters' names. To be fair they are pretty hard to remember! It features these characters go on a journey to find a mask and they learn about themselves and destiny and sacrifice and stuff. I'm sorry but it just seems like I've seen all of this before. While it's by no means an awful film it might just be that I've seen so many movies that I see these tropes everywhere. I guess the CGI isn't bad. It does come off as too goofy sometimes. It's weird how what is technically the first Lego movie isn't all that good.

Building and playing with them were one of my favorite pasttimes so of course my little 7year old self watched this movie on repeat while playing with the toys that were in the movie.Now I'm 19 years old and watching this movie I have to say. This movie sucks.This movie has NOT aged well. In fact this movie is bad enough to the point where if I had a time machine I would go back in time and smack myself around for watching this stupid stupid movie.So let's start off with one major problem. The characters. No matter how you look at it there is not one character who gives a memorable performance or even one that is mediocre. They all feel very archetypal and mundane. The Toas all feel flat Jalah and Tekuah or however the hell you spell their names have voices and actions that make you either want to beat your head against a wall or strangle something nearby.Not to mention the boy who becomes the Toa of Light... is unworthy. If anything Jalah is more deserving of the title he didn't falter and give up in his quest he sacrificed EVERYTHING for his friend and even paid with his life at one point before they pulled a deus ex machina and brought him back to save someone. What did Tekuah the Toa of Light do? Beat Makuta in a game.That's it. Truly a hero to go down in the history books.The animation is sub par at best. The characters look accurate to their toys but they move about awkwardly and not as freely as they should. The constant use of slowmotion is an eyesore and gets old QUICK and the battle scenes leave something to be desired. All the fights feel anticlimactic and like they have 20 minutes of better fighting footage but don't use it for God knows what reason.It's a shameless plug to sell more toys. But even that's not an excuse for this poor excuse for a film. We saw the same thing with Ninja Turtles and Transformers but those at the very least had likable characters with an increasingly interesting storyline especially with the films. This? This is just bad. And I mean BAD.So please. Play with some Bionicles if you want to have some fun they're really cool. But for the love of everything that is holy don't watch this movie.

Moreover anyone who does not put the charismatic career of Richard Wagner into the context of the 1848 revolutions and beyond seems fated to misunderstand the revolution parallel to the political unrest that creative artistsLiszt Wagner and so many otherslived through in Europe. The biography may not be perfect but it is based on Bertita Harding's wellwritten Scenes about the life of Richard Wagner so as with Young Bess one might expect as is true that such a fictionalized biography would be far more interesting than the life at some places see also The Great Ziegfield The Glenn Miller Story. The film was directed by the great William Dieterle and it is an undeniable masterpiece in many ways with stunningly beautiful scenes rich colors and intelligent acting he was a Wagnerophile of course. The narrative takes young rebellious and ambitious Wagner from his youth trying to start as a composer to his death in Bayreuth noted by the world. In between we see Wagner Alan Badel in many guisesas rebel husband ardent pursuer jailed pauper aspiring champion of a new music for a new Age conductor hero exile composer friend and more. His first wife wants him to conduct a choir and live quietly with her and his Newfoundland Robber pretty Yvonne de Carlo the woman who champions him lovely Valentina Cortese must give him up since she is the wife of a jealous man Peter Cushing and his second wife Cosima Liszt daughter of Franz Liszt Carlos Thompson played at awardlevel by gorgeous Rita Gam makes him an idol and devotes her life to him even going against her father who has now taken holy vows. At the end Wagner's individualism turns into the usual mysticismhe a sybarite advocates renunciationbut the real story lies in the sensitivity and intelligence of the man who challenged the music world's doltish old gods and forced them to adopt leitmotifsmeaningful themesin place of longwinded musical tylenol pieces heavy in chromatics and lacking a central purpose. The bright script filled with good short dialogue scenes was the work of David Chantler and Ewald Andre Dupont. In the cast besides the principals are Gerhard Riedmann as touching Ludwig the Mad Erik Schuman as Hans Von Bulow powerful Frederick Valk Charles Regnier Robert Freitag and many other European actors. This is a different age an age of monarchs powerstruggles and formal music formal costume formal manners. Artists then needed a patronand this was Wagner's problem and his ultimate personal challenge he resented the need for such a being and found himself comfortable pursuing the position and the material goods accompanying it. He was impossible and kind honest and in denial hardworking and vain but unlike most central characters he was worth making an attractive film about. Ernest Haller provided cinematography the many costumes were the work of Ursula Maes. Robert Herith did fine and consistent art direction. In the central role Alan Badel is often good and he understood the character of Wagner very well. Cortese Valk and Regnier are very good and Carlos Thompson very powerful as Franz Liszt. This is a lovely film miles above almost anything else like it . To its attractions we owe the few films about serious musical artists that followed it. A groundbreaking effort.".

	schema:headline " How to Destroy a Potentially Very Importnt Biography";
	schema:reviewBody "To understand all the things that are wrong with this film and why they are so requires locating the film soundtrack on LP only issued more than a quartercentury after the film itself and reading the stupendously informative cover notes by the son of the film's music director Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Others have commented on the disjointedness and episodic nature of what they have seen but may not realize that the film was made at a huge cost by Republic which had assets frozen in Europe that could only be spent there and so decided to make an allout spectacular movie that no one in their right mind could ever have expected from the studio so associated with Serials Westerns and John Wayne. They hired one of the best directors in the business Wiliam Dieterle then the arguably leading film composer of his time Korngold to make a cohesive whole of the musical excerpts seen and heard and the Wagnerian leitmotifs used for the film score itself and finally some quite first rate actors for the leading roles. The problem is the finished film ran almost double the length of the issued one and what we can no longer see are all the scenes that almost certainly caused the film to seem so disjointed and episodic. At its original length a film on an opera composer could not find firstrun bookings then distributors fought each cut version for further emasculation the result being that well over an hour was cut from a film that eventually ran about 92 minutes. There are only about six or seven minutes of Wagner's music heard in the entire film and even those have been bowdlerized into something somewhat unrecognizable even to Wagnerites I should know having been one for about 65 years now. I saw this movie originally around 1957 or 1958 as the bottom half of a doublebill at a 42nd Street grindhouse this when 42nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues was not a place for the faintofheart and certainly not for films about opera and at the time I had never even heard of the film so I imagine it had no opening of note in New York City maybe no opening at all. I thought it dull then and anyone who wasn't enamored of Wagner must have found it downright stultifying. Upon learning the reasons for my dissatisfaction a quartercentury later with those LP notes I wanted to see it again and now finally have. What remains is semiterrific for the most part but what is not there will destroy any enjoyment of the film for those not in the know. We find Wagner claiming that his opera Rienzi will make his name. It did but not in this film where it is never mentioned again and in which the next scene takes place with Wagner in debtor's prison! We find no indication of his first wife's growing instability close to madness. When he falls in love and runs off with Cosima the wife of one of his most fervent supporters the conductor Hans von Bulow she is also the daughter of his lifelong friend and supporter Franz Liszt we see them living together then much later on married but no mention is made of their four children three of whom were born before the Bulows divorced nor that Bulow remained a steadfast advocate of Wagner for the remainder of his life. Mad King Ludwig doesn't seem very mad at all and less interesting for not being so. We find Wagner getting an idea for an opera and seemingly accomplishing its writing in a few weeks while we know that MEISTERSINGER TRISTAN UND ISOLDE and THE RING OF THE NIBELUNGS gestated for years even decades the lastnamed consuming some 20 years of the composer's life. The performances are excellent. It's hard to imagine a more visually and dramatically perfect Wagner than Alan Badel except that he was of fairly normal height and Wagner was 5' 1 far better than in his introductory John the Baptist in Salome three years earlier. Carlos Thompson is marvelous as the older Liszt he should have had a better career than he did. Yvonne De Carlo is pretty good as the composer's first wife catching rather well her essential commonness of character compared with the rather overwhelmingly characterful Richard Wagner who was arguably the greatest artistic genius musical or otherwise of the entire 19th century and Rita Gam has the best moments of her entire film career as the rather dauntingly intelligent Cosima a worthy companion for her loverhusband. That she is about 250 times better looking than the original Cosima need not concern us here. Anyway knowing the film's troubled postproduction background has made me much more appreciative of what is left to see all of which is visually gorgeous and expensive looking. The tragedy of the film is that you can plug in the holes to a large extent admire all aspects of the production and then realize what a terrific film was probably left on the cutting room floor.".

	schema:reviewBody "To film industry Richard Wagner an emblematic German composer of the 19th century is rather known as a supporting character the most memorable portrayal being the one by Trevor Howard in Visconti's LUDWIG. The film by William Dieterle a name already known for THE LIFE OF EMIL ZOLA THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME with Laughton MAGIC FIRE called by some choppy and episodic puts the composer in the lead though being no biopic. And as soon as this far whilst reviewing such a film we have to keep in mind the very period of its filming. Otherwise an expectation appears if it is a movie about a composer we foresee something unconventional something intriguing neurotic perhaps a but shocking and vibrant...but that would be a product in the mode of Milos Forman's AMADEUS made 30 years later but never in the morally ordered explicit films in the mode of 'school lesson' from the postwar period. From the very opening shots we do not need very learned viewers to predict it is far from 'a radiant stronghold of film art' far from a faithful biopic far from a thought provoking interpretation and yet being an open minded viewer one may find some strengths in Dieterle's film. Where do these strengths lie? Firstly it is in the entire visual aspect. Although the film cannot boast such a perfect digital restoration as some other products of its time it offers images hard to skip. Exceptional subtlety in images skillful handling of cinematography by Ernest Haller some camera frames and elaborate costumes with splendid shots of idyllic nature may equal to most aesthetic screen experiences. Note for instance the scenes between Richard Wagner Alan Badel and Mathilde Valentina Cortese one being among the deleted scenes added to the disc as a bonus material. The glamor of palaces and elaborate interiors supply viewers with visual aestheticism. Great credit to art director Robert Herlth.Secondly it is the educational use of Wagner's operas throughout. While the episodic character of the movie where the action takes place in different cities of Europe including Zuerich Dresden Venice and Paris and the stories would perfectly affect the portmanteau concept the stage scenes with the performances of Walkuere Siegfried Tannhaeuser and other great works of the composer help viewers at least get to know the most significant masterpieces of our protagonist. In that respect a note must be made of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and his significant contribution to the music in the film.Thirdly the film reached for the stars in one aspect some performances. Here however in accordance with another title of the movie we have our protagonist Richard Wagner played by Alan Badel and three women he loves Minna Planer his wife Yvonne DeCarlo Cosima Rita Gam and Mathide Valentina Cortese. In addition there is one man the famous composer Franz Liszt played by Carlos Thompson. While women appear to evoke jealousy at love the composer evokes jealousy at work the creative conflicts are much more effectively developed in LUST FOR LIFE another film of the 1950s but about a painter not a musician. All the tensions however appear pale and flat. Alan Badel portrays Wagner quite well but indeed there is nothing special about him either. Seemingly identifying with Mozart and Beethoven as he mentions quite often the viewer could have got a clearer perception of his genius. Yet his goes flat too seriously. One performance stands on its own and appears to be highly underrated...it is Valentina Cortese's. She does not only look beautiful in the role wearing splendid costumes but combines all features that any composer and anyone would easily fall in love with. Pity she is given so little time on screen and some scenes with her are as I have already mentioned deleted.And king Ludwig? As the film is not at all any historical or biographical aid and the figure is in the shadow of the composer which puts in contrast the historical backbone presence of the composer in the king's life Riedmann's portrayal will always remain pale and incomparable to the king's later screen incarnates...just an episodic performance indeed.I consider this film one among ordinary works which only tries to reach for the stars no magic fire within viewing experience. Nevertheless a production you can hardly tire of as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Simply one of the best hard boiled noir films I have seen. Sterling Hayden is as usual excellent while a very young Charles Bronson is surprisingly good as a 'punk' hood. Seems to feature nearly all scenes as location or handheld camera and it seems at times like a particularly effective episode of a 50s TV cop show  except that the content is much more brutal and sharp. This is a dark dark film both in storyline and in the quite brilliant photography. I'd really love to see this neglected classic come out on a restored print on DVD. Isn't it time Criterion updated their 'noir' list? This cries out for restoration and a rerelease.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is excellent example of film noir almost everything you'd want in this genre. Right from the opening shot this had noir written all over it by cinematographer Bert Glennon and from opening holdupmurder scene at the gas station you knew you were in for a rough ride.Speaking of rough I can't think of too many actors who were better and more suited for noir than Sterling Hayden who delivers yet another uncompromising hardheaded tough guy character. This time he's a cop Det. Lt. Sims and one with no use for any con even if the guy in this case Gene Nelson's Steve Lacey has cleaned up his act. It wasn't just the photography and Haden the entire cast was fascinating and it's simply a fastmoving entertaining film. Andre de Toth's direction also was terrific. He directed only one other noir Pitfall another great film that we are still waiting to see on DVD. At least this film finally made it to disc.I had forgotten what classic beauty Phyllis Kirk possessed. Wow what a face! She starred as Nora Charles on the popular Thin Man television series in the '50s. In here she plays Lacey's wife Ellen. Rather that going through the whole cast I'll just say it was a hoot to see Timothy Carey again even if his role was limited. This guy played the most whackedout minor characters I've ever seen in movies. See The Killing for a good example of what I mean. Jay Novello as the veterinarian excon also was really interesting.I'll tell you what else was nice the realistic scenes with actual locations around Los Angeles in the early '50s. This movie had a number of handheld camera shots. Even the holdup in the bank was done in a real bank. There are few if any hokey studio shots in this movie. It's the real deal..... and very much recommended. Combined with Decoy on the same disc it makes for a nice doublefeature for a night of noir.".

This title ranks up there with White Heat as one of the best crime thrillers using the City of Angels as its locale. After renting Kubrick's The Killing on DVD I jumped at the chance to see another heist film with Sterling Hayden in my opinion the meanest S.O.B. Noir actor. He is awesome as usual in this movie with his characteristic scowl frozen on his face. Also for a film made half a century ago it has remarkably stood up to the test of time quite well. It's really a lean mean little crime thriller. Please whoever owns the rights to this gem release this forgotten classic on DVD!! You still have the chance to release a 50th anniversary edition this year!!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's too bad Andre De Toth didn't contribute more to the noir cycle because on the evidence he was a natural plus he was married to earlynoir icon Veronica Lake.  The Pitfall made in 1948 looks more and more like one of the best and most central movies in the cycle but except for the early more gothic Dark Waters De Toth only returned to it once with Crime Wave. Its story is not a fresh one  an excon trying to go straight Gene Nelson is coerced by circumstances to aid and abet a gang of his former cellmates. The uncomfortable spot he finds himself in lies between them and the law personified by Sterling Hayden as a tough unforgiving police detective. There's much more attention to character in the film's hourandaquarter running time than in many fulllength features of the era Jay Novello as an alcoholic veterinarian who doubles as an underworld sawbones is especially memorable.  By any reckoning Crime Wave is a minor film  even a minor second feature  but De Toth lavishes easy expertise on it it's surprisingly well paced well shot as well interestingly cut.  Why so many talented directors many of them refugees from Europe were relegated in the 1950s to genre movies  crime dramas 3D schlockfests and westerns  is a puzzle.  In any case I'd give any three of De Toth's westerns AND his House of Wax for just one more film noir boasting his directorial credit.".

What will Steve Lacey do?Crime Wave is an excellent filmnoir with the story of a man trying to start a new life and haunted by his former cellmates. The cinematography in black and white is impressive and very beautiful. The direction of Andr De Toth is perfect and Sterling Hayden has an amazing performance in the role of a tough homicide detective. Indeed all the cast has also great performance.

This is a great little filmbe sure and catch it if you ever see it on the schedule!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "There's something particularly pleasing about a relatively short low budget movie which has the power to make a great impact and Crime Wave a.k.a. The City Is Dark  Don't Cry Baby is just such a movie. It's very well acted has interesting characters and maintains a lively pace throughout. The story's main protagonist is an excon who's trying desperately to go straight and neither the cops nor the criminals believe in his determination or ability to do so. He's pressured and threatened by both and this puts him in a tight spot because if he cooperates with the criminals he'll inevitably fall back into a life of crime and if he doesn't he and his wife could find themselves in mortal danger.Since serving out a prison sentence Steve Lacey Gene Nelson has been successful in avoiding further trouble. He's married to Ellen Phyllis Kirk has his own apartment and also a wellpaid job as an airplane mechanic. His problems begin when one of his excell mates turns up at his home. Gat Morgan Ned Young who's seriously injured is carrying a gun and Steve and Ellen are forced to let him stay. Shortly after Dr Otto Hessler Jay Novelloarrives to attend to Gat's gunshot wound but it's too late as Gat dies before the doctor can help. Hessler takes the dead man's money to cover his costs and leaves.At the same time LAPD Detective Lieutenant Sims Sterling Hayden has been able to confirm that the three men who had just carried out a gas station robbery and killed a motorcycle cop were a group of escaped convicts who'd broken out of San Quentin. He has a hunch that the men will contact their old cell mate and so arrests Steve and takes him in for questioning. Steve insists that he's unable to help and is eventually released.Steve's situation then gets worse when the other two gang members Doc Penny Ted de Corsia and Ben Hastings Charles Bronson turn up at his apartment. Hastings takes Steve's car and goes to Hessler's place where he kills the doctor and then has to escape on foot because a passerby had witnessed the murder. As soon as the car found close to the murder scene is identified as Steve's he becomes the focus of a police manhunt. Penny and Hastings then force Steve to help them carry out a bank robbery and the tension builds steadily because Steve has tipped off the cops and also the heist doesn't go according to plan.Sims and Hessler are the two strongest characters in Crime Wave. Sims is big tough and permanently dishevelled and habitually chews toothpicks to help him give up smoking. He's intimidating and deeply cynical and doesn't believe that Steve or any excon can be rehabilitated. His unsophisticated method of operation simply involves bullying and threatening everyone regardless of whether they happen to be suspects or witnesses and Sterling Hayden gives an immensely powerful performance in this role.Dr Hessler is a very believable underground physician a man who's no longer able to practice medicine legitimately and who's turned his attentions to caring for animals instead. He's obviously suffered some misfortune in the past and consoles himself by turning to the bottle. His genuine fondness of animals is a positive quality which goes some way to balance out such actions as relieving a dead patient of his albeit stolen money. Jay Novello does well in bringing out the different aspects of Hessler's character so vividly.The visual style of this movie is quite striking and the nocturnal scenes are particularly well framed and lit. The shadowy streets add powerfully to the atmosphere of the piece and the use of so many location shots is effective in strengthening the movie's strong sense of realism. Crime Wave is very enjoyable on a number of levels and certainly merits greater recognition than it's been given in the past.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crime Wave has the makings for something quite simple as a movie. Its story is about cops and criminals and a few ordinary folks trying to get by. A few criminals the main ones played by Ted de Corsia and a young Charles Bronson are out of San Quentin and shoot a gas station attendant and cop. On the lam they hold up with also excon Steve Lacey decent leading man Gene Nelson with his wife but what they don't know is that he's already been tapped by the cops specifically Sterling Hayden's Detective Sims who is so hardnosed he could cut through bricks with just a stare and some tough words. It all leads up to one of those heists that just can't go right for the bad guys but what about the good couple caught in the middle? It is fairly straightforward and it could have been in other hands. But there's something about Andre De Toth as director that stands Crime Wave out as a piece of lean noir cuisine. The way it's shot is one thing as his European influence comes through in a lot of the exteriors and his way of utilizing natural lighting and real locations or just how he has someone like a room that looks too real like Sims' office. His camera has a distinct tone to it even when sets or usual shots in moving cars have to be done and it cuts through the BS and keeps one riveted even as one knows what's going to happen the last couple of minutes with Sims and the Lacey's are one of them.It also can't be stressed how awesome an actor Sterling Hayden is. In everything he just brings that umph that is required whether it's to a hoodlum or a psychotic or a corrupt cop and in Crime Wave his authority as a presence six foot five inches and his pattern of speech play off well against the rest of the usual character actors save maybe for Charles Bronson since he too is unique even at a young age and creepy character actor Timothy Carey as the man put on watch of Mrs. Lacey. Overall Crime Wave is a procedural that snaps and crackles and pops for 72 minutes and allows fans of classic film noir to soak up the atmosphere and have a good time seeing the coppers close in on the crooks who as almost always is the case don't stand a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crime Wave opens with a gang of criminals carrying out a robbery at a gasoline station in the course of which a police officer is killed and one of the gangsters wounded. The wounded man makes his way to the home of Steve Lacey a former associate of some of the gang but dies before medical help can arrive. This turns Lacey's life upsidedown. Although he is a former convict he has been trying to start a new life he has found an honest job as an aircraft mechanic and has married a woman who supports his determination to go straight. Soon Lacey is approached by the surviving gang members. Although he wants nothing to do with them his fears for this own safety and that of his wife mean that he is forced to allow them to stay in his apartment and reluctantly agrees to assist them with a planned bank robbery.There are a number of similarities with another film noir Sam Fuller's Pickup on South Street which came out the previous year. That film too had a central figure who was an exconvict and in both films the police are shown in a less that positive light. The police officers in Pickup on South Street are not idealised heroes but flawed characters with little compunction about bullying suspects or bribing informers to get information. The main police character in Crime Wave Detective Lieutenant Sims is a similar figure ruthless hardnosed and lacking in human warmth. Sims does not believe in the possibility of rehabilitation or reform and hence is very suspicious of Lacey even though his parole officer is willing to vouch for the young man's reformed character. A surprise development late in the film however does enable us to see Sims in a rather more sympathetic way.Director Andr De Toth was not primarily known as a noir director he seems to have specialised more in Westerns but here he reveals himself to have been a competent director of crime dramas even an innovative one. He shot much of the film on location in Los Angeles making use of both city landmarks such as City Hall and of more humble buildings. The gas station which the villains hold up was for example a real one. This use of real city locations for added realism seems to have started a trend in film noir one film said to have been influenced by this one was Stanley Kubrick's The Killing which used several of the same actors.Crime Wave was made as a second feature which explains why it is so short at just over 70 minutes in length. De Toth however was able to turn the film's short runningtime to his advantage as it has a terseness and gripping sense of tension lacking in some more expansive dramas. A number of typical noir features are present such as the moody blackandwhite photography with a number of scenes taking place at night or in low levels of lighting. An alternative title for the film is The City is Dark. Another such feature is the sense of moral ambiguity hanging over the storyline with an exconvict turning out to be more heroic than the official guardians of law and order. The film does not however feature that stock noir character the seductive but villainous femme fatale the only major female character is Lacey's courageous and virtuous wife Ellen played by Phyllis Kirk with her sweetly innocent girlnextdoor prettiness.I would not rate the film quite as highly as Pickup on South Street one of the greatest of all films noirs. There are no acting contributions quite on the same level as those of Richard Widmark Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter in the earlier film although Sterling Hayden is very effective as Sims. Another wellknown face is a young Charles Bronson credited under his real name of Charles Buchinsky as one of the gangsters. Fuller's film also has a greater moral complexity. Whereas Lacey is a reformed character who has gone straight and become a model citizen Widmark's character Skip McCoy is at the beginning of the film far from reformed in the very first scene we see him stealing a wallet from a young woman on the subway. Crime Wave however is a tense wellpaced and wellmade crime drama and for something which began life as a Bmovie a remarkably influential one. 710".

	schema:headline " A film noircrime drama gem";
	schema:reviewBody "With a diverse taste in film hopefully spreading across all genres and all decades crime dramas are right up my street even the dark and gritty ones.'The City is Dark' as credited here in the UK rather than 'Crime Wave' prefer the latter title personally is as dark and gritty as one can get and is as far from glamorous pretty seedy actually too but that is what makes it the little film noircrime drama gem it is. It isn't quite a masterpiece but 'The City is Dark' at its best is excellent and deserves far more exposure than it's gotten. Maybe it is a little too short and it does cram in a lot in a short running time perhaps a little too much in places. However it is never dull and one is kept on the edge of their seat throughout.Its production values are superb with gritty but also pretty sumptuous cinematography and suitably seedy settings. Atmospheric lighting too. The haunting score by David Buttolph adds a lot as does the taut direction by generally underappreciated Andre De Toth. It is interesting to hear the Gershwin brothers classic S Wonderful on the radio sung by none other by Doris Day and no despite how that sounds it's not out of place at all.Writing is tight and suspenseful with a lot of thoughtprovoking moments. The story is just as tense and is basically a gritty look at police methods the criminal world and the difficulties crooks face when reforming compellingly told.Very strong cast with an excellent Sterling Hayden and Gene Nelson who considering the stuff he's most famous for dancing and musicals completely different kettle of fish one wouldn't expect to work at all but he does. Phyllis Kirk is good support as is a slimy Jay Novello and the terrifying support of Ted De Corsia and Timothy Carey. A young Charles Bronson also does a good job.Overall it is a shame that 'The City is Dark' is as underrated as it is because it really is a very good film with very little to dislike. 810 Bethany Cox".

It isn't quite a masterpiece but 'The City is Dark' at its best is excellent and deserves far more exposure than it's gotten.

There was a drift in the 1950s from highly controlled studio to highly controlled location shooting and then as we see here to a slightly looser location style that used more of the ambient qualities. It isn't quite cinema verite or some other documentaryinfluenced style more common in Europe and it may be more a product of budget than aesthetics but it really works. It's most of all realistic.Director Andre De Toth handles all the moving elements with fast precision. The photography is by necessity smart and crisp but the lighting is less dramatic less noir you might say than most crime films. But again this is a indication of where the industry was moving on on De Toth's intentions to avoid over stylizing. Other mid 1950s crime films also show shifts from the dramatics of the noirs that define the genre one example being another Sterling Hayden The Killing directed by Kubrick two years later. The use of identifiable locations for the shoots is part of their unique draw. In Crime Wave the L.A. streets are used in a simple unhyped way.The story is a meat and potatoes police drama with Hayden working the homicide squad. He's terse and experienced and has the thugs in his sights almost from the start. This puts a lot of the focus on the bad guys and they come off as highly believable. They do crimes to survive without romanticizing the criminal and with lots of little mistakes and harping back and forth. And they know they are on the run dragging a couple of innocent people along for the terrifying ride.".

De Toth was given a one off film deal with Warners to make a big budget film BogieCagney and Ava Gardner were proposed for this particular venture to be filmed over 35 days De Toth said he didn't want any of them and insisted he could make the film in 15 days with Sterling Hayden in the lead role of Det. Lt. Sims De Toth's insistence paid off and he brought the completed film home two days ahead of schedule despite this the film was shelved for 2 years and when eventually released failed at the box office up until about ten years ago it was pretty much a forgotten film with only one print known to exist. Filmed pretty much all on location around Los Angeles in a stunning verite style by Bert Glennon the film has some truly stunning nightscapes with some very inventive lighting and tells the tale of Steve LaceyGene Nelson an ex con but a good guy at heart who is now married to the stalwart EllenPhyllis Kirk and is successfully going straight. Lacey receives a late night phone call from someone who doesn't identify themselves Lacey worries that its his past come back to haunt him he isn't wrong within minutes a wounded ex cell mate of his from San Quentin is at his door looking for refuge his wounds the results of a nearby brutal killing of a policeman at a gas station holdup. Before Lacey can do anything his guest dies he rings his parole officer looking for help but before he can do the right thing the belligerent toothpick chewing Sims arrives at his door determined to pin the crime on him the dead body only compounds Lacey's fate. Hayden is superb in the role and gives a very naturalistic performance in what is in some ways a semi documentary style of film there's also a host of great supporting roles for the likes of Ted de Corsia and Charles Bronson who complete the hold up gang and also a really entertaining and utterly scene stealing performance by the truly psychotic Timothy Carey. Crime Wave is really well paced hard boiled Noir and at a paltry 73 minutes it passes all too quickly it also has the distinction of being a rather important influence on Kubrick's The Killing which has a similar look and also most of the same cast. As my first viewing from the newly released Warner Film Noir Volume 4 boxset I found it an unmitigated success there's also a hilarious and very entertaining commentary from Noir luminaries Eddie Muller and James Ellroy although the latters barking like a dog does grate just a little".

And like most noir you get straight into it  the film's opening holdupmurder scene at the gas station lets you know you're going to be in for a rough ride. Speaking of rough Sterling Hayden was perfectly cast as the hardheaded tough cop. The rest of the cast which includes an eyecatching Charles Bronson were pretty good as well. At times I thought Gene Nelson could show a bit more enthusiasm but he did his job nonetheless.Scenes were filmed on location which was impressive. As was the fact that the movie was filmed in 13 days. Wow. The story isn't fresh but you get stuck in right away and are with Steve Lacey as he struggles to keep himself and his wife away from the criminals who drag him into their plans for a bank robbery. The dialogue is classic noir. It's a shame that this movie is another forgotten noir film. I mean it's not The Maltese Falcon but it sure as hell is worth watching.Crime Wave is a minor film but one worth watching  it is surprisingly well shot paced and interestingly cut. An excellent example of the low budget crime dramas that Hollywood churned out during the 50's I was a little underwhelmed by the ending. The cop just kind of has a complete switch of character when he tells the husband and wife duo that they are free and won't be bothered with. It seemed like a typical rushed ending that we get from a lot of B movie noirs.My Rating 710Final Word SatisfactoryFull Review httpcineranter.wordpress.com20140824moviereview crimewave".

That said without the exceptional acting talents of people like Sterling Hayden Phyllis Kirk and a very young Charles Bronson this film would've come off as strictly amateurish at best. The plot is almost too simple and there's virtually no twists unlike other movies of this genre. The only brief surprise is when all the bad guys get mowed down at the end due to the actions of a police informant. Since these fellows deserve what's coming to them the audience sheds no tears. Sterling Hayden's role as Detective Sims is straight out of Dragnet. He's a fast talker only wants the facts and chain smokes cigarettes when he's not chomping on a toothpick. If he isn't a parody of an LA police detective I don't know who is. If there's any real allure to this film it's the blackandwhite cinematography of a 1950s Los Angeles. The city is barely recognizable except for the old City Hall building which sticks out in several scenes. There's no smog no traffic and no sunlight in this version of Los Angeles. No wonder there's a crime wave. Of special note is the casting of the great Timothy Carey in an uncredited part as a grinning maniacal thug. His wildeyed lunacy is just the thing needed to perk up the proceedings and add some muchneeded color.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before its announcement for DVD release as part of the fourth installment of Warners The Film Noir Collection where it was greeted with cheers of anticipation I have to admit that I wasnt aware this particular title had that much of a reputation  despite the director and star Sterling Hayden involved.

	schema:reviewBody "Crime Wave is directed by Andre De Toth and adapted to screenplay by Bernard Gordon Crane Wilbur and Richard Wormser from the story Criminal's Mark written by John and Ward Hawkins. It stars Sterling Hayden Gene Nelson Phyllis Kirk Ted de Corsia Charles Bronson Jay Novello and Timothy Carey. Music is by David Buttolph and cinematography by Bert Glennon. Exconvict Steve Lacey Nelson finds himself reluctantly dragged into illegal activities when old criminal associates come calling and hold his wife Ellen Kirk hostage. Driven and unmerciful Detective Lieutenant Sims Hayden doesn't believe criminals can reform and goes after Steve with hardnosed prejudice putting the Lacey's well being in great jeopardy. Tough as old hobnail boots Crime Wave is a noir caper awash with moral ambiguities and reformation quandaries. Set to the backdrop of a sweaty Los Angeles populated by grizzled coppers and psychotic thugs de Toth marshals a fine cast through a screenplay ripe with interesting characters afforded quirky and beefy dialogue. The director backed by top cinematographer Glennon utilise the L.A. locations to the full giving the plot a gritty realism that was often missing in other 1950s caper movies. Ace card in the pack is Hayden given full license by de Toth he stomps around like a toothpick chewing bear with a sore head you do not want this Sterling Hayden on your case! Kirk deserves plaudits as well as the fulcrum femme she has to contend with not only Hayden's bullying of her husband but also the mucky attentions of de Corsia's gang headed by a wonderfully leering Bronson she shifts through the emotional gears without histrionics and the characterisation is more believable because of it. Truth is is that all the cast work well under their director's guidance even Carey's hyper attention seeking sits well in the context of the film's noir peccadilloes. A well stocked noir stew boosted considerably by fine direction why didn't de Toth do more noir? and Hayden being on iconic form. 7.510".

A dark and moody film that was adapted from a short story that was written by William Gibson. I was surprised by how intriguing and interesting the movie was. I have heard so many negative things about this production that I was a little leery in watching it. But I was impressed by the story acting and directing.Christopher Walken and Wilhem Dafoe are two losers who are always looking for rich people to swindle. One day they find the perfect pigeon who'll make them a lot of money. But they need a seductress. They find one in Asia Argento who's smoking hot in this movie. During the bug hustle Dafoe falls for her and the two make a side swindle. Unfortunately nothing is really as it seems. Instead of running off with Asia Dafoe tries to play all sides but he winds up with nothing. Before he can split his mentor Walken kills himself before the hit men can ice him. Dafoe realizes that he's be burned by a better con artist and flees. Hiding from everyone Dafoe spends the rest of his pathetic life hiding out in a derelict apartment complex The New Rose Hotel where he relives the last month of his life over and over until he ends it all.Even though we never see what happens to Dafoe's character one can assume what happens to him. He has nowhere to go but inside the coffin he's created. The movie is a serious character study about not knowing what you could have and how greed and stupidity make a dangerous combination. I found this movie to be very deep and moving as well. But it's not for everyone.Highly recommended.".

The small cast's intimate conversations which are woven together into a disjointed collage are the heart of the film.One might assume that this divergence from the original media's style would result in a derivative work that no longer held true to the essence of the original. This is wonderfully not the case.This is one of my favorite Ferrara films precisely because it translates the written work so aptly. This film is not intended for mass market appeal but is instead uncorrupted artistic expression. I do not believe that this film was intended by the director to be a financial success I wish it were so I could see more like it but to be an artistic success.The film is technically a science fiction work because it is set in the future. This is a future of gritty realism. The filth violence and crime of our present has not been washed away by the years. It is omnipresent as always. Ferrara has used very few special effects to indicate future technology as there was no need to do so. In the decadent underworld that is his setting said future tech is in cell phones and surveillance equipment which are subtle background not flashy foreground. There are no laser guns or flying cars.This is a story about memory and feeling. It has a tendency to be nonlinear. The music selected and performed in the film is a perfect compliment to the shadowy disjointed imagery. The acting from everyone including the three principals Walken Dafoe and Argento is superb. Ferrara films often involve small tightknit casts with soulful dialog and this is more of the director and his cast at their best.This is a film from a lover of film to lovers of film.".

	schema:headline " The only successful William Gibson adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "When making movies out of fiction most of the time it doesn't work unless the original text is purely telegraphic in style. If it's good prose it's not usually the larger actions that we see that make it good  it's something more ethereal within the style itself that give it quality. William Gibson's noirinfluenced technosatire would seem perfect for adaptation but anyone who's suffered through or even enjoyed JOHNNY MNEMONIC suddenly realizes that the characters' toughguy dialog sounds utterly preposterous when actually voiced by a human being.In NEW ROSE HOTEL director Abel Ferrara finds the emotional heart of a very spare Gibson short one of the best things Gibson's ever written and blessedly short on actual dialog and creates a recognizable near future world and characters who seem as comfortable with this subtly accelerated reality as we of 2005 are with plasmascreen TVs and mobile phones. The structure of the film can be extremely offputting to those without enormous patience  it's very slowpaced and halfway through we see the almost the entire story over again but very slightly changed. As far as I can tell most of the scenes were shot twice from different angles. The entire point of Abel Ferrara's approach is to visually represent the phrase If only I knew then what I know now. NEW ROSE HOTEL really needs to be seen at least twice to be understood and only lets go of the intelligence and daring of the direction and the performances after repeated viewings. Christopher Walken plays Christopher Walken under the guise of the character Fox but I've rarely seen Walken so simultaneously comfortable and affected in any other role. Willem Dafoe has to play younger than he looks and we get to watch his character learn what a fool he's been writhing with embarrassed disgust and fear as he discovers that the source of his predicament is his own stupidity and sentimentality. A very younglooking Asia Argento plays Sandii with more depth than she is regularly given credit for  her style is so subtle and genuine that she hardly seems to be acting and as far as I've seen she isn't but she's so sexy and vulnerable that I'm more than willing to watch.It's a shame this film is so underappreciated it's definitely my favorite Ferrara film and one of my top two Christopher Walken films. And lots of Asia in her underwear  what's not to love?".

William Gibson's noirinfluenced technosatire would seem perfect for adaptation but anyone who's suffered through or even enjoyed JOHNNY MNEMONIC suddenly realizes that the characters' toughguy dialog sounds utterly preposterous when actually voiced by a human being.In NEW ROSE HOTEL director Abel Ferrara finds the emotional heart of a very spare Gibson short one of the best things Gibson's ever written and blessedly short on actual dialog and creates a recognizable near future world and characters who seem as comfortable with this subtly accelerated reality as we of 2005 are with plasmascreen TVs and mobile phones. The structure of the film can be extremely offputting to those without enormous patience  it's very slowpaced and halfway through we see the almost the entire story over again but very slightly changed. As far as I can tell most of the scenes were shot twice from different angles. The entire point of Abel Ferrara's approach is to visually represent the phrase If only I knew then what I know now. NEW ROSE HOTEL really needs to be seen at least twice to be understood and only lets go of the intelligence and daring of the direction and the performances after repeated viewings. Christopher Walken plays Christopher Walken under the guise of the character Fox but I've rarely seen Walken so simultaneously comfortable and affected in any other role. Willem Dafoe has to play younger than he looks and we get to watch his character learn what a fool he's been writhing with embarrassed disgust and fear as he discovers that the source of his predicament is his own stupidity and sentimentality. A very younglooking Asia Argento plays Sandii with more depth than she is regularly given credit for  her style is so subtle and genuine that she hardly seems to be acting and as far as I've seen she isn't but she's so sexy and vulnerable that I'm more than willing to watch.It's a shame this film is so underappreciated it's definitely my favorite Ferrara film and one of my top two Christopher Walken films. And lots of Asia in her underwear  what's not to love?";

It's a single incident revolving around human emotions but having worldwide implications because the man is so brilliant he could change the course of science.The acting is great of course Willem Dafoe Christopher Walken and an early glimpse of Asia Argento. The story doesn't hit you over the head explaining events like most films but Ferrara never does and half the fun is suddenly realizing what's happened the check mate on your own.If you want action go see Johnny Mnemonic if you want deep see this film.".

Hiroshi Yoshitaka Amano a brilliant researcher is being observed by Fox Christopher Walken and X Willem Dafoe two corporate extraction specialists. Fox hopes to manipulate Hiroshi into leaving Maas the transnational corporation at which he works in favour for joining Hosaka a rival corporation. Whoever controls Hiroshi controls big bucks.What's odd about this surveillance footage though is that X is also being observed. So who if not Fox and X is ultimately behind the extraction of Hiroshi? And who is watching all three characters?Hotel's second scene takes place in a shadowy brothel. There's a war being waged for every shred of information Fox is told and the corporate suits are killing each other by the thousands every year. It's the Holocaust of the 21st century. Everybody knows nobody says anything and governments are just as culpable. The speaker then tries to sell Fox a job pushing cutting edge viruses but Fox ignores him more interested in the sultry female bodies gyrating in a corner. Moments later Fox has a conversation with Madam Rosa the brothel owner. I've given up looking for knowledge and virtue Fox admits the guy now existing solely to chase after cash and sex. This pursuit's gotten his back broken Fox limps with a cane. As Ferrara's camera zooms in on Fox a lounge singer stops singing about looking for love without love and starts singing about a woman whose soul's as black as black. Enter Sandii the smoky eyed Asia Argento a prostitute who takes to a microphone. I loved you for forever and a day but you walked away she prophetically sings. Fox gets an idea he'll use Sandii to seduce Hiroshi away from Maas. Afterall Fox says Hiroshi has everything  money riches status  except love. Fox will provide the love. But is Madam Rosa planting Sandii to get at Fox? Is Sandii ultimately seducing Fox and not Hiroshi? Fox X and Sandii begin putting their plan into motion. Along the way X falls in love with Sandii and she apparently with him. Let's make believe she says in their living room as she strokes Fox's ego under the guise of stroking Hiroshi's. Fox is hooked. She's his ticket to Hiroshi and Hiroshi on the brink of patenting high speed proteins is Fox's ticket to millions. We then learn that it is Madam Rosa supplying Fox with surveillance footage and that Madam Rosa is being bankrolled by Maas. Fox unaware that he is being setup remains optimistic. The new virtue Fox says is going to the edge. This plan takes us to the edge!Holding onto virtue becomes the dilemma of the film's last act. Here Sandii reveals that she is really in love with X and that she doesn't wish to continue a false relationship with Hiroshi. X in turn is madly in love with Sandii. The duo contemplate running away together. Whether Sandii is being genuine is unknown  she used the same words and ploy on Hiroshi  but this love affair be it real or simulated is nevertheless enough to set in motion a chain reaction X's handlers Fox and Hosaka and Sandii's real handlers Madam Rosa and Maas now deciding to do a little spring cleaning. Fox is thus killed possibly Sandii as well and assassins are sent for X. It is also revealed that Maas was allowing the defection of Hiroshi so that a virus carried by him infects all other scientists at Hosaka. This is the synthetic virus alluded to in Rosa's brothel a virus that may have been administered by Sandii.That Maas Maas more limitless has won this little game of corporate Darwinism is of no concern to Ferrara. Instead he devotes the last 30 minutes of his film to a massive flashback sequence. Here locking himself in a capsule hotel X rewinds and fast forwards through the film we have just watched searching memory engrams for clues that Sandii betrayed and so did not love him. A reversal of Ferrara's Blackout in which a character realizes that he was blind to and so missed the virtues of lovers around him Hotel portrays X indulging in a game of selective memory and mental rewriting. Whereas most climactic flashback sequences seek to quickly and dramatically draw attention to clues which audiences may have overlooked Ferrara's flashback takes the form of a slow pathetic descent into not revelation but delusion. By its end X has misread clues has misconstrued Sandii's love as deception has convinced himself that Sandii was never genuine and has rationalised that it was he who had been used and betrayed rather than her. If you want to you can walk away Fox sees himself telling Sandii the very challenge she in actuality put to him. More importantly Fox has begun eradicating his belief in virtue. If everyone around you wants something X rationalises then nobody could possibly want to give you anything let alone love. By the film's end X's philosophy How much more money must you make? What else is ahead? has been replaced by Fox's cynicism That's lust not love! and Sandii whom X refused to run away with out of loyalty to Fox's ethos becomes the little girl betrayed and lost on the altar of profit.New Rose Hotel was based on a short story by cyberpunk novelist William Gibson. Like Gibson's novels it is set in a high tech future rife with social decay warring factions technologysavvy lowlives corporate prostitutes killer DNA research which advances faster than it can be stolen and shady bodies who have long realised that the best way to control the opposition is to finance it. Typical of Gibson's work the tale relies heavily on noir tropes.8.510  Underrated. See the similarly themed Demonlover and Boarding Gate.".

What else is ahead? has been replaced by Fox's cynicism That's lust not love! and Sandii whom X refused to run away with out of loyalty to Fox's ethos becomes the little girl betrayed and lost on the altar of profit.New Rose Hotel was based on a short story by cyberpunk novelist William Gibson. Like Gibson's novels it is set in a high tech future rife with social decay warring factions technologysavvy lowlives corporate prostitutes killer DNA research which advances faster than it can be stolen and shady bodies who have long realised that the best way to control the opposition is to finance it. Typical of Gibson's work the tale relies heavily on noir tropes.8.510  Underrated. See the similarly themed Demonlover and Boarding Gate.";

Can you blame me? After hacking off all the stylistic coir the story is as such it's the Future. The most profitable form of industrial espionage is stealing human talent. Two threadbare hijack artists played by Walken and Dafoe will lure a brilliant scientist named Hiroshi from Evil Megacorp to Mega Evilcorp. They will use a magnetic temptress that they pick from a squirming Shinjuku flesh pit based on her skill at fellating a karaoke mic.Asia Argento is the girl  the actress has the rarity of rarities! not only sex appeal but enough charisma and acting ability to work the part. Unfortunately the singing is bad and the songs are bad and the sexy bar where they are performed is not very sexy at all. While we're at it the future is not all that futuristic. The sex of which there is plenty is made up of cuts quick pans and motion blur. The seduction and abduction of Hiroshi is talked about exhaustively but would have been pedestrian even if it didn't entirely take place offcamera. In brief the amount of abstraction and suspension required to enjoy  if I may use such a bold term  New Rose Hotel hangs some serious lifting on the viewer. Discounting the bland nudity the only distinct pleasure is watching Christopher Walken's line delivery. The one other actor who gets to do anything of note is his partner in crime Willem Dafoe unfortunately his arc comes down to getting warned severely against falling in love with Argento's character then falling in love with her like a man taking a headfirst dive on a concrete slab.Some people have called this movie confusing but they are dumb. The plot is crystal clear. It's simple as a triangle. Others have called it a boring flickering mess which is a much harder charge to beat. You know those reveal montages where the main character figures out the horrible secret? They're all made up the same way with ominous music getting louder in the background snippets of flashback picked halfsecond at a time from various parts of the movie and key lines of dialogue played over and over with an echo effect added on top. The entire movie plays like one of those. A relatively simple story is packed inside a fifteenlayered rebus of headache eyestrain and tinnitus as you squint to figure out what's on screen. If this is how the regular narrative plays then as a parting fillip the entire last half hour of the movie is made up of an actual flashback montage as one of the characters soon to be found and killed by his enemies is reliving past mistakes and pleasures in a dinky hotel room. Some have complained about this sequence because it goes on for about 20 minutes after even the densest of us have figured out every plot secret. I think they're missing the point  the scene isn't a reveal but the fevered looping memories of a man who's about to kick off the chair. As such it has a good deal of pathos. However in the end it's not really all that interesting goodlooking or original. And way way too long.The central question of New Rose Hotel is as follows is there any reason at all to watch this dizzy 90minute montage when you could read the original short story in 15 minutes? None actually. Unless you are enough of a stim addict to prefer watching any sort of dull video to reading any kind of engaging prose.".

	schema:reviewBody "New Rose Hotel is based on the short story of the same name by William Gibson.  While the film is supposed to be set in the tech infested world of Gibson's stories it fails to convey this feeling with only a few pieces of technology presented visually.  More importantly however the film is terribly written and directed.  It seems obvious that Gibson's story should have been followed in a more literal manner as the story finds the narrator Dafoe's character reminiscing in his coffin in the New Rose Hotel talking to Sandii as though she can hear him.  Instead we are subjected to the story twice the second time around in the form of flashbacks.  I imagine the flashbacks are supposed to clarify the disorganized mess that Ferrara weaves in the first half of the film.  Perhaps the film appeals to the art crowd but don't let them fool you.  It's a terrible movie putting to waste the incredible talents of Walken and Dafoe. Gibson's writing is densely descriptive and gritty.  Ferrara attempts for the grit but Gibson's worlds can't be created without a budget and a competent director would help. For example Kill Switch an episode of The XFiles that Gibson wrote was the most expensive episode ever filmed during the time the show was filmed in Vancouver.  And it's one of the best episodes in the show's history.  Why? Because it constructed the visual aspect necessary to tell the story.  The fact that New Rose Hotel fails to do this coupled with Ferrara's horrendous storytelling is what makes it an unworthy effort.  If you're a fan of Gibson then watch the film but I doubt you'll enjoy it.".

If you are however a reader of Gibson's works then this film captures perfectly the bleak future created by him.In the future after a short Third world war the governments of the world and economies thereof have collapsed leaving only Corporate Entities who war between themselves. The Corporation's ammunition are the minds they can accumulate to do their work.This story is about two guys named here X and Fox In the short story X is the narrator of the story who play the two main corporations against each other by brokering personnel between the two.This time they have a man Hiroshi who they can get to change sides by using the services of a ShinjukuGirl Basically a whore. X Is warned by Fox not to get involved with the girl but he does.And she basically betrays them by replacing Hiroshi's Hosaka Chip with one that would scramble a DNA Sequencer he would work on causing a Virus.Now I had to look this up on several websites because it had been a while since I read The Sprawl Trilogy but within the context of Gibson's works this film is remarkably well done.The corporation that was to pay these guys sends out assassins who kill Fox while X finds a New Rose Hotel to climb into and die. A New Rose Hotel is kind of like a RoachHotel but for humans. They are basically a honeycombed network of free rooms that can be used for homeless people to crawl into and die in.As X Played by Willem Dafoe waits to either die or be assassinated he has a number of flashbacks where he realizes with 2020 Hindsight the Duplicity of his ShinjukuGirl played by Italian Actress and Director Asia Argento. Whose Tattoo is real by the way. Christopher Walken plays Fox and I keep thinking of Mulder for some reason.The only dialogue filmed is between X and Fox and Asia the rest are filmed in a kind of dreamfugue it is like we are seeing these people through the eyes of the AI which is always in the background of these stories.If you want some background into the world of The Sprawl then I suggest a short story by Gibson called Skinner's Room And once again the name Skinner brings to mind The X FilesRemember these stories were written in the 80's and very early 90's  So The X Files may have been influenced by Cyberpunk long before Gibson ever wrote Kill Switch in that series.Note  Actually I was wrong Skinner's Room is part of The Bridge books".

Christopher Walken plays Fox and I keep thinking of Mulder for some reason.The only dialogue filmed is between X and Fox and Asia the rest are filmed in a kind of dreamfugue it is like we are seeing these people through the eyes of the AI which is always in the background of these stories.If you want some background into the world of The Sprawl then I suggest a short story by Gibson called Skinner's Room And once again the name Skinner brings to mind The X FilesRemember these stories were written in the 80's and very early 90's  So The X Files may have been influenced by Cyberpunk long before Gibson ever wrote Kill Switch in that series.Note  Actually I was wrong Skinner's Room is part of The Bridge books";

William Gibson is a great writer who I hardly ever read anymore. He's incredibly inventive and is a master at fabricating convincing compelling future societies...but his worldview and opinion of human nature is just too glum and depressing. And unfortunately for a film adaptation Gibson dialog that sounds convincing and right in the context of the printed page often rattles in the ear like a tin washer when declaimed by a human actor. Simiarly 90 of the plot development in Gibson's fiction is mysterious ambiguous muffled and cryptic  much like a John LeCarre Smiley Cold War novel there is so much dealing double dealing betrayal and backstabbing going on behind the scenes much of which the reader is not privy too that it required intense concentration on every aspect of the plot to keep from being completely buffaloed by the events.On top of this this is a science fiction story that requires a convincing visual setting to pull the viewer in the way Gibson's telling details and rolling technospeak pull his readers in. New Rose Hotel didn't seem to have much of a budget so it had to skimp on the settings and the props and just concentrate on the characters and the plot.All these issues can make for very problematic material for a cinematic adaptation and alas the director and screenwriter don't come close to solving those problems. They seemed to have opted for mood and character study over plot momentum and story arc and as a result we spend vast amounts of movie time watching Defoe sit glumly in a tiny hotel capsule brooding over his mistakes while the movies interrupts with recaps and flashbacks of various scenes of people sitting around drinking and talking at each other. As much as I like Defoe and Walken even they can't carry this for entire film. The overall impression I get is of a movie just sits around and mopes whenever it isn't being cryptic and dull. Much has been made of the supposed hotness of actress Asia Argento but since this is a movie where sex is just another tool for corporate espionage the screenplay itself seems to strip her character of any real humanity and she comes across as a simple hooker Barbie character. That may actually be a tribute to deliberate efforts of both Argento and the director but it doesn't make for on screen erotic charge. I will say that I've seen her in other roles and I have to admit she can be a tasty dish. But not so much here.I liked the original story  it's pure Gibson through and though  but this version of it just doesn't work unless you're an obsessive fan of moody lighting and muffled expressionistic nihilism. It's too well made to give less than a 5 but that score is a grudging concession to how hard the actors and the cinematographer worked to pull off impossibly stilted and scrambled material.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the simple pleasures of life is to sit in a darkened theater and have a film capture your soul not as a single person but as the whole sigh of the room. I saw this in 1967 in Boston in a makeshift theater. This was at the height of the flower revolution when Boston was the intellect of the emerging 'counter' culture.This film found a hungry audience  we and it fed each other. At the same time down the road were Hollywood projects on what we though was the same notion passion before everything and the purer the passion the clearer the beauty. Life matters less than living. 'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'The Graduate' seemed slick and pale in comparison then and more so now.For decades I recalled many of the images the raspberries and cream which she bought by selling her image her luminescence her dainty vomit the fish in her skirt the attentive query about eggs the fainting when she is discovered by innocence which we ourselves did at the very beginning through the same child's eyes 'There are times when you don't question the cost'and of course the release of the butterfly and the reluctance of the filmmaker to let us release the image.This film succeeds because it is so simple but its simplicity is not accidental. The notion of equating Elvira with the music by bringing the musicians into the story shows extraordinary skill. I can think of no other case where a classic piece of music is renamed because of a film.At the time I recall great discussion of the book Sixten carried around. Like Hamlet's book it 'mattered' but I have forgotten its importance. I remember much in the underground press about the selfreferential nature the passion and beauty of the characters and so with the film the simple commitment to no plan of both and the accepting of the consequences by both for meditative obsession. But another of the simple pleasures of life is to live long enough to see two of ourselves the recalled initial engagement with the film and the current one. I wish this pleasure on all of you. Oh how we have all changed. I strongly suspect that no person who was not there will find any traction with this film but perhaps others like it.And watching this now I discover I'm more of an 'In the Mood for Love' kind of guy. Same ethic. Same commitment to enter the unknown. But the passion if stronger is more diffuse and less selfish. I recommend seeing both films. Let me know.".

'Bonnie and Clyde' and 'The Graduate' seemed slick and pale in comparison then and more so now.For decades I recalled many of the images the raspberries and cream which she bought by selling her image her luminescence her dainty vomit the fish in her skirt the attentive query about eggs the fainting when she is discovered by innocence which we ourselves did at the very beginning through the same child's eyes 'There are times when you don't question the cost'and of course the release of the butterfly and the reluctance of the filmmaker to let us release the image.This film succeeds because it is so simple but its simplicity is not accidental. The notion of equating Elvira with the music by bringing the musicians into the story shows extraordinary skill. I can think of no other case where a classic piece of music is renamed because of a film.At the time I recall great discussion of the book Sixten carried around. Like Hamlet's book it 'mattered' but I have forgotten its importance. I remember much in the underground press about the selfreferential nature the passion and beauty of the characters and so with the film the simple commitment to no plan of both and the accepting of the consequences by both for meditative obsession. But another of the simple pleasures of life is to live long enough to see two of ourselves the recalled initial engagement with the film and the current one. I wish this pleasure on all of you. Oh how we have all changed. I strongly suspect that no person who was not there will find any traction with this film but perhaps others like it.And watching this now I discover I'm more of an 'In the Mood for Love' kind of guy. Same ethic. Same commitment to enter the unknown. But the passion if stronger is more diffuse and less selfish. I recommend seeing both films. Let me know.";

The dialogs are very few but they all mean something. I especially liked when Sixten talked to his friend about that the world could be just one straw if that's the right word? of grass and that love is when you want to See the world from your lovers eyes. Often when you try to explain love all your words become clichs but in this film it's like you have never heard about love before. But actually I didn't really notice how good I thought this film was until the ending when the beautiful picture of Hedvig capturing a butterfly froze to the sound of the gunshot.

	schema:reviewBody "Looking for a rare and good film to watch for Valentines Day ? Director Bo Widerberg's classic 1967 film Elvira Madigan is tailor made for lovers. It was a big hit in the 60's when love and individual freedom was the popular philosophy. In fact looking at this film audiences must have sighed in relief that such a case as that of Elvira Madigan and Lt. Sixten Sparre would not have occurred in their time. Elvira Madigan played by the beautiful Pia Degermark is a tightrope walker for the circus. She falls in love with the married Lt. Sixten Sparre Thommy Berggren. The 19th century world they live in shuns their love and is even after them. A life on the run is at first tolerable. At least they are able to eat picnics in the forests and make love. This scene by the way is the most romantic in the film. The Mozart Piano Concerto 21 second movement andante is played repeatedly as the romance theme. It became so popular that even the concerto was named the Elvira Madigan concerto though surely Mozart would have none of it.The acting may appear stilted and pantomime and there are plenty of moments in which there is no talk but visually and dramatically it's a very welldone film. Also in the score is Vivaldi's Four Seasons. The story is said to have been based on an actual event in the 1850's. A pair of lovers on the run killed themselves in the woods. The movie has set the time to either late 1890's or early 1900's. The reference to Toulousse Latrec and the style of dress gives it away. This movie is very romantic and haunting. It will move you to tears.".

A Swedish army lieutenant named Sixten Sparre Thommy Berggren runs away with a famous tightrope walker Hedwig Elvira Madigan Pia Degermark. They committed suicide in a forest in Denmark. This is their story. We meet them when they're already on the run. He abandoned a wife two kids and his job. They're madly in love but have to keep on the run. They want to live away from society but find that suicide is the only possible way to be together forever.I've wanted to see this for years. The only time I saw it was on TV ages ago. It was dubbed with a terrible print and so faded that it appeared the film was in black and white! I finally got the Korean DVD and it is GORGEOUS! The color is bright and strong and the cinematography takes your breath away. SeriouslyI've seen hundreds of films and this has got to be the most beautiful ever. There's music by Mozart the couple are both attractive people Degermark especially is stunning. There's not much of a story but the scenery is so gorgeous you won't care. This also has a brief sex scene with no nudity but it still is very erotic. Also one sequence stands outthey have a fight and Sixten apologizes by floating an apology down a stream to her. I gotta admitthat scene got to me This has no rating but would easily get by with a G today.This is a film for romantics only! Some people mostly guys will probably find it corny andor boring but others like me will love it. This was a big hit with teenagers back in 1967 but seems to have faded away. Too bad  it's incredibly beautiful. Recommended highly!".

A Swedish army lieutenant named Sixten Sparre Thommy Berggren runs away with a famous tightrope walker Hedwig Elvira Madigan Pia Degermark. They committed suicide in a forest in Denmark. This is their story. We meet them when they're already on the run. He abandoned a wife two kids and his job. They're madly in love but have to keep on the run. They want to live away from society but find that suicide is the only possible way to be together forever.I've wanted to see this for years. The only time I saw it was on TV ages ago. It was dubbed with a terrible print and so faded that it appeared the film was in black and white! I finally got the Korean DVD and it is GORGEOUS! The color is bright and strong and the cinematography takes your breath away. SeriouslyI've seen hundreds of films and this has got to be the most beautiful ever. There's music by Mozart the couple are both attractive people Degermark especially is stunning. There's not much of a story but the scenery is so gorgeous you won't care. This also has a brief sex scene with no nudity but it still is very erotic. Also one sequence stands outthey have a fight and Sixten apologizes by floating an apology down a stream to her. I gotta admitthat scene got to me This has no rating but would easily get by with a G today.This is a film for romantics only! Some people mostly guys will probably find it corny andor boring but others like me will love it. This was a big hit with teenagers back in 1967 but seems to have faded away. Too bad  it's incredibly beautiful. Recommended highly!";

The 14inchscreenTV might not be a proper device for fully enjoying the cinemas especially for this type of art films. However even on 14inchscreen this film impressed me with its beautiful scenes. Now I don't recall most of its scenes. My memory of actual scenes was pretty much faded by time but in my mind the aftertaste of this film still remain the same as when I watched the beautiful impressionist paintings. I think the director expressed very well the inner feelings of the leads through cinematography. For me this film was such beautiful and powerful. The classical piano piece that was flowing though out the film was also very good. I'd like to watch this film again on a huge screen and to have the touching feeling from this tragic but pure and powerful love story again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing a television commercial for classical music records which was frequently on American television in the 1970's. It played a shot from this movie while selling Mozart's Love Theme from Elvira Madigan. I never bought the records but I always wanted to see the movie. Mozart's beautiful music with a pretty young blond Swedish woman chasing butterflies on a sunny day in a park seemed a great scene to me. I assumed it would be a great movie.Let me say that my wife and I generally enjoy period pieces and romantic movies. Give us any Jane AustenCharlotte Bronte movie and we're enthralled. We also love the arthouse films of the 50's and 60's. We've seen all of Federico Fellini's movies and many by Ingmar Bergman. Theoretically we should have been the perfect audience for this film.My wife made it through the first 25 minutes and then said I'm going to bed. I tried to convince her to stay and promised her that it would get better It had too. I suggested but to no avail. I stayed through the whole movie waiting for something interesting to happen. I'm still waiting.The scene in the television commercial of the blond young woman chasing butterflies is not just one scene in the movie it is the whole movie. It is a scene repeated over and over again. Okay that's not totally true there are a few other things that happen in the movie for example the woman sits listening to a string quartet.It is just that the story doesn't really progress and the characters and their feelings remain mysteries. This is really a quite lifeless and drab romance. There is no real feeling here just pretty images of wooden mannequins set to music. It gets pretty dull quickly and at the 25 minute mark you too might feel like going to bed.".

	schema:headline " Love as Ephemeral as the Days of Summer";
	schema:reviewBody "You say the Andante from the 21 Piano you add it's the Elvira Madigan. As you know the nick does not come from Mozart times. It is due to a Swedish movie made by Bo Widerberg in 1967 Elvira Madigan the Andante was its leitmotiv played again and again with the coming of each love scene. Other parts of that movie were scored with fragments from Vivaldi's concertos the first movements from the Summer and from L'Amoroso.Maybe the association between the movie and the 21 Piano is not fortunate. Or is it? The Andante is divine and it deserved a cinematic pair a movie to render the same nobility the same bouquet with nuances of discretion and delicacy in the same dosage. But Mozart is unique! Many people today haven't seen Elvira Madigan. But forty years ago this movie was loved. And those who watched it should remember the childish tune that starts and ends the movie it's Den blomstertid nu kommer an old Swedish song celebrating the coming of summer. It was composed by Israel Kolmodin in 1695. Then in 1819 Johan Olof Wallin published a new version. Pupils in Sweden sing it each year in the last day of school.The story in the movie is real. In 1889 a Swedish aristocrat Count Sixten Sparre felt in love for a young tight rope dancer Elvira Madigan. Sparre was married and had two children but his passion proved overwhelming. He left his family deserted from the military he was a lieutenant in the Swedish army and ran with Elvira in Denmark. They lived a passionate love for several months being constantly on the run. After spending all the money they had overdone by hunger in impossibility to get lodging any more they didn't find other solution than death. Sparre shot Elvira and then shot himself. They were buried together and as it happens their story overpassed reality and entered the realm of legend one of those famous romantic loves in which the second part of the nineteenth century excelled. Their graves became a pilgrimage place for young couples. Later Johan Lindstrm Saxon would put the story in a ballad the Doggerel about the Love and Cruel Death of the lovely Evira Madigan.No wonder this story attracted the filmmakers. The first Elvira Madigan was made in Sweden in 1943. The other two Elvira Madigans came on the screen in 1967. One of them was produced in Denmark the other was the Swedish movie featuring Pia Degermark in the titular role and this version became famous and gave the nickname to the Andante from the 21 Piano.Watching this Swedish version from 1967 makes obvious some reasons of its fame. The musical background is great the scenes give the impression of coming from the brush of one of the French masters of the nineteenth century and generally each sonic or visual detail is treated with care. It is a feast for the ear and for the eye.However the movie attracted also critical reviews. It was noted that the final though a real story lacked artistic motivation. It is not enough that it really happened it should also be convincing on the screen. After all as someone exclaimed after watching the movie why shooting yourself when hungry and penniless? Steal a chicken instead and leave the serious decisions for the next day. And generally the story of these two lovers as it entered the legend lacks consistence. Much more likely the reality was about morbid obsession on the part of Sparre while Elvira wanted to escape the misery of circus life and find a husband no matter what.I think these critics miss the point. The movie is not recreating a novel to be concerned too much about the likeliness of the story or about the consistence of the decisions taken by the heroes. It is a ballad playing a love story like a fairy tale. Love in all purity with no connection with any earthly reality unaware of any moral issue of any obligation. A meditation about the ephemeral nature of love as beautiful and short as summer in Sweden is. The tragic outcome is told from the very beginning and then is suggested in each scene each moment has the awareness that summer will end before long happiness will not last. You see it is the only awareness of the heroes. They celebrate the beauty of each moment while they know that soon it'll be over.Love as beautiful careless and ephemeral as the days of summer as the butterfly caressed by Elvira in the final scene.".

It is VERY unusual to see a movie before the 1980s that does this so the movie artistically took some risks.

	schema:headline " Utterly boring trite romance.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this picture when it first came out. As I recall it did not get particularly good reviews but became quite popular with the younger art movies audience of that time. However I found it to be one of the most boring pictures I had ever seen. It fact I believe that it is one of the few pictures that I ever walked out on. The acting was so superficial and the story so predictable that I ceased to care what happened to the two main characters. Its attempt to portray a rather sordid 19th century love affair between a circus performer and a married army officer as an innocent romance between two young lovers just did not work for me. One scene after another scene followed in a predicable sequence with no imagination or surprises. The only thing that saved this picture from obscurity was the lovely second movement of Mozart's 21st piano concerto. What I regret the most is that one of Mozart's greatest composition has been saddled with the title of The Elvira Madigan Concert. What a travesty to have this magnificent composition identified by the title of this rather shallow and superficial movie.".

Halfway through the action however the screenplay has Jon change sides or perhaps just reveal his real obnoxious character. The blackguards then become the victims but only temporarily. At film's end we are led to believe by a chief constable who fails to mention them at all in his summing up they have been whitewashed presumably to set the heroine free to marry the movie's real hero Alan Curtis who makes a rather belated entrance when the movie is more than half over.Adding to the story confusion is Leon Errol in a major comedy role as a Cockney spiv who befriends the Hall character and does a fair number of mildly amusing turns including a happy scene in which he attempts to blackmail the villain who persistently outwits him and a long almost completely irrelevant sequence in the local pub in which he challenges the local champion to a game of darts and then tries out various throwing combinations that will have special effects fans really cheering him on. Yet for all that Errol is sidelined in the allaction climax where he might have proved useful.As for heroine Evelyn Ankers she may as well have stayed at home. If she has more than five or six lines of dialogue in the whole movie I'd be surprised.My guess is that the script was made up on the run. It certainly plays that way. Only John Carradine's scenes seem to have a formal scenario necessary because of the special effects enabling the actor to invest his role with dignity and even credibility. Mind you Hall does play the heavy rather well even if it does come as a bit of a shock.By the humble standards of producerdirector Ford Bomba Beebe the movie comes over as a fairly creditable production although lensed on a considerably lesser budget than Frank Lloyd's Invisible Agent.".

	schema:reviewBody "This the last of the Universal 'Invisible Man' series before meeting Abbott  Costello is a very enjoyable film that showed there was still life left in the concept.  I won't outline the entire plot here but be warned that spoilers will follow. Jon Hall in his second invisible outing plays a criminal named Robert Griffin who uses a formula for invisibility to exact his revenge on those that wronged him.  It is interesting to note that in all the other films in the series it is the potion that affects the mentality of the respective invisible men but in this film Griffin is unhinged to begin with and uses the opportunity invisibility allows him to realize his mad ambitions.  In this particular aspect and in a few other instances this film is closer to the book than the other films although the first film is an unrivaled masterpiece.  As an audience we feel no real sympathy for the Griffin in 'Revenge' only fear.  This is a dangerous man from the start who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Another enjoyable feature of this entry is the very creative use of special effects something that each film toyed with in new ways. Although the budget must have been pretty small for a film of this type the matte effect isn't as perfect as in other films the crew still managed to perform some amazing tricks.  Of particular note is the scene where Griffin puts his invisible arm into an aquarium the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then confronting his foes with water outlining his invisible face.

	onyx:emotionText "This the last of the Universal 'Invisible Man' series before meeting Abbott  Costello is a very enjoyable film that showed there was still life left in the concept.  I won't outline the entire plot here but be warned that spoilers will follow. Jon Hall in his second invisible outing plays a criminal named Robert Griffin who uses a formula for invisibility to exact his revenge on those that wronged him.  It is interesting to note that in all the other films in the series it is the potion that affects the mentality of the respective invisible men but in this film Griffin is unhinged to begin with and uses the opportunity invisibility allows him to realize his mad ambitions.  In this particular aspect and in a few other instances this film is closer to the book than the other films although the first film is an unrivaled masterpiece.  As an audience we feel no real sympathy for the Griffin in 'Revenge' only fear.  This is a dangerous man from the start who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Another enjoyable feature of this entry is the very creative use of special effects something that each film toyed with in new ways. Although the budget must have been pretty small for a film of this type the matte effect isn't as perfect as in other films the crew still managed to perform some amazing tricks.  Of particular note is the scene where Griffin puts his invisible arm into an aquarium the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then confronting his foes with water outlining his invisible face.  Very eerie and very effective. This film has something to offer any fan of classic horror.  Granted computer effects have done away with the types of effects done decades ago this film did more with them that other invisible man movies have in later years especially the hollow attempt done recently and remains enjoyable to this day.";

Wells returns Jon Hall recently from THE INVISIBLE AGENT 1942 in another caper revolving around the nosight and sound about a man out for avenge those who had done him wrong.The story opens on the docks of London where Robert Griffin Jon Hall returns after five years of memory loss following a diamond field expedition in Africa. Moments later a newspaper clipping reveals Griffin to be a homicidal maniac who had escaped from a Capetown Asylum. After acquiring new clothing and a shave he locates Sir Jasper and Lady Irene Herrick Lester Matthews and Gale Sondergaard friends and former partners of the expedition who had left him for dead to their luxurious mansion and founders of Herrick Mines Ltd. demanding the share of the fortune due him. While talking things over a few drinks Griffin not only discovers their daughter Julie Evelyn Ankers his former girlfriend to be engaged to Mark Foster Alan Curtis a reporter for the Courier but finds he's been drugged. Unable to function Griffin is escorted out by their butler Cleghorn Halliwell Hobbes. Half crazed Griffin is offered assistance by Herbert Higgins Leon Errol a drunkard. Afterwards Griffin stumbles upon the home of Professor Drury John Carradine a scientist who has discovered the formula of invisibility. Witnessing his experiment where Drury's dog and other animals are heard but not seen Griffin volunteers on becoming Drury's human subject. As an invisible man Griffin gets his revenge but in the process does become what he is accused of being a homicidal maniac.With this being the third invisible man story of the 1940s not counting the comedy outing of The Invisible Woman 1940 starring Virginia Bruce in the title role this latest installment gives some indication that the writers were attempting an original concept to an already unoriginal scenario. With comedian Leon Errol assuming second billing it's evident he's around for comedy relief. One scene finds him impressing his friends at the pub in a friendly game of darts by hitting a target every time compliments of his invisible friend.Evelyn Ankers Universal's resident performer in the horror genre who arrives 48 minutes into the story is given little to do compare to her secondary roles opposite Lon Chaney Jr. in The Wolf Man 1941 The Ghost of Frankenstein 1942 and Son of Dracula 1943 In fact it's a wonder why Chaney never had the opportunity to assume the role as an invisible man considering that he's played everything else in regards to Universal monsters. Gale Sondergaard and Lester Matthews do well as friendly thieves while Leyland Hodgeson as Sir Frederick Travers Doris Lloyd as Maud and a dog named Grey Shadow lend some moral support. An average production that contradicts its predecessors the screenplay by Bertram Millhauser fails to mention Jack Griffin Claude Rains from THE INVISIBLE MAN 1933 to be the true inventor of the invisible formula thus giving credit to another scientist Drury. Secondly Robert Griffin doesn't appear to be related to any of the previous Griffins from the earlier Invisible Man stories. His only connection is that he becomes invisible and the use of the traditional bandages and sunglasses over his head to be seen by others. It would have been logical had Carradine's character been a distant relative to Jack Griffin carrying on his experiment and using his formula on a human subject played by Hall assuming another surname besides Griffin. Had it not been for these inconsistencies THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE might have been hailed as a satisfactory entry. Overlooking that it actually is. Jon Hall may not have the charisma of Rains nor the distinctive voice of Vincent Price but he does have the distinction of being the only actor to twice play an invisible man on screen aside the fact that he was playing two different characters bearing the name of Griffin.Formerly available on video and currently on DVD as part of the Invisble Man collection THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE did have occasional revivals on cable television's SciFi Channel 1990s and American Movie Classics 2001. Not quite the closing chapter nor the finish of John Fulton's special effects department Universal concluded this science fiction series with the comedy of ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE INVISIBLE MAN 1951 which they most certainly did. 12".

Wondering in the wilderness he happens upon the house of eccentric Dr. Peter Drury John Carradine a scientist working on the possibilities of invisibility. Agreeing to become a test subject he is injected with the formula and becomes invisible. Using the opportunity to seek revenge on the Griffin's for betraying him earlier he carries it out and manages to fully avenge it. Still not satisfied he takes to the streets of London with his friend Herbert Higgins Leon Errol to make full advantage of his condition before he is found out.The Good News This here wasn't that bad. The invisible man's hijinks in the film aren't that bad. After becoming invisible the first thing to do is to see an old friend who now invisible spends the whole affair doing certain activities that indicate he's still there. From twirling a knife in the air to waving papers around and other such tricks as pulling chairs and denting seat cushions this is one of the creepiest scenes in the film due to the amount of antics on display that come across beautifully. There are some good invisibility effects in here that still look great now with the Invisible Man splashing water and flour on his face at various points leaving only the touched parts to become ghostly visible. A later effect where they are undergoing the transformation and a ghostly outline running in front of a window is executed flawlessly. As with the first one a little humor is injected into the film. The drunkard who becomes the Invisible Man's visible assistant is responsible for some really funny moments the best of which is the invisiblyassisted darts game in the pub which is a comedic gem. From the different positions to the fact that the darts are clearly not being thrown on their own trajectory to hit the targets this is hugely funny and gets the film's best laughs. Also quite hilarious is the frequent attempts to keep a barking guard dog from getting at it's intended target to the dismay of those who own the dog. It's finale is quite actionpacked filled with several great scenes packed inside a tiny space and featuring a couple of pretty nifty ideas as well and is the clear highlight as the best part of the film. It's a decent enough entry in the series.The Bad News There wasn't a lot wrong but there was a few problems in it. One of the main problems is the really off pacing in the film. It attempts to recapture that combination of comedy and horrific suspense that was the earmark of the first movie in the series but whereas that movie balanced the elements in such a way that they played off of and enhanced each other here we just have suspense scenes giving way to comic scenes giving way to suspense scenes without really building to an organic whole. This makes it seem like it was really two different movies put together and thrown into the mix with an effort made to link them together. The switch in tones is quite apparent though where in one scene the invisible man helps an old friend win a dartthrowing game then a few minutes later threatening to kill someone. That illustrates the problem quite readily. Also quite off is the long amount of time until the invisible man appears onscreen. It takes a good twentytothirty minutes before it transpires and that leaves the first half to consist of some really slow scenes as the race to the switch happens. Unlike the others which had the antics transpire onscreen fairly rapidly in the pace this one's wait is a curious inclusion. It's not a noticeable distraction but it is one nonetheless. Otherwise this is a really OK entry in the series.The Final Verdict While not all that much of a classic it has enough moments of fun to be more than the total wasted entry many had claimed of it. It's good enough to warrant a rental first as it's not near the classic original but if judged on it's own it's not that bad at all.Today's RatingPG Mild Violence".

Let's say that their actions don't allay his suspicions and Hall gets quite the bum's rush out of their house.Alone and paranoid Hall stumbles on scientist John Carradine who's been working on the matter of invisibility. He offers himself as a guinea pig to Carradine and of course Carradine sees Nobel Prize in his future.Of course Hall has other plans to use the invisibility as a method of revenge. He also considers an alternative to killing and stealing from Matthews and Sondergaard. Hall gets one look at their lovely daughter Evelyn Ankers and decides it might be easier to marry the fortune. That is if he can get rid of her boyfriend Alan Curtis.The motivations of these characters is quite confusing at times you're not quite sure who to root for. Even in the end someone had a marvelous idea for the Invisible Man to get his comeuppance involving man's best friend and blew it in the execution.One very interesting performance in the film is Leon Errol away from the comic parts he usually had. He's still got some funny moments but he's also a blackmailing scoundrel as well.The Invisible Man's Revenge is far from the best in the series.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is possible that I liked this film even more than I would have because the night before I'd watched the previous installment in the Invisible Man franchiseTHE INVISIBLE AGENT. THE INVISIBLE AGENT was such a remarkably bad film that by comparison THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE looks brillianteven though I realize it's just a Bmovie and not much more.The film begins with a maniac escaping from a mental hospital. It seemed that he killed three men in the process and is not about to let himself be captured. While he's psychotic he also seems reasonably rational at first. Because of this he's not easy to spot. Plus some of what he thinks and does makes sense. For example he tracks down an old business partner to demand his rightful share of a fortune in diamonds. However the partner blew much of the money due to bad investments and so the maniac demands EVERYTHINGincluding the partner's daughter! Well the partner and his wife are naturally aghast and soon throw him outthat is after they take the partnership paper away from the maniac.Later a nice but wacky scientist Robert Carradine finds the crazy guy and offers to let him be the first human to try out his invisibility formula. Little does Carradine know that this will unleash a madman's reign of terror. Oddly this is a reversal of the plot of the original INVISIBLE MAN 1933 as it was the formula that made the man paranoid and murderhungry.While the special effects and story aren't nearly of the level of the original INVISIBLE MAN it is very interesting and worth watching. I do agree with another reviewer who complained that it was hard to like anyone in the film. Making some of the characters a bit more sympathetic might have improved the film a bit. Still a nice timepasser and a film lightyears better than the previous invisible film.".

However the partner blew much of the money due to bad investments and so the maniac demands EVERYTHINGincluding the partner's daughter! Well the partner and his wife are naturally aghast and soon throw him outthat is after they take the partnership paper away from the maniac.Later a nice but wacky scientist Robert Carradine finds the crazy guy and offers to let him be the first human to try out his invisibility formula. Little does Carradine know that this will unleash a madman's reign of terror. Oddly this is a reversal of the plot of the original INVISIBLE MAN 1933 as it was the formula that made the man paranoid and murderhungry.While the special effects and story aren't nearly of the level of the original INVISIBLE MAN it is very interesting and worth watching. I do agree with another reviewer who complained that it was hard to like anyone in the film. Making some of the characters a bit more sympathetic might have improved the film a bit. Still a nice timepasser and a film lightyears better than the previous invisible film.";

Never mind that if you really were invisible the liabilities would overwhelm the assets for one thing you would be totally blind because light would pass right through your retinas without reflecting so unless bumping into things is your idea of fun being invisible is no great shakes. Now most of the time I like invisible man movies but this time I am willing to make an exception.Jon Hall took a break from costarring with Maria Montez to be in this thriller. Robert Griffin Jon and his pals discovered a diamond mine while they were in Africa. Said pals Lester Mathews and Gale Sondergaard double crossed Bob knocked him over the head and left him for dead. Bob survived but lost his memory and ended up in a South African nuthouse. He escaped after killing 2 guards and stowed away on a ship that brought him back to England. Why did I tell you all this? Because all that took place before the movie even starts and we have to hear about it from various characters the the film progresses!When Bob finally gets back to his notsogreatfriends Sir Jasper and Lady Irene he finds out that not only did they rob him they subsequently lost most of their fortune due to bad investments! Bob decides that no that is not revenge enough he wants whatever is left of the cash PLUS their daughter Julie Evelyn Ankers as his bride whether she likes it or not! Run out of the mansion Bob gets lost in a storm and ends up at the house of Dr. Drury John Carradine whose neighbours think he is batty because he has perfected a way to make living things invisible. Now here is the part of the movie you have been waiting for. Anxious to experiment on a human being Drury injects his serum into Bob and as Fate and the scriptwriter would have it Bob goes poof and becomes invisible. With the help of a local character former Vaudeville comic Leon Errol doing a believable Cockney accent Bob tries to scare Sir Jasper into signing away what is left of his fortune. Does it work? Does it ever? And what about Dr. Drury? How will he feel about letting an invisible maniac loose on the countryside?This is one time we don't have to worry about the invisibility serum driving the man mad because Bob is bonkers to begin with. The floating effects are predictable but fun and half the fun is spotting the wires. The cast is very recognisable if you like spotting character actors. Lester Mathews had gone up against THE WEREWOLF OF London and costarred with Karloff and Lugosi in THE RAVEN both 1935 and later ended up battling Fu Manchu on a weekly basis on the Adventures of Fu Manchu TV series. Gale Sondergaard is forever identified as The Spider Woman from SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SPIDER WOMAN and THE SPIDER WOMAN STRIKES BACK. Leon Errol costarred with fading starlet Lupe Velez in the Mexican Spitfire series and had his own series of 2 reel comedies. Watch also for Doris Lloyd Mrs. Hudson in the Sherlock Holmes series Ian Wolfe too doggone many movies to list here Billy Bevan DRACULA'S DAUGHTER RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE etc. and Skelton Knaggs BEDLAM ISLE OF THE DEAD etc.. Brutus the dog who turns out to be the hero of the picture is played by animal actor Grey Shadow. John Carradine is a welcome addition but is not given enough to do. Wisely he does not play his character as a stereotype mad scientist. Director Ford Beebe had written andor directed a lot of serials for Mascot and later for Republic. He also directed NIGHT MONSTER 1942 and even managed to impress Alfred Hitchcock by bringing in such an effective thriller in only 11 days.INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE is far from the best of the series. You might want to check out INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS 1940 or even the 1933 original with Claude Rains for some real entertainment.".

When I get to where I am paying more attention to the technical aspects of a movie instead of enjoying the story it really did not engage me. As far as special effects go it was okay I suppose by 1944 standards. A little lazy in many places though. Matte silhouettes are frequently seen and wires are clear in the scene where a man is supposedly lifted by the invisible man. I say it is lazy because judging from the earlier invisible man movies better effects were definately available they just seem glossed over here. The money shot of the movie appears to be a scene where the invisible man plunges his hand into a fish tank and then splashes water on his face to become visible. That's it basically the scene appears pretty early on and there will be no scene comparable to it so the movie plays it's hand too early. That scene in the very last sequence would have left the audience with something to talk about as they left.

Griffin accuses the two of leaving him for dead in Africa years before and taking full claim for the diamond mine he had discovered which subsequently made them rich. The two deny this and say they were told Griffin was dead by their guide. They offer to pay him half of what they have but Griffin now quite insane refuses and says he wants it all plus their daughter Julie Evelyn Ankers! They throw Griffin out which leads to him meeting up with a Cockney blackmailer Leon Errol and eventually a scientist John Carradine who enlists him to take part in the inevitable invisibility experiment. The experiment is successful and Griffin now invisible returns to get even with Jasper and Irene.Despite being named Griffin this Invisible Man shares no history with the previous ones. It's John Carradine's scientist who has created the invisibility formula here. Also Griffin is nuts before the movie begins so the invisibility formula can't be blamed for that. To make matters slightly more confusing Hall plays the lead here and he also played the lead another Griffin in Invisible Agent.The cast helps overcome a messy script. Hall is quite convincing as the psycho Invisible Man. Carradine as usual is great as the scientist. Leon Errol seems to ruffle quite a few feathers among viewers judging by reviews here. His character was pretty much unnecessary but he didn't bother me. Gale Sondergaard is always a treat to watch but she gets little to do and seems to disappear from the story altogether after a halfhour or so. Lester Matthews is fine as the weakling husband who may or may not have left Griffin for dead in Africa. Evelyn Ankers has a thankless part. Halliwell Hobbes is the butler as he often was in these films.Part of the problem with the story is that no one is that likable. The closest thing to a hero in the movie is Alan Curtis' reporter character and there's something about him that kind of bugged me. Another problem is the script feels uneven especially in the early part. Reportedly the first draft of the script had Jasper and Irene as much more villainous characters and no doubt was cast on their attempt to kill Griffin both in Africa as well as upon his showing up at their house in this film. That's not the case in the final version yet the pair still seems unsympathetic so I wonder why they bothered changing it all if they did? The special effects are OK if a little sloppy in some scenes. I think some reviewers have overstated just how sloppy they were. It's not like you see wires in every scene or even most scenes. I think only eagleeyed viewers will spot most of the flaws with the effects.Overall it's a good movie of its type. Not great but watchable Bgrade entertainment. It's got a solid cast with a strong performance from Jon Hall in the lead. Still it's easy to see why Universal stopped the series after this one.".

I will not spoil that bit of plot for you but I will say that the ending is one of the few highlights of this film.  Because the script takes no ground morally I was in a lurch as to whom I should be concerned for.  Were Jasper and his wife responsible for Griffin being leftfordead?  Did they purposely swindle him?  Even when they do something to him one is never really sure of their intent.  The other actors are typical for a Universal film and give adequate performances.  The sole bright light for me was John Carradine as a scientist with invisible animals that discovers he can make a man invisible too.  Carradine seems to have a lot of fun with his role as he is garbed in white lab coat and pincenez.  The plot never really thickens and any real meat to the film is indeed invisible.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSAmusingly the blurb on the back of this film's recent UK video release promises that the direction guarantees the suspension of belief. Errrr... shouldn't that be disbelief? Actually on second thoughts maybe they're right. In seriousness the direction isn't so bad it's more the starch acting by Gale Sondergaard in particular that has a slight distancing effect. The relentless procession of selfconscious Cockney stereotypes is also wearying though this isn't so bad a film. Obviously not a patch on the very fine original this fourth sequel nevertheless scores by having an actual story. The legal wrangling between Griffin and a couple who cheated him may not be the most exciting of events What next  Frankenstein Meets The Tax Rebate Form? but it's leagues ahead of oneidea movies like The Wolf Man.Griffin Jon Hall sports one of those Clark GableErrol Flynn tashe numbers and is perhaps too dashing and too bland to be the villainous lead. Much better is John Carradine as Doctor Drury a camp old buffer who offers put out your hand feel it and even seems to adlib a few lines to his invisible dog. His mild sense of fun perks up the fairly flat screenplay though you do wonder why he gets so excited over creating an invisible man. After all his claims of a science breakthrough are pretty much contradicted by the first four films  or doesn't he go to the cinema?

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSAmusingly the blurb on the back of this film's recent UK video release promises that the direction guarantees the suspension of belief. Errrr... shouldn't that be disbelief? Actually on second thoughts maybe they're right. In seriousness the direction isn't so bad it's more the starch acting by Gale Sondergaard in particular that has a slight distancing effect. The relentless procession of selfconscious Cockney stereotypes is also wearying though this isn't so bad a film. Obviously not a patch on the very fine original this fourth sequel nevertheless scores by having an actual story. The legal wrangling between Griffin and a couple who cheated him may not be the most exciting of events What next  Frankenstein Meets The Tax Rebate Form? but it's leagues ahead of oneidea movies like The Wolf Man.Griffin Jon Hall sports one of those Clark GableErrol Flynn tashe numbers and is perhaps too dashing and too bland to be the villainous lead. Much better is John Carradine as Doctor Drury a camp old buffer who offers put out your hand feel it and even seems to adlib a few lines to his invisible dog. His mild sense of fun perks up the fairly flat screenplay though you do wonder why he gets so excited over creating an invisible man. After all his claims of a science breakthrough are pretty much contradicted by the first four films  or doesn't he go to the cinema?

	schema:reviewBody "The fifth of Universal's classic invisibility films inspired by the novel The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells and the last not counting two appearances in Abbott and Costello parodies The Invisible Man's Revenge is extraordinarily poorly written. It's overburdened with exposition much of which is entirely unnecessary and not followed up on. There's lots of telling and little showingeven for the traveling matte effects for the invisibility. The film is more than a third through before there even is an invisible man. Character actions and motivations are often confused and unclear and yet the the plotting is both overly intricate and laden with holes served up with a more melodramatic treatment than prior entries in the series.Thanks to the annoyingly selfcontradictory propaganda of the prior Invisible Agent 1942 however this may not be the worst of Universal's invisibility pictures but it's a far cry from the 1933 masterful mix of camp horror and scifi in The Invisible Man and the underrated The Invisible Man Returns and even the surprisingly funny The Invisible Woman both 1940. Those three each did some interesting things with the notion of invisibility for example by equating it with the disembodied voices of the radio and telephone examining the traces left behind by an invisible man in the police dragnet and an invisible woman liberated from the male gaze. Even Invisible Agent had the promising concept although wasted of the use of invisibility for espionage. Here it merely becomes the tool of an incoherent mind in an incoherent narrative and it's kind of a confused and derivative rehash of The Invisible Man Returns in that transparency is employed by a man who attempts to set things right in his life again by intimidating the seen. Although I will say that Jon Hall is more tolerable in this villainous part than as the dimwit he played in Invisible Agent.Hall's Robert Griffin shares the name of the Griffins in three of the prior films but oddly no relation to those men is mentioned throughout the picture and this Griffin is decidedly not a scientist. According to a newspaper article that he conveniently leaves behind in a discarded outfit he's a homicidal maniac who escaped from an asylum. The report goes on to claim that the police have put out a dragnet to capture the fugitive. In this first scene we see him hide from a patrolman. After that there is no evidence in the rest of the film for any such dragnet or investigation. Only a dog seems to care about catching Griffin. Not only that but his name is mentioned in front of the Chief constable and he registers no knowledge of any Griffin! It's as though the screenwriter forgot that he'd written that he was a fugitive. Except that Griffin brings up his fugitive status again when by the most chance of contrivances he runs into a mad doctor played by frequent Dracula actor John Carradine experimenting in making animals unseen.Then there's this long backstory that Griffin and his former partners the Herricks get into where Robert was presumed dead but actually had amnesia for years and there's the issue of the half of a fortune owed to him. Sounds interesting but we see none of it the characters just talk about itviolating the golden rule of cinema by telling instead of showing. During their conversation Griffin becomes unconscious from a drink the wife serves him suggesting that he's been drugged but there's no actual evidence of this. Oh and he's in love with their daughter who he's never met and who we hardly see throughout the picturewe see the Invisible Man more often unfortunately. Another man a reporter is also after the daughter's affections too forming a trite love triangle that's hardly developed.On top of all of this is the mostly failed attempts at comic relief by Griffin's partner in crime Herbert. The darts scene though may be the best thing here and it anticipates the boxing in Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man 1951even though the scene serves no purpose to the plot and rather grinds it to a halt. To set it up Griffin is helping Herbert to pay his rent so that they may share his home but as with other storylines here this is never followed upwe never see the two in that house again.This is such a mess that I get the sense that there may've been some narrative ideas here that were subsequently altered dropped or not fully developed including Griffin as a bit of an unreliable narrator or Lady Herrick having been planned as a villainactually drugging Griffin and conspiring to withhold the fortune owed to him. As it is however much of the narrative remains confusing and poorly executed. Not even the resurrection of the transfusion business and the return of the bandaged head and goggles look from the first two Invisible Man films can save this one. Even the traveling matte visual effects by John P. Fulton aren't as impressive after 11 years of use and the narrative does them no service in showcasing the effects. Once unseen this Griffin spends most of the film avoiding his transparency including by splashing water and flower on his face to reveal his shape. The special effects seem to be even more noticeably imperfect than usual too for instance his open eyeballs are visible in the flower scene when they shouldn't be. This Invisible Man is best left unseen.".

	schema:reviewBody "This final entry in Universals' Invisible Man series is a rather weak one unfortunately. It's decidedly lacking in any sort of atmosphere there's too much unfunny comedy relief too much time wasting going on and the special effects are substandard you can clearly see the wires manipulating some of the objects for one thing. The script is nothing special either although the cast does the best that they can.The film does benefit from having its vengeance minded main character be a true s.o.b. The man in question Robert Griffin Jon Hall thinks that his old partners the Herricks Gale Sondergaard and Lester Matthews double crossed him and cheated him out of a fortune in diamonds. So when he happens upon a nutty scientist Dr. Drury the well cast and delightful John Carradine who's perfected an invisibility process he volunteers to be the first human guinea pig and uses his new appearance to his advantage.It's a shame to be referring to any of the films from Universals' 1930s and 1940s horror cycle as tiresome but that's exactly what The Invisible Man's Revenge is. It just isn't very involving it may have some good moments along the way but they aren't enough to redeem the film. What makes it bearable is a cast featuring some excellent actors. Hall is very amusing as the determined antagonist and Carradine is a joy to watch it's nice to see him playing a victim rather than a villain in this sort of thing. Pros such as Halliwell Hobbes Leyland Hodgson Doris Lloyd and Ian Wolfe are solid in small roles. However Alan Curtis is fairly dull as reporter Mark Foster and the film gives the lovely Evelyn Ankers precious little to actually do her character really isn't that important to the plot. Leon Errol is good although his part is an annoying one.Viewers may want to see this for completions' sake but it's best recommended that they lower their expectations before watching.Five out of 10.".

The script is nothing special either although the cast does the best that they can.The film does benefit from having its vengeance minded main character be a true s.o.b. The man in question Robert Griffin Jon Hall thinks that his old partners the Herricks Gale Sondergaard and Lester Matthews double crossed him and cheated him out of a fortune in diamonds. So when he happens upon a nutty scientist Dr. Drury the well cast and delightful John Carradine who's perfected an invisibility process he volunteers to be the first human guinea pig and uses his new appearance to his advantage.It's a shame to be referring to any of the films from Universals' 1930s and 1940s horror cycle as tiresome but that's exactly what The Invisible Man's Revenge is. It just isn't very involving it may have some good moments along the way but they aren't enough to redeem the film. What makes it bearable is a cast featuring some excellent actors. Hall is very amusing as the determined antagonist and Carradine is a joy to watch it's nice to see him playing a victim rather than a villain in this sort of thing. Pros such as Halliwell Hobbes Leyland Hodgson Doris Lloyd and Ian Wolfe are solid in small roles. However Alan Curtis is fairly dull as reporter Mark Foster and the film gives the lovely Evelyn Ankers precious little to actually do her character really isn't that important to the plot. Leon Errol is good although his part is an annoying one.Viewers may want to see this for completions' sake but it's best recommended that they lower their expectations before watching.Five out of 10.";

Leon Errol adds comic relief as Hall's cockney sidekick hysterically winning at a game of darts while Lester Matthews and Gale Sondergaard are sadly wasted after a great start as the accused Baron and Baroness who may or may not be guilty a fact which is never proved.

Webb got an Oscar nomination for his role of Waldo Lydecker as a Best Supporting Actor but lost to Barry Fitzgerald for Going My Way.David Raksin's musical theme for this film is one of the great ones ever done for the cinema. So popular did it prove that Johnny Mercer wrote a lyric for it after the film came out. At the time people like Frank Sinatra and Dick Haymes and a host of others rushed to record it. I guess you could classify Laura as a kind of sophisticated noir police drama. It's dialog will leave you begging for more. It's not much in the way of mystery because about a third of the way through you will realize at the same time Andrews does who the murderer is maybe even before Andrews does. That doesn't matter though because Laura is entertaining every step of the way.".

But if they're all as promising as this one...I'll soon become his biggest fan for sure! A fan of Vincent Price I was already. That was my motivation to watch Laura in the first place. I wanted to see this favorite actor of mine in a good oldfashioned and intelligent tale of mystery and murder. I got what I expected PLUS a hell of a lot more!! Laura can be summarized by using one single word BRILLIANT! Like no other film Laura is the perfect proof that cinema can be the purest form of art. The dialogues are superb. Every line that's being said in Laura is a highlight every facial expression made is a stunning one. Preminger's film is FilmNoir perfection. Period. First and foremost the story of Laura impresses you bigtime. The script is extremely intelligent and it's always one step ahead of you. There were most movies desperately TRY to fool the audience  and fail  Laura pulls it off without any effort. The atmosphere and design just sucks you in completely and you're overwhelmed by every surprising twist. I'm not telling anything about the plot or storyline here. It would be a shame to spoil something about this masterpiece. See it for yourself and be astonished! I am willing to write one last word about the cast though. Laura has the most entire charismatic cast I've ever seen! Gene Tierney was an obvious choice to play the title role I may say. She's one of the most beautiful girls who ever appeared on the big screen. It's only normal that she's in the spotlights here. Heck I even fell in love with her myself while watching her. Clifton Webb is terrific as the menhating critic named Waldo. His constant sarcastic remarks are a joy for all senses. And  as I said before  Vincent Price is the one who's making this film complete. Laura was shot pretty early in his wellfilled career but his talent is obviously there already. Even though he grew out to become a legendary horroricon he certainly proves here that he could handle all kind of characters.Go and see Laura! See it now!! It's one of the greatest films ever made and the undeniable proof that classic cinema will always be the best. No matter who're they're trying to impress us with sound and visual aspects nowadays nothing compares to the charm and intelligence of a good story!".

Incidentally a comedy of manners gets its name from the satirical possibilities in the differing class views on proper behaviormannersexploited by playwrights to the delight of an audience placed in a superior positionthey thinkof social discernment. Here we can see the differentials but they are not played for comedic effect.Gene Tierney at twentyfour stars as Laura Hunt a beautiful career girl who as the picture opens has been murdered. Shot in face with a double barreled shotgun a point of information not dwelled on by director Otto Preminger. Today's directors of course would have begun with a full facial shot of the corpse. Dana Andrews is the leading man playing Mark McPherson a hardboiled police detective with a soft heart. Vincent Price who before he became a maven of horror was actually a softspoken hunkish ladies man plays Shelby Carpenter who could afford to have his reputation blemished but not his clothes. He is a man about town who would fit nicely into a British comedy of manners at the turn of the nineteenth century.But the surprising star is Clifton Webb who plays Waldo Lydecker venomous columnist and radio personality who against his first impressions falls madly and of course hopelessly in love with Laura and becomes her mentor. This was before the genteel and very precise veteran of the musical stage was Mr. Belvedere and before his triumph in Cheaper by the Dozen 1950 that is to say before he was typecast as an irascible but lovable middle aged manbut not before his fiftieth birthday strange how the fortunes of actors may go. By the way George Sanders's Oscarwinning performance as the cynical critic in All About Eve 1950 owes something to Webb's work here.The strength of the movie is in the intriguing storyline featuring surprising but agreeable plot twists and especially in the fine acting by Webb Andrews Tierney and Price. Webb in particular is brilliant. I think this is another example of Otto Preminger getting a lot more out of his actors than he is usually given credit for. See Anatomy of a Murder 1959 starring James Stewart and Lee Remick for another example. Known for turning commercial novels into commercial movies e.g. The Man with the Golden Arm 1955 Exodus 1960 Advise and Consent 1962 Preminger is at his best when he lets the material have its way. I call that the invisible style of directing and he follows it here. Add the beautiful score by David Raksin and this movie is a special treat.As a mystery however it is a little predictable. We know from the beginning not only who will get the girl but with a very high probability who pulled the trigger. What we don't know in the first case is how since she is presumably dead and in the second case why. The lack of motive hides the killer's identity from us. But rest assured all is unraveled in the final reel.See this for Clifton Webb whose improbable Hollywood success beginning with this movie started when he was in his fifties and ended when he was in his sixties. If I were a thirtyyearold actor running to auditions I would call that inspiration.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:headline " Of Love Murder and Obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a classic tale of love murder and obsession when a homicide detective becomes enamored of the victim of a brutal murder he's investigating in Laura' directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The story begins with the discovery of the murder of Laura Hunt Tierney a young advertising executive in New York City and as detective Mark McPherson Andrews makes his investigation and begins to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of Laura's life and death the essence of who she was begins to emerge.  And it gives the story an interesting twist for after seeing a portrait of Laura and getting to know her by reading her most intimate personal letters and diary routine for a murder investigation McPherson becomes obsessed with her and soon discovers he's not alone there was another man obsessed with her as well.  Subsequently he must determine if that obsession played any part in Laura's death. The suspects include the men in her life Waldo Lydecker Clifton Webb a radio personalitycolumnist who helped her begin her career and Shelby Carpenter Vincent Price her fiance a man of seemingly dubious character who had recently been involved with a model who worked for Laura's agency.  The list doesn't end with them however also in the running is a man named Jacoby John Dexter the artist who painted the portrait of Laura that so mesmerized McPherson and then there's some question as to the relationship between a certain Ann Treadwell Judith Anderson and Carpenter that is yet to be resolved.  Preminger delivers a solid mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end but with only enough tension to keep it interesting rather than engrossing.  And though the story is believable there are elements of the plot that develop so quickly it stretches credibility a bit.  An additional two or three scenes relating to certain aspects of the characters lives especially Laura's would have had a significant impact of this film good as it is and with a running time of 85 minutes on most prints it wouldn't have been out of the question to expand it somewhat.As far as the characters McPherson Lydecker and Carpenter emerge fully sketched and need little development you know exactly who they are and where they've been.  This is not the case with Laura however Tierney's character suffers somewhat from lack of development and as the story unfolds she seems to get from here to there with little discernible change. What the character needed was a bit more depth and some real definition.Which is exactly what Andrews and Webb give to their characters Webb as the flamboyant and selfassured Lydecker Andrews as the stoic and deliberating McPherson.  Price gives a notable performance as well but has a tendency to lapse into melodrama occasionally which can be distracting at times.  And Tierney gives a passable performance though her acting is not on a par with her exquisite beauty.  In her initial encounter with Lydecker for instance her pronounced coyness is somewhat diverting.  Still her presence on the screen is radiant which makes it easy to overlook the slight flaws in her acting.  The supporting cast includes Dorothy Adams Bessie Cy Kendall Inspector Grant Mitchell Lancaster Corey Buster Miles Office Boy and Frank La Rue Hairdresser.  A good mystery but with few surprises Laura' nevertheless remains a classic in it's own right.  It's not a perfect film the final words spoken in fact are decidedly melodramatic but it's good storytelling and is ultimately satisfying.  Saying that there was room for improvement would be nitpicking suffice to say that it is what it is which is a pretty good movie.  I rate this one 710.".

Gene Tierney plays the title character a woman who seems to bewitch every man she meets. It's no wonder because Tierney is mesmerizing to watch. I think she could well be the most beautiful actress of all time. Dana Andrews Vincent Price and Clifton Webb play the three men in Laura's life. Andrews 'Night Of The Demon' plays a detective investigating Laura's apparent murder Price years before becoming a horror icon a gigolo type who is due to marry her and Webb best known as Mr. Belvedere is a snobby columnist and wit who is Laura's mentor. All four actors are just terrific and the plot is full of twists and surprises. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. 'Laura' is one of the very best Hollywood movies of the 1940s.

	schema:headline " I suspect nobody and everybody I'm merely trying to get at the truth.";
	schema:reviewBody "Laura A definitive film noir classic and simply put my favorite film of all time. Laura tells the shocking story of Park Avenue society beauty Laura Hunt  Gene Tierney who is murdered in her apartment which brings Detective Mark McPherson  Dana Andrews to New York's most elegant neighborhood to investigate. As he tried to get inside the head of the victim he also questions the men in her lifethe acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker  Clifton Webb and her playboy fianc Shelby Carpenter  Vincent Price. But who would have wanted to kill a girl with whom every man she met seemed to fall in love? Fueled by her stunning portrait liquor and classical music McPherson quickly finds himself falling under her spell too. A police detective falling in love with the woman whose murder he's investigating? Then in one stormy night halfway through his investigation something so bizarre happens to him that he is forced to rethink the whole case.This reveal still kind of leaves me guessing. Is it all a dream? Or maybe it is all formulated by the ' spell' of the movie.

	onyx:emotionText "Laura A definitive film noir classic and simply put my favorite film of all time. Laura tells the shocking story of Park Avenue society beauty Laura Hunt  Gene Tierney who is murdered in her apartment which brings Detective Mark McPherson  Dana Andrews to New York's most elegant neighborhood to investigate. As he tried to get inside the head of the victim he also questions the men in her lifethe acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker  Clifton Webb and her playboy fianc Shelby Carpenter  Vincent Price. But who would have wanted to kill a girl with whom every man she met seemed to fall in love? Fueled by her stunning portrait liquor and classical music McPherson quickly finds himself falling under her spell too. A police detective falling in love with the woman whose murder he's investigating? Then in one stormy night halfway through his investigation something so bizarre happens to him that he is forced to rethink the whole case.This reveal still kind of leaves me guessing. Is it all a dream? Or maybe it is all formulated by the ' spell' of the movie. An alluring cast and no doubt the famous musical theme by David Raksin has something to do with it.There are so many scenes I could count as my favorite but the one that always stands out to me is the scene where McPherson falls asleep under the portrait and he awakes with the sudden appearance of a woman who seems to be Laura Hunt herself! dressed in a drenched trenchcoat.

	schema:headline " The crafty Preminger's coded highstyle murder mystery hasn't lost its perdurable appeal";
	schema:reviewBody "Rashomonlike Vera Caspary's clever suspense novel Laura falls into  five sections and five separate voices telling its story from the  viewpoint of each of its principal characters. It was too cumbersome a  structure for a 1940s mystery so the script by Jay Dratler and  others simplifies and concentrates the narrative for director Otto  Preminger to play with.   Judith Anderson as Laura's aunt Ann Treadwell a vain and silly society  dame and Vincent Price as Shelby Carpenter a 'male beauty in  distress' and onagain offagain paramour both to Treadwell and to  Laura find themselves demoted to supporting players if still a couple  of satisfyingly kippered herring. Caspary's pentacle gets rejigged  into an oldfashioned triangle with vipertongued newspaper columnist  Waldo Lydecker Clifton Webb and wisemouthed police  detectivelieutenant Mark MacPherson Dana Andrews locking horns over  the elusive Laura Gene Tierney.  Elusive isn't the half of it. For the first half of the movie she's  presumed dead her face obliterated by a load of buckshot when she  answered the door of her apartment one stifling Friday night in New  York City. MacPherson's on the track of her killer and pieces together  her story How through brains and determination not to mention looks  she rose in the advertising industry how she met the powerful Lydecker  by seeking his endorsement for a fountain pen first meeting a rebuff  on the grounds that he writes with 'a goose quill dipped in venom'  how they became a highprofile MayDecember couple in Manhattan  society. But to Lydecker's sniffy chagrin Laura didn't see herself as  his exclusive chattel. There were other men The painter who did her  portrait that hangs over her fireplace for instance out of spite  Lydecker demolished him in the press and then the indolent hulk  Carpenter.  MacPherson learns most of this while interviewing Lydecker in his bath  where the feared and lionized wordsmith fashions his prose on a  typewriter perched atop a trestle across his marble tub 'It's lavish  but I call it home'. With his imperious  queenly  airs Webb takes  his performance as Lydecker into a rarefied realm that can't have  failed to register even in 1944 that of the closeted elegant  gentleman critic using the glamorous Laura as his beard it's a  dimension that was far fainter in the novel. But his fulltilt camping  makes his desperate obsession with Laura  if taken at face value  too  perfumed a lozenge to swallow.  MacPherson's obsession however looks like the real McCoy. The  testimonials to her beauty her vibrancy her elegance start to work on  him until he finds himself holed up at the crime scene  her apartment   gazing at her portrait while drinking himself into a trance to David  Raskin's entrancing title song and falling asleep in her armchair. As  Lydecker puts it he's fallen in love with a corpse. When he awakens  it's to find Laura come back from the dead  actually from her country  place where she's spent the weekend oblivious to her supposed murder.  The victim turns out to be a model who worked at her agency.   Laura's eerie reemergence reactivates all the tensions and antagonisms  slackened or frozen by her presumed death. With Laura now among the  living Lydecker finds in MacPherson a more formidable  'disgustingly  earthy'  rival than the penniless playboy Carpenter while MacPherson  finds himself working not on a remote case but seeking the perpetrator  of the attempted murder of a woman he's infatuated with who since  there was in fact a corpse finds herself a suspect as well....   One of the more perdurable movies of the 1940s Laura nonetheless  remains perplexing. Set in the uppercrust New York of terraced  penthouses and chic botes and the Algonquin Hotel where Lydecker's  prototype Alexander Woolcott held court at the fabled Round Table  it gives off more than a whiff of the Gothic of tales set on the moors  or craggy seacoasts. Echoes of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca abound  above and beyond the presence of Judith Anderson as do those of a more  contemporary New York story I Wake Up Screaming. It's a stylish and  stylized murder mystery that finds the tangled liaisons among its  characters more absorbing than what clues may be hidden inside the  grandfather's clock.   Those characters have been written off as superficial and their  liaisons as implausible a point which carries some validity. The  making of the movie was troubled with producer Darryl Zanuck replacing  Rouben Mamoulian with Preminger then clashing with Preminger over his  casting of the flamboyantly gay Broadway star Webb. Preminger was a  shrewd and worldly man who surely knew how Webb would 'read' even to  audiences in the boondocks not to mention his casting of Price and  Anderson two more actors about whom rumors persist. So there's little  getting around the fact that Laura stands as what has come to be called  a 'coded' movie brimming with subtext.   But coded how? Preminger saw his movie as less about heterosexual  passion gone homicidal than about a superficial culture of celebrity  and hype and image. Lydecker's obsession was not so much with Laura's  flesh as with fantasy  a rising star to which he could he hitch his  jaded wagon. He's a demented fan who fancies that only his own  enthusiasm and puffery make her shine. It's the only version of reality  that the narcissistic grandiose Lydecker can accept with himself as  both creator and custodian of her legend. It was the world Laura too  occupied and enjoyed if fitfully a world which she departed for  meatier trysts albeit with lovers who lived in the same fairyland of  ritzy illusion. Until she met and almost too late MacPherson a prole  without affectation who came to love her as a physical organism rather  than as a creature of publicity a fabulous freak of the zeitgeist.   Under a veneer of arch sophistication aptly captured by director of  photography Joseph LaShelle Preminger found an affirmation of bedrock  American values. But he burrowed into that bedrock by the most oblique  and unlikely of routes having himself a great deal of perverse fun  along the way. As crafty in his own way as Caspary was in hers  Preminger managed to satisfy wartime ticketbuyers and he continues to  satisfy decadent cinastes six decades later.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was rather enjoying this movie as I was watching it but I found myself dissatisfied with the ending and the more I think about the film the more flawed it seems to be. My main complaints are plot holes and character inconsistencies.o Laura is portrayed as a quite intelligent woman. So what does she see in Shelby? Everybody else has figured out this guy is a shallow lying loser. How does she not see through him? Why hasn't the aunt long since opened her eyes? We know that the aunt sees right through him and what's more she wants him for herself.o For that matter what does she see in Waldo? She hates his cold arrogant personality at the start and he does little to hide it the rest of the way. You'd think gratitude or not he would have rubbed her the wrong way much much sooner.o What on EARTH was Shelby doing fooling around with the model in the first place? He was clearly dabbling with the aunt for the money OK. He had a sweetheart deal with her so why was he sacrificing it to marry Laura? The only reasonable answer is that he actually really did love Laura. OK. So what possible reason does he have for risking both of them to trifle with this poor unimportant and not even that great looking model?o Explain to me again why on earth he took the model to Laura's apartment? And dressed her up in Laura's negligee? And why the model went along with this? This is crucial to the plot yet barely touched on.o MOST DAMNING Why why why would Waldo go kill Laura the first time that Friday night when he was on the cusp of victory??? He already knew that she was going to take the weekend to decide if she was going to break off the engagement to Shelby and it sure seemed likely that she was going to. All evidence was that he was succeeding in breaking up that marriage so the If I can't have her nobody will! motive makes NO SENSE!!!Aside from these plot holes and character inconsistencies I had three other complaints.First off the best moment of the film was completely marred for me by bad film making. That is the moment when Laura comes back and we find out she's still alive. The way the scene was shot I was absolutely sure that this was a dream sequence and not really happening. It took me quite a while to readjust my thinking and go along with it all being real. And I was still halfexpecting it to turn out to all have been a dream up to the end of the movie. Turns out I was right. From what I've read there originally was supposed to be an itwasalladream ending that was scrapped. Which is fine the movie is better if she really were still alive and all. But that scene should've been reshot without the detective falling asleep like that. As it stands it's just clumsy and confusing.And then there's Laura herself. She's certainly beautiful. But the character just didn't come off to me as being this amazingly magnificent woman. It's hard to buy why everyone is so obsessed over her. She seems pretty ordinary frankly. I guess the problem was that she failed to make me fall in love with her and so it didn't resonate with me when everybody else did. I agree with what someone else said that she worked better as a painting than a character.Finally I found the ending disappointing. At the moment that the detective announces he's about to make an arrest we had a pretty nicely tangled web with some reasons to suspect every character yet also reasons to doubt. I actually paused the movie at that point to consider the possibilities. I imagined various combinations of possible conspiracies and alliances between various characters less obvious motives surprises. I was hoping for and expecting something much more clever and interesting than just that oldsourpuss did it.So there you have it. My strongest emotion is disappointment. And the usual bewilderment at the people who gush over this movie. It's a shame because handled better this really could have been an excellent film.".

However in many ways it is like The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon because plot point by plot point it is baffling.The body of Laura Hunt Gene Tierney is found shot point blank in the face apparently as she opened the door to her apartment. She is an advertising executive who has risen to high society thanks to doors opened by columnist Waldo Lydecker Clifton Webb who has the opening lines I'll never forget the weekend that Laura died... The third main character is a tough New York cop Detective Mark McPherson Dana Andrews. Mark is instantly smitten with the portrait of Laura that hangs in her apartment. He is so smitten that he seems to forget all rules of evidence and police procedure. He lets a civilian and a suspect himself Waldo accompany him on his rounds to question other suspects and he walks all over the crime scene heck  he practically moves in for a few days reading Laura's private diary and letters and drinks heavily even in the morning while on duty? Was Frank Drebin of Police Squad his only competition when he was promoted? While he was practically moving into Laura's home he MIGHT have asked why her housekeeper continued to come in every day when her mistress was dead. Exactly who was she cleaning up after and who was paying her? Questions unanswered and unasked.And everybody in this film is lying their heads off seemingly to no avail. Vincent Price as the lazy effete amoral Shelby is deliciously funny. Why does he lie  twice  about the classical music concert he claims he attended? To what purpose? And the scene where Laura and Waldo burst in on Shelby and Ann Treadwell Judith Anderson having dinner is priceless. In fact every scene with Price and the wonderful Judith Anderson is both funny and touching. Judith's character really loves this charming skirt chasing gold digger in spite of the fact that she sees all of his flaws. He really should follow her advice and marry her.Well then it turns out that Laura is alive and the very fact that she is alive makes her a suspect too. After all there WAS a killing it just wasn't her! Laura was all mystery and allure when she is just a beautiful portrait with a personality built by Waldo's words and Mark's imagination. However the real Laura is disappointingly ordinary. Waldo does to some degree seem to be her Svengali and he does seem to be right when he says that her doom is being attracted to any guy with a good build. Back to the lying  Laura herself lies like a carpet. What's all that nonsense about the radio? It's there it's not there it's broken it's being fixed....who cares? Why does she lie about whether her radio works or not? Meanwhile once Laura returns Mark's attention in questioning suspects seems to be focused on whether or not Laura really loves Shelby or anybody else in other words does Mark have a shot with her? He acts like a schoolboy every time he gets an answer in the affirmative.How does this all work out? Watch and find out. I highly recommend this one just don't get too wrapped up in the plot. Instead enjoy the atmosphere and dialogue.As an aside this was the first time Clifton Webb had been in any film since 1930 when he costarred in a Vitaphone short with radio personality Fred Allen. He refused to do a screen test from Laura's script but did agree to be filmed doing a scene from The Blythe Spirit which was a play in which he was starring. So at age 55 from his single performance in Laura Clifton Webb was catapulted to stardom at Fox for the next 15 years.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful noir romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler warning at suitable point below Ah love and death I've found myself referencing Laura while thinking about so many other films lately most particularly the excellent Korean thriller Tell Me Something that I just have to add my pennyworth despite being the millionth person to contribute.The premise 1940s New York tough detective called in to investigate a nasty Park Avenue society murder finds himself falling for the victim through her portrait her things his contact with those that knew her. One night a startling twist sends him  and the film  in a completely unexpected direction. Don't mistake the brusqueness of style the punchy delivery and starkness of this film for onedimensionality. Just as the work of Preminger is greater than the sum of its parts so Laura is more than meets the eye. It owes a lot to the excellent and subversive book by Vera Caspary from which it is taken. Am I the only one who had no idea women were instrumental in every subgenre of pulp magazine writing from the 20s to the 50s? Much of the psychodrama came from the book  but the visual and stylistic tone is pure filmic noir. However in classic film noir the femme fatale is always the powder keg for everyone around her and she usually pays for her sin with death. In Laura the central death is only the start of the story not its retributive finale the 'femme fatale' antiheroine is really no such thing and its hero a portrait of curt masculinity falls most unusually for an image an idea.    spoilers from here on    This isn't so much a study in police procedure as a study of a man in love. The underrated Dana Andrews' Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson may seem like a cartoon hardboiled copper but look a little harder his terse tense scrutinising detective is a study in the transformative power of love on such a man. From Waldo Lydecker Laura's friend we learn that McPherson is damaged  a silver shinbone in his leg as a result of a gun battle with a gangster. He reveals very little of himself  we know him rather from what others say or by his actions. But his tension control and intelligence lends an edge to his masculinity. He has ways of looking which speak volumes. His big sad eyes reflect the bafflement of a man lifted by the love he finds himself experiencing. He plays continually with a baseball toy to rein himself in. The point  reinforced by a great punch late in the film  is that he has reason to. The sensual swooning quality of the theme music is made flesh by the magnetic Laura herself Gene Tierney. She's not just beautiful  she's like something people dream of. Mark thinks he's dreaming when he wakes to find her standing before him she's the woman who could make him feel whole. Laura  whom he gets to know uniquely from the inside out  is neither a 'doll' nor a 'dame' his enraging early words and in reaching for her he becomes a gentleman against his own character or background. His 'real' gentleman is in marked contrast to the apparent gentlemen and Laura's admirers that we first meet  the acerbic snippy Waldo Lydecker Clifton Webb on great Wildean form who narrates the first half of the film and the Southern playboy Shelby Carpenter an oddly cast Vincent Price. They both turn out to be fakes in a way. So Laura emerges from her portrait from her elegant apartment and from Waldo's museum  his clock his story his possession  to become real for Mark. From here on in it isn't Waldo's world any more it's hers and his. I think Tierney takes great credit for Laura not merely being the story of a tussle between three men for something they want she shows you that there's something she wants too and that she has the spark and independence to get it.The extraordinary circumstances of McPherson's contact with Laura lends their connection an intimacy which isn't lessened by the suspicion under which she labours. When Mark makes a move to arrest her at one point it's almost as if she wants to go she'd rather be with him under arrest than listen to Waldo's sniping or put up with Shelby's lies and lack of faith in her. The moral ambiguity created by these circumstances sets the tone of the piece creating a sort of swirling swoony romance with a very dark heart.Laura stands watching and rewatching. For an interesting companion piece check out Tierney and Andrews a few years down the line and both incidentally somewhat battered about by life in another great noir Where the Sidewalk Ends. I'd also strongly recommend reading Caspary's original pulp novel of the same name.".

Most of the films I review have an IMDb rating which is too low. LAURA on the other hand currently as I write this with a running score in the high 8's is not a film I would consider underrated. If anything the score is just a tad a touch a whisker too high. Here is the skinny in its day this film was a revelation. Even in its genre it was a standout. The idea of falling in love with a picture is something you would expect in a fantasy or tearjerker not a police procedural or mystery. The audiences that saw it in a theatre were gobsmacked and with the trick ending which I will NOT discuss justifiably so. But the musical question does it hold up well today? I am not so sure. We are talking about a film where the character playing the hook the draw is for all argument's sake not actually there. Like John Cleese would say in the infamous DEAD PARROT skit dead deceased no longer among the living. Therefore the film has to be carried by those talking about her. And to this wizened old reviewer much of those scenes resemble the living room pieces in the old Charlie Chaplin films where the exposition however interesting proceeds much like a stage play with various characters banging lines of dialogue back and forth. If you want to see something from the period which is just as spectacular today as it was then see PORTRAIT OF JENNIE .. this is not an ad I don't get a commission if you do I'm just saying...".

	schema:reviewBody "Empty pleasure.I thought of ending this review there but Dana Andrews deserves more.Laura is a whodunit with a sort of surreal happy ending and enough twists and pretend twists and twists on twists to make you give up guessing and just watch. It's not such a good thing to have the movie control the facts so that we can't participate in solving the mystery not really. I know I gave up on this one easier than other people and for me the second time not remembering who did do it I still gave up on the guessing game. But there is more here than that by far. Just start watching as a start. Very smartly staged and photographed LaShelle masterfully and with strong clean performances mostly from the demurring detective played by Dana Andrews better known for his performance in The Best Years of Our Lives watching is easy. The long scene two thirds through where Andrews is alone in the posh apartment brooding considering puzzling and possibly falling further in love with the dead Gene Tierney of the title role is a little masterpiece of careful restrained moviemaking. As if to confirm his feelings and really make the movie perk up this is where he has a glass of whiskey falls asleep and wakes to see Laura standing there like a mirage or an angel. Or a mistake. Laura the supposedly dead main character we had seen only in flashbacks. From here it takes us on a circuitous wrapping up and we sort of know what will happen though still don't know how to guess who may have done it.There might be some issues of confusion not intendeda plot this precise and interwoven begs for nitpicking. Watch the final big party scene with all the suspects gathered where Andrews accuses implicitly Laura herself. Does she panic? No. If she wants us to think she did it killed the model in her clothes wouldn't she worry that she would go down by mistake? Isn't the electric chair a lot to risk? And then there is the clock and Andrews smashing the bottom panel. Shortly later a replacement panel is perfectly in place. Is this just good police cabinetry? Did I miss something about the second clock there is an exact match somewhere? Finally we would all like to know how Laura could afford such a spectacular and not very attractive apartment on her working woman's salary. No one besides Andrews is especially admirable or evil as a character here. And as actors no one is especially amazing or awful either professional competence begetting the unexceptional. Of note Vincent Price a cult favorite is strained as a chipper disingenuous boyfriend. And potential killer. Clifton Webb is pretty amazing as a disdainful local writer. And potential killer. His verbal barbs are cutting and hilarious all the way through.This is a quirky murder mystery a little cutting edge for its time and yet without social or psychological compensations. Like a Hitchcock thriller we have intrigue and surprise but unlike Hitchcock there is too much composure and glint. And that painfully recurring theme song which became a hit. This is somehow a great movie but a flawed great movie.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes the best portrait are those in which there is a slight mixture of caricature. Laura was a good movie but somewhat dated since the 1940s.";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening title and credits play atop the haunting pause yet recognizably poignant portrait of the eponymous title character as the famous atmospheric haunting theme music 'Laura' by composer David Raksin plays in the background. It's here where this classic film noir directed by Otto Preminger start to become one of the most stylish elegant moody and witty classic films ever made without one scene with any of the ensemble cast of characters or one sentence of dialogue. It create the interest by allowing the viewer to fixedly gaze upon the artist work. By having the portrait in dreamlike highcontrast black and white cinematography characterized by shadowy it allows the audience to know that this movie is a mystery and a psychological study of obsession. Everybody wants to know who in the painting this is and what happen to her. For some more than others this was the case for New York City police detective Mark McPherson Dana Andrews whom investigates the murder of a beautiful and highly successful advertising executive Laura Hunt Gene Tierney. Laura has apparently been killed by a shotgun blast to the face just inside the doorway of her apartment and everybody around her is a suspect. Among of them is a dimwitted parasitic playboy fianc Shelby Carpenter Vincent Price a cynical mannered and prickly society columnist Waldo Lydecker Clifton Webb a loyal housekeeper in Bessie Clary Dorothy Adams and an aging wellheeled matronly socialite Ann Treadwell Judith Anderson. All of them beautiful portrayal by the wellseasoned actors with Andrews doing the best even if his character is now so clichs. Although I like his acting I have to disagree with the Academy for allowing Clifton Webb to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor that year. I found Clifton to be one of the weakest in the picture because how aloof  cartoony his character was. He was alright but not Oscar worthy. I get that this was Clifton Webb's first screen appearance since the silent era but he was a bit over the top. In my opinion actor Barry Fitzgerald deserve his win for 1944's 'Going My Way'. Why because who else can say that they were nominated both for Best Supporting Actor  Best Actor in the same year for the same role in the same movie. Nobody that's who! Despite that the other Oscar nominates such as Best Director Otto Preminger Best Cinematography Joseph LaShelle Best Art Direction and Best Screenplay was truly deserving for the people that work for 'Laura'. Preminger really get mad props from me because how passionate he was for the project. Not only was he willing to work with rival producer Darryl F. Zanuck to produce the film but he also had to replace two weeks of work from outgoing director Rouben Mamoulian including the painting when Darryl F. Zanuck fired Rouben for lack of direction. He deserve the nominated. However the best screenplay nominated could be questionable since a similar theme movie where a man fall in love with a woman's portrait was release during the same year with director Fritz Lang's 1944's film 'The Woman in the Window'. In the end it's up to debate which movie probably rip off whom or was it just all a coincide. We may never know. What we do know is that the crisplywritten screenplay by Jay Dratler Samuel Hoffenstein and Betty Reinhardt was loosely based on the play and novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. A series of changes happen such as the five separate voice narrators being drop the ending of the film alternate and a number of allusions to a character's homosexuality were cut from the script before filming began in favor for a hyperprotective character expressed heterolike jealousy over anyone else's attention toward Laura particularly by the detective who shows some troubling signs of necrophiliac. While the twist toward the end softened the feelings of the detective this was still pretty shocking for the 1940s for a lead character to have. As much as I love the twist ending it does beg the question why the police officers didn't bother doing finger prints or body measurements to make sure who the victims is. While a lot of people do mistaken Laura as an amoral femme fatale. In truth her character felt disappointing as she's nothing like it. She just another damsel in distress broad. Don't get me wrong Gene Tierney is a beautiful creature but this movie isn't one of best roles. Her character haunting theme song is more famous than her role here. Gene Tierney was right with her being adequate here. Overall While this movie was badly cut up due to wartime appeals during its original run. It has since been remastered and clean up for future audiences since the 1990s. Even some versions of DVDs has the rare sequence in which Vincent Price sings a song and accompanies himself on the piano. In the end Laura was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant. Because of that it's one film worth looking out for.".

Don't get me wrong Gene Tierney is a beautiful creature but this movie isn't one of best roles. Her character haunting theme song is more famous than her role here. Gene Tierney was right with her being adequate here. Overall While this movie was badly cut up due to wartime appeals during its original run. It has since been remastered and clean up for future audiences since the 1990s. Even some versions of DVDs has the rare sequence in which Vincent Price sings a song and accompanies himself on the piano. In the end Laura was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant. Because of that it's one film worth looking out for.";

	schema:reviewBody "For decades LAURA has had a big reputation as one of the alltime greats of Hollywood Golden Age cinema. People gush and sigh when they talk about it. It inspires awe. I had seen snippets of it over the years but always lost interest after about five minutes. Having just watched the whole thing through I now know why. Three of the main characters are cast with boring actors so that whenever they are on screen the movie sags and dies. Those actors are Dana Andrews Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Tierney is at least beautiful so that even though you don't care one whit about her as a human being she is pleasant to behold. And truth be told she did excellent work in subsequent films. Andrews was one of the most nondescript actors of his generation with no distinguishing features and no passion. Vincent Price who exuded villainy without trying could have been better but he was either given bad direction by Otto Preminger or had not yet developed much as an actor as he evolves through the course of the story we never care about him never feel what he must be feeling but only listen to his dialogue so that we can follow the plot. He goes through the motions of what his character is supposed to be in a limp fashion. He is supposed to be from Kentucky but hardly ever uses that accent and when he does it's weak. It is also puzzling that the title character praised by others for her warmth and genius and intelligence and magnetism would be attracted to such a zero. The script is good and witty and clever but these actors do not live up to it. There are however two actors who do indeed live up to it and those actors are Clifton Webb and Judith Anderson. Whenever they are on screen the film crackles and delights. With this performance Webb launched a long and successful screen persona as the sarcastic effete authority figure. Anderson with her softly cutting voice chews up any acting partner other than Webb her scene with Tierney in the ladies' room as she dissects her own character and that of Price is priceless! Dorothy Adams is also very good as Tierney's loyal maid. The plot itself is nothing special  just a rather routine murder mystery with more indepth participants than usual. It's a handsome production that physically evokes the penthouse world of New York City in the 40s. The photography is attractive. The score is overrated. After the initial 8note repeated opening motif the muchlauded title tune fizzles out.".

Am I jaded did I miss something andor what's all the fuss over this movie? I figured out in the first 15 minutes who the murderer was and except for some great costumes this flick was regrettably disappointing. The music became insipid after so many rounds. The only notable acting was on the part of Clifton Webb ....Waldo Lydecker who struck me as over the top gay...but of course being 1944...still in the closet. This is a famous movie and I was expecting to be astonished with it's masterful cinematography and script but neither were that outstanding.  As for film noir there are many better examples. The Third Man' and Notorious' come quickly to mind.I think the problem with Laura is that the characters were so lackluster it was difficult to get involved with them. I really disliked Vincent Price in this movie. He was so unconvincing as a Southern gigolo type and he wasn't charming or good looking enough for us to think that Laura could ever truly fall for him. The investigating detective Dana Andrews ....Lt. Mark McPherson was not exactly inspired but at least he could act well enough to be convincing as a policeman. Lastly Laura herself  was really just a pretty face...the very pretty face of Gene Tierney but nothing like the Pygmalion of a woman she was supposed to be portraying. In fact she had more spunk and magnetism before Waldo Lydecker got a hold of her and transformed her into a proper lady. At least it's not listed in the top 100 of IMDB...I hate that when that happens!".

However in the end we realize that there are more equally scary villains out there even if Electro is defeated. The writer and director is Axel Braun and his film here received many nominations and 2 awards at the prestigious Adult Video News Awards. Lead actor is played by Xander Corvus. The first scene takes place at Peter Parker's job. We hear Jonah Jameson rage a bit as usual and then an interracial sex scene follows. The chick there was maybe the hottest in the whole film.A bit later SpiderMan saves Mary Jane from a bunch of thugs and afterward they exchange a bit more than just the famous kiss with the Spider hanging upside down. Mary Jane apparently has not enough yet as she engages with Flash Thomspon and Gwen Stacy in a juicy threesome. Wait aren't these two Parker's girls. Lucky bastard this Flash. There is also a hooker scene but this one wasn't too great or hot in my opinion. However the crucial moment with Electro shooting was probably the funniest moment of the film admittedly one of not really many funny moments. The biggest letdown however was the final scene with SpiderMan and Black Widow. Widow played by Johansson in the films is really a great character but the actress playing her did absolutely nothing for me. Very disappointing and this film certainly did not end on a high note. Braun made a sequel to this one. I hope that one will maybe be better. I cannot really recommend SpiderMan XXX A Porn Parody.".

	schema:headline " Another great French film about children";
	schema:reviewBody "The film tells the story of young Paulette and Michel. It takes place in the french countryside during the war. Paulette's parents are killed and she wanders into the lives of Michel and his family. The Forbidden Games in the title refers to Paulette and Michel's concept of religion in order to come deal with death They steal crosses around the village and create a cemetery for Paulette's dead dog and other village animals. You feel so much love between the older Michel to Paulette. When the end comes and officials have to take Paulette away the sadness one feels is so intense. Looking at Michel his feeling of sadness and betrayal and watching Paulette deal with her loneliness and fear and having the movie end on such a sad and abrupt note seemed right to me. This is truly a great motion picture.French filmmakers just seem to have such great instincts when it comes to making films about children. This classic film started the wave of fine films about children which includes many of Truffaut's films such as The 400 blows and Small Change..also Ponette La Vie en Rose the Dardennes' La Promesse Le Fils and Rosetta Sundays with Cybele Louis Malle's Murmur of the Heart and Au revoir les Enfants and a great recent documentary To be and To Have. The children in these films and in countless other french films are treated as human beings not cute cuddly creatures. We follow these children through their lives and it gives us hope for our own children we realize that they have such a deep capacity themselves to feel to think to learn to suffer to love... When I see most of the movies coming out of Hollywood about children and I see the commercialization of it all and then see how many of our kids turn out I say.....well what did you expect. Francois Truffaut once said that you should not make films about children because you want to understand them better no it should simply be because you love them. We feel Clement's love in this film.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece with a misleading title";
	schema:reviewBody "In French the title of this movie is perhaps appropriate but in English it is misleading. What is forbidden about the games that the children play has nothing to do with sex the usual designation of forbidden in English. Instead what 11yearold Michel Dolle Georges Poujouly and 5yearold Paulette Brigitte Fossey do that is forbidden is they steal crosses from the cemetery from the top of a horsedrawn hearseMichel even attempts to steal the rector's crucifix. They do this as a way of coping with death. The crosses are for dead animals her dog some chicks a worm etc. that they have buried in a little plot under the mill near a stream.But this is not a horror show or anything like it. Instead Ren Clment's celebrated tale of childhood love is actually a strongly religious antiwar movie of incredible delicacy laced with humor and poignancy.It begins with an air attack on a stream of people presumably Parisians running from Paris along a country road trying to escape the encroachment of the Nazi army. Little Paulette is in a car with her parents and her little dog Jock. They are gunned down by a German fighter plane. Paulette's parents and the dog are killed. Paulette is left alone carrying the dead dog in her arms. Eventually she wanders onto a farm where she is met by Michel who takes an instant liking to her and becomes her protector and her friend. His is a peasant family of farmers who really don't need another mouth to feed but they take her in. She is so clean they exclaim and she smells so good. She is from Paris. She has just undergone the most horrible terror the death of her parents and her dog and now she must somehow come to grips with that loss. What transpires is a child's interpretation of the healing power of religious ritual and symbol.Clment uses the world of the children as a counterpoint to the war in the background and as a gentle satire on the church. The children make a game of religion and in doing so demonstrate the healing power of ritual and sacrament.What makes this totally original and deeply symbolic film work is the uncluttered and naturalistic vision of Clment and his wonderful direction of his two little stars. Fossey in particular is amazing. She is completely unaffected and natural an adorable little girl suddenly alone in the world who must make a new world for herself against great odds. Her sense of personal integrity and her strong will makes us believe that somehow she will succeed. Incidentally Fossey's performance here in conveying the creative world of the child should be compared with 4yearold Victoire Thivisol's performance in Jacques Doillon's Ponette 1996 as should the skill and vision of the directors. Both are deeply religious films that rely on the presocialized world of the child to show us our own spirituality.Also very good is Poujouly as the farm boy who loves little Paulette and shows that love by assuming the psychological and spiritual responsibility for helping her to overcome the tragedy of being so brutally orphaned. He is himself experiencing a preadolescent coming of age a transition exemplified by rebellion and a growing independence of mind and spirit. Poujouly is intense and fully engaged so much so that in one scene we can see him mouth in unison Paulette's lines in preparation for his time to speak. Clment left this in perhaps because he knew it would further characterize Michel's intensity.This film won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1952 and an Academy Award the same year as best foreign film. It is one of the wonders of the French cinema a masterpiece of the human spirit not to be missed. See it for the children whose strength of character can inspire us all.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rene Clement's Jeux Interdits opens with perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war committed to celluloid. A multitude of Parisians file down a dusty country road while the Luftwaffe circles above. Bombs drop machine guns blaze. At the end of it a little girl is orphaned moreover she's crushed her beloved dog Jock in an attempt to escape the machine gun fire that took down her parents. Not shocked and not necessarily sad the girl carries the limp puppy onward she does not know he is dead until an elderly couple picks her up and tosses the lifeless canine into a nearby river. It's a completely devastating way to spend ten minutes. The remaining film in which the little girl Paulette comes to live with the rustic Dolles and cause their young son Michel to become totally smitten is now less emotionally charged though it does lack a certain visceral gutpunching quality inherent in the film's beginning. Jeux Interdits explores death through the eyes of children who either do not understand or only partly understand the concept. The mysteriousness of mortality has never been more touchingly portrayed and I can think of few other films that dwell so singlemindedly on this theme. There probably do not need to be more films like this as when you hit the perfect note on your first attempt there's no need for another try. Additionally childhood has rarely been captured so accurately the apparent callous innocence of these children is pitch perfect and recalls to mind the axiom forgive them they know not what they do. The youths in this film are not idealized Paulette is selfish and finicky but that is not a character faultshe's simply youngand Michel eager to please her commits acts at which the audience frowns but which the audience understands. Though innocents these children are anything but idealized and that's immensely important to a film that deals with so much death. Beyond thematics the acting especially by the kids is uniformly excellent and adds to the touching humanism of the film. The cinematography and framing is also wonderful. It's subtle but Clement arranges his actors within the frame in a masterful and painterly way. Watching the film I paused it several times to simply enjoy the tableau. All in all Jeux Interdits is an amazing achievement and I think should be more highly regarded or it should simply be regarded by a wider audience. It ranks among the best in French filmamong the 400 Blows the Grand Illusions the Breathlesses. It's a remarkable movie which you should watch immediately.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am really drawn to art that makes clean choices about messy things in order to deliver the richness of the mess cleanly.Its a complicated set of tradeoffs part abstracting things away part enriching or amplifying things. Cinema is different than any other art because nominally we presume we are seeing reality. The people and things we see are real and the situations seem real.But what we actually get is refined. There are two pleasures to such projects. One is the inhaling of the world we are presented with then living with it as it commingles with our blood. The other is a sort of external appreciation of what choices were made how expertly the arrows were made and what craft there was in how we were tracked and captured.This is a wonderful film in both respects and likely will stay with you dually for the rest of your life. Clean and messy.One of the messes is accidental as is probably true in most real art. The story is truncated abruptly because funding was. If you didn't know that you might be amazed at how adroitly this storyteller dropped the narrative to keep us in the story once it has ended. And you might marvel at how appropriate that is given the girl's own loss of story.The nominal threads are about losses and the superficialities of religion to cover them. This is wrapped in an evocation of dear childhood innocence deep bonds impulsive large projects. And of course adults who have no idea of the real world nor appreciation for the bonds to it. We can get all this because the ordinary skills acting writing staging are performed so well that they get out of the way.However along the way we become aware that the filmmaker murders a finally twitching puppy before our eyes.I'd like to highlight the external view the one that looks as what is refined and what leavened. Simplified in story thread and child's perspective. Enriched in emotion engagement and unexpected shape. Its sweet and dark both. Its emotionally casual and deeply affecting both. Its both distinctly French and universal something that is rare in my experience. Bresson can't touch this. Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Clement opens his film with a harrowing and totally realistic airraid sequence but proceeds with a charming and humorous depiction of simple farm life which revolves around the household church and cemetery the latter two settings in fact host two of the film's most entertaining sequences. Of course the paradox of the children's love for animals and the need to populate their secret cemetery and utilizing stolen crosses no less is only the direct result of the children's impossibility of grasping the world around them the children's cruelty to animals the boy's stabbing of a cockroach with a pen for example is just as sensible to him as the barrage of bombs which the civilized adults throw at each other day in day out.The remarkable performances by the two young children Brigitte Fossey and Georges Poujouly are certainly among the finest of their kind but the film also takes care to offer eccentric characters for its relatively unknown ensemble cast to sink their teeth in including an early role for familiar character actor Jacques Marin as the illfated Georges whose untimely death has a pivotal bearing on the film's plot.

Together the two children create what can only be describes long before Stephen King even came on the scene a pet cemetery in a local mill beginning with the dog which is supplemented by the odd chicken worm etc and for which they steal real crosses inadvertently aggravating a longstanding feud. This is a film that has it all laughter tears and everything in between and cannot be praised too highly and will be around long after Truffaut's ouevre has been turned into banjo pics.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forbidden Games Rene Clement's masterpiece is a magnificent document about the absurdity of war. This antiwar film has given a lot of pleasure to audiences since its release. The film juxtaposes the madness of the conflict during WWII to the innocence of a child who is caught in its web of death and destruction.We are taken to the French countryside as people are leaving the madness behind in search of safer havens where the war would spare them of the tragedy the country was living during those days. Paulette a girl who is fleeing with her parents has only one thing in mind to stay with her beloved dog. As her pet gets loose she runs across a bridge to rescue him when German aircraft strike killing her parents and her precious dog.Paulette wanders deep in the country and is discovered by Michel Dolle a farm boy a bit older than Paulette. These two will bond with one another in ways that only innocent children would. Michel feels protective of this orphan girl. The Dolle family are poor peasants that are eking a life out of their land during difficult times. They have quarreled with their neighbors the Gouards. The Dolles accept gladly the stray girl who obviously comes from a different world than theirs.The little girl who wants to bury her dog suddenly discovers death all around her. She finds in Michel a friend and an ally who will prove he is a true friend until the end. Michel in turn sees an opportunity to show Paulette his knowledge in the ways of the farm. When Michel's brother Georges die both he and Paulette come face to face with a new reality they can't comprehend. Suddenly their games take a new turn. The little girl's fascination with crosses and tombs come to a head as they go to the village's cemetery to bury Georges. In the graveyard Paulette finds a treasure trove of the beloved objects all over the place and she and Michel must have them to mark the tombs of their dead animals something a child's mind could ever conceive. The local priest and the two families are shocked by the discovery when after all in Paulette's mind it was a new kind of game in her new surroundings.Rene Clement made an excellent job in this classic that will stay one of the most beloved pieces of film making of all times. Mr. Clement was extremely lucky in finding the luminous Brigitte Fossey to bring to life Paulette. Pairing this young non professional with Georges Poujouly proved to be the right combination as the two children blend seamlessly together complimenting each other throughout the picture. Brigitte Fossey who was about five years old when the shooting took place gives a performance that perhaps no other professional child actor has ever equaled. The Criterion DVD transfer we watched shows how wonderfully they have preserved this film for future generations to enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Forbidden Games Rene Clement's masterpiece is a magnificent document about the absurdity of war. This antiwar film has given a lot of pleasure to audiences since its release. The film juxtaposes the madness of the conflict during WWII to the innocence of a child who is caught in its web of death and destruction.We are taken to the French countryside as people are leaving the madness behind in search of safer havens where the war would spare them of the tragedy the country was living during those days. Paulette a girl who is fleeing with her parents has only one thing in mind to stay with her beloved dog. As her pet gets loose she runs across a bridge to rescue him when German aircraft strike killing her parents and her precious dog.Paulette wanders deep in the country and is discovered by Michel Dolle a farm boy a bit older than Paulette. These two will bond with one another in ways that only innocent children would. Michel feels protective of this orphan girl. The Dolle family are poor peasants that are eking a life out of their land during difficult times. They have quarreled with their neighbors the Gouards. The Dolles accept gladly the stray girl who obviously comes from a different world than theirs.The little girl who wants to bury her dog suddenly discovers death all around her. She finds in Michel a friend and an ally who will prove he is a true friend until the end. Michel in turn sees an opportunity to show Paulette his knowledge in the ways of the farm. When Michel's brother Georges die both he and Paulette come face to face with a new reality they can't comprehend. Suddenly their games take a new turn. The little girl's fascination with crosses and tombs come to a head as they go to the village's cemetery to bury Georges. In the graveyard Paulette finds a treasure trove of the beloved objects all over the place and she and Michel must have them to mark the tombs of their dead animals something a child's mind could ever conceive. The local priest and the two families are shocked by the discovery when after all in Paulette's mind it was a new kind of game in her new surroundings.Rene Clement made an excellent job in this classic that will stay one of the most beloved pieces of film making of all times. Mr. Clement was extremely lucky in finding the luminous Brigitte Fossey to bring to life Paulette. Pairing this young non professional with Georges Poujouly proved to be the right combination as the two children blend seamlessly together complimenting each other throughout the picture. Brigitte Fossey who was about five years old when the shooting took place gives a performance that perhaps no other professional child actor has ever equaled. The Criterion DVD transfer we watched shows how wonderfully they have preserved this film for future generations to enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a solid reminder of how a film does not need to be graphically violent sex ridden and controversydrenched to really affect the viewer. I picked this movie up from my local library and have watched it twice in the last two days. I chose this title simply because it bore the Criterion Collection emblem on the jacket cover and I had heard nothing about the movie at all before that time. That being said i knew very little of what to expect nor would i be prepared for the power of this movie.From the opening scenes the audience is thrown into a world of chaos and terror. This world is then filtered through the eyes of Paulette a young french girl as she struggles to find safety and peace from the destruction and displacement of world war two. She meets a young farmboy Michel with whom she instantly bonds. Michel and Paulette begin to play games hence the title and create worlds separate from the noise and confusion of adults. Together they search for peace within their microcosm and in their own way serve as symbols for love and friendship as Michel attempts to constantly make Paulette happy and Paulette in turn gives Michel something his large family never has time to award him love.Through breathtaking cinematography and flawless acting Forbidden Games captivates and holds that captivation for its entirety. With strong antiwar messages this film still pertains to the present and will continue to stay relevant so long we as a human race continue to make war. There will always be children that will have to somehow rationalize the seemingly unfathomable actions of adults and there will always be adults who should turn to their children to learn the simple pleasures of life ignored in the bustle of growing old.".

However that may be part of the movie's greatness. The alternative ending and beginning that I saw on the DVD were soulless and without power.

This time the war leaves all alone a very young girl a French girl who saw the consequences of war before any other thing. It's a difficult beginning focusing in the desperation the desperation of people from anywhere that the only thing they want is to find some peace for their families a peace that is just impossible to find. Everything happened because the love of her to her dog but it could have happened because of any other and extremely little detail the only thing relevant is that three lives were destroyed and one will never be the same. From here everything is new for Paulette and she has the enough fortune to find complete new people in a complete different environment. Those were good people and soon Paulette was the new little daughter and sister. Michel is the closest brother of course and from here everything is a game a game that for them is quite important. They don't have a fascination for death itself they and specially Paulette have the fascination for new things that were unknown so they went across with death and other things. Paulette is marked and everything turns around her dog so when she knows that her parents were buried she wants the same for her dog when she knows what Michel knows about cemeteries she wants to build one because she don't want to leave her dog all alone and in the same way works when she knows how to make a prayer. No one would ever believe that two little kids were trying to make a cemetery so everything well especially the situation with the crosses was considered just as a prank or even as a matter of Michel's own business. Not before that situation was related to the typical rival family that provides a Shakespeare situation with two young persons. The final situation shows more about how the friendship between Michel and Paulette grow with the time both now being confidants in a friendship that has to end and the girl is lost Jeux interdits or Forbidden Games is a film recognized in the Venice Film Festval BAFTA Awards etc but honestly I never heard before about it or about its director Ren Clment. Fortunately the Criterion Collection selection has never disappointment me so when I went across this DVD it was not hard to make a decision. It is a gem. As you have already read or heard we have two impressive and really moving performances of Georges Poujouly and Brigitte Fossey for both was their first film. There's not a lot to write about the support cast since is just excellent and since Georges Poujouly and Brigitte Fossey steals the film.Then Jeux interdits is a beautiful piece of work and the kind of film that once you saw it and loved it you must show it to anyone you know to share it's wonders. Soon I will do that meanwhile here I give my highest recommendations about it.The Criterion Collection DVD is a presentation with only one disc the picture looks really good and definitely that's the most important thing in this case. The extra material is few but quite good and interesting in the case of the interviews. In 10 minutes or so Clment express some of his experiences of the filming Literally when I finished Forbidden Games it was like lifting an invalid out of bed fearing he might die the next moment and of course his thoughts as a filmmaker about if Cinema was dying Its still an art and I believe in it. The other really interesting extra is both the alternate opening and ending that changes everything for Michel and Paulette but not the context of the story. Oh and it contains a beautifully printed booklet with an essay by Peter Matthews.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forbidden Games deals with the reaction of a couple of children Paullette who losses both her parents as the consequence of an air attack and Michel the youngest of a peasant family in which Paullete finds refuge in the context of the horrors of war in this case the second world war in 1940.The movie unlike others dealing with children and war like Germany Year Zero does not portray a miserable and deadly environment. Certainly war is sensed all the time and the danger of falling bombs is ever present. However the movie is set in the seemingly peaceful countryside not among ruins and combats. That doesn't diminish the tragic context of the movie at all. Because we have witnessed what Paullette has gone through. And although Michel doesn't seem to have had any kind of traumatic loss he's old enough to know what's going on and what Paullette is suffering. Maybe this explains the way Michel wants to please Paullette in her way to direct her pain. Their game of stealing crosses to complete a big animal cemetery could be seen as a morbid and macabre play by children spoiled by the war transformed into monsters. However we never question the innocence that remains in the main characters as children that they are what's macabre is not what they do it's the war that they are witnessing. They just channel the influence of war and its implicit dead without malice.Whether this topic is analyzed as the simplicity of an ill influenced child's play or through any psychological or mental connotations or meanings that could be applied Forbidden Games is still even today a very original piece of cinema that would hardly reach the same meaning if it's filmed today without the context and recent history that influenced it back in 1952. Anyway nowadays any director that would try to make a movie like this would find himself being very cautious and I think he would end up doing something too tragic or too simplistic. Ren Clement did the right thing with the material that was handed to him and the story and its meaning is so powerful and well executed that can still be enjoyed today. And what seems to be an open ending is useful to reminds us that in war for children there are no happy ending stories.Unlike what one might think about a movie made in 1952 and with children as the lead actors acting is flawless. I said that we never question the innocence of the children and that is due in great part to the looks and great work of Briggitte Fossey and Georges Poujoly whom give great credibility to that premise.Criterion Collection has made available this magnificent movie on DVD for the first time. As usual it's a commendable work of restoration in many senses in the sense of allowing more people like me to get to know this movie and in the sense of giving it the best quality that the latest techniques allow.The original French soundtrack is included along with the English dubbed both of them monophonic. Of course English subtitles are included.As Bonus materials we have alternate opening and ending that would have given the movie a different context less realistic if you will. But I cannot help but think that they would have given the story some more contrasting connotations. Also there are interviews with the director alone and him with Briggitte Fossey both from the 60's and an interview with the actress in 2.001.Unlike some other Criterion releases there is no additional track with an expert shedding some light on aspects that might be of interest but a little printed essay is included in a booklet.My only complaint here is that in IMDb this movie has a relative low qualification and few votes. I hope that the availability of the new Criterion release will change things in the near future.".

	schema:headline " A lost prologue and epilogue for this film  Who knew?";
	schema:reviewBody "This great film has been welldescribed here and elsewhere and I don't know that there's a lot more to be said about its worth. It made a great impression on me when I first saw it in an Englishdubbed version on late night TV many years ago and it has always been a favorite of mine since then.But it seems there's often a bit more to learn about an old favorite film. In this case I acquired a foreign DVD edition of Les Jeux interdits which contained besides some interesting outtakes a laterdeleted prologue and epilogue to the film which I had never heard of before. These did not have English subtitles so I had to guess what was being said but Clement's direction and the acting of young Fossey and Poujouly are so good that I could follow almost all of it without knowing very much French at all. They establish a sort of framing device for the story in that the plot of the film is in fact a story from a book being read by the boy to the girl. In the prologue we see Fossey and Poujouly not dressed in grimy peasant clothes at all but clean scrubbed and in their Sundaybest sitting on a log over a stream. The boy begins reading the story of Paulette and Michel out of the book and we fade into the film as we now know it beginning with the refugees on the road. After the sad ending of the story we fade back to the epilogue where the boy has just finished reading. The heartbreaking ending of the story has the girl in tears of despair. So the boy in an act of kindness to her pretends to read a blank page at the end of the book and makes up a happy ending to the story to dispel her grief.I guess I can see why it might have been deleted later as it tends to soften the force of the central narrative a bit and the devastating sadness of its ending. But it really is a beautiful and touching bit of film and I'm very happy to have a chance to see it as I don't think it's been seen much over the years or that many fans of this film are even aware of it.The outtakes are quite interesting as well as they show some alternate takes of familiar scenes including the snapping of that little blackboard thing with the title of the film at the start of the shots what's that thing called anyway?. There is also some footage of the old owl in the rafters of the mill in which you can occasionally see Clement coming into the frame to turn the owl's head around toward the camera when it keeps turning away.With or without the missing prologue and epilogue  this is a great masterpiece that you should experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my all time favorites! I've been looking for this one for a long long time. Having very strong documentary features this film keeps surprising the viewer every minute. It is at least for the first half an hour or so as if someone just shouldered a camera and followed Horsemouth around Kingston doing his daily hustlin' business. Most of the the main characters are real people playing themselves esp. reggae artists and producers and most of the locations are real as well. Later the plot turns into kind of a Robin Hood scenario when the ghetto people strike back against the upper class mafia guys. What I like most about this movie is its many layers. It's like a deep insight into Jamaican society of the late 70's the golden era of roots reggae in all its many aspects like class struggle Rastafari family and religious issues. Several times like in the opening scene or when Horsey gets punched by Sunshine's father characters directly address the viewer personally by facing the camera which I've never seen used like this anywhere else. Technically it's remarkably well done apart from some pretty dark underexposed moments for instance they manage to have many songs of the soundtrack coming from actual sources in the picture. In one word Great stuff not only if you're into old school dub and reggae. If you have it treasure it! If you don't get it and then treasure it.".

The musical performances are topnotch especially a stunning a capella rendition of Jah No Dead by Burning Spear and Horsemouth actually makes a pretty good actor filled with righteous indignation as he goes after the Mafia boy who t'ief his bike.

Do not lend it out or you might not see it again sight? Without taking away from the great directing Theodore Bafaloukos did this movie almost makes itself!

But he rises above them and meets the challenge. The end is perfect and sweet. The use of real people as actors and the very poignant of real life in Jamaica is incredibly unusual.

This is a movie that should have never been made and is one of the worst of the series. This film is really for Halloween completest only and is for the most part unwatchable. The storyline that ended Halloween 4 isn't revisited with no explanation and goes in a really strange and awful direction that is continued in the EVEN WORSE film that follows. The whole man in black concept is ridiculous and silly and actually isn't even explained until the next film. The acting is very bad and Donald Pleasance seems like he is really slowing down and ill throughout the film. I actually felt sorry for him watching this.

Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers was one of the sequels that I wasn't to fond of when first watched it but after continuous repeat viewings its slightly growing on me nonetheless still it's not without its problems in what is an unsatisfying exercise. While a little more grittier being very misogynistic and graphic which the previous sequel wasn't with its deaths it's runofthemill formula fell on the dull lumpy side with it being less punctuated with grinding suspense and moody atmosphere as some of it takes place in full daylight concentrating on visceral unpleasantness and plastered jump scares. This lowbudget production feels like a rushed job and the misguided wishy washy script just doesn't cut it even with a decent concept for its basis and a few unsettling surprises that caught me off guard. However there are some odd out of character moments involving Michael toying with his victims driving after them in what I guess beats slowly walking after them and showing a glimpse of emotion is just to name a few useless comic routine police officers with ridiculous sound effects backing them up and a cloudy inclusion of a man dressed in black that seems to be following Michael around. The performances are simply mediocre however the like of Danielle Harris radiates again and Ellie Cornell proves how much of a bold talent she is with a terrifically wholesome turn. Donald Pleasance looks ragged but he passionately camps it up with some morbid streaks to show the obsessive strangle hold Myers has over Loomis' personally and mentally. As now he would do anything to get his man even risking the life of Jamie to do so. Outside these three there's not much else. I didn't find the teens here as agreeably likable. Dominique OtheninGirard's direction is competent but generically flat with little visual styling which was an imprint of Return and few intensity filled pockets of shocks which you only wished it could hold it throughout. Still Michael is used unnervingly as a foreshadow within the background of many shots and it always seems to work as he could be lurking anywhere. Also the creative novelty of the film's opening credits is a nice touch. It's more of the same but an watchable pedestrian slasher blanketed with shocks.".

It seems like every horror movie sequel has to have it Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street had it why not include the Halloween franchise as well? Unfortunately I didn't get into it I think because it was extremely unoriginal and not to mention that the story didn't really continue from the 4th sequel. The ending of Halloween 4 had Jamie turning evil I guess they just totally dropped that idea which could have been great to see instead we got a silly and typical horror story that was badly acted edited and directed.Michael Myers makes his way into a small shack by the river owned by a local hermit. Once there Michael collapses and remains in a comatose state for a full year. On October 30th Michael awakens kills the hermit and returns to terrorize Haddonfield where his young niece Jamie Lloyd continues to live after nearly being killed by Michael the year before. Jamie has been mute since attacking her foster mother at the end of film 4 but exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her evil uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis realizes that this link exists and plans to use it to put an end to Michael's reign of terror. Michael begins stalking Rachel and her friend Tina. After both are killed Jamie agrees to put herself in danger to help Loomis stop Michael for good. With Jamie's help Loomis lures Michael back to the old Myers house. Michael makes many attempts at killing Jamie finally getting the chance to in the attic. Jamie tries appealing to Michael's humanity by calling him Uncle. Myers pauses prompting Jamie to ask to see his face. He takes off his mask and a lone tear runs down his face. Jamie reaches up to wipe it away and Michael is thrown into a rage. The killer pursues Jamie who runs into Loomis. The doctor seems to turn on the girl as he shouts for Michael to come and take her. It turns out that he has used the girl as bait thus leading Michael to walk beneath a heavy chain net. But you have to see what happens next by watching the movie.While granted that this movie isn't the worst movie in the world I do enjoy the Halloween sequels I think this was a fall in the story line for the Halloween series. It really could have had a lot of potential but since they dropped a few ideas that were presented in the previous Halloween sequel. Not to mention this is one of the rare times that I wasn't scared by Michael he's loosing his touch no I can't say that please I can't say that it's the writing! It's the blasted writing! So if you wanna see the sequels yeah do watch it just to see the story continue but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general you can skip Halloween 5.510".

Instead of genuine characters all we have here are Porkystyle sexmad teenagers with nothing approaching an IQ between them.  There's even a scene set in a barn similar to the one in some of the Friday the 13th films.

And why does Myers' mask look nothing like the one he wore in the previous films? One good point in this film is Donald Pleasence who is at his best as an overwhelming Dr Loomis who dominates his every scene and makes the film worth viewing.

Inexplicably Michael coexists with this individual foragainan entire year without incident. Without warning Michael decides to off his caretaker without warning so as to pursue his original plan of finally putting an end to the Myers family name with the murder of his niece Jamie.I have a few questions about this.First why was it necessary that the movie take place on year later? Wouldn't it have been more feasible a relative term given the circumstances to be sure to have Michael lay unconscious for several days before coming to and continuing his reign of terror? Logistically having him exist in some sort of comatose state for a full calendar year without food water or any kind of nutrition seems like an unnecessary stretch on the flip side if he were conscious during that time why would he wait so long to dispatch of this poor sap who would naturally serve as little more than creative kill fodder for the imposing slasher? Any way you slice it pun intended it just doesn't make any sense.Given the ridiculousness of how movies of this type play out I'll concede that such a complaint could be viewed as a moot point. I only dwell on it here because it serves as the perfect example of just the sort of moronic plot developments that plague the fifth outing of the now dwindling franchise.Jamie having been placed in a juvenile sanitarium for the attempted murder of her foster mother now has some kind of magical ESP connection with her maskwearing uncle. It's explained that Michael is actually the one who forced Jamie to brutally stab her mother with a pair of scissors at the conclusion of the fourth film. In fact any time Michael is about to do what he does best she wigs out and the omniscient and omnipotent Dr. Loomis swoops in to decipher her writhing and what it means about Michael's next move. Thrown into the mix is some sort of mystic cowboy clad in all black who dons the same Druidish tattoo as Michael. The guy roams around Haddonfield keeping tabs on the now grown up boy wonder never doing anything of particular note well that's not entirely truehe does implement a breakout of Michael from the county jail after the perennial sociopath is finally subdued but this is confusing odd and does nothing to advance the story within the framework of the movie. All of this I suppose is designed to serve as a leadin to the sixth film.If you're scratching your head rolling your eyes or doing both at the same time you're not alone. As things progressed I found myself increasingly frustrated at the missed opportunities of Halloween 5 as the aftermath of the fourth film's conclusion suggested an interesting new direction for the series that is never made tangible. Instead we're forced to endure a stale entry that's full of logical inconsistencies.All of that said this entry is still superior to Halloween 3 and methinks that's worth at least an extra half star.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ho boy where to begin? At this point in the series Dr. Loomis has become abusive the characters are all hateful Michael's slipping and the scripts are making even less sense.We begin right where we left off from Halloween 4 a la Halloween I and II Michael escapes from the mine shaft crawls to safety and gets nursed back to health by some random bum with a parrot. One year later and with a lot more energy his immediate action once he's able to move is to off the bum and head back to town hoping to hunt down his niece who now has a psychic connection with him. A troop of teenagers are introduced and the movie promises carnage. Sort of.This movie is bad. By bad I mean incompetent on pretty much every level. In horror movies part of the delight and part of the terror is the fact that the teenagers die but one character at least we hope will live. Not so in this one. Every single character is a hateful stereotypical 80s idea of idiocy and Michael's carnage can't come soon enough. This storytelling is backed up by probably some of the worst editing and directing I've ever seen as characters move sporadically through jump cuts to... well they don't really do much of anything except ignore the warnings of a traumatized little child with a psychic connection to a serial killer. That role is given over to Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis who somehow still has a practice and still is listened to despite the fact that at this point he breaks about every rule of clinical ethics and the fact that he's an obnoxious jerk.Breaks every rule... that's what this movie does. This movie is so unable to bring actual horror suspense or gory delights to the fore that it literally just bumbles around hoping for something to photograph until Michael comes around and then the storyline and directing are so incompetent they can't even make Michael seem cool. The scenes in the barn are pretty much mustsee for film students who want to know exactly what NOT to do. And then as if it's not enough the movie has the audacity to introduce a new character for the sole purpose of letting Michael out of prison... who he is what he's there for what he knows even if it's a he... there's no explanation. They literally wrote a character into the script because they were too lazy to know how to end this movie. That's like THE single basic screenplay nono.Of course there's always room for camp but camp only works when the film goes in outrageous directions and does things creative and fun. This movie isn't even creative enough to come up with crazy outthere ideas like Halloween 3 it just lazily serves the tropes of its genre without even the craft and skill required to make a successful continuity cut! By the time this movie ends you will feel frustrated bored betrayed and uninterested. While this movie plays you will wish for every character to die just so that you no longer have to watch their stupid mindless antics and you will regret renting or buying the disc. Halloween 5 isn't even worth the plastic it's printed on and that's bad considering how cheap it is to put things on DVD.PolarisDiB".

At this point in the series Dr. Loomis has become abusive the characters are all hateful Michael's slipping and the scripts are making even less sense.We begin right where we left off from Halloween 4 a la Halloween I and II Michael escapes from the mine shaft crawls to safety and gets nursed back to health by some random bum with a parrot. One year later and with a lot more energy his immediate action once he's able to move is to off the bum and head back to town hoping to hunt down his niece who now has a psychic connection with him. A troop of teenagers are introduced and the movie promises carnage. Sort of.This movie is bad. By bad I mean incompetent on pretty much every level. In horror movies part of the delight and part of the terror is the fact that the teenagers die but one character at least we hope will live. Not so in this one. Every single character is a hateful stereotypical 80s idea of idiocy and Michael's carnage can't come soon enough. This storytelling is backed up by probably some of the worst editing and directing I've ever seen as characters move sporadically through jump cuts to... well they don't really do much of anything except ignore the warnings of a traumatized little child with a psychic connection to a serial killer. That role is given over to Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis who somehow still has a practice and still is listened to despite the fact that at this point he breaks about every rule of clinical ethics and the fact that he's an obnoxious jerk.Breaks every rule... that's what this movie does. This movie is so unable to bring actual horror suspense or gory delights to the fore that it literally just bumbles around hoping for something to photograph until Michael comes around and then the storyline and directing are so incompetent they can't even make Michael seem cool. The scenes in the barn are pretty much mustsee for film students who want to know exactly what NOT to do. And then as if it's not enough the movie has the audacity to introduce a new character for the sole purpose of letting Michael out of prison... who he is what he's there for what he knows even if it's a he... there's no explanation. They literally wrote a character into the script because they were too lazy to know how to end this movie. That's like THE single basic screenplay nono.Of course there's always room for camp but camp only works when the film goes in outrageous directions and does things creative and fun. This movie isn't even creative enough to come up with crazy outthere ideas like Halloween 3 it just lazily serves the tropes of its genre without even the craft and skill required to make a successful continuity cut! By the time this movie ends you will feel frustrated bored betrayed and uninterested. While this movie plays you will wish for every character to die just so that you no longer have to watch their stupid mindless antics and you will regret renting or buying the disc. Halloween 5 isn't even worth the plastic it's printed on and that's bad considering how cheap it is to put things on DVD.PolarisDiB";

But this film excells when it cuts to the real story of Meyers chasing the girl and the doctor's relentless pursuit.  Thank goodness it refrains from too much extreme gore ad special effects which has hurt horror so much in maby other films.Meyers here is madder than usual and more hyper.  He also commits some murders that make him a truly hated figure to me.  Spoiler  At the end I wished there would have been another quick sequel and really wanted to know what would happen especially to the little girl and the doctor.  I know that there would not be another Halloween for 8 years so I do not really know.  I have not seen 6 yet but I fear 8 years is too long to remain relevant to the little girl's story.  4 and 5 makes you really want to meet the doctor and the little girl as if they were real people.  Perhaps that is the most haunting thing in the series.  Now that Pleasance has really died one can only wonder that movies can in some ways can be far more than movies.".

And this time around Miky proves he has a dark sense of humor.  I especially like his choice in masks in Halloween 5 . . . But is it scary?  No but there are a few genuine intense moments towards the end as Michael inevitably runs out of victims and closes in on the stars.  I liked all the chases involving Danielle Harris and confrontations between Donald Pleasence and evil personified . . . even if said confrontations are on the silly side.Speaking of Harris despite her character not being able to talk in the script she manages to rise far above the material and actually pull it off. Or in other words while her character was written by a hack and sloppily thrown together she works wonders with the very little she's given.  It makes me really wish she got writing worthy of her performance but like a professional she makes the best of it . . . and to think the studio wouldn't let her reprise her role after this?

And couldn't help but chuckle as I recalled him being maskless at least once in every Myersinclusive Halloween until this film. Granted this is the first time he himself takes it off.  Oh well. As for the film's ending I can't forgive because it lead to the atrocity known as Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers which felt Halloween 5 was extremely flawed but still fun . . . so it set out to make a sequel that was all flaw and no fun . . . or something.".

Aside from being a bit annoying I still don't think that she was as bad as some of the buffoons from part six...Anyways I used to believe that Halloween 5The Revenge of Michael Myers was superior to its predecessor. However having recently watched the two back to back I realize that I was wrong about that. This sequel still has some redeeming qualities though. While part four delivered some great scare scenes director OtheninGirard capitalizes on this formula and delivers even better scares this time. Examples are the aforementioned death scene with Rachel the chase scene with Jamie in the hospital's basement the carchase scene with Tina and a very suspenseful scene with Jamie in the Myers's laundry chute. In fact every scene that takes place in the Myers house is superb. Overall I rate Halloween 5 a 710. Some of the editing and voiceovers were absolutely awful so I had to take away a point. Other than that I think that this installment is at least worth a viewing and the ending will certainly leave you craving more. Too bad we had to wait about six years for another one and sadly Danielle Harriswho plays Jamie in four and fivedoes not return.

The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predecessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet these films are not criticized for the same reason.While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 minutes are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next. I also think that this film added new story elements that were interesting. This film is also much darker and even Gothic I think. Still everyone is welcome to their opinion but I'm just sharing my voice.".

Its a great direct follow up from the forth film and adds a couple new solid characters namely Tina and of course The Man in Black. In this movie Meeker grows on me and becomes in my opinion a better sheriff than Brackett. One negative is there are some typical cheesy 80s scenes that I thought The Return could have cut out. Also Harris and Billy were somewhat offputting in some scenes with overdramatic screams. When it gets to the last thirty or twenty minutes of the film is when its at its best. Loomis versus Myers it doesn't get any better than that. The Return 710 is a slight drop off but still a solid entry to the Halloween series.".

	schema:headline " The Most Agreeably Nutty of Any of the Sequels";
	schema:reviewBody "After the original Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers is my favorite of the series. This is an unpopular opinion. Part five is frequently considered the worse of the series. It's certainly not a good film in any traditional sense. The script feels rushed and halfformed. The relatively likable Rachel from the previous sequel is quickly killed to make way for Tina a deeply unlikable final girl. Tina abandons Jaime to go see her jerk boyfriend her most egregious sin. The previous ending is largely ignored. The movie attempts to forge some sort of mythology around the Myers character hinting at the Curse of Thorn and all that other nonsense we'd get in part six. The biggest plot hole for me anyway is that we see Michael's face and it isn't burnt to a crisp. Maybe the Shape has a healing factor? The point is yes from any sort of objective perspective Halloween 5 isn't that good a film.Which has little to do with my enjoyment of it. Revenge is by far the most agreeably nutty of any of the sequels. There are so many bizarre choices here. Either production was quickly rushed or the director was going for intentional camp. Exhibit A The comic relief cops which are introduced with honking clown shoes music. I love the hermit and his screeching parrot that takes Michael in for a year. Did the Shape spend a whole year passed out in a hobo's hobble? Imagine the fanfiction that's been written about that. Michael spends an extended amount of time driving a teenage girl around and letting her kiss all over him. Considering he murdered her anachronistic greaser boyfriend maybe the Shape was horny. The whole Man in Black business is of course utter nonsense. But it's likable utter nonsense. No wacky element is more endearing then Donald Pleasence completely sloshed performance as Dr. Loomis. He pushes the character as far as he can this time pulling a gun on a cop using innocent Jamie as bait getting all up in her grill. I absolutely love it.Rewatching the film this time I realized another reason I enjoy it so much. Most of the other sequels attempt to recapture Carpenter's magic. This one on the other hand goes for blatant exploitation. It's the Halloween version of a Friday the 13th film. The sex is sexier the gore is gorier. The teens run off for a raunchy Halloween party even though you'd think the holiday would be verboten in Haddonfield at this point. The onenote supporting characters the slasher fodder are far more broad playing goofy pranks. Michael Myers has basically been transformed into Jason at this point impaling a rutting couple and using multiple weapons. The most blatant Jason element is when Jaime reaches Michael's human side a scene blatantly swiped from Friday the 13th Part II. It's horribly out of character for Myers of course. He has no human side at all! Don't care. Part 5 delivers the trashy thrills you expect from the fourth sequel in a horror series.The movie is questionable sure but I honestly think some elements are very strong. Of all the sequels this one most captures the autumn spirit to me. The pumpkin carving opening is fantastic. The direction is very strong the nights thick and black. There are even some genuine thrills. Jaime being stalked by her uncle spirit through the hospital is great. The car chase scene works very well. The laundry chute creates claustrophobic tension. Dr. Loomis delivers another monologue in which he establishes an inner rage as Michael's motivation. That's as good an explanation as any says I. Surely I can't be the only one who loves this movie? I perfectly understand why some folks dislike it. By the same accord I believe its underrated. Not to mention enjoyably goofy.".

I cannot describe the sensation that is being burnt alive shot six times by a pistol shot several times with various shotguns pistols and an assault rifle simultaneously and I especially cannot describe what it is like falling through some sodden ground only to have a gravestone cave in on top of me. Maybe I cannot describe it because none of it really happened after all  the third Halloween film only included me as part of a television trailer thus disconnecting me from the 'real' world entirely poor shame.I can get away with anything because I'm Michael Myers and I'm invincible. I've been shot and burnt and what have you loads of times but I keep coming back like the giant cockroach that won't die I am invisible despite being the biggest person in the whole town I am indestructible despite being a human being I've been captured but then consequently escaped when I should have been victim of capital punishment long before I even got the chance to. Yes I'm the thing that wouldn't die in the franchise that wouldn't die and isn't it grand?

Another case of idiocy on the resident's part was when the police come round to check they leave after thinking it was a false alarm involving the dog but I'm smart I hide in the closet and wait for them to go but when the silly girl opens the door to get something out she still doesn't see me  unfortunately she has since changed after finishing her shower.I'm Michael Myers and I'm invisible. I can stand amongst the bushes and stick out like a sore thumb but no one sees me. I am able to stand there and watch kids and their cars and partners mingle around a shop front they are more interested in sex and alcohol than they are in values when I was their age I was being treated at a hospital after what I did when I was very young but they don't know anything about that soon they will though soon they will. What I love about these kids is that I kill one of them and take his car  his name is unbelievably Michael. From here I get to live out a fantasy I have never come within a lightyear of ever experiencing. I drive to my new partner's house and pick her up she dances for me showing me her Halloween costume thinking I'm Michael which of course I am she says my name in that wonderful voice she has and attempts conversation but I can't reply for two reasons it would give the game away and I'm stone cold with adrenaline. We drive for a while and she asks to stop by a petrol station but I drive straight past before screeching round and going back  it would seem that a little girl whom I am related to has used her telepathic powers to tell the police where I am the 'living the dream' is over but it was worth it.It would seem that when I do come face to face with my relative it is in an attic of my Myers house that wasn't actually there in any other of my adventures. It's equally convenient that the authorities and my doctor at the hospital never thought to check the house to see if that's where I was staying during this Halloween. After all they didn't check the surrounding area after I escaped into the river at the very beginning especially since I lodged up in a shack owned by an old man  there I lay for one year with no interference or anything like the old man reporting that he'd found me but how was I to know he'd keep quiet after I'd left? I wasn't so I had to get rid of him of course. When it does come to the crunch I delay over completing my goal in this edition as she lies there in my coffin bed  I shed a tear but I don't know why she escapes and gets the better of me in a laundry chute  how careless of me this invisible indestructible killing machine is beaten by an infant.

At the end nothing stayed really memorable here except the colors makeup and costumes perhaps but nothing in terms of plot or performances even if I would not really blame any of the actors and actresses as the material they had to work with here did not offer any possibility for a great achievement rangewise. The cast includes a semifamous name here and there like Montezuma or Constantine but no big stars either or any of the most known from Germany at that point. The story includes many somewhat epic moments but the execution just wasn't on par to make these really seem epic to audiences as well. What stayed in the end was a film way too long for its own good and a pretty surreal film that suffered from all kinds of low production values. I am not sure if I have seen anything else by Ottinger before probably! but if I did then it was apparently as forgettable as this one here and I am not curious in the slightest to take a deeper look into her fairly prolific body of work.

Very few films ever grasp this concept or very few filmmakers can relate it but that is why film is such an elusive art.".

It takes it's time. It is surrounded by snow and muted colors except one character Rebecca is always in red  even her car is red. In a dreamlike state this film will take you into four different people's lives and see how they intersect through the tragedy of a car accident. I think Twyker is extremely gifted with how he tells a story visually and I was a big fan of his Run Lola Run. He obviously has an attraction to stories about destiny and fate and how life is full of little decisions and moments that mold us or damage us in a blink of the eye. Very well acted film also.".

	schema:reviewBody "I definitely enjoyed this film and found it pleasantly unpredictable throughout. That really has become a huge criterion for me if you are the same you might save reading this and other reviews until after you've seen the film. Thus...SPOILERS of sorts...While the film launches with hyperkinetic momentum a la Lola by about halfway through the pace of the action and even the camera itself stops to freeze. Tykwer's early tracking of the camera by hand to weave in on various actors helps to inject tension to this film even  when the scenes themselves may be no more tense than a typical soap opera. Then for awhile the camera becomes stationary and we wait as the earlier motions and emotions play themselves out and finally we get an explosive exhillirating ending.I see the tag line for this film refers to it as a Liebesthriller and when I watched the trailer for the film after seeing it properly in English they referred to it as a Romantic Thriller That is a fine encapsulation of it...and not really a genre that I place too many films under its rubric.While this film ride well upon surprises it also uses one more familiar and frequently deployed device these days. there seems to be more movies where multiple characters are brought together with only say one degree of separation but their connections are unbeknownst to them. I admit it I enjoy this cheap omniscient thrill...and it works well here.Here certain secrets are known to us and the criminals who have committed various acts all men sigh... they often seek out retribution for the very crime they are responsible for. We have the philanderer as jealous boyfriend and the father whose own mistake led to the loss of his daughter seeking vengeance. Then there's a peculiar character who rather than being hypocritical suffers from a peculiar form of shortterm memory loss.This latter character rather than charging blindly over the cliffs of ration seems to be struggling with recalling his acts and reclaiming his responsibility. There is a haunting scene on New Year's eve where you can see the fireworks in his fragile shrapnelshattered mind reflected on his very forehead.And the film is beautiful in other aspects...the two female leads carry their theme colors with them wherever they go. Their connection as caring roommates helps to hinge much of this film and feels right for that sort of relationship. And both are crucial in helping transform the villain in this film past antihero into a hero as he rescues both. He plucks the ultracynical green girl from the clutches of her despair while he consoles the red girl in the wake of a death in her family and in the wake of her absent boyfriend.So whether we buy into this conservation of guilt and karmic comeuppance is one trick to this film. Even while watching it I felt a bit manipulated towards Rene and in hindsight now moreso. The photography is flashy throughout. The skidiving at the end shots of the antihero though a diamond lattice work at his hovel the camera in the lair of the lovers starts early on tight and intimate but eventually gets as much distance as it can spying on them from a corner in the ceiling. Wideangle to catch them as they drift apart. That bathroom fireworks shot is really a tremendous one as well and any of winter wonderland shots were great. Especially the skating ones...On one level this could be the soap opera of the future romantic rollercoasting along with nice dabs of mystery and of course duplicitous if not just plain dumb men. We are missing the catty female and honestly the film is far more savvy than that. I suspect reducing down the novel for this film was probably a challenge but well worth it. I wonder if the title has any idiomatic sense in German like the notion that when winter thaws out we can see what has happened. I think we see all of the characters actually asleep at one point or comatose even and they all lurch awake. I know the film starts with the idea that they are all running away or leaving with a sense of urgency.The film questions whether you can run away from your actions and to me it covered a lot more movie mileage than Rennt Lola Rennt. Indeed the two female here live rentfree and the men well they run into trouble...but not necessarily their own.710".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Winter Sleepers took the audience on a twistycurvy journey through the experiences of five people whose lives intersected in an ironic and sometimes tragic way.  The plot was somewhat Mementoesque fashion although the use of multiple flashbacks and flashforwards weren't employed.  I was impressed to see that that this film came out in 1997 several years before Memento I wonder if the idea for Memento was somewhat inspired by this film.  The film did a good job of creating a setting that was enticing and believable.  The scenery of smalltown Bavaria in winter was very pastoral and the mountain shots presumably the Alps were breathtaking.  The lighting was soft and warm creating the sensation of being snug despite the wintry beauty outside.  The coziness and clutteredness of the character Rebecca's house also helped to create this illusion.  Plot Spoilers Ahead I felt that the plot andor character development could have been a bit tighter.  For instance Theo's character seems to spin in circles for a good portion of the movie and when he finally finds his direction and decides to take action the action he decides to take is shocking and tragic.  In a twist of fate he ends up driving Marco off a cliff for committing a crime he didn't commit.  I wasn't too sad to see Marco go given his nasty habit of cheating on his girlfriend however I found Theo's actions to be implausible given the previous context of his character and his character's identity essentially was undermined. In addition to this minor flaw there was a general failure to resolve the conflicts set forth in the film in any meaningful way.  When the film ended I was left unsatisfied and a little disappointed.  I know that European movies don't always end in the same perfectworld way that most American movies do however I still felt that more resolution could have been achieved in this film.Overall however I did enjoy the film very much and felt that the strong points outweighed the week points.  I would give this film an 8 out of 10 for its ability to draw my attention with an interesting plot and likeable characters.".

This movie has all the necessary elements for a successful production and ensures a completely entertaining evening.   The opening and what an opening! sets the mood..... A chilly landscape of deep snow with helicopter shots racing across treetops heavily weighed down with a recent fall.....And the music with its tremulous monotone suggests impending drama. I wait expectantly.....Into the picture comes Rene.  At first glance an oddlooking guy who suffers from a kind of amnesia.   He knows his name and where he lives but can't remember anything else.  That's why he photographs every little incident to jog his memory.  Laura who works as a hospital nurse agrees he's a bit weird but is fascinated just the same.  You get the feeling he's up to something.Her friend Rebecca an attractive blond who works as a translator is having trouble with her boy friend Marco.  He's so possessive.  They congregate in Laura's house where much of the dialogue takes place.  Rebecca and Marco are continually arguing falling in and out of love. These scenes are exceptional.In some strange coincidence these four characters are in one way or another involved in the aftermath of a serious accident involving two cars swerving on the slippery highway.   In one of the cars a farmer who is taking his horse float to the vet. is knocked unconscious.  Later he is unable to convince the police that a second car was involved.  So he sets out on a mission to find the other car and the man responsible for the death of his daughter who died in hospital as a result of the accident.Marco the skiing instructor has an eye for the girls and there are some exciting scenes on the ski slopes as they engage the treacherous terrain. It's a matter of Hold tight! as the skiers disappear into the foggy atmosphere.The snow bound landscape is for me a most unusual setting for the drama and I enjoyed every exciting minute.  The ending left me almost openmouthed! And I'm not telling!".

Rene is a kind of melancholic intellectual who has amnesia problem and takes picture of the most important events of his life to recall them. One night he drinks too much and steals the car of the ski trainer Marco Heino Ferch just for fun. Due to a lack of attention of Theo on the road there is a dreadful  accident when his young daughter is seriously hurt in the head. She is sent to a hospital without the necessary resources for such a case but she is unable to be transferred to another suitable place due to the bad weather and her conditions. The nurse in charge of the young girl is Laura MarieLou Sellen an anorexic woman full of problems and inferiority complex due to her body who lives in a house inherited from her grandmother with her friend Rebecca the delicious and sexy Floriane Daniel. Rebecca works in translation usually wears red colored clothes and has a kind of engagement indeed their relationship is limited to sex with Marco. He is a typical unfaithful male man sexually chasing the women trained by him and being an empty person. The story is a kind of metaphor with the cycle of life through the lives of five persons with different attitudes and behavior who are linked by an incident having death and birth but with life going on. The direction and the performance of the cast are excellent and the photography is wonderful. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Winter Sleepers  Inverno Quente' Winter Sleepers  Hot Winter'".

	schema:headline " This is great cinema from a country that isn't known for it";
	schema:reviewBody "I had seen Lola Rennt before and I remember that I liked a lot I even bought it on DVD. So when I got the chance to see another movie from Tom Tykwer I didn't think twice and watched it. Although it is very hard to compare both movies I must say that I liked this movie even a bit more.In this movie we meet five people who at first sight don't seem to have much in common but faith and love brings them all together. You'll see Rebecca. She's a translator who lives with her boyfriend a ski instructor and a real womanizer in a villa owned by her friend Laura a nurse. Marco's car is stolen by Rene a local cinema projectionist who suffers from amnesia. He still knows everything that happened in the past but can't remember recent facts. While he's driving Marco's car he causes an awful accident with a local farmer called Theo. Theo's daughter ends up in a coma and is rushed to the hospital where Laura works where she dies later on. In the mean time Laura has fallen in love with Rene who doesn't know what has happened. And Theo who can't accept his daughter's death tries everything to find the man who caused the accident and killed his daughter so he can punish him...What makes this movie so good is the combination of some very fine acting a great choice of music very beautiful images and a touching story. If you like movies like 21 Grams than you definitely have to see this one as well. This is the kind of movie that will never be a great success in the multiplexes but that will be loved by all who like to see a movie with some depth. You know what I mean it doesn't have to be artcinema but not the 36th sequel of a movie based on a comic book either.This is honest and sincere cinema from a country that isn't exactly very well known for it. Although I know several German movies that are more than just worth a watch Der Untergang and Lola Rennt are two others German movies aren't as well known or famous as the ones from Spain and Sweden and to a lesser extent France. Nevertheless Tom Tykwer proves with this one what a good director he is and that's why I can recommend it to everybody who likes to see some good European cinema. I give it an 8.510.".

But hello all of these new devices being used in films ARE unreal AND amateur because they're so innovational since no one has tried them before.  Tom Tykwer is exactly the sort of filmmaker that likes to take chances who goes against the normal sometimes recycled cinematic techniques employed by the majority of the cinematic world.  Here in Winter Sleepers we see those revolutionary techniques that led to his international success in Run Lola Run in full bloom.  The narrative is basically shallow leaving many gaps in plot and dialogue but this is done purposefully and the filling of the gaps is left up to the cinematography lighting and color schemes.  It is no surprise that Tykwer uses the subjective camera to convey the feelings of his characters sometimes we fall to the ground in a flash of white when Laura blacks out or we spin around in circles when Rene has a psychological episode.  It is done for a purpose and we can understand the turmoil that each goes throughwithout the reliance of a script.The film can be seen as more character driven than plot.  So if you need the precious plot more than anything else I wouldn't recommend this movie. But you should see this movie if you're at all interested in how an event can exponentially set off another set of events continually building until the life of every character whether involved in the first event or not changes forever.".

There are three reasons for the immense effect of Winterschlfer1 the movie picks out as  central themes questions that nearly everybody has asked himself what is my fate? And how is this fate connected with the life of other people? Is there somebody or something watching every step of mine? Where can I find the one that'll change my life? What if this person is sitting in the train just passing by thinking about the meaning of life and hoping to find someone too?2These questions are mixed in an extremely thrilling and complex story set in a small village near Berchtesgaden in the wintry German Alps a location which is otherwise in film history known only for bad 70sLederhosensoftsexmovies an so called Heimatfilme can be seen nearly every day in German TV not all are so bad.3The characters are complex and credible and they all have their little faults my favorite is Marco the guy who's always jealous and seems to be a little bit dim played by the unique Heino Ferch. If you watch it pay attention to the colordramaturgy is this the right word??? every main character has its own colour as a symbol for his specific character traits.After all everything in this movie is outstanding music sound camera actions... this is a real perfect movie and the only thing I can not understand is that it had become so little attention in Germany. There is even no DVD out here the Americans got one really funny!".

While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions sterling cinematography by German cinematographer Frank Griebe production design by German production designer Uli Hanisch and introduction of it's central characters this dialogdriven and narrativedriven story where a car accident has a man searching for the person he crashed with depicts several dense studies of character and contains a great score by long time collaborators Tom Tykwer German composer Reinhold Heil and Australian composer Johnny Klimek.This romantic coincidental and atmospheric drama from the late 1990s which is set in the Bavarian Alps during a winter and where a single woman receives a new patient at the hospital where she works and befriends a projectionist named Ren at a place called Sleeper's Bar is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure subtle character development and continuity brilliant editing and use of music style of filmmaking and the fine acting performances by German actress Floriane Daniel GermanFrench actress Marie LouSellem and German actors Ulrich Matthes Heino Ferch and Josef Bierbichler. A somewhat surreal imaginative and multifaceted character piece.";

Making a cohesive and believable plot was supposedly the last of his intentions. The characters in WS are too dumb and underdeveloped delivering some braindead lines rarely heard in the dumbest horror flicks as the one about maybe it's better to live only 3 years which was said by a character sitting near the 10years old girl who had just died. Or another artsy moment of bewitching emptiness when the blonde stopped on her way to the granny's funeral and started to urinate on the roadside with some grief on her face. Also all these multiple coincidences in the end didn't make any good to the film.Anyway the setting is quite beautiful and it lends some charm to this lame story. Hence 255. At least.".

Winter Sleepers is a beautiful example of this type of filmmaking. The film centres around five characters their lives seemingly unconnected. Gradually as each makes their choices their fates become entwined their actions having profound effects on one another. The question is could they have foreseen these consequences? And should they have? Tykwer's choice to set the film in a remote mountain town hemmed in by snow on all sides was a brilliant one. The eerie quiet of the place the sense of being trapped by forces beyond human control add a heightened tension to this slow burning thriller. There is a sense of unreality threading through the entire film perhaps because it gives one an omniscient view of events. Instead of just one viewpoint Tykwer gives one the ability to see all points of view at once. In doing so he invests the viewer with the impotence of watching as unbeknown to each of them the characters' make the choices which together will produce the film's tragic conclusion. Quiet slow in pace and multilayered this is an exquisite film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Run Lola Run' German director Tom Tykwer gave us a frenetic lightning bolt of a film about a woman given just 20 minutes to save her boyfriend's life. In Winter Sleepers' he performs another miracle of pacing slowing things down to a heartbeat. Only a director at the top of his craft could so masterfully integrate music dialogue and cinematography into a unified vision of lives entangled by love death and fate. Rebecca. Marco. Rene. Laura. Theo. The first four are young and aimless. The last is desperately seeking to save his daughter's life following a horrifying car crash on a winter road. But as chance throws them together what they don't know about each other is what makes Winter Sleepers' so relentlessly fascinating. When the handsome ski instructor Marco absentmindedly leaves his keys in his car in order to get Rebecca in bed Rene impulsively takes the car for a spin. He slams into Theo sending the farmer's daughter into a coma. But the car goes into a snowbank leaving the two drivers amnesiac and no one to blame unless one of the two recovers his memory. Around this plot Tykwer works wonders. Lovers' quarrels strangers' encounters remorse jealousy confusion infidelity all surface in these five lives. As the characters come together each scene is a masterpiece of brevity and revelation. Each moment further enmeshes the five in their shared fates. Although the ski town's hottest hangout is called the Sleepers Bar' the sleeping here is entirely metaphorical. Two generations of Germans collide and only one  the elder represented by the grieving Theo  has more than a Deutsche mark of meaning in his life. The others having chosen surface over sincerity and freedom in lieu of commitment are sleeping their lives away. Despite the cultural gaps the sleepers seem eerily like people we know. Marco is impulsive and hot wired. Rene lonely and lost squanders his talent while working as a projectionist. Laura is a gentle nurse moonlighting as an actress. Her friend Rebecca is coasting through life on her beauty. Yet unlike modern American films about slackers Tykwer doesn't mock. The problems of these sleepers are very real their malaise is deeply felt. The film's lone flaw is its highly unlikely ending. After so skillfully blending coincidence with character Tykwer stretches chance a little too far. Not even Dickens would have dared such a meeting on a mountain slope. Yet the end does not ruin the means and the means of this movie make it one of the best films you'll see this year. In one of the film's typically cryptic scenes Rene and Laura trade adjectives to describe each other. Frustrated inhibited egocentric... While these words fit the characters the only adjectives to describe Winter Sleepers' itself are brilliant disturbing powerful and haunting.".

I will also give kudos for the choice of music and smarts by the director to know when to have silence play with the drama.

	schema:headline " A Brazilian Classic Considered by Most of the Professional Critics as the Best Brazilian Movie Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersIn 1933 in Rio de Janeiro the engineer Marcos Durval Bellini kills his wife on his wedding night after discovering she had had an affair. In his trial he is considered notguilt since he was defending his honor. He decides to move to the country working in the construction of a factory. Marcos meets Sonia Dea Selva a naive young woman who is engaged of Dcio Dcio Murilo and they fall in love with each other. Dcio discovers their romance fights with Marcos and dies. In the end Marcos and Sonia get married. This slow film is a Brazilian classic considered by most of the professional critics as one or maybe the best Brazilian movie ever. The story is very innocent in the present days. A man kills his wife defending his honor because she was unfaithful in the past and is absolved by the jury. The metaphoric use of the machines in the factory to symbolize an intercourse between Marcos and Sonia in the erotic scene in the garden is very creative in a time of sexual repression. The use of a portable camera consisting of a large box is very funny in the present days. This movie was restored and is available on VHS in Brazil. Unfortunately it seems that different reels were used alternating the quality of sound and image. A must see film for lovers of cinema as art. My vote is nine.Title Brazil 'Ganga Bruta'".
