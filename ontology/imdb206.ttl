But at the heart of this scenic serene village is much darker than its benign appearance and while she hopes her vacation will dispel her visions a sinister presence has drawn her there.

Special effects weren't terrible and I loved the the different ideas of how people change into a werewolf. One melts into a puddle of goo in a gruesome scene when he is walking in the woods and drops to the ground and begins to literally melt and then comes back together as a werewolf. Well done scene Tom Savini worthy. There is another man that rips the skin off of his jaw and it grows and he turns into a werewolf. Alot of memorable scenes in this movie makes this a standout movie in the werewolf horror genre and is definitely one of the best movies out of the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay here's a great premise  what would The Howling have been like if it was made by somebody without the talent or good sense of Joe Dante? Well thanks to the fourth of the dire sequels now we know. It would have sucked.There are two good things I can say about this movie. First it serves as a lesson about how not to adapt a book to the screen. Second it shows how much of a great film The Howling is simply by comparison. As it's another version of the same novel you already pretty much know the plot ... a disturbed woman goes to a retreat of some kind in order to set her mind straight and decides to investigate a mysterious howling in the woods. The only positive thing I'll say about the adaptation is that it retains the strong religious element from the book which was neglected in the Joe Dante version. This movie is apparently a lot closer to Gary Brandner's novel but it lacks any of the flavour metaphor or subtext.First off you don't care about the characters. Secondly it just isn't scary. Director John Hough may manage to stay faithful to the book like some kind of a literary parrot but apparently he hasn't heard of those things we call mood or pace or style ... in no way does this feel like a horror movie it features the most unfrightening ghosts I've ever seen in a film. It's not even a particularly wellmade film and I noticed several errors in continuity. The acting isn't great as all of the cast seem to belong on a soap opera but by no means is that the worst thing about the movie. Also for some odd reason all the dialogue is dubbed. Badly. And there's no excuse for it ... it just distracts you from the rest of the scene or perhaps that was the intention. The special effects are actually very good but unfortunately you don't see any of them until the last ten minutes of the movie when they're all thrown together in a hectic mishmash.Why do we need this movie? It sure beats me. There's absolutely no reason to watch it unless you're curious about the original novel but can't be bothered to read it. Joe Dante's The Howling is superior in every single way.".

So when Clive Turner decided to do a third Howling sequel he decided to make it closer to the novel which was fine.Howling IV is about a writer named Marie who after having a metal breakdown goes to a town called Drago with her husband Richard. Once there Marie begins to hear howling noises from outside her husband think's she's making it all up due to her breakdown and the townsfolk are not too concerned about the noises. Soon an exnun arrives and tells Marie about a friend of her's that was attacked in Drago and Marie has seen her in her mind. The two soon go off searching for info about the town's history.Her husband soon catches an eye on the art owner who resembles a similar look to Marsha from The Howling. After meeting her again in the woods she changes into a Werewolf and bites. After telling Marie it was a wolf that attacked him the next day he tells her he fell and scratched is shoulder.Soon her nun friend discovers that the town people are Werewolves and hurries to warn Marie meanwhile Marie's publisher Tom also tries to warn Marie but sees Richard in the road thriving in pain. He tries to help him only to get killed by a Werewolf in the bushes. It's not long before Marie and the exnun hide in the bell tower where Marie must wait outside while she summons the Werewolves with the bell.Doing so Marie has no choice but to burn the tower with her friend and after looking at the burnt body of her husband a Werewolf jumps out at her.Although I haven't read the novels reading the reviews and seeing the film gives me a clue what the novel is like. Howling IV isn't a bad film the transformation is kind of good and the Werewolf in the tower isn't that bad. The one thing is that the Werewolves don't show themselves until the final twenty minutes of the movie but I wasn't that bothered. I enjoyed the film.I also love that theme song Something evil something dangerous".

Romy Windsor plays the visionbound introverted semitolerated Marie. Neither Marie nor her husband Richard nor their friend Tom believe in werewolves. Janice an exnun is the only one considering a werewolfexistence possibility. MarieRichard met her in Drago and Janice's belief in demons is probably what paved the way for her werewolf suspicions. Along the way some peeps have vanished including a hitchhiking couple and the longdead sister Ruth. When Marie discovers that the sheriff coveredup the disappearance of the pleasant hitchhiking couple or attempted to do so tempers flare. There's more than one way to skin a wolf or cover it's tracks and it isn't by lying to redriding hood. You can't run a successful werewolf business without breaking a few nuns as it turns out. The lethargic and apathetic sheriff would probably agree. The main complaint here is the scarce onscreen werewolf time. But in my opinion this is redeemed by acceptable performances just enough atmosphere and a classic 80's score.".

The lethargic and apathetic sheriff would probably agree. The main complaint here is the scarce onscreen werewolf time. But in my opinion this is redeemed by acceptable performances just enough atmosphere and a classic 80's score.";

	schema:headline " The Best Werewolf Movie Ever!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Howling IV The Original Nightmare is one of the more underrated werewolf movies.SPOLIERSA young mystery writer Romy Windsor becomes plagued by weird visions of wolves. She and her husband Michael T. Weiss decide a country vacation is just the right prescription. At the same cabin in which a nun was found nearly catatonic and babbling incoherently about demons and danger the two take up residence. During the nights she begins hearing eerie howling sounds. Her husband brushes them off as the new surroundings making her crazy. Befriending a friend of the nun Susanne Severeid the two decide to explore the nearby town. Finding the locals quietly resentful she begins to suspect foul play and tells her husband. He again laughs it off as the new surroundings and storms out in anger. Walking alone at night in the forest he is attacked by a werewolf and bitten savagely. He barely manages to stagger home. Convinced more than ever that something weird is going on the writer and her friend decide to investigate the town some more. They discover that a local church bell is from a town in Europe called Drago the birthplace of werewolves. They then uncover another startling secret concerning the nun that finally solves the missing pieces of the puzzle. Again trying to explain to her husband what is happening he goes into a rage and storms out never to be seen again. The writer and her friend try a last ditch effort to rid themselves of the werewolves.The Good News What I enjoyed about this movie was it's simple story than followed along quite nicely. The several subplots don't get in the way too much and help the movie. There isn't a second of the film that seems like filler material. It keeps your attention throughout and unlike most werewolf movies gives quite a lot of suspenseful scenes and effective scares. The special mention is the part when Weiss is in the forest with the slut from the town and they start to kiss then she ducks her head down to kiss his neck. When she pulls her head up it is a true demonic werewolf face that comes up rapidly. It is better than how I wrote it but the scene is quite nicely done. Steve Johnson's XFX Inc did a truly recommendable job in place of Rick Baker in special effects and he creates several impressive scenes. Remarkably the goriest scene isn't a werewolf attack but Weiss disintegrating from flesh done to a flopping skeleton in an at least three minute scene. It still gives me the creeps when I see that part. The only downfall was an unspectacular transformation that takes place in about thirty seconds. Compared to the amazing disintegration scene it leaves one puzzled. Another interesting part was the subplot involving the nun. I don't want to give away too much but this subplot would have damaged the movie if handled poorly but director John Hough made it work. Uncovering her cryptic saying tied the loose ends of the movie together and made it enjoyable. Replaying the original legend of the church bell they lead the werewolves into the church and then blow the place up burning all the wolves inside and ending the threat is a great ending but it feels to rushed to have been done effectively. It allows for some good action parts and the fiery destruction of the landmark building in town is a nice visual to end on.The Bad News The film does have a few flaws such as the hurried ending. After discovering the truth about the village and the bell tower the film ends five minutes later. The two woman lead the wolves into the church by ringing the bell then setting the place on fire. It seems like it could have been dragged out an extra couple minutes by giving the two some obstacle to overcome at the end as they set about destroying the place in a remarkable amount of time when infiltrating the enemy's headquarters. The lone werewolf inside offers no challenge to the two and lets them go about their business. Also for a werewolf movie the werewolves are on screen a relatively short amount of time. Most of their screen time comes in the final ten minutes of the movie making it a slight disappointment if you want to see a lot of werewolf attacks or seeing them on screen.The Final Verdict 'Howling IV The Original Nightmare' is a better werewolf movie than either the original 'Howling' or 'An American Werewolf in London.' It contains some convincing lead performances and some impressive gore set pieces. This is recommended viewing for any werewolf movie fan.Rate R Graphic Violence Nudity a sex scene and some language".

The scene of the werewolves in the bell tower was cool as well as the running pack the fire and the heroic exnun who sacrificed her own life to save her favourite writer. There was campiness especially the wooden husband who sports a real 80's mullet and goes off to have a fling with the beautiful witch werewolf. The acting was awful. I mean while Richard is screaming in agony while his flesh is falling off his wife Marie just stood there looking at him. No emotions and no sense of distress. Why doesn't anyone call for the police or ambulance in these films? The local sheriff was creepy and a werewolf but still the world exists outside of a small village. The Richard scene changing into a werewolf was done in a gross manner. For so long his skin melted to bone and he can still talk and move around but falls in a puddle of goo. Then he returned back to normal with thick sideburns! Also why no one else that turns into werewolf do that? They only sprout hair and fangs. What was the point in the friend character who visits from the city to help Marie only to get killed straight away? The only purpose he served was to annoy Richard. Anyway much of this film's best bits happen at the last 10 or 15 minutes. Before then it's just really long and boring.".

I saw this one years ago and I couldn't recall anything about it tried watching it again recently and now I know why the film didn't stand out in my mind  it's just bad.The lead male looks like David Copperfield's long lost illegitimate son. The lead female is rather bland  but then again so is the rest of the cast.I think I'll just leave this one in the past where it belongs. Not worth finishing the movie  leave it as a distant fading memory.210";

	schema:reviewBody "I got this movie in a 8 movie package. The first movie The Prophecy with Christopher Walken was horrible. This movie Barfing IV is worse.Here's the problem The story sucks. Apparently this is closer to the book than the first Howling. I saw the first movie many years ago and don't remember it as being this horrible. The script the dialogue the stupid nonimportant nonconsequential scenes. It's so incredibly boring. The acting is horrible all around. You could tell Romy Windsor the main female actress is trying. But trying does not mean you should be in front of the camera. Maybe as a model. Not as an actress. All the rest of the cast sucks completely. The worst actor here is the husband. Again he is no actor. Maybe as a clothing model. This guy has zero acting talent. The wife's boyfriend. He was slightly better than the husband but what the hell was his story line in the movie. The former nun acting is whatever. How does she go from being a nun to a civilian and all of a sudden she has a car fancy clothes and can stay in hotels? Where did she get the money for all that? This movie is consistently bad all around. The camera work sucks. The editing is whatever. Best part is when that couple gets killed by the water halfway through the movie. And guess what they screw that up too with some completely inappropriate music. I mean this thing has to be seen to be believed. There are scenes where the husband and wife are in the cabin talking about some stupidity. The camera angle is like OK we got the shot roll the film. Nothing special going on. Conversation is not moving the film forward. We don't get to see any wherewolfs or wolfmen or whatever the hell they are until the last 10 minutes. The worst transformation scene ever! Worst and ugliest costumes and that includes the human wardrobe. Take a look at that double button down vest on the doctor. This is one stupid and ugly movie. Sets suck take a look at that town and the cabin. Crappy music crappy dialogue crappy non acting no chemistry no packing no atmosphere no surprises no nothing.If you can bare to watch this it would be a test in discipline and endurance. It took me two sittings. I have read most of the user reviews and some of the critic reviews. And You Call Yourself a Scientist! critic reviews was most entertaining to read as they give a very good account of this mess of a movie. There should be a book written about this movie. Screen for screen description of how not to make a movie and what is wrong with each scene and an overall serious takedown of the screenplay and the movie overall. Now that would be entertaining. Then they should produce a remix of this movie with 50's TV laugh tracks. Then we are in the realm of full blown entertainment.As it stands this thing is garbage. No value at all. It is not so bad it's good. It is not so bad it's bad. It is so bad you fall asleep. I still believe Suspiria is the worst movie ever simply because a lot of people actually love it. Which is inconceivable. But there is room at the bottom for Howling IV.Complete Failure! F 1 star. One thing it does do it elevates other crappy movies like Star Wars Force Awakens to entertainment level.".

The production is riddled with shortcomings. The editing is unbelievably sloppy and the sound is inconsistent. The script is slow and predictable. The special effects at the end of the movie are alright and the obligatory transformation scene is pretty cool. But at this point why should we even care?Howling IV is a truly mystifying movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1988 Howling IV The Original Nightmare chronicles events in the Southern Cal desert town of Drago where a writer Romy Windsor goes to heal after a mental breakdown which is hard to do when she gets caught up in a mystery about demons and werewolves. Michael T. Weiss plays her husband while Antony Hamilton plays her hunky friend from Los Angeles. Susanne Severeid appears as a fan of the writer who becomes her assistant sleuth while Norman Anstey in on hand as the aloof sheriff. Lamya Derval plays a shopowner with catlike eyes and torpedo breasts sorry. The movie's subtitled The Original Nightmare because it's more faithful to Gary Brandner's original novel which doesn't mean it's better not even close. The lowbudget prevents it from being anything more than a decent sequel with a rushed awkward ending. Unlike the classic The Howling 1981 werewolves are scarce but it's superior to Howling II 1985 and Howling III 1987 in that it throws out Phillippe Mora's goofy camp and general eccentricities. I like the slowbuild mystery and the cast. There's some quality full moon ambiance as well and Windsor  Severeid make for an effective female team. Moreover Weiss is one of the few actors who could get away with a mullet. While the bulk of the movie was shot in the sticks of South Africa and you can tell it's not THAT bad of a substitute for the desert wilderness of Southern Cal. Actually it makes for an interesting change of pace for the barelyconnected series of standalone werewolf flicks. The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in South Africa with some parts in Fresno  Los Angeles California. It was directed by John Hough from a script by Clive Turner and Freddie Rowe. Clive would continue serious work with the franchise on 1989's Howling V The Rebirth and 1995's Howling New Moon Rising. GRADE C".

	schema:reviewBody "The frontpage review of this film simply doesn't do this marvelous film justice.  Renowned Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami takes an innovative approach at giving us a very deep glimpse not only into the life of mother and child but also into Iran its society and the situation of women transitioning to a more assertive role in society however I don't think one should be confused that the issues women face in Iran are not relevant to women elsewhere in the world including the West.The film has two fixed camera angles one giving us a view of the driverside and the other a view of the passenger side of an automobile. The driver is a mother who has left her husband and now resides with her new lover she is the common thread in all ten episodes.  Each sequence places a different person in the passenger seat with particular emphasis on her son who rides in four of the 10 scenes if I'm not mistaken.It is this motherson relationship that is at the crux of the film and for good reason.  The performances of these two characters was nothing short of amazing.  The boy in particular with every eyetwitch frown smile and outburst was able to convey a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a boy who is all at once obstinate angry disrespectful and immature yet still sweet and somewhat an innocent victim of the situation.  He is unforgiving to his mother for walking out on him and breaking up the family and is reluctant to accept any explanation his mother offers.  They trade barbs and though the love is there you can see the seeds already planted in the young adolescent of a society that subordinates women to their male partners. Here it is so profound that even a preteen lectures his mother on right and wrong.The mother bounces back and forth between defending herself to accepting blame showing the cracks of guilt that clearly lie beneath her composed and beautiful surface.  And it's a beauty that her son can't recognize she's a sexy passionate woman with needs of not just a mother but also as a lover and a liver but like all children he can only see her as an adult and a mother.The other key character involves a friend who desperately seeks a life partner but finds herself unsuccessful at every turn.  Most recently a man she has been seeing tells her that he cannot marry her because he does not love her.  She coyly reveals from under her veil that in her grief she has shaved her head completely.  This act is astonishing not because it is defiant but because it is terribly charming. She can't offer an explanation as to why she has done it but no explanation is necessary.  Who hasn't at some time when an ego has been made fragile by rejection sought to change hair clothing face self?  And it is with this scene with veil pulled back that the woman's beauty is uncovered not because we see her hair or her bald head but because of the insight the shaving act gives to her character and her innocent embarrassment brings a smile to her tearstained face that lights up the screen.I give the film a 9 and not a 10 because of one sequence involving a conversation with a prostitute in the passenger seat.  Presumably the driver has given a ride to hitchhiker leading to an intelligent conversationdebate about the world's oldest profession. But this scene seemed a little outofplace contrived and added little to the more general theme of the rest of the film.  This one slipup notwithstanding Ten is a creative and wonderful experience for film lovers who seek something out of the ordinary.  And it has a final scene which punctuates the film perfectly.".

A beautiful Iranian woman married to her second husband in a society that makes divorce nearly impossible for women to obtain drives her car around town. She takes her son to a swim meet goes shopping with her sister gives an old woman a lift to Prayer etc. The title of the film refers to the fact that there are 10 chapters to the film each representing a different conversation she has with her various passengers on different days. By experiencing these exchanges the viewer can expect a crash course on middle class life in Iran. Like middle class life anywhere there are the written rules and conventions that one must obey and then there are the practicalities and the REalities. There is what is true and what people tell themselves is true what they want and what they tell themselves they want. As in any society on earth including this highly controlled religiously based one there is the hypocrisy. And we can soon see from the conversations our Driver has with her passengers that there are also the largely unspoken hopes fears needs and insecurities of these people who often appear to be going through the motions of life rather than truly living it.The film mostly focuses on how women view this world but their perspective is primarily organized around and driven by their relationships with men be they fathers boyfriends husbands or sons. The film is difficult to watch at first because things quickly escalate into discomfort with the driver's very first passenger but sticking it out is well worth the investment as the exchanges each build on the ones that came before it getting progressively deeper and deeper.The women in this film are covered from head to foot but still manage to lay themselves completely bare to us. It's a very simple concept elevated to an amazing accomplishment. You will learn a great deal about life in Iran people in general and possibly yourself. I expect to be thinking about this movie for weeks if not much much longer.".

	schema:headline " Conveys a searing emotional honesty";
	schema:reviewBody "Ten conversations four passengers two digital cameras using two camera angles one angry young boy one agitated mother and one great film director. That is the essence of the remarkable new film Ten by acclaimed Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. Using only two small video cameras strapped to the dashboard of a car to eavesdrop on a series of semiimprovised conversations Ten is a highly original film that has an experimental feel to it yet manages to convey a searing emotional honesty.The opening fifteenminute exchange between a divorced mother Mania Akbari and her son Amin Amin Maher as she drives him to a swimming pool is amazing in its intensity. I don't think I've ever seen any sequence in a film quite like it. Amin urges his mother to allow him to live with his father rather than his stepfather. The camera does not leave the boy who expresses emotions seemingly beyond his age articulating anger frustration and selfpity with sharp intelligence and humor. His mother is deeply unhappy about her relationship with Amin but stubbornly refuses to bend to his desires. The opening sequence reaches such an emotional peak that the remaining conversations become almost anticlimactic.Other conversations examine the emotional lives and attitudes of the driver and her passengers. These include an old woman who visits the local mausoleum three times a day and tries to persuade Akbari to go to and pray with her. Another depicts Akbari's sister who discusses the mother's relationship with her son and new husband. In one of the best sequences a laughing prostitute gets into the car thinking the driver is a man and asserts how women cling to men as their only source of strength. She claims that marriage and prostitution are different facets of the same business  the married woman sells sex wholesale the prostitute retail. Indeed a recurring theme in the film is that in Iran today men dominate the society and thwart women's desire for emancipation. All of these conversations expound diverse opinions about women in Iran and look at issues from a woman's point of view. The camera is trained almost exclusively on one of the participants and does not shift back and forth regardless of whom is talking. The only sound and light emanate from the natural street environment which can be very dark as in the nighttime vignette with the prostitute. In the process of these conversations some new things about Iranian society are revealed for example that a woman can get a divorce by falsely accusing her husband of drug abuse. Kiarostami reminds us of the restrictions on wearing the veil particularly in a scene where the friend removes her veil to expose her shaven head something that must have caused the censors to scratch theirs.As the film moves toward its conclusion Amin's mother seems to acquire an inner strength that allows her to let events unfold more naturally. She offers advice to two other women who have experienced disappointment in their relationships and acknowledges that winning and losing are but two sides of the same coin. Most importantly Akbari states many times that you must love yourself before you can love anyone else'. This leads to another drive with Amin during which the mother is more able to just be with her son without having to discuss plans or expectations. I found Ten though not always easy to be with a deeply humanistic work and an extremely rewarding experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "My experience with Iranian film is pretty superficial having only seen a handful but none have disappointed me. I saw Kiarostami's early film Where Does The Friend Live? and was completely blown away. I then saw Saalam Cinema by Iran's other giant Mohsen Makhmalbaf  and then I realised just how important this country's output has been.Ten did nothing to diminish this view and I'll try not to repeat much of what's already been said here. I saw an Iranian person on this site claim that there was too much lost in the translation from Farsi to English. This is always the case with translation but I am quite sure Ten gets away with it. I recently saw Ingmar Bergman's Saraband and if you think language being stilted ruins a movie then I am sure seeing that film will shatter the view. The single thing that destroys it in both cases is the incredible power of the acting  the truth lies in their facial expression. I am quite sure 9 out of 10 people asked without context would swear blind Ten was a documentary.In the western world overrun by reality TV its significance is lost on some but if you take the time to realise that these people are actually acting  and more than likely doing it for the first time  thats where the power lies. Try taking this film put it in America and put Hollywood AListers in the car and see where it goes. Basically how you could call both what they do and what happens in this film acting is opened to debate. This is true of the majority of Iranian output.Ten would be significant for these reasons alone but when you take into account how much insight you gain into the life of a woman in there who tries to say no to male domination and to love herself it really comes into its own. This is the case of much of this countries output  and what sets is far apart from other countries. What we learn ultimately is this struggle though perhaps more explicit in Iran is a struggle felt by all women in the world. It's a film which in that way unites rather than divides which in light of Iran's current status in global affairs is what probably what makes it one of the more important Cinema's in the world.".

I think the film is remarkable because it looks so simple but I imagine setting up the camera and capturing the realistic dialogue and plotline we see in the film had to have taken a lot of preparation. I also think the director deliberately chose scenery to accommodate the backdrop of the film and he must have driven around Teheran constantly to figure out which images to put in the background. I think the scenes with the murals of new archconservative president are very telling. Ten seems to have a lot of messages under the radar including the subversive powers of all governments certainly including our own in America to censor art. I think the relationship between the mother and her son is a very poignant one and it shows how children and adults simply live in different spheres of the universe. Film is strikingly similar in some aspects to American independent filmmaker Rob Nilsson's film Signal 7 which came out over 20 years ago.".

This gimmick will not please everyone and hardly qualifies the film as a masterpiece.  But Hitchcock's brilliant Rear Window was a gimmick too and Kiarostami's 10 is no less worthy of attention.  A movie has to be done well regardless of its tricks and 10 fits the bill.  The driver of the car also drives the conflict she is a recently divorced Iranian woman in a country in which women barely have the right to divorce at all.  As the city rushes pastit's great fun to watch the people and places outsideshe curses the drivers and pedestrians along the way but holds her own against the crises in the passenger's seat.  Funny thing about a car it gives one the sense of control here that's clearly an illusion and the oxymoronic ability to remain private even while out in public.  She and her women passengers air their grievances within this zone of safety a scene in which a passenger slowly removes her head covering a symbol of repression is moving and unsettling.  The greatest conflict however is between the driver and her young son who's bitter about the divorce and lets his mother unravel until he not she controls where the car is heading.  The boy's performance is astonishingly real as much for the way he fills the silences as for his sharp and sometimes humorous counterpoints.  The film could have done without the countdown of the 10 conversationsthe source of the titlebut no matter everything in between is a delight.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Ten really impressed me for many reasons. The first one is the interpretation of the nonprofessional actresses and the boy Amin Maher. It is simply amazing the first sequence number 10 with fifteen minutes of dialogs between the lead character and her son without any cut. The second reason is the intense and impressive insight in the repressed women's world in Iran. I believe that most of the Westerns have no idea about the feelings and the culture of Iranian women and Abbas Kiarostami shows very real dialogs picturing the lifestyle of a middle class woman and some samples in other women of different classes the prostitute the religious woman etc.. The third reason was the simplicity and the originality of the location inside a car with a divorced woman transporting her resented son her sister a prostitute an old lady and a romantic young woman along different days. I would never imagine such a splendid scenario for a movie with such a theme. Last but not the least the remarkable beauty of the face of the driver Mania Akbari is awesome she is exotic for Brazilian standards but really a very beautiful woman. My vote is eight.Title Brazil 10 Dez 10 Ten".

	schema:headline " Subtle documentarylike masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Ten is a lesson of cinema. It is entirely shot in a car with two fixed cameras one on the female driver one on her passengers. Long shots no camera movement no music no dramatic event just dialogues Kiarostami boils down form to its simplest elements. He reaches the extreme extent of his documentarylike style that appeared in his previous movies at different degrees. He seems to go back to the origins of cinema notably the Lumire brothers when a fixed camera was simply shooting reallife scenes. This is hinted by the numbers appearing as in rushes 10 9 8  which punctuate the scenes. WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS Paradoxically these selfimposed constraints deliver a powerful artistic impact for at least two reasons. First the movie gains in intensity as if Kiarostami compensated the simple form by a strong content dialogues are dense even though they are natural characters are well outlined without being caricatured Iranian society is depicted without concession. It notably shows women's difficult conditions obliged to lie to divorce criticised by their family if they do alone when old abandoned by their lover sometimes obliged to prostitute themselves. The movie's freedom of speech is surprising considering censorship in Iran. Nevertheless Kiarostami's goal is not to criticise his country his movie has a universal reach as show for instance the facts that none of the persons have names that they have universal attributes mother son sister old lady prostitute friend that there are no specific references to Iranian politics and that we never know where the car is exactly.Second Kiarostami introduces small exceptions to the general setting at carefully chosen moments which enhances the aesthetical and emotional impact of these scenes. They are easy to notice because the film sobriety increases our awareness since our focus is not distracted by secondary elements.1. As noted there are only two fixed cameras. However at one point a different angle shows us what is happening outside a prostitute solicits a driver without success then goes into another car. This sudden change of perspective plunges us in the reality of society prostitution money male domination.2. Throughout the movie the two camera angles are distinct the driver and her passengers are never in the same frame. This reinforces the sense of psychological distance between the persons. However on rare occasions they are in contact which generates surprise and emotion an old woman shows her relics the mother touches the forehead of her son to feel if he has fever the driver wipes the tears of her crying friend.3. Dialogues only occur in the car however there are a few exceptions for instance when the driver speaks to an outside merchant or to other drivers. The most striking examples are the short dialogues between the driver and her former husband each one in their own car on separate sides of the street. This highlights the distance between them as well as the violence of their relationship especially when the husband passes the car blows the horn and shouts from his huge SUV which seems to crush the mother from her back.4. All scenes are quite long in order to develop a separate intrigue with a beginning a story and an ending. However the last scene only lasts a few minutes. The son says Let's go to grandma's as he did previously and the movie ends brutally. This short scene shows that life will go on as usual that nothing will change.This minimalist movie is hence very elaborate. Its preparation lasted a year and a half the shooting as much as three months. It is a real tour de force giving a sense of reality and simplicity by concealing skillful directing. As another illustration the action outside of the car is perfectly coordinated with the inside for instance when the driver speaks with external people or when an ambulance passes noisily just as the characters became silent.Apparently simple in its form the movie shows the psychological evolution of the mother. She first seems rigid with her son granted he is not easy to manage. Then she wants to help two old ladies one refuses one accepts to be driven tries to understand a prostitute she has nothing in common with tries to comfort her sad friend. At the end she seems more relaxed as if these experiences had somewhat changed her she laughs of her weaknesses and accepts that the father keep the child even if it might be done out of resignation. The movie in general also seems to evolve. Many dialogues are conflicting with the son the sister and the prostitute. Characters frequently seem to be in defence mode and to hide their feelings symbolically two of them are not shown the old lady and the prostitute. As we have seen persons are mostly shown separately highlighting the gap between them. Then in the penultimate scene a woman exposes herself figuratively and literally she voices her despair and takes off her veil revealing her shaved head a doubly astonishing act in Iran. It is a very moving scene sober and delicate crowning a subtle movie. The contrast with the final blunt scene Let's go to grandma's makes it even more gripping.If you like movies with action special effects simple roles and easy dialogues I would not recommend Ten. If you want see a movie about real life be in touch with the characters' feelings discover other countries' cinema and see how great a director Kiarostami is then Ten is a top choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "A mother takes her son to the pool and during the journey they argue over the usual topic of why the mother divorced the boy's father and how the boy feels about his new stepfather. After that the woman continues her journey running errands and picking other people up including relatives an old woman a prostitute and of course her son. In each journey we hear the conversations and get a feel for her life in Tehran.There are very few films made these days where I am attracted by the way they were made most are made in the same way. Here the concept is that we have two static cameras on the dashboard of the car and we only really look at the driver or the passenger. The driver stays the same throughout and we get to know her through ten conversationsarguments that she has with those passengers as she drives around. It is not all as effective as it should be and some of it is so concerned with looking at general women's issues that it loses sight of the actual people in the car. However when it works it manages to do both and most of the ten scenes do it well enough to hold the interest. The direction is basic and it takes a moment to get used to being so close to the people's faces while at the same time having to read the subtitles but it is different and for that alone it was worth trying.Part of the reason that some of the scenes work and some don't so well is mostly down to the material but it is also down to the actors in the scenes.As Iranian Woman Akbari is the focus and is hardly out of the car. She does well enough but is often reacting to the passenger more than she is being her own person. Of the rest of the cast the old woman and the unseen prostitute are pretty poor and also have very little baring on the rest of the characters however the other female passenger wit man trouble is pretty good. However the film is stolen by an intense and convincing performance from the boy Amin Maher. In his opening scene he runs through a lot of emotion with the camera on him throughout it is not his fault that his other scenes are not as good as this one but such a strong opening helped me get into it quickly.Overall this is a pretty good film. Some of it works well but at other points it loses sight of its characters and wanders onto wider issues in a rather weak fashion. The concept of placing two cameras on the dashboard sounds like laziness but it works really well and is good once you get used to it meanwhile the cast are mostly very good and deliver the dialogue in a natural and convincing fashion  with Amin standing out from the rest with his very good opening scene.".

Perhaps Iran is France of east.

We barely even get to see the city. One also has to take into account the local rules and culture as well which is less visible character in the film.Think it is impossible to make a film out of those elements with only two dash mounted miniDV cameras? Think again because Kiarostami did it and he did it with gusto and talent that left me speechless.I will admit that the film is quite local in its focus but also global in its theme. The local aspect left me wondering what the woman's job was as she seems to be taking other women in her car all the time... until I learned that first of all women do need all the help they can get in Iran duhh... and also that it is illegal correct me if I am wrong to drive a car alone in some parts of Iran or Tehran. It almost seemed to me that she was a taxi driver but she is not. However even with that little misconception on my part I did not loose any of the joy of watching this deceptively simple treasure.The best things in life seem to come from the places we would never expect.If you are a lover of good cinema than by all means watch this film. If you have dreams of making your own films perhaps you should buy this one and study it over and over again.".

It could have been a tad bit better but if it were better I would be very frustrated since it is not possible to give it an 11.The actors were engaging the script well oiled and full of folk wisdom cosmic wisdom and slants I had never thought of before  WOW. I was forced by some of the excellent dialog to stop and write down many of the things the lady driver had to say especially when she was talking to women whose men one a husband the other a fianc had left them. Some of the advice she dispensed was nothing less than Stellar Honestly honey. You can't live without losing. We come into the world for that. To win and to lose. Win! Lose! Why don't you want to lose? See what it's like. Experience. More experience. Nothing but experience!....You're weak. You've very weak.  the woman continues to cry maudlin  You understand? You cling like this to someone who leaves you. It's useless. Forget him. We women are unhappy because we don't love ourselves. We don't know how to live for ourselves. You can't sum it all up in just one person. Life is so vast. Why depend on just one person? Why not be different? It's not love. It's an illusion. If it's an illusion what is love then? the grieving woman asks.First you must love yourself. You despise yourself so much you hurt yourself. Has he gone? Too bad. There's more than one man in the world. Are you still crying? Go on and leave him too. You're wrong to cling to him. It's an illusion. That's all! You were hurting each other like psychopaths. 'Why are you late? Who's on the phone? Where were you?' Why this why that. People say women should please men. That is a weakness. Still weeping the other woman says All the same I was fond of him. You were wrong. We're unhappy dependent clinging. When we were little we clung to our mother and father then to a boy then to a man then to our child. Like idiots. He is no longer there. You can cry all you want. He's not there anymore....Should your life and your ruin depend on just one person? What's preventing you from being yourself? The quotes above and more where what I copied down and it was like manna from heaven for my ears to hear and in my case to read. I may not agree 100 with what she said but 99 yes definitely and can't tell you how much it would have helped me as a person to have watched this film when I was 15 or 16 years old before the saga of all my heartbreaks with men began. It may not have changed my fate but it sure would have changed my attitude enough to help me learn at a much younger age to roll with the punches! I would just like to add that I feel the weakest portion of this film is the very first 10 minutes or more. In fact I got an entirely negative impression of the lady driver at the beginning of the film because I thought of her as another mom who yells at her child too much and has not learned how to communicate well. However this problem righted itself and I very much enjoyed her conversations with all of the people who rode in her car. I was also particularly touched by the story of the woman who traveled to the mausoleum 3 times a day to pray for the dead among other things. Turned out both her husband and 12 year old son had died. Somehow her response of going so often to pray for them struck another beautiful chord for me.Her conversation with the prostitute was interesting too though I am not certain I learned anything from that one.I think people who feel a need for plot and action in a film will not be able to listen to this film and that is unfortunate. However for those who are able to and enjoy just listening this movie will provide you with wonderful fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Today afternoon I saw Abbas Kiarostami's TEN  an Iranian movie that was downloaded and kept with me from may be 34 years. It was BRILLIANT. Kiarostami is one of my favorite directorsTen is a story of a lady in Tehran Iran  whose life is documented by 10 episodes while she is driving her car. Each episode opens us slowly unwelding a new layer of human issue and personal relationship with such simplicity that after a while the movie seeps into your bone  marrow and starts bringing about unconscious awareness of our own groundings. 1. The Lady driver beautiful Mania Akbari picks up her son to drop him to a swimming pool  this introduces us to their complex relationship and the history of divorce and her dating another man 2. The Lady drops her sister to a place and this episode unveils the family structure and dynamics between sister and comfort level of the her child finding more happiness with a fullfledge family of her maternal aunt  uncle their son and grandma. 3. The Lady picks up an old lady to drop her at the mausoleum and opens up issues surrounding prayers good wishes God and simple humans 4. The Lady picks up a prostitute  who was cheated by her LOVER and now is a happy street hooker who thinks this lady driver is nothing different than what she is doing by selling her body for money. 5. The Lady picks up a stranger girl  who does not believe in God but has started to pray to God  so that her dream man whom she LOVES will agree to marry her. 6. The Lady picks up her another friend  who is facing a recent breakup of relationship  after 7 years of courtship and how depressed and desperate she is to kill herself  if she does not get that boy back. 7. 8. There are 2 more episodes with the Lady and her son being picked up and dropped 9. There is one more episode with the Girl who does not believe in God but goes to pray. Her dream has shattered as she realizes that the man whom she LOVES will never marry her  and she has bald her head due to that. 10. The last episode is again with her son  who does not want to stay with her but instead with her Grandmother's house.The movie may look like a documentary but it is a fictional movie. There are just two cameras used  one capturing the driver's seat and the other the other front car seat. That way the use of machine  technically the movie is minimalistic. Only a master craftsperson like Kiarostami can think of such an idea and execute it with utter simplicity yet expertise.The first single shot of the movie is 16 minutes long  just focusing in the child and the driver  Mom lady is never shown  but we can listen them talking and arguing. Another aspect that I noticed was the interaction between this 8 year old boy and his mother the driver. If one reads the dialogues without knowledge of who are these two characters  one will end up concluding  that they are LOVERS or Husbandwife who are unhappy  staying with each other and fighting.Each episode is iconic in opening new flood gates of understanding issues that we face across and some questions that we think of finding answers. This movie is a soulsearching journey of humanity through the lens of women's life. The great thing is that it is made by a man  Abbas Kairostami with utmost sincerity. His sensitivities understanding of psychology the depth of presenting things with utter simplicity  that can change a worldview is nothing short of a person who knows his craft and who knows humanity in and out.Each and every episodic interactions are farreaching beyond the interiors of the car but the most enriching is between the prostitute and the driver. Wow..! The prostitute is not shown in a single frame except her from her back when she gets out of the car and picks up a nightcustomer  we can just listen to her voiceover. Brilliant!All actors have acted with such perfection that not a single note seems awkward or acted. There are long and lingering shots on a person  and I wonder  how much rehearsals and shooting would have been done to come with a perfect single take shot. Special mention of the lady  Mania Akbari  We just see her face driving her car but she is so stunning in her persona. It is a life changing movie. When you get time and leisure and are in good mood and alone  sit and see this movie. It is a movie that is wholeheartedly recommended to all cinema lovers. Normally I never give a movie more than 8 stars. But I give this movie8.25 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Today afternoon I saw Abbas Kiarostami's TEN  an Iranian movie that was downloaded and kept with me from may be 34 years. It was BRILLIANT. Kiarostami is one of my favorite directorsTen is a story of a lady in Tehran Iran  whose life is documented by 10 episodes while she is driving her car. Each episode opens us slowly unwelding a new layer of human issue and personal relationship with such simplicity that after a while the movie seeps into your bone  marrow and starts bringing about unconscious awareness of our own groundings. 1. The Lady driver beautiful Mania Akbari picks up her son to drop him to a swimming pool  this introduces us to their complex relationship and the history of divorce and her dating another man 2. The Lady drops her sister to a place and this episode unveils the family structure and dynamics between sister and comfort level of the her child finding more happiness with a fullfledge family of her maternal aunt  uncle their son and grandma. 3. The Lady picks up an old lady to drop her at the mausoleum and opens up issues surrounding prayers good wishes God and simple humans 4. The Lady picks up a prostitute  who was cheated by her LOVER and now is a happy street hooker who thinks this lady driver is nothing different than what she is doing by selling her body for money. 5. The Lady picks up a stranger girl  who does not believe in God but has started to pray to God  so that her dream man whom she LOVES will agree to marry her. 6. The Lady picks up her another friend  who is facing a recent breakup of relationship  after 7 years of courtship and how depressed and desperate she is to kill herself  if she does not get that boy back. 7. 8. There are 2 more episodes with the Lady and her son being picked up and dropped 9. There is one more episode with the Girl who does not believe in God but goes to pray. Her dream has shattered as she realizes that the man whom she LOVES will never marry her  and she has bald her head due to that. 10. The last episode is again with her son  who does not want to stay with her but instead with her Grandmother's house.The movie may look like a documentary but it is a fictional movie. There are just two cameras used  one capturing the driver's seat and the other the other front car seat. That way the use of machine  technically the movie is minimalistic. Only a master craftsperson like Kiarostami can think of such an idea and execute it with utter simplicity yet expertise.The first single shot of the movie is 16 minutes long  just focusing in the child and the driver  Mom lady is never shown  but we can listen them talking and arguing. Another aspect that I noticed was the interaction between this 8 year old boy and his mother the driver. If one reads the dialogues without knowledge of who are these two characters  one will end up concluding  that they are LOVERS or Husbandwife who are unhappy  staying with each other and fighting.Each episode is iconic in opening new flood gates of understanding issues that we face across and some questions that we think of finding answers.

I have felt him so close in spirit it was one of the saddest losses in recent years.My relationship with him is rather simple and uncluttered much like the films he makes. Shucks about form and whether the camera moves or not as far as I'm concerned. It's a tool to create stillness so that simple gestures will ring wide but you can't still the mind of a viewer who has a million thoughts running in his head while watching and you can't prevent a viewer who wants to remain still by moving the camera.And I urge you as always to not settle for receiving films his or anyone else's as only cultural items that were made for us to intellectualize and keep up to date with norms of life in faraway places. It can make for interesting postviewing discussion but most of all make sure to know things privately in your own self allow them to have their cosmic import that speaks about the fact that here you are living a life that will last a little while more.A woman drives around Tehran having conversations with people on the passenger's seat during a day and a night this is the whole story here. We never leave the car. The camera simply flits between shots of the driver and passenger.By way of insights you will glean several here about the place of women in Iran expectations of being a housewife and how hard it is to obtain a divorce. Religion as focal point. You might consider that her unruly son who constantly berates her is promulgating larger social attitudes at play a far more eyeopening way than showing us an angry mullah. You will get to decide how much of all this echoes your own society.But now how about we allow it to simply be about a woman who drives around life that wells up around her with anxieties?A life that breaks down around the edges as all lives do. A marriage that didn't work out and a son that pushes himself away from her. A man and woman who wanted different things from life and parted ways. You might appreciate here that the man allowed himself to be painted as drug user before the court as the only way for her to get the divorce.Parallel possible lives materialize in the seat next to her. A sister who is going through a breakup she has already gone through how hopeless it is to cling to love that isn't there. Another woman whose marriage was broken off at the last moment. A prostitute who scoffs at the conventions of marriage. An old woman on her way to the mosque.It ends with a son who is growing up to be a man and she has to softly let go into life. It isn't just a social film but you'll have to allow yourself to watch from a softer distance. Kiarostami does it here bestows the gift of wisdom.

	schema:reviewBody "Ten 2002 is an Iranian film written and directed by Abbas Kiarostami. In an astonishing tour de force this movie takes place entirely within an automobile. One of the hallmarks of Kiarostami's work is his use of motor vehicles. However the single set for this film is the interior of a automobile. We see some POV shots of the streets and other cars but that's it.Mania Akbari plays the role called Driver. She does indeed drive throughout the film. Sometimes we see her passengers but we never have a shot of both people in the car at once. The plot of the film is the Driver's interaction with passengers.Akbari has several different passengers. Two of them are I think her sisters one is a pious older woman and one is a prostitute. However most of the time she interacts with her son Amin played incredibly well by Amin Maher. Amin appears to be about eight years old. The title of the movie Ten refers to the ten discrete episodes that make up the film.The Driver and Amin's father are divorced and most of the dialogue between mother and son revolves around this fact. The constant furious arguing between the two is painful to watch and hearbarely a loving word is exchanged between them. The boy is so angry about the divorce that he attacks his motherand her new husbandat every turn. The mother lashes back in between offers of ice cream which the boy clearly doesn't want. Interestingly Amin holds his own in the argumentshe's really skilled at taking his mother's words and using them against her. His behavior so extreme that in the U.S. we might consider him as being on the autism spectrum. Not knowing Iranian culture it's not clear to me whether this behavior would be considered so abnormal in that country.The mother's interactions with her other passengers are not as difficult to watch as are those with her son. Picking up the older woman and taking her to the mosque is an act of charity. She tries to help her sisters with their problems and she appears to be very sympathetic to the prostitute. She's clearly an intelligent and cultured person. However her interactions with Amin are so toxic that the movie is fairly depressing.What's not depressing is the skill and deftness with which Kiarostami tells us about the Driver's life and the lives of the people around her. Only a genius could give us so much information and make a movie so interesting while having just a single set. Not only is there just a single set but that single set is narrowly confined to the interior of an automobile! It's just amazing.We saw this film on DVD and it worked well. It may not be right for everyone but if you like intelligent quiet intense movies it will be right for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before James Bond.Before Indiana Jones.There was the Hercules series.Or at least the series starring Reg Park. These Hercules films were big colorful full of action and fun. They are also shockingly maligned just by looking at the IMDb rating for HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN which is a joke.HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN wasn't your average lowbudget Sword  Sandal flick. It was shot in Technirama expensive 70mm and the look of it in the widescreen version is remarkable to say the least big colorful sets big cast big action. The details in some scenes is stunning.The whole production reminds me of old serials where our hero encounters one pitfall after another. HATCW is like the missing link that bridges the gap between old serials of the 1930s1940s and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. And like James Bond films DR NO was made a year after this this Hercules movie is replete with vast cavernous sets which dwarf the cast and are set on the side of spectacle.CAPTIVE WOMEN has many highlights. My favorite part is when Hercules saves Iseme daughter of Queen Antinea from the clutches of Proteus. Psychedelia circa 1961 or psychedelia before psychedelia was in! The surreal look is great and precedes all other films made in the 1960s including BARBARELLA or even Fellini films like SATYRICON. In fact HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN looks like an action film if it had been directed by Fellini. It doesn't shy away from combining odd imagery along with comic book action.The cast is perfect. Steve Reeves was and still is the definitive Hercules but beefy Reg Park fits the bill here. Park is happy just to be an action hero as opposed to Reeves who wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. Fay Spain makes a memorable evil Queen. Laura Efrikian is beautiful as Iseme. Ettore Manni a familiar face in Peplums and a pretty good actor lends excellent support as Hercules' best friend Androcles.The film itself is not perfect. The story is a tad thin and the stock footage at the end is obviously just footage of an erupting volcano and it definitely lacks a distinctive score to give the film that extra special character but even so these things didn't diminish the fun I had while watching it. HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN is the kind of movie I'll be watching again and again. It just rocks!".

	schema:reviewBody "An epic peplum adventure film. considered by many to be one of the best of its genre  it's certainly the one of the most beautifullyshot and wellmade of them all with colourful locations and crisp gorgeous locations plus interesting costume design and great sets. Made on an obviously bigger budget than most this is a delightful film which is gorgeous to look at and should appeal to children and adults alike. While some of the special effects may seem cheesy to a modern crowd they nonetheless contain an air of spectacle and magic that later more complex special effects work couldn't hope to capture. The plot is predictable stuff involving an evil queen as always who rules over the lost city but is enlivened with imaginative scenes like an army of identical men and an excellent scene where Hercules battles a shapeshifting god Proteus.Reg Park star of HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD once again reprises the role of the legendary Hercules who is actually based on myth for a change instead of just being another Italian musclemen. His Hercules is an exceptionally lazy brute who can hardly be bothered to take part in the action when it happens  a deeply flawed character who still manages to come through in the end. This gives his character an added dimension making him more of an interesting lead. Although Park's acting skills are severely limited as always he more than makes up for this with his impressive bulk.Initially the film is pretty slow with lots of court intrigue following on from an excellent staged barroom brawl with lots of props being smashed. However when Hercules and his pals set sail to conquer an unknown foe the fun really begins. He's accompanied by a nottooirritating dwarf sidekick known as Timoteo his weakling son and King Androcles a mutual friend who is desperate for the strongman's help. When the crew of cutthroats attempt mutiny Hercules singlehandedly pulls the boat back to shore! Just one of the many incredible feats of strength portrayed throughout the movie which include the usual barbending rockthrowing and guardfighting action all welldone.Things start getting eerie when Androcles and Hercules are both swept overboard during a freak storm. Hercules wakes up floating on a raft in a sea of mist very impressively done and sees a vision of Androcles crying out for help. He discovers a weird red island and a girl melded into the rock face a very weird not 100 successful special effect. Holding her captive hence the title is Proteus a shapeshifting god who assumes the form of a lizard man cheesy but cool burning flames a huge snake a lion and an eagle. Hercules must fight each incarnation in turn before ripping off the lizard man's horn killing the God for good. He rescues a girl an Italian stunner as usual and discovers the lost island of Atlantis hidden behind a sea mist.Atlantis is ruled by the lovelybutcruel Queen Antinea who repeatedly attempts to kill her daughter due to a prophecy which says she will only die when her daughter is freed. Hercules meets Androcles but is stunned to discover the man has a whole new personality and is convinced that he has been living in Atlantis for years! Meanwhile his shipwrecked fans hide out on the island and rescue the Queen's daughter from a certain death. Hercules is initially seduced by the Queen but breaks free from her spell and frees a pit of slaves on the island. A battle ensues which leaves the slaves massacred and in a great pan we see the littered corpses strewn around the steps of the palace  a sudden solemn and surprisingly affecting moment.Hercules and his son are taken prisoner in the palace and thrown into a memoryloss room but manage to escape by lifting the rapidlylowering ceiling! Hercules battles with an army of superstrong identical soldiers great scene and escapes to a nearby mountain. He tears a rock from the roof whereby a shaft of sunlight hits the evil manchanging rock of death and causes the dormant volcano to erupt. Hercules and his friends escape by ship as the city is destroyed behind them buried under tons of rubble.I love the way they throw every clich in the book and a few surprises into this film. For example the guard who has failed in his job and who is thrown into an acid pit turning into a skeleton! Or Antinea's attempt to drug Hercules who is so obviously keeping the liquid in his mouth. There's an expected dancesequence a man who kills by swinging rocks and some weird distorted computer sound effects thrown into the brew for good measure. The supporting cast is excellent with Luciano Marin and Ettore Manni as strong supporting leads the friends of Hercules Fay Spain as the wicked selfobsessed queen and the beautiful Laura Efrikian as the queen's unlucky daughter. Mario Petri turns up in a small role as an Atlantan priest who helps Hercules on his quest.HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN is a film packed with spectacle like the wild scene where Hercules decimates the Queen's guard by propelling a burning chariot into their midst! Or the excellent moment where he fights the magic shapeshifter. There's also the surprising plot twist where you expect an exciting battle scene to occur but the film instead cuts to the dark vision of a bloody massacre  not what you are expecting at all. Sure the film is cheesy with copious poorlyinserted stock footage of a volcano eruption popping up at the climax but its all in good spirit. One of the highlights of the genre and a mustsee slice of spectacular Italian exploitation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vittorio Cottafavi's Hercules and the Captive Women recycles the standard Hercules plot structure. If you have seen any of its predecessors or descendants you have seen something very much like this film. However in this case the entire army of evildoers Herc must confront are immortals from Atlantis who have been secretly infiltrating Greek politics. Most of the action takes place on Atlantis after Herc his son and a couple of friends wash up there.Hercules is played by Reg Park a very beefy nonactor built like a comic book superhero. Park seems to spend the first 13rd of the film lounging about and most of the second 23rds flexing and fighting. His occasional lines are clearly spoken but without a great deal of enthusiasm. Most of the acting is OK. No real highlights in the cast though.The action sequences are fairly entertaining but don't compare favorably to the specialeffects saturated fight scenes of today. Like many Hercules films Captive Women features lavish costumes and sets.The costumes are up to the series aboveaverage standards and a few of the Atlantean sets are really nice. The script is on par with most of the series which is to say that it is not very good.Recommended for Hercules fans only.".

	onyx:emotionText "Vittorio Cottafavi's Hercules and the Captive Women recycles the standard Hercules plot structure. If you have seen any of its predecessors or descendants you have seen something very much like this film. However in this case the entire army of evildoers Herc must confront are immortals from Atlantis who have been secretly infiltrating Greek politics. Most of the action takes place on Atlantis after Herc his son and a couple of friends wash up there.Hercules is played by Reg Park a very beefy nonactor built like a comic book superhero. Park seems to spend the first 13rd of the film lounging about and most of the second 23rds flexing and fighting. His occasional lines are clearly spoken but without a great deal of enthusiasm. Most of the acting is OK. No real highlights in the cast though.The action sequences are fairly entertaining but don't compare favorably to the specialeffects saturated fight scenes of today. Like many Hercules films Captive Women features lavish costumes and sets.The costumes are up to the series aboveaverage standards and a few of the Atlantean sets are really nice. The script is on par with most of the series which is to say that it is not very good.Recommended for Hercules fans only.";

Former Hollywood Bmovie starlet Fay Spain is also terrific as the evil Queen of Atlantis in her only peplum appearance. Mimmo Palmara is all but unrecognisable under a mask shamelessly borrowed directly from Atlantis The Lost Continent while genre regulars Ettore Manni and Mario Petri provide their usual dependable support. There is definitely something a bit gay about the threeway relationship between Park Luciano Marin supposedly playing his son and Furnari whom Park sits on his knee at one point and Park is frequently told that things have happened because of Uranus which no matter how you look at it still sounds like your anus!.The English language and European releases feature completely different openings the European release featuring a much longer version 7 minutes of the opening bar room brawl complete with exotic dancer going on behind the credits and without the voice over and there is also an additional scene in the countryside before everything turns red. The scene where Hercules destroys the throne is also several minutes longer in the European release as is the storm at sea sequence. There are numerous other slight editing differences throughout which account for approximately 8 minutes difference in running times.".

His physique of course definitely helped him getting these sort of roles. His career also ended pretty soon after he started to age like often happens to these types of 'actors'.Like all these sort of Italian swords and sandals productions it's a very cheap and often laughable looking movie even though the movie is also being grand to look at with its enormous and colorful sets. The movie does use some silly early effects though you just can not accuse this movie of not being creative. It just doesn't always works in the movie its own advantage.I of course couldn't care less about the story of the movie and all that seemed to matter was that the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Passable Peplum thanks to robust Reg Park and expert filmmaker Vittorio Cottafavi . Mythological epic with a magnificent heman as is Reg Park and set in Greece and Turkey . The Greek council of the 30 formed by a nice Italian cast such as Ivo Garrani  Enrico Maria Salerno  Ettore Manni and the notorious Gian Maria Volonte  previous his Fistful of dollars assigns Heracles Reg Park a dangerous mission to go to Orient country to investigate a terrible enemy foreseen by the augur Nando Tamberlani . Heroic Hercules along with his son Luciano Marin  Androclo Re Di Tebe Ettore Manni and a midget battle the seductive powers of the wicked Queen of Atlantis named Antinea Fay Spain . Strong yet sleepy Hercules discovers that the Queen of Atlantis is plotting to take over the world with superhuman warriors . The bouncing Maciste helps the Atlantis citizens and reunites an army of rebels to take on the queen headquarter . But Maciste is captured  locked and become a slave . Our protagonist unhesitatingly goes into action and must use his strength to save the Atlantis townsfolk from villain Queen Antinea . Then Maciste becomes inextricably involved in a war between rebels under his command against an army of automat . Along the way Maciste or Hercules or Goliath frees slaves  moves rocks  fights weird creatures and nasty masked hoodlums . ItalianFrench coproduction with haunting scenarios  wonderful outdoors and functional production design  including a city similarly designed to mythical Atlantis . Lavishlyproduced  sometimes tongueincheek  plenty of action and results to be pretty entertaining . This is a good spaghetti  mythopera with action  battles  luxurious landscapes and a love story between Hercules' son and a princess . The movie has not mythological accuracy neither expecting historical . Breathtaking scenes when Maciste moves a giant rock  thrown from a cliff  and overwhelming final with surprising and spectacular scenes  including the explosive spotlight when ground shaking  volcano erupts and the town blows its top . In the picture turns up Peplum ordinaries as Ivo Garrani as Re Di Megalia  Mimmo Palmara as Astor Il Gran Visir  Mario Petri as Zenith Prete Di Urano and veteran Nando Tamberlani as Tiberiades  the soothsayer. Reg Park is perfect as the mythical hero who encounters many dangerous situations while trying to save his son of numerous odds and taking on the mythical Queen Antinea from Pierre Benoit novel . Reg Park himself became something of a cult personality in the Italian epic genre . Reg was a personal fitness trainer in South Africa . His friend and protg Arnold Schwarzenegger considered Park to be the best of the peplum heroes. Reg Park who played the mythic Maciste in a few movies was randomly assigned the identity of Hercules  Goliath  Samson or Aron for U.S. viewing . Bouncing and strong Reg was the third American actor bodybuilder  after Steve Reeves and Gordon Scott to be recruited by Italian producers to star in Peplum films . Reg Park played reserve team football for Leeds United before turning to bodybuilding in 1946 . He finished Mr Universe runnerup to future film rival Steve Reeves in 1950  then won the title outright in 1951 1958 and 1965. After marrying South Africanborn Mareon Isaacs in Johannesburg in 1952 the Parks moved permanently to South Africa . Reg used the amount of money he made acting as hero and gladiator films in Italy to fitness . As the muscleman Reg Park left allegedly the sword and sandals genre for the gymnasium in South Africa where Reg ran a chain of fitness studios . He was one along with Ed Fury  Dan Vadis  Brad Harris  Alan Steel  Rock Stevens  Gordon Scott whom to seek fortune acting absurdly as muscle mythological figures but nobody topped Steve Reeves in popularity . Reg only starred 5 Peplum such as  La Sfida Dei Giganti  1964 Ursus terror of the Kirguisos  1961 Ercole Al Centro della terra Hercules  1961 The conquest of the Atlntida and Maciste in King Solomon's Mines  USA TV title or Samson in King Solomon's Mines which  handily for Park was filmed on location in South Africa .Interesting screenplay by Sandro Continenza and Ennio De Concini  a prolific writerdirector who wrote a lot of Spaghetti  Gialli and Peplum . This spectacular Sword and Sandal movie displays a colorful and glowing cinematography by Carlo Carlini  filmed on location and Incir De Paolis Studios Rome Lazio Italy . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Gino Marinuzzi and Armando Trovajoli . The motion picture was professionally directed by Vittorio Cottafavi who also wrote many tales of this kind as he continued to realize and write films in similar style  at which he developed a considerable skill and mastery . He began his professional career in the film industry as clapper boy . After progressing to write motion picture screenplays and working as assistant director under Alessandro Blasetti and Vittorio De Sica he became a director in his own right in 1943. Many of his films have been swordand sandal epics dealing with mythological subjects involving the Roman Empire or Ancient Egypt such as The Warrior and the Slave Girl  Amazons of Rome  Goliath and the Dragon  Messalina and Cleopatra's Legion . From the mid60's Cottafavi concentrated exclusively on directing TV series and miniseries under contract to RAI . Rating  Acceptable musclemen fodder and better than most muscles operasspaghetti  thanks to Reg Park and by Peplum specialist as is the director Vittorio Cottafavi . Rating  6510  Well worth watching and better than average Sword and Sandals movie .".

	schema:headline " This is a mad dream Antinea but I shall put an end to the madness.";
	schema:reviewBody "The title Hercules and the Captive Women is a bit of a misnomer there was only one woman captive and along with her mother Queen Antinea of Atlantis were the only two women in the entire film. The International English title mentions the 'Conquest of Atlantis' and that probably makes more sense but in the end it's the destruction of Atlantis that takes center stage.There's an entire mythology offered by Zantas the last high priest of Uranus that explains what's going on with Antinea and her cohort of Grand Vizier clones. It involves the betrayal of Uranus and how at his death his blood becomes a rock of power which Antinea will use to become omnipotent. Only the rays of the sun can destroy the rock so that clue is a preview as to how Hercules will save the day.Reg Park is the beefy Hercules in this film probably the best known bodybuilder after Steve Reeves to don the mantle of Zeus' son. The entire first half of the picture has him unusually resigned to his fate his buddy Androcles the King of Thebes had him drugged so he could whisk him away to do battle against an unknown enemy. Herc's son Hylus was in on the scheme and tries to stay out of dad's sight as long as possible to avoid a Herculean butt kicking.One has to consider just how effective a king Androcles actually was. He's on a mission to save his kingdom and not one warrior from Thebes accompanies him he had to man the ship with galley slaves and cutthroats. He mentions to Hercules that his senators didn't agree with him but come on he's the King! At least Hercules was sharp enough to avoid being drugged a second time.

The other effect that caught my eye was when one of Antinea's ineffective soldiers got the 'House on Haunted Hill' acid wash reducing him to a skeleton.I'd be curious to see the outtakes from this picture.

I'm sure by the time Atlantis blew up Hercules was ready to say  'you watch yours and I'll watch mine'.And what about the captive women er woman? Well she hooks up with Hylus on the voyage home exchanging a major lip lock with Hercules' son as they sail off into the sunset. All's well as Androcles comes out of his state of amnesia and he doesn't remember a thing. As for Hercules he shows just how powerful a son of a Greek god can be when he climbs aboard the ship after swimming to safety from Atlantis he's as dry as a bone!".

	onyx:emotionText "The title Hercules and the Captive Women is a bit of a misnomer there was only one woman captive and along with her mother Queen Antinea of Atlantis were the only two women in the entire film. The International English title mentions the 'Conquest of Atlantis' and that probably makes more sense but in the end it's the destruction of Atlantis that takes center stage.There's an entire mythology offered by Zantas the last high priest of Uranus that explains what's going on with Antinea and her cohort of Grand Vizier clones. It involves the betrayal of Uranus and how at his death his blood becomes a rock of power which Antinea will use to become omnipotent. Only the rays of the sun can destroy the rock so that clue is a preview as to how Hercules will save the day.Reg Park is the beefy Hercules in this film probably the best known bodybuilder after Steve Reeves to don the mantle of Zeus' son. The entire first half of the picture has him unusually resigned to his fate his buddy Androcles the King of Thebes had him drugged so he could whisk him away to do battle against an unknown enemy. Herc's son Hylus was in on the scheme and tries to stay out of dad's sight as long as possible to avoid a Herculean butt kicking.One has to consider just how effective a king Androcles actually was. He's on a mission to save his kingdom and not one warrior from Thebes accompanies him he had to man the ship with galley slaves and cutthroats. He mentions to Hercules that his senators didn't agree with him but come on he's the King! At least Hercules was sharp enough to avoid being drugged a second time. When Antinea attempts to slip him a mickey Herc fakes it so he can continue investigating the secrets of Atlantis. He had some fun earlier defeating the shape shifting Proteus who protected the island from the outside world. The other effect that caught my eye was when one of Antinea's ineffective soldiers got the 'House on Haunted Hill' acid wash reducing him to a skeleton.I'd be curious to see the outtakes from this picture.

Anyway Hercules and the Captive Women is a genre exercise and so if we are to properly evaluate it we should run it against the Hercules Movie Checklist to see just how well it delivers the mandatory elements! 1. Is the title character portrayed by an actor with an almost ridiculously huge and bloated physique? Check! 2. Does he lift large seemingly heavy objects and chuck them around? Check! 3. Does he fight a wild animal? Check! 4. Does he fight absurd monsters or creatures from outer space? Check! 5. Does he cause a natural catastrophe buildings toppling mountains exploding world economies collapsing? Check! 6. Does he bend iron objects out of shape and then bend them back again? Check! 7. Is there an evil queen? Check! 8. Does she have the hots for Herc? Check! 9. Does she try to drug Herc with poisoned wine? Check! 10. Does she seem to really enjoy killing other people? Check! 11. Do the men wear miniskirts while the women wear diaphanous gowns? Check! 12. Are there chariots spears bows and arrows and soldiers wearing helmets and carrying shields? Check! 13. Are there enormous temple sets? Check! 14. Are there caves? Check! 15. Are there secret passages and trap doors? Check! 16. Is there at least one Pagan Splendor Dance Number? Check! So to be fair this movie does seem to touch all the Hercules bases! It loses points however for the inclusion of several unwanted and unwarranted elements. The first is a hopelessly convoluted and confusing plot that is so riddled with holes that it resembles a corpse at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The second is the pointless inclusion of Hylas the son of Hercules. He seems to be in the movie to provide some kind of love interest for the Princess who is condemned to die to save the life of her mother the evil queen. But shouldn't the Herc be her love interest? It seems to me that a love triangle between Hercules the queen and the princess offers more plot possibilities than wedging a son into things. There is really nothing he does in the flick that couldn't have been accomplished by Daddy with a lot less plot machinations. Hylas really drags the movie down. The third is the inclusion of Timotheus the dwarf and companion to Hylas. My guess is that he is there to provide comic relief although the movie is already so full of unintentional laughs that Timotheus really comes off as completely unnecessary. In fact he is just plain annoying. There are some folks in Hollywood who think that dwarfs are completely adorable and endlessly entertaining. Those folks are wrong!".

Only Herc's mate Androclo offers to take his army and see what's going down and for some reason Herc declares he isn't going and then destroys Androclo's throne for no reason whatsoever! Probably just a side effect of necking too many Aberdare tictacs I'd imagine.Of course Herc's own son gives Herc some drugged wine and both of them end up on Androclo's ship with their dwarf sidekick for good measure. This is the point when Androclo declares that he hasn't got an army and everyone on board the ship is a cheap pirate he picked up to work for him and yes they rebel and Herc leaves them on an island for their troubles.After an awful lot of fannying about the film decides to become mental for a few minutes as Herc has a square go with the shape changing God Proteus! Proteus also has the Queen of Atlantis' daughter as a sacrifice but before Herc can rescue her he's go to deal with Proteus who changes from an old man to a lizard monster to some flames then into a snake that attacks Herc then into a lion that attacks Herc then into a vulture that attacks Herc then back to a lizard monsterthat attacks Herc! The Queen of Atlantis shows her appreciation for having her daughter rescued by having her daughter taken away and put to death she's rescued by Herc's son and dwarf sidekick who gets to impale a guy with a spear. This is when things get a bit draggy as the plot splits in two with Herc drinking more bloody drugged booze fending off the Queen's advances and hearing the word Uranus a lot and Herc's son falling in love with that chick and finding a quarry full of mutants. Androclo also becomes insane by this point in a story that bored me while I watched it so let's forget about that.That seems like an awful lot of plot and doesn't even include the clone army the glowing Uranus rock people saying Uranus all the time Uranus rules over all! and the massive fight between the mutants and the clone army that results in the deaths of every single mutant. The pacing of this film is very erratic but the body count is through the roof as Herc manages not only to destroy the Queen but also her clone army her regular army every single person living on Atlantis and the entire land of Atlantis itself. And still makes it home for dinner.Why does Hercules just drink everything he's given without question? I've seen him drugged this way in every single Herc film I've watched I think. He's drugged up twice in this film alone! One of these days someone's going to give him a cup of pish just for a laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reg Park was a champion British bodybuilder from Leeds known for his size. He prefigured the bigger man who dominated the sport when it gained in popularity especially Arnold Schwarzenegger who considered Park a friend and mentor. He was a natural choice to play Hercules and I think the secondbest at it after Steve Reeves. He just has to stand there to look imposing but he had a natural athlete's grace an easy charm and looked good with a beard.Originally titled Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide Hercules at the Conquest of Atlantis the American title doesn't make much sense because there is only one captive woman and she is freed by Hercules then recaptured and freed by Hercules's son. That however is only the tip of the stopmakingsense iceberg even though the film tries to build a halfbaked political backdrop for the story the early scenes could have inspired The Phantom Menace except that this is more entertaining. The Atlantis story the film concocts is not one that has any basis in any mythology I'm familiar with but it involves an evil queen Antinea Fay Spain who plots to take over the world and destroy Greece with her army of supersoldiers who's capabilities she badly overestimates. Naturally she falls for Hercules which is one of the many Peplum tropes the filmmakers squeeze in the comicrelief sidekick played by little person Salvatore Furnari the dancing girls the monsters and animals Hercules has to dispatch. This time the film gets that out of the way with the character of demigod Proteus who can shape shift so Hercules takes on a serpent man in hilarious rubber suit snake lion and bird of prey in rapid succession. There is a surprising amount of armchair philosophizing with Hercules insisting he couldn't do what he does if the gods didn't approve but otherwise being quite the skeptic. He tells Queen Antinea he likes his nature to be natural as opposed to augmented by magic and she basically tells him to check his privilege. Overall this is very silly but very watchable and enjoyable even if it is slow to get going. See also the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version.".

He was a natural choice to play Hercules and I think the secondbest at it after Steve Reeves. He just has to stand there to look imposing but he had a natural athlete's grace an easy charm and looked good with a beard.Originally titled Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide Hercules at the Conquest of Atlantis the American title doesn't make much sense because there is only one captive woman and she is freed by Hercules then recaptured and freed by Hercules's son. That however is only the tip of the stopmakingsense iceberg even though the film tries to build a halfbaked political backdrop for the story the early scenes could have inspired The Phantom Menace except that this is more entertaining. The Atlantis story the film concocts is not one that has any basis in any mythology I'm familiar with but it involves an evil queen Antinea Fay Spain who plots to take over the world and destroy Greece with her army of supersoldiers who's capabilities she badly overestimates. Naturally she falls for Hercules which is one of the many Peplum tropes the filmmakers squeeze in the comicrelief sidekick played by little person Salvatore Furnari the dancing girls the monsters and animals Hercules has to dispatch. This time the film gets that out of the way with the character of demigod Proteus who can shape shift so Hercules takes on a serpent man in hilarious rubber suit snake lion and bird of prey in rapid succession. There is a surprising amount of armchair philosophizing with Hercules insisting he couldn't do what he does if the gods didn't approve but otherwise being quite the skeptic. He tells Queen Antinea he likes his nature to be natural as opposed to augmented by magic and she basically tells him to check his privilege. Overall this is very silly but very watchable and enjoyable even if it is slow to get going. See also the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version.";

	schema:reviewBody "Once again Hercules is back to do what he does in nearly every movie! This time Hercules is played by Reg Park who just is not quite as good in the role as Steve Reeves was. He looks okay but something about him is just off. This is the fifth film in the series following Hercules Hercules Unchained Goliath and the Dragon and Hercules vs the Hydra. The two films before this one featured two other guys in the role of Hercules however Reg Park would make one more Hercules film besides this one. There are a whole lot of Hercules films that were released during this time and there would be several more films after this one as well. I only saw the first and second film before this one so I do now that the first and second film do follow each other however I am not sure how this one follows the previous two films. Hercules has a son at this point but due to the very confusing way this film opened up I literally did not realize it was his son until the thing was nearly over when they were helping people out of the pit. Of course the fact the opening of this movie was so confusing may point out that it did follow the previous film and that one would of had to seen it to understand what the heck is going on! Hercules Unchained was a bit confusing too until I watched the original Hercules film.The story is very cluttered especially at the beginning. All I know is that there is a brawl in a bar and Hercules and his buddies go riding and there is something with the sun before they are in a throne room where a man who is king or something declares that he is going to try and thwart some sort of threat against Greece. Hercules trashes his throne and then they are off on an adventure where Hercules ends up on a piece of driftwood before fighting a monster that turns into several monsters and saves a girl who takes him to Atlantis where he is drinking with another evil queen. Thankfully he seems to have learned his lesson and does not drink the tainted wine and he has to save the people from a rock that a leper guy lectures Hercules about before being vaporized and there is kind of a volcanic finish as Hercules does not get a really cool battle to end this one.This made for a good episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 though watching this Hercules films they all kind of do things the same way. They riffed three true Hercules films during the shows initial run as they did this one and the first two Hercules films. They also riffed Hercules Against the Moon Men but that was not a true Hercules film believe it or not. It was part of a series called the Maciste series though my guess is kind of an Italian version of Hercules. There were 17 or so Hercules films and several more of the Maciste films and there were others that featured a large muscular guy that was a Hercules type hero. Suffice to say there was a whole lot of Hercules type films back in the day! They made for some good material for the gang of MST3K.So this film was just not quite as good as the first two films. Both of those films seemed a bit better quality than this one. Reg Park just did not seem as good in the role of Hercules as Reeves did but not placing the blame squarely on his broad shoulders. No the plot was kind of a mess but as I said that may be due to the fact one needs to watch this series of film in the order presented. Still a lot of what they were doing in Atlantis was perplexing and it had nothing to do with the strange opening that may or may not have required additional viewing. Also if you are going to have Hercules in your film he should figure more in the end of the film rather than just moving a rock or two. He should be involved in a battle in this film the best battle of the flick was when he fought Proteus at nearly the beginning of the film.".

She enjoys her work but dreams of getting a road assignment a train of her own. Sharing the railroad with her are Farnsworth a refined passenger diesel locomotive Pete a rough and tumble freight hauler Jebediah an elderly engine who handles the branch line milk trains and Georgia a friendly locomotive who handles the Birthday Train a toy and food run for the kids on the other side of the mountain. In charge of them all is a grumpy high strung dispatch tower who oversee's the day to day operation of the railroad. The rest of the characters are the toys aboard the Birthday Train and some incidental line side folks such as talking eagles and coyotes a pair of kids on the other side of the mountain and a workrescue locomotive named Doc.The premise of the film is the same as the children's' book with Tillie taking over the Birthday Train on her own accord following Georgia breaking downand the other engines not wanting to or be able to assist. With the rally cry I THINK I CAN Tillie heads off over a tough stretch of mountain railroad and encounters adventures along the rails as she strives to bring the train to its destination.Well drawn well voiced and oddly endearing this film continues to carry the message that if you have the heart and put your mind to a task you can do anything!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Little Engine That Could is a 1991 short film that runs for slightly half an hour. as this one has its 25th anniversary this year I thought this may be a good time to give it another watch. It is about a little locomotive train that looks a lot like Casper the Ghost and has the difficult task to make it over the mountains so that a boy can have a great birthday party with lots of entertainers and animals. The boy's sister is a bit of a bully and the main antagonist if there is any. It is all very harmonic I guess. The characters are funny to watch including pessimistic poultry and courageous clowns. The animation looks a lot older than 1991. And the title is probably the biggest spoiler ever as the dramatic final scenes are really all about whether the engine is gonna make it or not. As a whole a pretty decent watch that scores more through cuteness than through drama or comedy but it's worth checking out. Thumbs up. The voice cast includes a bunch of famous names including Frank Welker who seems to be in everything.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty great special even to this day. Kids from 36 would especially love it. It's colorful bright and true to the book not just to the point of the art style and the characters but to it's very core and emotion. The music with the happy gloomy and sometimes even scary images displayed don't worry nothing your kids can't handle! gives kids and perhaps even adults alike a sense of empowerment towards the end. This is especially important because everyone and their grandmother knows what happens in the story birthday train breaks down other snooty but powerful trains come along excepting the old less welltodo engine refusing to pull the train when along comes a little engine who ends up pulling the whole train over the mountain against all odds. Knowing very well the ending you would think that you wouldn't necessarily feel as worried for Tillie little engine as you would when you first read the book but the story is told in such a wonderful unique and perhaps even Expressionistic way that you forget about the ending for 20 minutes and immerse in the world that is Tillie's home and the gloomy mountain.Animation fans will recognize the work of Dave Edwards who prior to working on this special is known for the UK animated classic SuperTed. The cuddly bouncy style fits well in this halfhour special and as mentioned earlier fits well with the style of the book. Fans of TV music in the late 80s will recognize Mark Mueller who prior to this has done work with the theme songs for DuckTales and Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.One of the few things keeping the score to go any higher is the bland setting and story but keeping The Little Engine That Could interesting is no easy task and the team has done the best they Could to keep it as interesting as it is. Recommended over the 2011 special any day.".

I mean Organic that means I am excused to like Knight Rider's K.I.T.T. 2000. This movie just makes it worse. In this movie everything you can see made by human hand is alive for some reason Satanic Ritual maybe and that's unnerving for me who likes technology in the way it is.

I usually wish I could join the main heroes or villains in the movie video game or novelcomic I read or watch. This is one of the exceptional cases when I was grateful for living in the real world where trains are not living objects. But can it be worse? Please keep that scene away from me in which the phrase I Think I can is repeated the great beings knows how many times in a manner that clearly sounds like imitating the sound of a running Steam Locomotive. I always found that sound annoying but here it was turned into an atrocity a scene from hell to torture me. Before it even stopped I was ready to do what I never believed I ever get close to doing... then it stopped to my brief relief only to give me a song... which returned the discomfort. Again in most cases I don't like the characters in an animated movie singing. There are exceptions. And this movie doesn't have that. Let's get to the appearance of the main character of all characters who has her... yes... HER face on the chimney where the steam comes out. Doesn't that hurt? Having the face in front of the water tank must be atrocious as well and some characters do have that too in a similar manner to Thomas the Tank Nightmare. But here's the elephant in the room Almost any man made object is given an organic face. And I am thankful for living in the real world this time.

	schema:headline " Good film making with average source material";
	schema:reviewBody "El Paramo The Squad is neat little film coming out of Colombia. It is extraordinary in many ways. Coming from a nonprolific film industry it falls within the extremely small subgenre of military horror films. Although to be fair it is really a psychological thriller. The writerdirector Jaime Osorio Marquez handles the story well for a novice film maker. Constraints of low budget are hard to spot largely due to superb on location filming. The director appreciably discards the urge to let things over the top and follows a minimalist approach. In many ways El Paramo is a minimalist film. The storyline itself is bare minimum and so are the dialogs. Acting is largely good again not requiring much from the actors. A notable exception is the actor Andrs Castaeda he plays sarge who hams in a few intense scenes required of him. May be the minimalist approach itself is the biggest flaw of the film. With absolutely no storyline to hold things together nobody has anything much to do. The basic premise itself of a tightly knit group of soldiers encountering the unknown and the eventual break down of all form of cohesiveness is hardly new. The basic storyline is surprisingly similar to The Bunker 2001by Rob Green and also has shades of South Korean films The Guard Post GP506 2008 and RPoint 2004 by Kong SuChang. Osorio Marquez's film making craft however is inferior to none. He handles the mood building well aided by a suitably spooky soundtrack. The misty desaturated colours help set the tone. The overall pace may be a tad bit slow and since nothing much happens along the way the eventual feeling is not satisfying. A lack of a tangible outside threat means that the squad members are ultimately fighting their internal demons. The director gives a hint of the underlying tensions in the opening scenes as well. That part however is underplayed by the script giving scant background to the viewers. The director obviously fights the urge to provide quick and cheap thrills to the audience and instead chooses to build the tension up gradually through the interplay of the squad members and reaching a crescendo when all military discipline breaks down ultimately. The problem is that the characters themselves are not well developed and initially it is difficult to differentiate between them due to the desaturated colour tones and overall white gray background of mud and fog. Watching them run around in circles helplessly and turn against each other is a slow painstaking process something not enjoyable to all. In the bottom line El Paramo is certainly quality film making. It scores big on atmospherics photography sound design and production value especially considering the limited budget. The script is weak however and is now getting predictable.".

	onyx:emotionText "El Paramo The Squad is neat little film coming out of Colombia. It is extraordinary in many ways. Coming from a nonprolific film industry it falls within the extremely small subgenre of military horror films. Although to be fair it is really a psychological thriller. The writerdirector Jaime Osorio Marquez handles the story well for a novice film maker. Constraints of low budget are hard to spot largely due to superb on location filming. The director appreciably discards the urge to let things over the top and follows a minimalist approach. In many ways El Paramo is a minimalist film. The storyline itself is bare minimum and so are the dialogs. Acting is largely good again not requiring much from the actors. A notable exception is the actor Andrs Castaeda he plays sarge who hams in a few intense scenes required of him. May be the minimalist approach itself is the biggest flaw of the film. With absolutely no storyline to hold things together nobody has anything much to do. The basic premise itself of a tightly knit group of soldiers encountering the unknown and the eventual break down of all form of cohesiveness is hardly new. The basic storyline is surprisingly similar to The Bunker 2001by Rob Green and also has shades of South Korean films The Guard Post GP506 2008 and RPoint 2004 by Kong SuChang. Osorio Marquez's film making craft however is inferior to none. He handles the mood building well aided by a suitably spooky soundtrack. The misty desaturated colours help set the tone. The overall pace may be a tad bit slow and since nothing much happens along the way the eventual feeling is not satisfying. A lack of a tangible outside threat means that the squad members are ultimately fighting their internal demons. The director gives a hint of the underlying tensions in the opening scenes as well.

Yes it follows a welltrodden path but is none the worse for it. I thought it a shade heavy on the melodrama and it lacked a little refinement here and there hence only 810 but artistic direction and photography were tight and sensitively handled throughout. I enjoyed the device of concentrating totally on the actors to the exclusion of just about everything else there IS a lot of darkness and mist around so may be best avoided if expensive sets and grand scenery are more to your liking. Or if somewhat grisly scenes turn you off! The basics of the story which all unfolds quite nicely are no more than have been revealed by other reviewers so I've nothing to add except praise for the welldesigned music soundtrack and a warm recommendation overall.".

El Paramo or 'The Squad' so we can all pronounce it fairly decent is more of a psychological thriller in which a group of nine pro soldiers of a special antiguerrilla unit are sent to an abandoned base located over a mountain in the Colombian Andes which has lost contact a few days ago. Why? Supposedly because they were under attack. At the time the commandos arrive they find only one survivor. And that's where the game begins.Suspicion paranoia and treason. The root of all evil is inside the group itself and that's what makes this film stand out. It might seem like a bit of a spoiler but I think it's really important for the viewer to concentrate on the right aspect as soon as possible in stead of waiting on something that will never come. It is what it is and it's shockingly suspenseful. The misty hills of Colombia are the perfect place for such an isolated horror flick in which the tensions get so high that you yourself will get desperate and confused. The visual style is creepily dark and unpredictable. Because of the mist it's hard to look any further than a few meters get used to it Americans ahead and that adds up to the 'locked up' feeling the soldiers must have. They can't go anywhere and have to deal with their fears and disagreements on the spot. When all structure is lost who will come out alive in the end? Total anarchy whooo! A must see if you're not a neurotic adrenaline beast just sit back and get dissolved in this wall of suspense and strong written conversations. It had to be well acted to come across and thankfully they had a great group of unknown yet ambitious guys to form a convincing group of depraving commandos. Two thumbs up for this foreign piece of delicious psychological horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "El Pramo is a tensionfilled horrorthriller from Colombian director Jaime Osorio Marquez.It tells the story of a squad of soldiers who have been sent to investigate a remote fogstricken mountain outpost believed to have been overrun by guerillas.Though once they arrive...there is no one to be found. Only what looks to be the aftermath of a massacre.Eventually they discover a female guerilla holed up behind a wall that is scrawled with spells and covered with magical charms meant to ward off the devil.The squad members can't agree on whether she is a witch or whether she is responsible for whatever atrocity occurred here...but one thing is certain...it has struck a wedge between them.Whatever you think occurs it has the effect of revealing the men for who they truly are. It separates the good from the evil the strong minded from the weak willed and the survivors from the dead.This is exacerbated when the most sadistic fck in the unit is killed after being alone with the woman whom he planned on torturing andor raping. If she was able to kill an entire unit and the man who made them all cower in fear they feel she must be more than just your average guerilla.Now that she's on the lamb pure fear sets in. And what follows is an expert psychological breakdown of the military mindset.Is someone really out there using magic to knock them off onebyone...or is it all in their heads...with themselves being the only ones to blame? A couple clever twists expertly placed keeps you thinking about this and just when you think you've gotten it all figured out forces you to question your assumptions.You really need to have patience and engage in reflection to fully appreciate this film. It is neither an action packed nor gore based horror...as some critics were clearly expecting. It plods along slowly builds tension and forces you to engage with the characters by encouraging you to break each of them down them down psychologically.In the end what made me enjoy this film so much is how it acts as a scathing critique of the military mindset. Going into it I fully expected this to be a promilitary propaganda piece with a horror angle. But it's not. It's completely the opposite. Not only does it act to condemn the war in Colombia in general...but also encourages you to reflect on how dangerous it is to throw ordinary people with all their psychological misgivings and limitations into such situations. It's an atrocity waiting to happen.Slow buildup aside I found this to be a relatively engrossing film.6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Accused Loretta Young plays a psychology professor who kills an amorous male student in selfdefense then spends the rest of the movie covering up her crime. William Dieterle does an excellent job with the familiar material and Miss Young gives a sympathetic performance. This is one of several crime pictures that Hal Walls produced in the late forties and early fifties many of which fall into the noir category. Most of these films concern people with conflicted or tortured sexual urges dysfunctional families inadequate or just barely adequate men with the women often hysterical or scheming. At the time this must have seemed daringly modern and contemporary. Now it just seems quaint a waystation in the breakdown of smalltown American values with the action taking place in a netherworld between Andy Hardy and Tennessee Williams. The movie is surprisingly sympathetic toward Miss Young who though on the cusp of middle age still looks pretty damn beautiful. Robert Cummings is stronger than usual as her suitor while Wendell Corey is his inscrutably pokerfaced self as always hinting between the lines that had his character been better written he'd be more than up to the task. If this was so I believe him. In a smaller role Sam Jaffe is positively mephistopholean delivering his lines as tartly as Corey and in his lab scenes photographed to resemble a Dwight Frye hunchback from the thirties. A nice touch. The Accused is filled with nice touches as Dieterle and most of his cast are much better than the script breathing real life into it at times which makes watching the movie a pleasure. There are no real surprises here but lots of good scenes.".

Especially well handled are the opening sequence of Young fleeing the crime scene a boxing match where she suffers a flashback and the ghoulish reconstructions of the murder by forensic pathologist Sam Jaffe.But a glaring structural flaw keeps The Accused lukewarm.  We know from the outset that Young acted in selfdefense which pretty well leeches all the suspense out of Corey's implacable pursuit the tightening case against her packs no impact because it's safe to assume she won't be spending any time with those harpies from Caged.  Consequently the film focuses more on her emergence from a cocoon of droopy skirts a bun in her hair sleeping pills and swooning spells into a seductive butterfly flitting into Cummings' net.Dick as the young narcissist calls to mind such amoral charmers as Robert Walker in Strangers On A Train and John Dall in Rope a film in which Dick also appeared.

Corey charges her and presents his case but knows it is going nowhere with a jury.The film is good looking but somewhat lacking in the suspense area. The basic story has worn rather thin since 1949.

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually a love story and as is usually the case with noirs of the 40s a very well written one especially since it deals with some rather tricky psychological matters of which guilt complex resulting in fear approaching the borders of possible schizophrenia is just one. What makes this film more than average of classy noirs of the 40s with a romantic and seriously psychological intrigue is the interesting peripatetic moment of the boxing match when Loretta Young unintentionally gives herself away and how very interestingly Robert Cummings as her lawyer and lover reacts to that. The acting is superb throughout the story is credible and convincing the dilemma of unintentionally having killed someone and the natural urge to avoid the consequences and take responsibility for what was not intended anyone can understand and relate to. To all this comes Victor Young's endearing score fashioning the experience with a golden frame the beauty of which increases all the time. In brief this is a much underrated unjustly forgotten and deeply human and interesting film that deserves some intention after having been more or less buried alive since 50 years.".

This puts a devilish kink to proceedings as Lieutenant Ted Dorgan Corey is pretty sure he knows what really happened an inquest had previously ruled the death as an accident caused whilst diving.Further spice comes with the knowledge that Dorgan also has the hots for Wilma thus this puts Wilma in a whirlpool of fear and fret conscience battering and the amorous attentions of two male suitors both of whom are intricately bound to the investigation.

But the film is Miss Young's and her legion of fans will not be disappointed  plus she's beautiful as always. I have to think this was released as an 'A' picture as they hired Victor Young to write the music  it doesn't get any better than that.This movie really is worth watching but don't go out of your way  unless you're a Loretta Young fan.".

Sam Jaffe Dr. Romley at times reminded me of a 'detective version' of 'Doctor Kildare' or even a lab coated version of 'Columbo' with the way he went about doing his 'job'. As for Douglas Dick Bill Perry what can you say about character who thinks he's the 'cats meow' is slicker than a bottle of 'Brylcreem' feels that all women are fascinated by him but refuses to take 'NO' for an answer? Don't you just love how some of these pretty boys end up?

Nonetheless the number of closeups leaves no doubt who the star is. My money however is on the rather exotic Wendell Corey Det. Grogan. He's such an icy presence it's hard to keep your eyes off him.

U.K. release March 1949. Australian release 16 June 1949. Sydney release at the Victory 27 May 1949. 9243 feet. 103 minutes.COMMENT No producer in 1940's Hollywood guided such a formidable collection of permanent classics as Hal B. Wallis All This and Heaven Too The Sea Hawk The Letter The Sea Wolf Sergeant York The Maltese Falcon High Sierra The Strawberry Blonde King's Row The Man Who Came to Dinner Yankee Doodle Dandy Now Voyager Casablanca Watch on the Rhine Saratoga Trunk Sorry Wrong NumberOne of Wallis's talents was the ability to select the right director for the script  and then to get the most out of him! The Accused while it is not one of his major films is an excellent example of this technique.Ketti Frings at this stage was a writer with primarily a radio and stage background though she had written the 1940 novel Hold Back the Dawn. This training shows in her screenplay for The Accused. If you close your eyes you can follow the story perfectly well for it's written like a radio serial  very skillfully written with essential facts put over with power and subtlety but it's purely verbal. The script has been wholly conceived in aural terms rather than visual.With such a scenario on his hands what does a producer do? 99 would call in another writer  but not Hal Wallis. He assigns the script to a director with a noted visual flair  William Dieterle  who has given the film such a wonderful sheen and style aided by atmospheric photography and deft film editing. Notice how deep focus framings are inventively utilized for maximum dramatic impact how the lighting appropriately changes from the chilling murky gray of the flashback sequences to the contrasting brightness of the campus episodes how long takes are adroitly intercut with reaction shots. The director builds up what is essentially a synthetic Loretta Young vehicle into a psychological thriller of considerable suspense and class. Admittedly too much footage is still taken up with the familiar Young heartburnings and hysteria she even has a pervading off camera commentary as well but many of the sequences particularly those with Sam Jaffe and Wendell Corey deliver a taut tense powerful impact.While the conclusion is somewhat abrupt and predictable it's a movie that moves all the way thanks to Dieterle's frequent changes of set scene and camera setups and his skilled use of tracking shots and similar fluid camera movements.For all its aural orientation the dialogue has a realistic edge to it which fine actors like Wendell Corey know how to deliver with the right amount of intensity. Corey has a tailormade part and receives excellent support from character players like Sam Jaffe Sara Allgood Bill Mauch one of the Mauch twins from The Prince and the Pauper Francis Pierlot Al Ferguson Charles Williams and Henry Travers yes Henry Travers making a surprise unbilled appearance as Jaffe's assistant.Wallis has dressed The Accused in great production values including sets locations and a vast crowd of extra players among whom Bess Flowers can be spotted as a wardress at court. She even has one word of dialogue  Sure.I wasn't very happy with Wallis Dieterle told Tom Flinn. He used me to try to make something out of very secondrate material. This movie is an intriguing example of that fascinating and entertaining something.".

U.K. release March 1949. Australian release 16 June 1949. Sydney release at the Victory 27 May 1949. 9243 feet. 103 minutes.COMMENT No producer in 1940's Hollywood guided such a formidable collection of permanent classics as Hal B. Wallis All This and Heaven Too The Sea Hawk The Letter The Sea Wolf Sergeant York The Maltese Falcon High Sierra The Strawberry Blonde King's Row The Man Who Came to Dinner Yankee Doodle Dandy Now Voyager Casablanca Watch on the Rhine Saratoga Trunk Sorry Wrong NumberOne of Wallis's talents was the ability to select the right director for the script  and then to get the most out of him! The Accused while it is not one of his major films is an excellent example of this technique.Ketti Frings at this stage was a writer with primarily a radio and stage background though she had written the 1940 novel Hold Back the Dawn. This training shows in her screenplay for The Accused. If you close your eyes you can follow the story perfectly well for it's written like a radio serial  very skillfully written with essential facts put over with power and subtlety but it's purely verbal. The script has been wholly conceived in aural terms rather than visual.With such a scenario on his hands what does a producer do? 99 would call in another writer  but not Hal Wallis. He assigns the script to a director with a noted visual flair  William Dieterle  who has given the film such a wonderful sheen and style aided by atmospheric photography and deft film editing. Notice how deep focus framings are inventively utilized for maximum dramatic impact how the lighting appropriately changes from the chilling murky gray of the flashback sequences to the contrasting brightness of the campus episodes how long takes are adroitly intercut with reaction shots.

	schema:reviewBody "Pukar aka The Call is a movie about how a soldier Jaidev played by Anil Kapoor raises to the occasion whenever his nation calls irrespective of his personal issues. What makes Pukar interesting is that inside the story there is also a different kind of pukar the call from a dear one Anjali played by Madhuri Dixit who truly loves him but he does not feel or see or responds to her love. Rajkumar Santhoshi blends these two pukars very nicely with right amount of emotion beautiful visuals stunts and entertains us for about 3hrs.Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit have given first rate commendable performances. The chemistry between them is not like their earlier youthful movies Tezaab Ram Lakhan etc. it is more restrained mature and appealing. Definitely it is one of the best of AnilMadhuri combination. It could have been little better if Anil Kapoor looked a bit younger. Though Om Puri as Colonel Hussein and Rohini Hatangadi as Mrs. Mallappa have little screen presence they have played their role very well. Rest of the acting crew has supported well. I felt Girish Karnad an actor of high calibre has been wasted in this movie.A. R. Rahman's music is OK. The songs are hummable especially Kay Sera Sera and Sunta Hai Mera Khuda but the background score does not leave any lasting impression. The choreography of the song Kay Sera Sera.. is commendable. The visuals and locations are beautiful. Rajkumar Santhoshi's direction is crisp and good but it is not in the league of his previous best movies Ghayal and Damini. The story remains on its track all the time there are no subplots and unlike usual bollywood movies does not digresses into unnecessary petty comedies emotions and remarks about any particular country or organization.The main weak point of the movie is that the story is not air tight 1. The way the commando operation is carried out to save the minister shows that the army already knew Abhrush's hide out and so they could have done it well before. 2. Anjali as daughter of an army personnel should have known the meaning or consequence of leaking confidential information. 3. Army intelligence work is downplayed. Logically when Om Puri is killed in such a big terrorist attack there should have been an inquiry and that would have lead to the cancellation of the independence day function due to security risk.Inspite of these flaws Santhoshi's direction and dialogues keep the attention of the viewer till the end. The first half of the movie is fast paced but the pace weakens in the second half. If you want to watch a quality commercial movie with good acting visuals and dialogues then I would recommend it.".

Om Puri and the rest of the supporting cast made this a film to be watched time and again. The action plot music scenery and direction helped to make this a great film.

Good story of oppression tyranny and rebellion natural acting and even a few shots of nudity which I would never expect to see in an Arab film. Aicha Radia and their strict mother live removed from the world in the servant's quarters of a deserted house. Aicha a teen who is discovering her femininity has never been schooled nor underwent any form of socialization other than the satisfaction of her basic needs like food and shelter. Her controlled visits to the outside are enough to trigger curiosity but the ruling hand of the mother is stronger. Due to her lack of social behavior and skill Aicha seems a little mentally challenged unlike her sister Radia who had her share with the outside in the past and seems more acceptant to their retreat that seems to hide some very dark and painful secrets. Their obscure existence is shaken when a young modern couple moves into the main house. A bizarre cohabitation settles between the couple and the three women who decide not to make their presence known to these undesirable neighbours but Aicha becomes enthralled by their way of life putting her own family at risk. Their hideout is eventually discovered by the girl who was then taken prisoner so while having to live together she uncovers some family secrets which led to a violent ending. The final scene is nothing but a masterpiece!Raja Amari examines what it is to have secrets and to what lengths a family will go to keep them. She visualized what oppression and abuse can lead to and how violent the human being's urge for dignity and freedom can be. Alsothe film addressed an extremely important issue in Arab or any other society and that is the clash between the two worlds  the world of modern women and the ones closed in themselves under multiple pretexts and sometimes even against their own will. I'm off to try to find Amari's debut work 'Red Satin' that also explores the struggle of a woman torn between modernity and tradition.".

I think the computer artist was trying to create something out of 1001 Arabian Nights. It resembled nothing remotely Tunisian I ever saw the and I lived there 5 years. The palm trees look like coconut not the date palms of N. Africa. The interior looks like a 20s Hollywood horror mansion. Why didn't they hire a Tunisian to do these computer graphics? All they got right were the olive groves.These 3 women imprison the female who visits the mansion with her boyfriend...eventually killing her and burying her at the end. The young girl then smoothers her grandmother?sister's mother and carves up her half sistermother with a razor blade. Then walks down the streets of Tunis in a blood soaked nightgown with a prominent menstrual blood spot along with her sisters blood.Being brutally honest this is why I avoid movies written or directed by women. They often seem to get carried away with gratuitous graphic sexuality and corporeal realism issues that are totally unnecessary.The story had potential but not the way this was done plus it is kind of old hat...hidden incest etc... I watched it because I lived in Tunis but you get about 2 minutes of real street scenes and an hour and half of inaccurate fantasy digital backdrops in this femlib realism tour de force.DO NOT RECOMMEND".

'Permanent Midnight' is one of the best movies he has been involved with and features what is arguably his single finest performance. Based on the autobiography of TV hack writer Jerry Stahl this is a smart fresh and blackly humorous look at addiction and Hollywood. Stiller has a fine supporting cast here especially his buddies and frequent costars Owen Wilson 'Bottle Rocket' and Janeane Garofolo 'Reality Bites' the amazingly charismatic starinthemaking Peter Greene 'Laws Of Gravity' and comedy veteran Fred Willard 'Best In Show' who all have small but memorable roles. Hell even Liz Hurley and Cheryl Ladd are good in this believe it or not. 'Permanent Midnight' was like so many other good movies that don't pander to a mass audience a box office flop but will hopefully find a larger audience in years to come via video and DVD. I think it is one of the most underrated movies of the last ten years and highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me apologize for the easy joke in the one line summary. It was simply too easy to pass up. And sometimes writers fall back on easy cliches especially in headlines.Actually make that especially in headlines and in movies about substance abuse. Simply put Permanent Midnight fails. And it doesn't fail because of the direction or the writing or the performances thought there are certainly serious flaws with each but because it doesn't have anything new to the discussion. Permanent Midnight on one hand is about the depths to which drugs can drive a man but it's also about the superficiality of Hollywood. The problem is that neither angle has anything remotely original in it and so barring something remarkable in the execution there's really no point in making the movie. Permanent Midnight though features many good things but nothing remarkable enough to justify the been there done that feeling that remains when the narrative is finished.Permanent Midnight features a framing story that feels made up. Since I haven't read Jerry Stahl's book of the same name I cannot speak to the truth of the framing sequences which feature Maria Bello as an exdrug addict named Kitty. I can only say how painfully convenient it is for recovering Jerry Ben Stiller to have this blond angel more than willing to hear his story of degradation. Not a moment between Jerry and Kitty rings true emotionally but at least it gives writerdirector David Veloz and entre into the story not that the story actually goes anywhere. You see when Jerry arrives in LA he's already a junkie living with his friend Nickie Owen Wilson who's also already a junkie. He marries a British TV producer so that she can get her green card and she helps him get a television writing job. As shown in the film there's nothing about his life that leads the the progression of his drug addiction. He just gets deeper and deeper and befriends shadier and shadier characters.There's an arbitrary point at which he obviously decided to quit since he's clean in the frame story but by the time we get there it seems so obvious and so unsatisfying as to make the journey feel wasted. No matter how bad things seems to get the audience knows it could always be worse because we've seen worse drug addictions in a dozen movies of varying qualities. Throughout the flashback Jerry makes no real attempts at recovery and yet only falls to a certain level. He never makes it to hell. Nothing in the film has a payoff.Much of the problem then is in Veloz's episodic screenplay. Characters wander in and out and nothing really comes together. Jerry seems strungout but he never seems horrible so we can't really pity the people who trust him and love him because he doesn't really do any serious damage to them. Everything just comes and goes. The film is filled with tiny star cameos which meet with only occasional success. Owen Wilson and Janeane Garofalo are always good to have around as is the perpetually psychotic Peter Greene. Cheryl Ladd Fred Willard Andy Dick and Connie Nielsen though provide uninteresting one shot encounters.Veloz perhaps wisely avoids drug movie hallucination clichs. Aware that he lacks the visual sensibility to rival Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Trainspotting he restricts his flourishes to a single drug nightmare and to boring New Wavey jump cuts and the like. Veloz clearly sets the film up as Ben Stiller's show.As Jerry Stahl Stiller is never less than solid. He makes it clear why people would continue to trust Jerry even with all of his problems. The script however gives no indication of the genius that everybody attributed to Stahl making it difficult to feel that the character is wasting his talent. Stiller then is fleetingly amusing fleetingly harrowing and always acting. When the character in a moment of true desperation turns to his neck for an uncollapsed vein it's Ben Stiller shooting up into his neck not the character. It's tough to watch but you feel for an actor on the edge rather than a character. So people in Hollywood are so selfabsorbed that they don't notice what's going on around them. OK. I've seen that before.  And amidst all that egomania people with problems are allowed to fall through the cracks. And I've seen that before. And recovery is possible? In a onedayatatime way? I've seen that before as well. I kept waiting for Permanent Midnight to offer me something new and different. But it was only more of the same. There's enough good there for a 510.".

	schema:headline " Probably the most inaccurate depiction of a heroin addiction ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was recommended this film by a friend and after going through it and reviewing each particular scene...I'm not so sure that the actors or directors have done their research properly. This is a pretty poor depiction of heroin addiction and withdrawal.Right when he uses in the first scene he appears to have the symptoms of using meth. He's anxious he's looking around nervously etc. Not once did he fall out of consciousness or nod off. These are the symptoms of methamphetamine usage. During another scene his bedside companion uses a substance on a vein in her inner thigh and immediately starts going into an orgasm. Also a symptom of a methamphetamine induced methgasm.During the scenes that he's using he consistently goes into sweats and even one time at a party enters some kind of psychosis where he's hallucinating. Sweats occur during the withdrawal stage of addiction and hallucination does not ever occur unless mixed with another upper of some kind. Is he really using heroin? Until he starts using crack cocaine which can actually induce these symptoms that are depicted each frame of mind that is displayed is the polar opposite of opiateabuse.Heroin induces involuntary dreaming even happening midconversation where a user will nodoff in the middle of it. The case of not having opiates in your bloodstream will actually give you flulike symptoms. Instead this film depicts the flulike symptoms occurring during the time of the main character's usage of the substance which is terribly inaccurate.Movies that depict opiate addiction and withdrawal accurately would be something such as BlackBird Jesus' Son or The Panic in Needle Park. This film unfortunately falls incredibly short of these other films in terms of accuracy. Other than these inaccuracies the film is a fairly generic story of an addict losing control of his life. I probably wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.".

This is a pretty poor depiction of heroin addiction and withdrawal.Right when he uses in the first scene he appears to have the symptoms of using meth. He's anxious he's looking around nervously etc. Not once did he fall out of consciousness or nod off. These are the symptoms of methamphetamine usage. During another scene his bedside companion uses a substance on a vein in her inner thigh and immediately starts going into an orgasm. Also a symptom of a methamphetamine induced methgasm.During the scenes that he's using he consistently goes into sweats and even one time at a party enters some kind of psychosis where he's hallucinating. Sweats occur during the withdrawal stage of addiction and hallucination does not ever occur unless mixed with another upper of some kind. Is he really using heroin? Until he starts using crack cocaine which can actually induce these symptoms that are depicted each frame of mind that is displayed is the polar opposite of opiateabuse.Heroin induces involuntary dreaming even happening midconversation where a user will nodoff in the middle of it. The case of not having opiates in your bloodstream will actually give you flulike symptoms. Instead this film depicts the flulike symptoms occurring during the time of the main character's usage of the substance which is terribly inaccurate.Movies that depict opiate addiction and withdrawal accurately would be something such as BlackBird Jesus' Son or The Panic in Needle Park. This film unfortunately falls incredibly short of these other films in terms of accuracy. Other than these inaccuracies the film is a fairly generic story of an addict losing control of his life. I probably wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.";

David Veloz let a brilliant and emotional performance and autobiography do way less than it should've. Throughout the film Stiller's performance gets more and more intense but the direction goes nowhere. The cinematography is flat and the editing is dull and inconsistent. It's a classic case of an actor being more involved in a film than his director. Would i recommend this movie? If you like Stiller you need to see it but just keep in mind that once the end credits roll and a song by none other than Everclear wraps up what's a nice little emotional ending it's time to press mute and put on ANY OTHER BAND. I'll tell ya there's nothing quite like the belting emotional vocal stylings of Art Alexakis to ruin a nice little film about heroin addiction. Yeahah! Nooh!

This is not a very entertaining film but it is gripping simply for the realization that some people actually try to navigate their lives that way. During this period the real Jerry Stahl was writing for popular 1980s series like Moonlighting Alph and Northern Exposure. Anyway during his addiction phase Stahl represents himself as a person with little selfcontrol lying needing drugs to get through any stressful situation.

	schema:reviewBody "If I were in emotional distress I would want someone like Paul Douglas to try to help me out. He was one of the best actors in Hollywood during his tooshirt career. Here he is superb as a compassionate traffic cop.Richard Basehart plays a man threatening to jump from the ledge on a high floor of a hotel. Basehart was another of the best actors of the late 1940 and the fifties. He pulls off an almost totally stationary role very well. This is particularly intriguing given his vibrant physical performance in La Strada a few years after this.I had never heard of Fourteen Hours till it appeared at my neighborhood video store yesterday. Now it is one of my top noirs. And that is saying a great deal.Agnes Moorehead another superb performer of the period plays Basehart's mother. She engages in the same sorts of hysterics that are so memorable in Citizen Kane and particularly in The Magnificent Ambersons. It's a very fine performance. What a shame that to the degree that she is known at all today she is primarily known for her admittedly mildly amusing role in the Bewitched series! Robert Keith is just the kind of father in this role who might have a confused possibility suicidal son. Here he plays a mousy businessman. Two decades later he was to be memorable in a totally different kind of role in Don Siegel's The Lineup! Debra Paget is very appealing in a very small role that gets her fourth billing. Jeffrey Hunter is likable as the man in the crowd outside the hotel who falls for her.This was Grace Kelly's first film role. She looks gorgeous and seems very poised. Her store that of an onlooker on her way to divorcing her husband is extraneous. Yes it sets up a different kind of relationship to others and to the world from what the Basehart character has. But it is far from integral.Barbara Bel Geddes is very likable as the girl who loves Basehart. She has a small but very significant role.The movie is very sad. In a way it is as if Tennessee Williams had written a very fine script for a thriller. We like many of the characters and are put off by others. But we're deeply moved by what goes on.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been perhaps 15 years since I have seen this picture and despite the strong and competent cast of Hollywood favorites it's Paul Douglas who carries this film on the strength of the sincerity and warmth he brings to his character.Paul Douglas was 42 years old entering middle age before he made his first film of any consequence in 1949.He came from a long career in radio as a very popular announcer at CBS in the 1930s and 1940s who was often the man at the mic for the Glenn Miller show for Chesterfield cigarettes. With Judy Holliday he scored a major Broadway success in BORN YESTERDAY though the film role went to Broderick Crawford. He was signed to a contract by 2oth CenturyFox and spent most of the next ten years successfully appearing in dramas comedies fantasies and even some science fiction before passing away prematurely in 1959.FOURTEEN HOURS is typical of the appeal he brought to his many films. It's based upon a true incident though the film is opened up for the sake of the large and screenworthy cast.Paul Douglas is a NYC cop pounding a beat who gets the call of a jumper on the 14th floor ledge of a downtown building. Once the experts appear Douglas is sent back on the beat but turns out the potential jumper doesn't want to talk to them. He wants to talk 'to that cop who was here before'. They find him bring him back and the story continues from there.It's not a faultless film but that doesn't matter. It's a great period piece and a showcase for Douglas.Excellent direction and camera work including location shooting in a NYC long vanished.I recommend it without reservation.And cheers for Paul Douglas who has never gotten the acclaim he deserves.".

	schema:headline " Suspense  Despair On The Ledge";
	schema:reviewBody "Fourteen Hours is a low budget offering with a simple plot and a relatively short running time but it's also an incredibly gripping drama about a disturbed young man who threatens to commit suicide by jumping off a skyscraper window ledge.The story's based on the real life incident which involved John Wilson Warde who on 26 July 1938 leapt to his death from one of the highest window ledges of the Hotel Gotham in New York City. Director Henry Hathaway filmed the action in a style which was very realistic and made good use of some strikingly effective camera angles. His approach was also one which avoided any tasteless sensationalism or sentimentality.Shortly after delivering breakfast to a hotel guest a service waiter suddenly realises that the young man has stepped out onto the ledge outside of his room and is threatening to jump. The waiter reports what's happened to the hotel manager and at the same time traffic cop Charlie Dunnigan Paul Douglas who is working on the street below alerts his colleagues to what's going on before swiftly going up to the would be jumper's room. There Dunnigan poses as another hotel guest and starts a conversation with the troubled Robert Cosick Richard Basehart who despite Dunnigan's encouragement refuses to step back into his room.Soon the police newspaper reporters and a couple of psychiatrists arrive Dunnigan is ordered back to his traffic duty and outside a large crowd gathers and radio and television crews quickly set up their equipment. The psychiatrists discover that Robert is unwilling to speak to anyone but Dunnigan and so he's duly called back to the scene by Deputy Chief Moksar Howard Da Silva.The police locate the young man's divorced parents but Robert only becomes more upset by the arrival of the hysterical Mrs Cosick Agnes Moorehead and also fails to communicate properly with his father Robert Keith from whom he's been estranged for many years. Next Robert's exfiance Virginia Barbara Bel Geddes is brought to the hotel but her intervention ultimately proves to be just as ineffective as that of his parents. Robert's predicament is eventually resolved but in a most unexpected way.In Fourteen Hours the despair of a solitary man on the ledge provides a stark contrast to the frantic activity of the large number of people in his hotel room. Similarly this man's lonely and desperate life or death situation is seen as insignificant in a large city where the onlookers who watch him simply regard the whole incident as a gross inconvenience and even take bets on what time he'll jump.The story's subplots which involve a couple meeting in the crowd and falling in love and a woman changing her mind about proceeding with her planned divorce also emphasise how the lives of the city and its people drive relentlessly on because one person's crisis is totally insignificant in this kind of environment.Robert Cosick is a man with a history of mental problems and his instability at the time of his crisis on the ledge is explained as being caused by the inadequacies of his parents and the way he was treated by them.This movie has a cast who turn in some good performances but it's the contributions of Basehart and Douglas which really stand out. Basehart looks genuinely tormented and anxious and it's understandable that the strongest bond that he forms is with a man who has the type of qualities which would normally be associated with those of a conventional good natured father figure. Douglas is also excellent as the kindly and modest man who puts his sound personal qualities to good use in what for him is a very challenging situation.".

I disagree with comments that some situations and characters were clichd many major cities did have beefy IrishAmerican beat cops in the early 50s and so Paul Douglas' character is perfectly acceptable. Likewise the 'good ending' is not necessarily traditional after all the rescue attempt would have been in progress for hours and the police were pulling out all stops. The odd thing is that although the film is available on DVD it remains relatively unknown even among connoisseurs of Film Noir.".

Richard Basehart plays a man on the edge who decides to try and end it all perched on the ledge of a Manhattan hotel. The first on the scene is traffic cop Paul Douglas who does his best to try and befriend comfort and hopefully coax the unbalanced man back inside. The performances are all pretty good though some of the dialogue rings a bit hokey at times. I believe this was also Grace Kelly's first film role. Director Henry Hathaway does a pretty good job of wringing out the drama and suspense and gives the film a nice big city feel using some pretty impressive sets in the foreground and background. All in all a pretty enjoyable film that I wouldn't mind picking up on DVD though I don't believe it is currently available.".

Good thing that the producers also come up with one of the best young actors of the time Basehart who acts just foggy enough to teeter on a ledge and play Hamlet. Then there's that genial roughneck Paul Douglas as the cop who tries to persuade him that it's really better to be than nottobe.Note how ace studio director Hathaway keeps the hotel room bustling so that the static ledge shots don't become boring. Also note how TV is competing with radio coverage at a time when the tube was just beginning to take off. Then there're the subplots that take the pulse of the city. The cynical cabbies do offer comic relief. But frankly I could have done without the young lovers Paget and Hunter who appear better suited to a Pepsi commercial or the Grace Kelly soap opera that comes across as trite and unimaginative. But I guess the producers figured a variety of relief was needed. Also I can see from the closeups why Hitchcock liked Barbara Bel Geddes Virginia. She pulls off the really difficult task of being sweetly wholesome without drowning the part in sugar.All in all there's enough skill and craftsmanship in this TCF production to keep even digital age audiences on the edge of their seat.".

Paul Douglas is police officer Charlie Dunnigan who discovers the man and tries to talk him into coming off the ledge. The drama and setting are enhanced by the massive crowd of onlookers who are attracted by the great media circus playing out. Douglas is supposed to be an older man but in fact was only seven years older than Baseheart who at 37 played the role of a younger man. Douglas was a highlycompetent supporting actor from the fifties who would have gone on to greater roles except for his death in 1959 at age 52. Other supporting actors are Agnes Moorehead as Mrs. Cosick the mother Robert Keith the father Grace Kelly Jeffrey Hunter Martin Gable Barbara Bel Geddes the girlfriend and others. Baseheart was something of a Hollywood idol in his day and died after completing the narration for the opening ceremonies of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984.The story captures the skyline of New York its people and media as the drama gives an air of immediacy to the suspense of whether or not the man will jump from the building. There are a number of close calls as various characters try to persuade the young man to come in off the ledge. It is Saint Patrick's Day and people have gathered in the streets for the parade but find themselves watching the disturbed character high above them. Day becomes night and one couple fall in love during the viewing of the ordeal. We learn about the boy's history his upbringing the parents and the girlfriend. The media show presents the young man as a sympathetic character with crowds warning him about the police as they move towards him overhead and women calling radio stations with proposals of marriage...a slice of New York at midcentury. The movie is still great entertainment today if not quite up to the calibre of the movie The Naked City made three years earlier.".

It's professionally handled by Henry Hathaway a director who probably had little sympathy for a temperamentally unstable fellow who couldn't handle his hysterical and selfindulgent Mamma Agnes Moorehead.The goods are delivered. Most of the work is done by Richard Basehart as the wouldbe suicide and Paul Douglas as the traffic cop who befriends him and alternately wheedles and lambastes him.Movies mavens will be left agog after they see the list of supporting and bit players many uncredited who were to go on to climb to dazzling heights in Hollywood either as stars or as indispensable supports  Grace Kelly Jeffrey Hunter Jeff Corey Brian Keith Richard Beymer and John Cassavetes among them.The movie doesn't wallow in easy sentiment. It's pretty toughminded. But a modern treatment if it had any pretense to realism would be far more cynical. The only characters here who exploit Basehart's impending self destruction are a nutty preacher who naturally belongs to no recognized church a cabbie who organizes a pool to bet on when Basehart jumps and of course the press. But nobody in the streets complains that a weakling like Basehart who is probably a sissy just out for attention deserves to die. And if any of the bystanders jumps up and down yelling Jump! Jump! it must have been while I was in a period of microsleep. In 1951 it's my impression Americans in general weren't so anxious to see a sensational splash on Broadway not even New Yorkers.Worth catching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The DVD contains some interesting commentary by film noir expert Foster Hirsch. His basic thesis is that what 14 Hours is really about is a crisis over masculinity. Hirsch argues that the subtext of the film is that the Richard Basehart character Robert Cosick is gay but in 1951 Hollywood was not permitted to deal with such gay themes explicitly. Hirsch makes some good points particularly in his description of Charlie Dunnigan the downtoearth cop convincingly played by Paul Douglas who is set up as a welladjusted family man in contrast to the tormented Cosick.14 Hours works on two levels. The primary level is the attempt by Dunnigan to get Cosick off the ledge and prevent him from killing himself. It's interesting that it's immediately apparent that Dunnigan has established a rapport with Cosick but the higherups represented by the Police Captain played by Howard DaSilva sends Dunnigan back to the street. Only once the two 'professionals' the psychologists are brought to the scene and realize that Cosick will only speak to Dunnigan that the brass have to eat crow and bring their 'inferior' back up to negotiate.If the whole movie was just Dunnigan trying to sway Cosick things would get pretty boring after awhile. But Screenwriter John Paxton mixes things up nicely by bringing in the three family members who try and coax the errant sonhusband back to reality. Agnes Moorehead probably has the most interesting part in the movie as Cosick's semidemented mother who just can't cut the strings. Then there's the passive alcoholic father played by Robert Keith the real life father of well known actor Brian Keith who comes off as much more genuine than the spotlightgrabbing mother. Barbara Bel Geddes has the thankless role of being the good 'wife' who deep down knows she'll never have a sexual relationship with her husband ever again. There are other characters that add to the film's verisimilitude high above street level the slew of cops who are continually trying to physically remove Cosick from his perch as well as the obsessed preacher the 'man of God' who sabotages the rescue plan almost culminating in disaster!The second level takes place 'below' the main action. On the street level we're introduced to a group of 'everyman' characters. One of them is Mrs. Fuller in Grace Kelly's first screen role. She's on her way up to her attorney to finalize divorce proceedings. Then there's the downtoearth 'Ruth' played by Debra Paget who meets Danny played by Jeffrey Hunter of 'King of Kings fame' in the gathering crowd who are staring up at the great passion play above. There's also a group of taxicab drivers one of them is Ossie Davis in his first screen role who represent the various ethnic types found in NYC. They cynically place bets on the exact time they expect Cosick to jump. Finally there's the mediathe reporters both print and TV journalists who are covering the media event. Suffice it to say the 'media' does not come off very well in this film.14 Hours has a gripping story that moves along at a brisk pace. You'll find out from the DVD commentary that most if was filmed on a Hollywood sound stage but through expert editing the NY scenes were inserted to make it look like the entire film was filmed in New York City. As I mentioned before I agree with Foster Hirsch's central thesis that this is a film about a guy who doesn't trust his masculinity. Some of Hirsch's theories go a little too far especially when he suggests that the Woolworth Building in the background is a phallic symbol. Furthermore I disagree with his view that the film takes a dim view of the psychologist who provides the 'psychological' explanation of Cosick's malady. Quite the contrary psychoanalysis was all the rage at that time especially in the movies so when the explanation is offered that Cosick is suffering from an Oedipal Complex' and all his family members are depicted as contributing to Cosick's neurosis it appears that the filmmakers seem to embrace that line of reasoning.14 Hours loses a bit of its luster with it advocacy of what it believes is 'normal'. While Cosick is saved it's quite obvious that he'll always be 'damaged goods'. But most of the other characters get to live 'happily ever after'. The 'normal' couple go off in the sunset hand in hand presumably to begin a 'normal' 1951 style sexual relationship. Grace Kelly realizes that divorce isn't the answer and even the taxi drivers walk away from the most cynical of their lot. Dunnigan meets up with his son and we get a peek of his doting wife waiting outside the revolving doors at the front of the hotel.14 Hours will never win awards for tolerance of 'alternative lifestyles'. But as a taut gripping little thriller it can be surely termed an 'oldie but goodie'.".

As the film states in the end this happens almost every day people and authorities the police and fire brigade are used to it and know how to handle it which doesn't make it less of a fatally dramatic emergency every time it does happen. Even though the police and firemen are all professionals and know what to do nothing can stop mistakes from being committed and here a tremendous lot of people are involved in them including a preacher vulture journalists a league of doctors bookmakers irresponsible youngsters adding to the mess there are a lot of minor dramas in this film adding it to Henry Hathaway's already fine collection of semidocumentaries among which this is definitely one of the best.

Sellers' Clouseau was a catalyst for the disasters that inevitably befell him he CAUSED most of his own problems without ever realizing it.

	schema:reviewBody "This 1960s film is a real oddity  a Clouseau comedy without director Blake Edwards OR star Peter Sellers. Alan Arkin plays the French sleuth.It starts off well with the usual comic cartoon credits  sans Henry Mancini score however. Clouseau arrives in England by plane as he gets onto terra firma he realises he's in his socks and tries to barge past back onto the plane. There's a good line in some English bigwig's office said bigwig says superciliously I must say it was not my idea to bring you onto this case. You are too modest replies Clouseau oblivious to the insult.But my it goes downhill quick.

	onyx:emotionText "This 1960s film is a real oddity  a Clouseau comedy without director Blake Edwards OR star Peter Sellers. Alan Arkin plays the French sleuth.It starts off well with the usual comic cartoon credits  sans Henry Mancini score however. Clouseau arrives in England by plane as he gets onto terra firma he realises he's in his socks and tries to barge past back onto the plane. There's a good line in some English bigwig's office said bigwig says superciliously I must say it was not my idea to bring you onto this case. You are too modest replies Clouseau oblivious to the insult.But my it goes downhill quick. Arkin who looks like Freddie Mercury and has a bit of Borat about him or maybe the English spy dressed as a policeman in Allo Allo! is proud and bumbling enough but lacks the boldnesss of Seller's portrayal.

Watching him say his lines was an exercise in embarrassment and major cringing. I suppose that diehard PP fans who have nothing better to do can have endless discussions as to who was worse Martin or Arkin. Maybe it'll take another 40 years for someone to attempt to make a PP movie without Sellers. What with the direction Hollywood is heading towards in recent years it'll be someone like David Arquette's son who'll be cast to play the goofy Frenchman...One person here wrote that one should forget about Peter Sellers and watch this movie on its own merits. Maybe heshe can do that probably with some help from hallucinogenic drugs but personally I'd find that a task both impossible and stupid. The fact is that Sellers DID do Panther earlier and was about 1000 times better.Arkin is terminally unfunny with the sight gags but it's the dialogue that really exposes his miscasting there isn't a single line he says that is even remotely funny.In all fairness though the script is garbage. The story has no flow just a bunch of barely connected scenes strung together the gags being rare and rather pathetic. The only thing the movie has going for it are the high production values which make it watchable if nothing else.".

The problem itself is with the script which is unoriginal tedious and not in the least bit funny.

The ones made with leftover footage of Sellers not so good and the ones without Sellers Son Of PP The Ted Wass Curse Of PP the Steve Martin remakestink.Well I am NOT of that opinion. Sure it's nearly impossible to watch ANYONE else pretending to be the good Inspector or a relative. But for me the best Panther films are the first 2 60's gems Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark. Once Blake Edwards resurrected the series in 1975 with Return and Strikes Again the films got more and more silly and preposterous. I mean Clouseau' boss Dreyfus in an insane asylum or as the Phantom Of the Opera ruined the films for me long before most fans cried foul. The thing I loved about the original 2 films were that silly as they were they were within the realm of possibility. That wasn't the case after The Return of The Pink Panther which I recall actually seeing in the movies on it's original release.Perhaps that's why i'm much more forgiving of films like Curse Of The PP the Ted Wass vehicle because they didn't get as far out as the 1970's entries in the series with Sellers.After finally catching the much maligned Inspector Clousea I have to say although missing Sellers all the same this is actually my 3rd favorite entry in the series right after the original two and much better than the Steve Martin remake.Of course one of the things for me that adds to it is the entire 60's vibeI feel this is simply the most enjoyable time period to place this type of farce in. There's allot of 60'sisms that just fit in with this type of comedy. There's a reason Austin Powers tapped into the 60's thing for much of it's humor.Arkin doesn't imitate Sellers unlike Steve Martin and plays Clousea a bit understated but for me it works much betteragain as one tries to image these things happening within the realm of real life. It's just too bad we don't have Herbert Lom as Dreyfus or a Henry Mancini music score though there really is nothing wrong with the movies score at all as it is.At this point in my life i've see the original Panther and Shot In The Dark multiple times but Inspector Clousea only twice making it my very favorite Panther movie to pull off the shelf and watch on my DVD burned from a cable TV showing of the flick.Go into it with an open mind especially those who somehow may not know the other movies in the series very well and you could easily enjoy this very much..Far from a failure in my book..".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people dismiss this stance in the Pink Panther canon simply because it does not feature the great Peter Sellers in the titular role of Inspector Clouseau. Unfortunately there's a whole bunch of other reasons this movie is simply bad.First of all the story is silly naive full of holes and outrageous plot devices and it generally feels as if it was written by a six year old after watching the first two Pink Panther films. I understand that this is supposed to be a comedy and also that the Peter Sellers Pink Panther films are not IQ bending mysteries either but I honestly can not believe that the writers thought the audience would buy this.The acting in general is on a school play level with a good actor such as Alan Arkin failing miserably somewhere in between the attempts to copy Peter Sellers and to develop a character on his own. The expression wooden acting applies here literally  Arkin's screen appearance seems as if he was in fact made of wood or forgot a coat hanger in his jacket and although somewhat stiff motion was one of the signature traits of Sellers' Clouseau it simply does not suit a ten years younger and much more physical Arkin here. However Arkin does manage to extort a few chuckles here and there but mostly so just by being laughably unconvincing in a role tailormade for another actor.All in all it's a sad attempt at comedy at if this film was made in its own right instead of being made part of a hugely successful and memorable series it would have been completely forgotten by today. Which considering Alan Arkin's otherwise fruitful career would have probably been for the best.210".

However Arkin does manage to extort a few chuckles here and there but mostly so just by being laughably unconvincing in a role tailormade for another actor.All in all it's a sad attempt at comedy at if this film was made in its own right instead of being made part of a hugely successful and memorable series it would have been completely forgotten by today. Which considering Alan Arkin's otherwise fruitful career would have probably been for the best.210";

But when negotiations with Peter Sellers broke down they unwisely tried to make it without him.'Inspector Clouseau'  1968  was doomed from the onset despite good work from the talented Alan Arkin. To be fair he makes no effort to duplicate Sellers' mannerisms. His 'Clouseau' is childlike as opposed to bumbling. Note his panic when he thinks his plum pudding's been sabotaged! Sellers would never have done that.After animated titles courtesy of DePatieFreleng  accompanied by a jaunty Ken Thorne tune  the film proper starts with Clouseau arriving at New Scotland Yard to help discover what became of the money stolen in the Great Train Robbery.

Mastermind 'Clyde Hargreaves'  Clive Francis  the son of a warder at Wormwood Scrubs is known to the underworld as 'Johnnie Rainbow' and intends robbing the banks of Switzerland using doubles of Clouseau to get past security.Bud Yorkin the director later made 'Start The Revolution Without Me'  1970  and 'Arthur 2 On The Rocks'  1988 .

The strong supporting cast includes Frank Finlay Barry Foster Tutte Lemkow  who was one of the cossack dancers in 'A Shot In The Dark'  the everwatchable Beryl Reid Geoffrey Bayldon and Anthony Ainley with Delia Boccardo providing romantic interest. With its international heist plot gadgets and gorgeous girls 'Inspector Clouseau' looks more like a Bond spoof.

	schema:reviewBody "The three necessities for a good Pink Panther film are 1 Peter Sellers as Clouseau 2 Blake Edwards as Director 3 Henry Mancini as the writer of the music.Inspector Clouseau contains none of these.The music is the best of the three. Obviously Inspector Clouseau does not have the Pink Panther Theme but neither does arguably the most satisfying SellersEdwards Clouseau collaboration A Shot in the Dark. A Shot in the Dark does have a great Mancini score especially its opening song. The music here is not Mancini but it is workmanlike enough and in the long run it's satisfactory. It lacks the Mancini magic but it will do.The AWOL Sellers is a more serious problem.I have not seen the Clouseau reset films with Steve Martin but Inspector Clouseau seems to suggest that the good Inspector is not a James Bond into whom any suitable actor may be plugged. James Bond was created in books before his movies were made and so everyone had a chance to have a slightly different view of him.Clouseau was created on film. Originally the part was to be played by Peter Ustinov but he backed out. Peter Sellers was riding a wave of popularity then and director Edwards hired him for the first The Pink Panther 1963. Clouseau was not the star role but Sellers stole the show and literally landed the role of a career.Peter Sellers also may have been the best actor at physical slapstick since the Silent days. Just take a glance at the previews for other Clouseau films on the DVD of Inspector Clouseau and compare them with a whole movie full of Alan Arkin playing the same character.Alan Arkin can be an extremely funny actor see The Inlaws 1979. Unfortunately his movements as Clouseau leave a lot to be desired. Two scenes spring to mind. In the first Arkin's Clouseau is in the office of Commissioner Braithwaite Patrick Cargill one of the best things about this movie. He moves from chair to chair during the conversation confusing Braithwaite and the payoff which I won't divulge is good. Sellers' Clouseau however would in small increments have left the office devastated. Later there is a scene in a gentleman's club where Arkin's Clouseau runs around smashing things left and right with a Geiger counter. Sellers' movements were like ballet. He and Edwards would never have been satisfied with just swinging one instrument around and wreaking destruction with it. This is not to say Edwards himself could not be guilty of coarse comedy statements or serious mistakes in judgment. Compare the scenes of Catherine Schell laughing at Clouseau's foolishness in Return of the Pink Panther to the much funnier scene in A Shot in the Dark when George Sanders stares on blankly on while Sellers' Clouseau demolishes his billiard room. And then Edwards made the misjudgment of trying to continue the series  with Ted Wass and later with Roberto Benigni  after Sellers' death. Then near the end of Inspector Clouseau Arkin's Clouseau indulges in the unthinkable selfreflection. He suggests to someone else that he may have been a failure confessing that nothing ever goes right for him and he might be to blame.This is impossible for Sellers' Clouseau. One famous reviewer I can't think of his name once mentioned how Sellers' Clouseau looks with sad reproach at a doorknob that has just come off in his hand. It is the doorknob that comes off in his hand that is guilty of a faux pas not Clouseau himself. Sellers' Clouseau is the ultimate egotist. He always thinks he's right even when he is forced to admit he was wrong.There is the occasional moment in the Pink Panther films where a look comes over the face of Sellers' Clouseau that suggests nothing ever goes right and he can expect nothing better out of life. But Sellers' Clouseau will never admit his own ineptitude is responsible neither to himself nor especially to another.Arkin was probably a good selection on paper for Sellers' replacement. Unfortunately in this movie at least he lacked Sellers' panache at physical slapstick. The direction . . . is passable. The story leaves a lot to be desired and the director should not have been satisfied with it. There are too many gaps where nothing funny is even suggested.On the plus side of Inspector Clouseau 1 For all its flaws the script does have some ingenious ideas and even a few honest laughs. Arkin hits his stride as Clouseau starting with the meeting with Weaver on the train to Switzerland but he falls out again when he sees Barry Foster's character on the street.2 The cast is Alist. Arkin is a superb actor it's too bad he comes off as a good actor playing Clouseau rather than being Clouseau. He is supported by Frank Finlay Barry Foster Patrick Cargill Beryl Reid and Tutte Lemkow as one of the baddies in one of his patented small performances.Clive Francis who would in later years become an extremely watchable actor lets the side down a bit as Clyde Hargreaves. He doesn't seem to be a comfortable fit for this part.On the whole it's easy to see why Sellers declined to take part in this movie. Arkin would have made a better choice to be a Clouseauclone but with the script problems this movie might not have been made without the Clouseau imprimatur.Whether it would have been better with Sellers or whether this script and movie would have rung the death knell for Clouseau if Sellers had made it we'll never know. It's just as well Sellers opted out or he might not have had his triumphant return as Clouseau in The Return of the Pink Panther.".

	schema:reviewBody "Inspector Clouseau is the most obscure entry in the Pink Panther franchise even more obscure than Curse of the Pink Panther or Son of the Pink Panther. Technically the third movie in the series Inspector Clouseau finds Alan Arkin in the title role of French Inspector Jacques Clouseau a character Peter Sellers had started to make famous in two previous movies and a character that Sellers would become inextricably linked to in four more afterwards. Inspector Clouseau lacks the boundless energy of director Shawn Levy and actor Steve Martin's 2006 entry in the franchise or the subtle sophistication of any of director Blake Edward and actor Peter Sellers' indisputable classics but director Bud Yorkin and actor Alan Arkin's entry is undeniably unique and actually quite entertaining.Inspector Clouseau finds the ever klutzy Clouseau heading from France to London to France again and then onto Switzerland to take on the psychotic gang behind the Great Train Robbery led by the mysterious Johnny Rainbow Clive Francis. Clouseau is assisted by shifty Scotland Yard Inspector Weaver Frank Finlay who played Inspector Lestrade in A Study in Terror and again in Murder by Decree who arms Clouseau with an array of James Bondstyle gadgetry. Along the way Clouseau as he's always had the knack to finds his way into the arms of beautiful babes and takes out dangerous underworld assassins trying to kill him all completely on accident.Bud Yorkin's directing style is quite different from Blake Edward's and the whole movie feels like a completely different animal from any of the other Pink Panther flicks. But the movie finds a charm and sense of fun all its own. A lack of a jazzy Henry Mancini score adds to the distance from other Panthers but Ken Thorne's hummable score is a suitable replacement. Memorable moments include a scene where Clouseau moves from chair to chair while being debriefed by the Scotland Yard commissioner Patrick Cargill a scene where he finds himself modeling for a seductive photographer and a hilarious sequence where he and Weaver become intensely competitive playing games on a speeding train. There's also a sufficient number of twists and turns that make this movie worth a look despite its obscurity.".

Along the way Clouseau as he's always had the knack to finds his way into the arms of beautiful babes and takes out dangerous underworld assassins trying to kill him all completely on accident.Bud Yorkin's directing style is quite different from Blake Edward's and the whole movie feels like a completely different animal from any of the other Pink Panther flicks. But the movie finds a charm and sense of fun all its own. A lack of a jazzy Henry Mancini score adds to the distance from other Panthers but Ken Thorne's hummable score is a suitable replacement. Memorable moments include a scene where Clouseau moves from chair to chair while being debriefed by the Scotland Yard commissioner Patrick Cargill a scene where he finds himself modeling for a seductive photographer and a hilarious sequence where he and Weaver become intensely competitive playing games on a speeding train. There's also a sufficient number of twists and turns that make this movie worth a look despite its obscurity.";

At that time it may not have been clear to the whole world that only Sellers could really play Clouseau. Maybe this movie helped prove that.Anyway it seems that Arkin's Clouseau starts with the character as he was in SHOT and takes him in a different direction than the '70s movies with Sellers would. Sellers' Clouseau at that point didn't yet have his totally ridiculous accent but sounded more like a real Frenchman so it's only natural that Arkin would sound like one as well. Like Sellers' Clouseau Arkin's is wellintentioned but with incredibly bad judgment clumsy prone to focus on what's not important and easily thrown off course by a pretty face. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau Arkin's is not only emotional but prone to panic and is not only aware of but comes to mourn his ineptitude. It takes some time to get used to his voice lower and thicker than Sellers. So this is not the Clouseau we know though the character here is welldefined and interesting in its own right.The animated opening credits barely even try for the humor and charm of those in the Sellers films. The score by Ken Thorne who scored the Beatles' Help and the Monkees' Head is the next best thing to Mancini though.Whatever complaints one might have about the plot and the directing I won't repeat the ones already made other than to note that the flow early in the movie is rather bumpy I'll say this the Pink Panther films made after this one came so much to rely on familiar formulas that it's actually refreshing how this film does NOT use them. There is no superior of Clouseau's being driven mad by Clouseau's ineptitude  just one reacting to it like a real person would. The crime plot here is actually pretty interesting  much more so than the theft of the Pink McGuffin that got so overused later. Sellers' Clouseau always sounded like a Frenchman among Englishmen even when he was in France which didn't make sense. So it was a good idea in this case to actually put him among Englishmen. His malapropisms come off quite logically as due to his unfamiliarity with English. And the rather obnoxious fantasy elements present in STRIKES AGAIN are nowhere to be seen here.So to sum up Different from and not as good as most of the Sellers entries. But give me Arkin's Clouseau over Ted Wass' Clifton Sleigh.A few highlights The nicely choreographed scene in Braithwaite's office near the beginning And what makes you think I trust YOU?The scene with the tape recorder in the graveyard.Clouseau eavesdropping on the gang's bank robbery plans.Item of special interest the use of an Amphicar as a getaway vehicle.

And even the quality of the slapstick is better toned down somewhat.  Draw back from too much and you get just right.  Arkin's Clouseau is somewhat sympathetic not just a jackass.

However luckily things pick up when we finally after what seems like a lifetime! get to see the actual 'barbarian' story kick in proper.Well OK perhaps the word 'story' is being generous with the term as there's no real plotting here as such other than of course that staple plot for about 99.99 of all sword and sorcery tales namely 'Hero seeks revenge for the death of his  insert parents andor siblings here'. In this case it's our hero's parents although in a lacklustre plot twist at the end it turns out that the murderer our hero seeks to defeat is in actual fact none other than his REAL father.So how can a film so base be of any enjoyment value you might ask? Well after the dreadful introduction its rarely dull and skips along briskly with a number of fairly enjoyable battle scenes as our hero fights his way towards the inevitable climatic showdown with his nemesis.Our hero here is none other than Pietro Torrisi also billed as Peter McCoy star of two other barbarian outings both also directed by Franco Prosperi namely The Sword Of The Barbarians and The Throne Of Fire and as per usual he looks physically perfect for the part although once again has very little dialogue throughout In my opinion this is the best of the three films however yet it is also the most primitive.And herein lies the probable reason for my fondness for it... The movie has exactly the same sort of base bare bones rawness feel to it that the very similar themed 'Thor The Conqueror' directed by Tonino Ricci possessed again a film that is universally panned but which I actually found strangely fascinating in its said primitivenessBack to 'The Invincible Barbarian' I think that the most equitable way to judge the film is within the genre to which it belongs as opposed to any outside the said sphere. Certainly comparing this to something along the lines of a cinematic masterpiece like for instance Gone With The Wind one could be entirely justified in describing this as admittedly atrocious. However as sword and sorcery outings go it is actually quite enjoyable and certainly serves as an entirely harmless way to spend an hour and a half.".

Certainly comparing this to something along the lines of a cinematic masterpiece like for instance Gone With The Wind one could be entirely justified in describing this as admittedly atrocious. However as sword and sorcery outings go it is actually quite enjoyable and certainly serves as an entirely harmless way to spend an hour and a half.";

Obviously the English dub is horrible but it's to be expected from a film of this ilk. Even worse are the endless voiceovers at the beginning and ending of the movie. The action scene's are some of the funniest you'll ever see given that they're all done entirely in slow motion Watch for the crushing death blow Gunan gives at one point where he simply slaps his foe across the back with his sword.My friend and I believe that the film had to have been directed by two different people given the drastically different first and second halves of the movie. In the first half we see the competition between Gunan and his brother to see who is the most invincible of the barbarians. Suddenly the movie turns into Lenne running around topless for the rest of the film with some strange subplot about a tribe of female warriors which turns into the main battle scene and climax and whatever other garbage the second director wanted to toss in.

It's the same thing isn't it?Husband phones solicitor to begin divorce proceedings...Such a scenario might seem a little farfetched but I can only imagine the complete and utter disappointment of those who have watched this film hoping for anything approaching the greatness of Arnie's barbarian classic. I saw Gunan armed with the knowledge that it was a total stinker but I was still astounded by the level of ineptitude in every department from the dire script to the terrible acting to the pitiful direction.Gunan opens as the Ungat horde led by the savage Nuriak Emilio Messina rides towards the peaceful village of Solmen where the chief's wife is giving birth to twin boys. As the barbarians attack the elderly midwife flees the village to carry the newborns to the safety of a friendly tribe the Kuniats. Cut to many years later and the twins are fully grown competing to become Zukahn the invincible warrior prophesied to free the land from the tyranny of the fearsome Ungats. The two brothers race each other and battle with swords with Gunan Pietro Torrisi the victor. In order to prove himself Gunan's brother steals the winner's talisman and sets off to kill Nuriak but ends up with his head on a stick. Now Gunan must avenge his brother as well as his mother and the rest of his village.Equating slowmotion with epicness director Franco Prosperi ensures that all of his action scenes are slowed riiiiiiight dooooooown the result being a film that is even more boring than it would have been if played at normal speed. The fight choreography is especially poor and looks even worse when given the opportunity to study every move in detail. None of the sword blows result in bloodshed. Desperate for anything that might hold the viewer's attention Prosperi throws in a few attractive warrior women with fleeting glimpses of nudity but so mind numbingly banal is the rest of the film that a few flashes of bare skin does little to help.Easily one of the worst Conan ripoffs ever which is saying something given how many there have been Gunan is fully deserving of the lowest possible rating possible 110.".

Desperate for anything that might hold the viewer's attention Prosperi throws in a few attractive warrior women with fleeting glimpses of nudity but so mind numbingly banal is the rest of the film that a few flashes of bare skin does little to help.Easily one of the worst Conan ripoffs ever which is saying something given how many there have been Gunan is fully deserving of the lowest possible rating possible 110.";

No they're about ancient prophecies and cruel despots and evil twins.There's a decent amount of bloodletting as well as some goofy Xenastyle sword fighting just whack the other guy with the flat of your blade. There's also a 'very' decent amount of nudity on the part of Sabrina Siani and much exposed skin from her Amazon sisters which pushes INVINCIBLE BARBARIAN into watchable territory. The hilariously overwrought and as typical unrelated VHS box art of a scruffy yet pensive savage who looks nothing like any of the actors and a tiger that never shows up is just a sweet barbarian bonus.".

They probably didn't please many movie fans at the time but a select group of cult fans today will be ever grateful.We watched this movie on an appropriately titled Night of Distaste which had previously featured questionable classics such as 'Cannibal Holocaust' and 'Megashark vs. Giant Octopus'. 'Gunan' obviously tried to score in the wake of the success of 'Conan the Barbarian'. Thank God the makers had no idea what they were doing because this was easily the best worst movie of the evening. Even 'Troll 2' seems wonderfully inspired compared to this hilarious attempt to make an epic.It wasn't for lack of trying though. This hilariously bad movie starts with a prologue that tries to sell the idea that millions of years of cosmic powers and evolution on Earth have been a prelude to the battle between good and evil that is to be settled by some guys in animal skins. Wow. Ambition is one thing this movie can't be denied. They even included some stopmotion dinosaurs that must have been borrowed from a better movie or one with an actual budget.The action scenes are pretty unconvincing. The sword fight scenes are probably rehearsal footage. However probably for artistic reasons almost one third of the movie is shot in super slowmotion or they simply had a hard time filling the running time so they chose to stretch it a bit. At one point we started to get slightly annoyed by this and someone cranked up the movie's speed to 130. It didn't help much. I am not kidding we upped it to 150 and even then the movie was still slow as hell. But this was compensated for by a complete lack of convincibility if that is a real word there was a shot where a fake sword was clearly bouncing off someone's back which was still perfectly visible even at 15 times the speed. From what we could tell the movie is about two guys destined to defeat evil who have been raised by a tribe of women. The females make 'subtle' sexual advances all the time but the guys don't seem to be interested at all. But don't be afraid the only girl they are willing to fight for is captured by a hostile tribe and stripped from her clothes for no apparent reason other than that it gives the makers a reason to film her nude while running in slowmotion. Can't have good cult without gratuitous nudity now can we? All in all we had no idea what to expect but we definitely had a great time on this movie. It's a piece of crap but thoroughly entertaining and best appreciated with a large crowd of drunk young men and a media player that can crank up the speed otherwise you may fall asleep. A 1 for effort but an 8 for sheer enjoyment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reporter Gregory Moore Jean Sorel is found dead somewhere in Cold War Prague and brought to the morgue but he is not really dead  his mind works but he cannot move. Now he tries to figure out how he ended up in the morgue. Most of the movie is told through Moore's flashbacks from the morgue where an old friend of his is trying to revive him because he suspects something is wrong with the body since rigor mortis have not set in.The next hour of the movie is very slow moving  through the flashbacks we learn that Moore had a girlfriend Mira played by the gorgeous Barbara Bach who he loved very dearly. At a party she disappears without a trace and Moore starts his own investigation when the Prague police almost dressed like the Gestapo is of little help. His investigation leads him from place to place and he discovers that Mira is not the only missing girl in Prague. As he gets closer to the truth about the missing girls someone tries to stop him and the people who are willing to help him. It looks like a giant conspiracy And the twist ending is magnificent and gruesome at the same time!SPOILERS The truth is that a satanic cult is behind it all. They sacrifice young people at giant orgies  we are so lucky to catch a glimpse at an orgy so we are treated to loads of old people having sex! Moore discovers the truth and is drugged. The effect of the drug is pretty gruesome since it is like being buried alive  he appears to be dead and cannot move but his mind will be fully working! In the end the doctors at the morgue realizes that Moore must be dead and any attempt to revive him is abandoned. Instead they are going to perform an autopsy on him. Just before the autopsy is going to begin Moore gains a little control over his hand  sadly the doctor performing the autopsy is a member of the cult and he kills him! Pure evil! END SPOILERS Short Night of the Glass Dolls is a very unusual giallo mainly because of the pace. It is remarkably slow moving and lacks the stylish and vicious killings which almost defines the giallo genre. The overall feeling of the movie reminds me a lot more of Roman Polanski's The Tenant 1976 and Rosemary's Baby 1968. The Anchor Bay DVD from The Giallo Collection is brilliant and the 11minute interview with director Aldo Lado is very informative. Especially his views on how the movie reflects on how the political elite buries people alive reassigning them for example when they come too close to the truth about the elite hey he is from Italy! and how the old generation the elite lives of the blood of the young generation the young has to fight the wars the elite engages in. Aldo Lado also directed the giallo Who Saw Her Die? 1972 which is also part of the box set. Both movies have a brilliant score by Ennio Morricone but they are used very differently  in Who Saw Her Die? it was almost vulgar and in Short Night of the Glass Dolls the score is used very subtle. This has to be my favorite giallo so far! Go see it!My rating 810".

	onyx:emotionText "The reporter Gregory Moore Jean Sorel is found dead somewhere in Cold War Prague and brought to the morgue but he is not really dead  his mind works but he cannot move. Now he tries to figure out how he ended up in the morgue. Most of the movie is told through Moore's flashbacks from the morgue where an old friend of his is trying to revive him because he suspects something is wrong with the body since rigor mortis have not set in.The next hour of the movie is very slow moving  through the flashbacks we learn that Moore had a girlfriend Mira played by the gorgeous Barbara Bach who he loved very dearly. At a party she disappears without a trace and Moore starts his own investigation when the Prague police almost dressed like the Gestapo is of little help. His investigation leads him from place to place and he discovers that Mira is not the only missing girl in Prague. As he gets closer to the truth about the missing girls someone tries to stop him and the people who are willing to help him. It looks like a giant conspiracy And the twist ending is magnificent and gruesome at the same time!SPOILERS The truth is that a satanic cult is behind it all. They sacrifice young people at giant orgies  we are so lucky to catch a glimpse at an orgy so we are treated to loads of old people having sex! Moore discovers the truth and is drugged. The effect of the drug is pretty gruesome since it is like being buried alive  he appears to be dead and cannot move but his mind will be fully working! In the end the doctors at the morgue realizes that Moore must be dead and any attempt to revive him is abandoned. Instead they are going to perform an autopsy on him. Just before the autopsy is going to begin Moore gains a little control over his hand  sadly the doctor performing the autopsy is a member of the cult and he kills him! Pure evil! END SPOILERS Short Night of the Glass Dolls is a very unusual giallo mainly because of the pace. It is remarkably slow moving and lacks the stylish and vicious killings which almost defines the giallo genre. The overall feeling of the movie reminds me a lot more of Roman Polanski's The Tenant 1976 and Rosemary's Baby 1968. The Anchor Bay DVD from The Giallo Collection is brilliant and the 11minute interview with director Aldo Lado is very informative. Especially his views on how the movie reflects on how the political elite buries people alive reassigning them for example when they come too close to the truth about the elite hey he is from Italy! and how the old generation the elite lives of the blood of the young generation the young has to fight the wars the elite engages in.

	schema:reviewBody "Aldo Lado's directorial debut known by its English title Short Night Of Glass Dolls is a unique cerebral experience. For those in the United States that have been searching in 2002 was first released on DVD by Anchor Bay  I got mine as part of a fourdisc Giallo Collection that also contains Lado's second feature Who Saw Her Die? Currently in 2018 it's on Bluray from Twilight Time and 88 Films.Short Night Of Glass Dolls was originally titled Short Night Of The Butterfly also a song in the film but right before its release another film came out with with the word butterfly in its title thus the retitling of this one. Malastrana is a title Lado was originally going to call this film but at the insistence of others involved it was then on to Short Night Of The Butterfly. Too bad Short Night Of Glass Dolls was the main choice as the Butterfly title would have made much more sense to the story.Jean Sorel stars as an American reporter found allegedly dead and yet we hear his thoughts as he is examined in a morgue. His memories take us back to the beginning where he tries to find out the reason for his girlfriend's disappearance played by a very young Barbara Bach. What follows is not your typical giallo but a very thought provoking mystical mystery. It evokes the tone of films like Suspiria and The Tenant and was made years before those. It really does transcend the typical Italian giallo  most are just murder mysteries with a cast of characters that all have skeletons in the closet and you have to sort through their hangups to see if they have relevance as to who done it. Here there is much more going on amidst political unrest and metaphors for power being fed by the blood of the young. I usually yawn at heavy political stuff the likes of Lina Wertmuller but Aldo Lado's take is a nicely blended comment as well as visually stunning storytelling.I really enjoy films from that period of time as the actors are not so GQ looking nor are they too young for the parts they're playing. The moustached Jean Sorel is nicely cast and easy to sympathize with you'll find yourself really hoping he solves the mystery and gets out alive. The locations are used well and extremely scenic another reason I love giallos from the early 1970s. Add to that a really wellwritten story along with a wonderful Ennio Morricone score and it just couldn't get any better than that! Even the famous group scene is handled so well that it does not come across as gratuitous nor cheap.Short Night Of Glass Dolls is very accomplished filmmaking and now that it has been restored and looking better than ever on DVD those with a hunger for something very unique will be quite satisfied.".

Lado's intelligent script combines different styles like typically Hitchcockian thrillers detective stories and near the end even pure occult horror! American reporter in Prague Gregory Moore is pronounced dead in a local hospital but his brain functions are very much alive and slowly reconstructing the fiendish conspiracy that put him into this disturbing medical condition. Gregory's stunningly beautiful girlfriend Mira vanished shortly after a social gathering and during his private investigation he discovers that many prominent citizens hide macabre secrets. I realize this is a very basic description of the story but it really is all I can say without revealing essential clues. The actual denouement albeit farfetched is truly unexpected and the grand finale at the hospital left me completely speechlesswhich is a rare event! Even though it was only his first horror effort Aldo Lado proves himself to be a master when it comes to building up tension and he has a talented eye for imaginative camerawork. The classy location of Prague provides this film with one of the most beautiful settings in European horror cinema ever and Lado could also count on mesmerizing musical guidance by Ennio Morricone. The song entitled Short Night of the Butterflies is a real beauty. Highly recommended to fans of atmospheric storydriven horror movies.".

However the movie is too slow there is no gloved killer only a couple of murders take place which are very unoriginal and ordinary not the ones you expect from a giallo and the ending is not that surprising at all. The film never manages to build up the tension and make you involved in it. Definitely the weakest film of Anchor's Bay  Giallo Collection. I would call it more a mystery film than a giallo. Morricone's music score is simply good nothing special for his standards. Recommended only for hard core fans of giallo 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Outstanding Giallo where the Giallo tag barely applies every shot looks like it was painted by an Italian maestro and Ennio Morricone's soundtrack just adds to the eerie disorientation. The films starts with the dead body of Jean Sorel being found in a park in Prague although as we can hear his thoughts he's not quite as dead as he seems. After his initial horror at his predicament and his futile attempts to communicate Jean tries to figure out why he ended up in this situation in the first place  while laying out on a mortuary slab. Way back before he was a fauxcorpse it turns out Jean was a groovy US journalist based in Prague and just about to move home with his Czech girlfriend Barbara Bach. Obviously this is back in the communist era so he's having to do a bit of bribery in order to get her out of the country. He attends a party where most of the highranking politicians are present and ends up leaving Barbara surrounded by cooing strangers while he fends of the advances of his coworker and gets bogged down in a pointless conversation with his other coworker boozy Mario Adorf!The next day Barbara has gone missing which leads Jean and Mario on a city spanning hunt to find out where she's gone. The police aren't much help and Jean uncovers a history of young woman going missing in Prague that leads to a truth far more sinister than a mere black hattedkiller going around knifing folk for kicks. Of course everyone who could actually help Jean ends up dead but this film isn't all about body count. And that's just the flashback portion of the film because in real time Jean's being rolled here and there tested for responses poked probed and all the while screaming in his head for help. The two plot strands come together nicely in an ending that'll have you thinking This is an Italian film.Just stunning to look at it that means when you look at the film you fall over your coffee table or just fall off the couch jawdropping which means your mouth just falls open for no reason mesmerizing you starve to death looking at the film. Watch out for the nightmarish visuals and the old person orgy! Recommended. The 'Creepy Eastern European City' plot would return in the Spider Labyrinth probably the last genuinely creepy Italian film ever made".

	schema:headline " The Communist giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "Short Night of Glass Dolls is an unusual gialloesque thriller set in Prague in Czechoslovakia. The film has a Central European ambiance that is unfamiliar to giallo cinema. The oppressive Communist backdrop is unsettling. The Prague of this film is one of decay reflected by the fact that a number of the populace have disabilities  a blind man and woman a man with no legs and a man suffering a seizure. The story involves an American journalist Gregory Moore who is discovered dead in a square in the city. Except he isn't actually dead. He merely appears that way but is instead in a state of paralysis where he is powerless to alert anyone to his dilemma. From this point the film alternates between Moore's situation in the mortuary where he has been scheduled to go under the knife in a public autopsy and a series of flashbacks that tell the story of how he got into his current predicament. It transpires that Moore's girlfriend had suddenly vanished from his house one night when he was called away on a false lead. The authorities prove unhelpful in the subsequent search and Moore then goes on his own search discovering that there had been a series of other girls who had went missing under similarly mysterious circumstances. Events lead to Klub 99 a mysterious society where chamber music is celebrated. The search leads to a trail of murder and dark secrets that push Moore to the edge of madness leading to an unforgettable ending.This is a slow paced thriller with little sex or violence. But it is not a weak movie at all. It's a little oddity that has a giallo feel despite not really being a fullon giallo. In this respect it is similar to The House With Laughing Windows in that it is a dark little gem of a movie that goes against the conventions of the genre and is an original piece of work like that movie too this is little seen which is a shame. One of the things this film has got in common with other early 70's giallos is its crazy title  Short Night of Glass Dolls is possibly the most meaningless of the lot! The movie benefits from an Ennio Morricone score. The maestro was knocking out scores to these kind of movies ten to the dozen and this is another strong effort. It alternates between dramatic orchestral work menacing jazz compositions and breathy wordless female vocals courtesy of the legendary Edda dell'Orso. The soundtrack goes a long way in creating an atmosphere of suspense. Acting is pretty solid. Jean Sorel is a good lead and Barbara Bach although not given much to do is quite stunning. Jos Quaglio is also memorably vampiric. Aldo Lado handles the whole film well. His use of flashback scenes and recurring motives of chandeliers and butterflies is clever and well done. Despite not a great deal happening in the first half of the movie Lado gradually pulls us into the mystery. And the ending really is very good.".

They follow a similar pattern  often there is a blackglovedmasked killer and several nubile young women in jeopardy. The male heroes often appear to compete with them in the beauty stakes. Here the meticulously styled Gregory Moore Jean Sorel is the main man here but he is upstaged regularly by the wonderful Barbara Bach as his girlfriend Mira You're adorable he tells her at one stage and I can only agree. She is particularly striking in her final scenes.The main difference between this and others of its genre is when we first meet Moore he appears to be dead. We return to his unblinking unmoving body at various stages of the story as it is prepared at the mortuary  the shocker is that Moore still appears to think and to reason. Quite how this has come about and continues is a mystery throughout luckily for us all the film is mainly told in flashback and it deals with the leadup to Moore's apparent incarceration and the disappearance of Mira.Giallos are often leisurely paced at least initially and this is certainly no exception  in fact there are no glimpses of any answers for a lot of the running time which often makes the viewing annoyingly opaque.When they come the revelations are particularly harrowing and exciting and things race to a head in a wincingly powerful way. And then at this peak the end credits scroll down it is over. It is a frustratingly sharp finale but expertly handled the finale brings things to an end in a way you may not forget in a hurry.".

Quite how this has come about and continues is a mystery throughout luckily for us all the film is mainly told in flashback and it deals with the leadup to Moore's apparent incarceration and the disappearance of Mira.Giallos are often leisurely paced at least initially and this is certainly no exception  in fact there are no glimpses of any answers for a lot of the running time which often makes the viewing annoyingly opaque.When they come the revelations are particularly harrowing and exciting and things race to a head in a wincingly powerful way. And then at this peak the end credits scroll down it is over. It is a frustratingly sharp finale but expertly handled the finale brings things to an end in a way you may not forget in a hurry.";

	schema:reviewBody "A superior giallo classic from Aldo Lado who would follow it up with the watchable but not quite so gripping WHO SAW HER DIE?. SHORT NIGHT OF THE GLASS DOLLS is an acknowledged classic of the genre for the few people who have seen it a suspenseful and thoroughly atmospheric conspiracy thriller which takes an understated approach to rival the sheer claustrophobic paranoia of such '70s classics as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. Lado's movie is expertlymade from the stylish cinematography which brings the beauty of the Prague location to the fore to the strong acting on display and the fitting score by genre maestro Ennio Morricone.The conspiracy lies at the centre of the movie and we watch as the lead Gregory gradually gets a step nearer at a time to discovering the truth about the disappearance of his girlfriend as played by the incredibly fragile Barbara Bach. The slowpaced nature of the narrative may be offputting to some viewers but the lack of action is by no means a hindrance rather a plus as Lado takes time out to characterise the leads build atmosphere and also work on the level of suspense the film offers ever increasing. The framing narrative of the story unusually comes from the point of view of Gregory's corpse or rather his body as he is suffering from a form of the rare condition catalepsy which of course led to Edgar Allan Poe's fears of being buried alive. However the fear of something much worse is at hand here  an autopsy! The finale involves Gregory's body being laid on the autopsy table in front of a student college and is sheer nailbiting stuff which brings the tension up to breaking point and is near unwatchable. An extremely powerful conclusion that I can't really say any more about other than it's well worth waiting for and one of the scariest bits of cinema I've seen in a long while.Lado ignores the typical horrific approach for the genre  i.e. to ladle in oodles of sadism and gore  and instead concentrates on psychological horror over the physical stuff  there are no faces burned off by acid or gruesome knifings in this movie. Instead what we have is a deliberate pacing which helps get us into the increasingly desperate head of the lead Gregory as he alienates those around him and becomes a murder suspect himself as he hunts for the missing Mira becoming increasingly dishevelled as he does so. Lado has some excellent set pieces in which the filming and lighting are spot on take for instance the shot where Gregory hides in the darkened room or the train station murder sequence. Technically the film is perfect and seen in its subtitled version the dialogue is witty believable and often packed with doublemeanings.Jean Sorel is perfectly cast as the young handsome male lead in what is a chivalrous and Franco Nerotype role. His acting gets better as he gets increasingly fraught throughout the production and I couldn't imagine a better actor in the role. The supporting cast also turn in strong performances which give the movie a realistic edge  you don't feel like you're watching actors acting here just real people. Lado deepens his movie with political subtexts and inserts some arty clues a case of butterflies which cannot fly which are the norm for the genre. The title incidentally refers to a crystal chandelier which hangs above Sorel's bed. Other spineshuddering moments include mysterious characters hanging around on street corners always a good scare for me and a really weird orgySatanic ritual which comes as a real surprise. Lado's movie avoids being sleazy there are nude scenes but mainly of old women! and gory yet stands out as one of the highlights of the giallo genre  a minor classic that deserves a better reputation than the lack of one it has at the moment.".

He'd become obsessed when his smoking hot young girlfriend Mira Barbara Bach had disappeared and done quite a bit of sleuthing of his own.This unusual structure lends a nice hook to this effort from writer  director Aldo Lado. One can hardly fail to notice how subtle and deliberately paced it is. It's also not punctuated by the typical spate of elaborate and bloody killings. Therefore it will not appeal to all devotees of the Giallo genre. But patient viewers will find it to be a reasonably absorbing story with Lado making very fine use out of many striking locations. One valuable component is an excellent soundtrack by the always reliable Ennio Morricone. There is a certain aspect of sleaziness to Lado's scenario considering the ultimate revelation that is in store for Gregory. It involves the sight of many shall we say older people doffing their clothes for the camera.Sorel is quite engaging in the central role.

What might disappoint slightly is that you don't see a lot in the way of good deaths. Most are done offscreen which makes this a marginal giallo at best. However don't be put off by the lack of hack. This movie has got the goods and delivers them.An American journalist Gregory Moore played by Jean Sorelwho reminds me of Franco Nero a bit is found at the beginning of the film lying in the grass and being menaced by a hungry crow. Gregory is believed to be dead and so is transported to the hospital. However while there the audience is privy to his inner dialogue which seems to prove he is very much alive. The examining doctors are befuddled by his lack of rigidity and other normal signs of recent death. Then we begin to move through flashbacks as Gregory tries to piece together how he got to the hospital and what occurred over the last few days. During the hospital sequence there are some delicious moments of uncertainty where you wonder whether a possibly stillliving Gregory will fall under the scalpel for an autopsy or will he wake up with is innards exposed? I especially liked the part where he was slipped into the cooler until the doctors decided what to do with him and then another body is placed on the rack above him. Super creepy.The flashback sequences are masterfully spun. Gregory searches desperately for his girlfriend the prettyfromtherightangle Barbara Bach who's gone missing. He and his journalist friends butt heads with the local police in Prague as they chase shadows in empty plazas and zigzagging alleys. After putting a few pieces of the puzzle together Gregory finds a club for lovers of classical music and believes Barbara and other women have met their fate at the hands of the occupants. What follows is a rather strange orgy of black mass rites and political potency. The ending is shocking. The hospital aspect of the plot is very similar to a Twilight Zone episode and also to a Stephen King short storyI doubt King saw this film but he did say the TZ episode inspired himwhich is admirable since it's practically identicalah the ability to be published for such nonsense but I digress.Ennio Morricone provides the score. While Morricone is always good the second film by Aldo Lado has a much better score written by Ennio.There is almost no bloodshed in this film and what you do see is mainly offcamera deaths. This is unusual for 70's horrorthrillers and it's a rare treat to just sit back and take in Lado's meticulous direction.".

Short Night Of The Glass Dolls of 1971 is a work of art in style and beauty that every fellow lover of Italian Horror cinema should see for its many ingenious aspects. Yet I cannot deny that I was a tiny bit disappointed with this film which I bought under the title Malastrana and which several fellow Gialloenthusiasts had recommended to me as something absolutely unique. My expectations were high and I also expected something quite different in the film. I was misslead to believe that Malastrana was a typical Giallo and while it can be attributed to the Giallogenre it can not really be described as a Giallo in the traditional sense. It was not the lack of stylish murders from the perspective of a blackgloved killer that bothered me however. The visually striking film has a downright brilliant premise and an ingenious ending but inbetween it tends to drag a little. While the general atmosphere is an eerie one however I would have loved a little more genuine scares.Not that the film wasn't suspenseful. It actually builds up a great tension. The film begins very promising when a man Jean Sorel is brought to a morgue while he is actually still alive. The man who soon remembers that he is Gregory an American Journalist working in Prague experiences how he is pronounced dead and yet he is unable to do anything about his situation. He therefore decides that all he can do is to try and remember how he got in this peculiar situation... A more than original beginning indeed which made my expectations for the rest of the film even higher. A fellow Giallo fan had described the film as one of his personal favorites to me and in the beginning I almost felt that it might become one of mine. Sadly there are some points that I didn't like. The film drags a little in the middle and the suspense could sometimes have been more intense. Also the film does not really make the viewer care for the characters which lessens the intensity a little. Then again the film has many brilliant aspects. Visually the film is incredibly striking. The photography is beautifully done and Prague is an excellent setting for a Giallo even more for one with an occult twist. The visual impressions are intensified by a brilliant score by maestro Ennio Morricone. Jean Sorell is very good in the lead and the rest of the performances are also brilliant. The cast includes the great Mario Adorf in a typically unpolished role and the immortal Ingrid Thulin. The ravishing Barbara Bach is unbelievably beautiful in the role of Mira the main protagonist's young girlfriend who takes every man's breath away. Overall Short Night Of The Glass Dolls did not quite live up to my very high expectations but it is not the film alone which can be blamed for that. I began to watch this film expecting a masterpiece and while in my opinion it is not it is nonetheless a highly atmospheric original and visually striking film that no Italian Horror fan should consider missing. Especially the ending is breathtaking. Not an absolute masterpiece in my opinion and yet highly recommended to all my fellow Giallobuffs!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many reviews praising SHORT NIGHT...and I guess I just don't get it. There are definitely some things to like about itbut overall I found the storyline and pace of the film to kill what otherwise could have been an interesting ending. American reporter Greg Moore is found dead in a park in Prague. Thing ishe's not really deadjust paralyzed but still cognizant of what's going on around himand the plot is presented to the audience through Greg's flashbacks of what brought him to this condition. The 'mystery' of the story revolves around the fact that days earlierGreg's girlfriend disappeared and the search for the truth surrounding her disappearance and his subsequent solving of the mystery is why he ends up in the condition that he's in...There are a few things that I liked about this giallostyled thriller. I say 'giallostyle' because there are a lot of stylistic differences in this film that in my opinion move it more into just straightup 'thriller' territory than the slightly more 'specific' subgenre of the typical 'giallo'. There's very little actual sex and violence shownand the typical 'black gloved killer' is nonexistent. Regardlessthe film is shot well the acting is decent and Greg's odd 'condition' is both interesting and original for this sort of film. The underlying theme of the 'elite' being able to manipulate people and situations for their own benefit usually makes for an interesting basis for a plot as well. That saidSHORT NIGHT is SO slowly paced that after the first halfhour or soit just drags. I don't mind a slowpaced filmbut the problem I found is that often leads were followed that never really went anywhere therefore not really forwarding the story very much. The 'climax' of the film though somewhat interestingdidn't feel as though it was builtup to very well. I think the occult angle could have been discovered earlier and then used as a major and interesting part of the buildup...but it wasn't. I will say that I did very much like the downbeat nature of the final scene. At this pointI've now seen three of Lado's filmsincluding the relatively enjoyable if completely derivative NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS and the abysmal WHO SAW HER DIE? I found SHORT NIGHT...to fall somewhere between the two on the enjoyment scale. SHORT NIGHT....isn't a 'bad' film by any meansbut I can't agree with those that feel this is a shining example in the genre. I'm not nearly as much of a giallo aficionado as somebut I've seen enough to know that this definitely isn't one of the most notable entries. 610".

So many funny and quotable scenes The Wrecka Stow Tell him it's chinese It's the mum! How much money you make? Damn couldn't you buy some cologne man?! and it goes on and on. And of course the soundtrack is superb. Sure you'll have to like prince at least a bit 'cos you'll getting a lot of him being the director actor and composer but once you can forgive his little faults which I think is not the extreme vanity stuff cos I think that was done so over the top on purpose for fun you'll be entertained for sure and PrinceJerome Benton make a great comedy duo as Christopher Tracy and 'Tricky'. When things are getting more serious and dramatic it loses it's strengths a bit but still I found this a very enjoyable movie.".

So many funny and quotable scenes The Wrecka Stow Tell him it's chinese It's the mum! How much money you make? Damn couldn't you buy some cologne man?! and it goes on and on. And of course the soundtrack is superb. Sure you'll have to like prince at least a bit 'cos you'll getting a lot of him being the director actor and composer but once you can forgive his little faults which I think is not the extreme vanity stuff cos I think that was done so over the top on purpose for fun you'll be entertained for sure and PrinceJerome Benton make a great comedy duo as Christopher Tracy and 'Tricky'. When things are getting more serious and dramatic it loses it's strengths a bit but still I found this a very enjoyable movie.";

I tend to find the silly stuff funny and that's partly why I loved this film.  It was so silly that it was funny!! Well I also love Prince and his music.

Under the Cherry Moon is the finest movie Prince ever directed and if you've seen the abysmal Graffiti Bridge you know what I mean and the fact that he took over from Mary Lambert who went on to direct the ludicrously bad Pet Semataryat the last minute further proves my point. Prince and erstwhile sidekick Jerome Benton play a pair of hustlers who make no bones about their profession in fact the fun they have is so infectious it seems to take all the sleaze out of it. Merrily they go along until Christopher Prince lays eyes on Kristin ScottThomas and goes completely gaga forgetting altogether the pair's objective of swindling her out of her fortune. This is a fun movie one that manages to evoke the feel of a 30s screwball comedy injected with a modern sensibility. The music is among Prince's finest and most cohesive albumwise and most rhythmically inventive. Don't rent this expecting to see a work of cinematic art this is pure entertainment plain and simple. If you're looking for something you can watch strictly for fun check this one out. For those who have seen it and love as I do I have two words for you Wrecka Stow!".

Of course Prince's best movie was the concert picture Sign O' The Times. Purple Rain from what I can remember  it too only gets screened on rare occasions  was a decent film making 7.8 million its first week in America and going on to earn 70 million over there. Under The Cherry Moon by contrast made just 3.2 million in its first week and went downhill from thereon.Never as bad as the reviews would have you believe Prince is actually quite personable in his role as Christopher Tracy and pulls off to my mind a competent performance. Although the black and white cinematography wasn't intentional it does come to good effect as he uses his expressive face to homage one or two licks from the silent comedy era. He's especially good when playing opposite Jerome Benton one of his Time proteges and for the purposes of this film at least a member of The Revolution. Benton again puts in a good performance as his halfbrother Tricky.Christopher and Tricky are jive talking gigolos scamming money out of rich women with the promise of marriage. If the idea of Prince becoming a highlydesired gigolo is stretching the imagination then we excepted it for the even more er... unconventional looking... Woody Allen. And this was a role Prince was to hold in real life becoming engaged to Kim Basinger just four years after this film was made. What fails to make the set up convincing is that Christopher's latest target  Mary  has no real on screen rapport with the star. Kristin Scott Thomas is now an enviably famous actress The English Patient The Horse Whisperer and Mission Impossible just three of the films to her name. Rather a surprise then that for this her first film she looks beautiful but undeniably uncomfortable. This is possibly the major factor as to why something in the picture doesn't quite gel.But if Prince's acting wasn't to blame then what was? Certainly the storyline for the genre takes precedence Prince only singing on screen three times. And of those occasions one is merely humming along to his song on the radio the other an end titles sequence of the superb Mountains Mary Lambert a pop video director was originally slated to direct but the 27yearold's ambition urged him to take up the reins. Again direction is adequate utilising many of the respected Hollywood techniques of the previous five decades. Yet there's the nagging feeling that he's not quite put himself in there he's merely copying the riffs of those who went before him with none of his own style. As a result it can look a little flat although the Paris filming is pleasant on the eye.Ultimately though the film holds no real compulsion for the audience and there's never truly a moment when you believe the events of the film are real. As for the soundtrack Parade was fortunately one of the half dozen or so greatest albums the artist produced taking its lead from the film with a chic monochrome cover. I'm a huge of Prince's work and hold out for the day when he may make a serious comeback after a series of lacklustre late90s albums. As a result I'm glad I saw the movie though I probably wouldn't watch it a second time. Instead I'd put on the CD and relax to the irresistibly funky electropop and searing falsettos it has to offer.POSTSCRIPT APRIL 2016 Watching this film again after the sad news of Prince's death I largely agree with the above review. In fact I may have even been a little too hard on it and I've given it an extra point. I didn't even mention Wrecka Stow. The critics hated it but watched with the right frame of mind it can be quite fun even if some of the electronic score jars with the mood. In hindsight I realise I was completely wrong about suggesting that Prince couldn't be a gigolo in reality in real life being attractive to a great number of women. One of the last shots in this movie is a note written by Christopher Tracy Prince which reads without love there is no death. Of all of his movies this one now becomes the most poignant and oddly prophetic. Sometimes It Snows In April. Yes it does indeed.".

I doubt many people in 1986 were wanting to see a BW movie and I doubt even more that they wanted to see anything other than PURPLE RAIN 2. This film has gained a pretty bad reputation over the years but I honestly didn't find it to be that bad. Yes there are all sorts of problems but I thought there was still some good stuff as well.For starters the cinematography is downright beautiful and I thought it really captured a fairy tale like quality. The BW images are perfectly used to highlight the beaches and the sexy locations. I also thought there were some rather funny moments scattered throughout the picture. As far as Prince goes his acting had certainly gotten a little better since PURPLE RAIN. Benton is decent in his supporting role but I thought Kristin Scott Thomas and Steven Berkoff were quite good.I'm going to guess that Prince wanted to do some sort of romantic drama that had the flare of the 1930s. This probably explains it being shot in BW and they even name drop Bela Lugosi in the picture. The biggest problem with the movie is that the story itself is just way too predictable and I'd argue that there's really not any drama and the ending certainly doesn't hit like I'm sure Prince wanted it to. Still there are much worse movies out there than this.".

The soft white jumpsuit with the hijablike headpiece was terrible. Prince overacts towards the end of the film. The jokes are somewhat ethnic without trying to be. The scene that comes to mind is when Tricky is suggesting that he could wed Mary Sharon. Christopher implies that if Tricky even approached Mary the police would lock him up. Christopher gets into some dialog about being lightskinnedbutterscotch and Tricky being darkskinnedchocolate and how they have different fathers. This is to suggest that he wouldn't bail Tricky out of jail once he's locked up. Trickey informs Christopher that he'll Slap the waves out yo head!. Prince  Jerome Benton were Bling Bling before the Bling Bling Era came into fashion during the mid 90's. Overall the movie is a 6.5 on a 110 scale.".

The writer and the actors are all gifted talents. The movie had a sophisticated approach. Why this movie didn't really come together may not be known to us in the general public.";

This is when the Jew step forth and tells them that the priests saved his life and the lives of many other Jews and then he sings Psalm 137 the Psalm of exiles written in the memory of slave Jews in Babylon. The psalm is very fitting here not only because it reflects the horrors Jews had to go through in the Holocaust but also because Christians are experiencing the same thing at this moment in the film.

In between bouts of depravity people wander around in Victorian clothes looking very pretty and completely lost. Ben Barnes is neither pretty enough nor possessed of sufficient character to be the eponymous Dorian. In his hands Gray is lifeless and somewhat uninteresting. Sybil Vane appears there is no chemistry and she drowns herself after his rejection. There are no reasons for his rejection he just rejects her and she drowns. In the book the reasons for Sybil's suicide are more complex and interesting and her death is through swallowing poison not drowning. After that incident the film careers downhill with the brakes off. Unlike the source material it is devoid of any kind of personality and just limps on. Basil the artist goes in the river in Gray's truck which any number of people could have identified yet miraculously Basil's body is found. There is no rhyme or reason to any of it rarely has Colin Firth been as dull as ditchwater but he is both boring and irritating in this story. There is no sense of time passing. The action of the story takes place over at least a couple of decades there is no suggestion that this is the case. Unfortunately the complete lack of timeline charismafree zone and just the sheer tedious drudgery of it put me off to the extent that I did not make it to the end.

Henry Dorian and Basil's characters are poorly explored and established which I would say is a massive part of the books appeal. This is further enforced by very poor acting! I was dubious about Colin Firth's suitability for the role but with some more time i believe that he could have worked but the scripts didn't allow it.

	schema:headline " Laughably Bad Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I hardly know where to start describing just how bad this movie is. First I will say that the movie especially the first half feels terribly choppy and rushed. The relationship between Dorian and Sybil for example from initial meeting to marriage proposal to breakup and suicide is covered in the space of TWELVE MINUTES. This is including the scenes in between in which she is not involved. The director probably could've put a montage of them running through tall grass and painting each other with paint rollers while giggling merrily and it would've done a better job of establishing this relationship in believable fashion.I feel like the director just wanted to get it out of the way so that he could spend as much time on the lurid details of Dorian's life as possible. Director What? I have to provide an explanation? OK here goes...Dorian hi I'm Dorian want to get married? Sybil yeah sure 2 days laterSybil you slept with a whore! I'm going to kill myself!Director OK now that that boring storyline garbage is out of the way I can get to the SM sex montages murders and a painting that actually GROWLS AND HISSES.Which brings me to my next problem with the movie the cheesiness and unbelievably heavyhanded symbolism. The first time that we actually see a heavily altered version of the painting hidden up in the attic the camera zooms in on the painting and yes it actually hisses at the audience. I feel that this is a massive copout on an attempt to create a frightening and tense atmosphere. It is as if the director was unable to use lighting shot framing scenery etc. effectively to create the atmosphere which he desired and decided instead to have a ghost pop up on screen and yell BOO! at the audience to startle them into a state of fright.The symbolism is something I would expect to see from a first year film student. The montage of SM sex scenes interspliced with scenes of Dorian spreading jam on a biscuit made me burst out laughing. Possibly the most obtuse symbolism I've ever seen in a movie takes place when Dorian seduces Hallward at his party while some kind of sexually charged African drum dance involving a large snake takes place downstairs. That's right snakes look kind of like a penis and they're representative of sin! BAM! Double the symbolism! I was so convinced in the final scene where Lord Henry speaks to the painting that it was going to blink or start crying I'm sure someone talked the director out of that one. I wouldn't even have been surprised to see a caption saying Dorian is in the painting with an arrow pointing to it.A great deal of Oscar Wilde's sharp wit is cut from the story and what does remain I would call the most redeeming factor of the whole movie. There are still a small handful of wonderful Wilde quotes that will have you laughing and thinking but you can save yourself the trouble of viewing this travesty.".

I thought with this new technology the 21st century has The Picture of Dorian Gray will receive the justice it deserves. However I was very wrong. I just finished watching the movie and I felt compelled to write a review about it.The movie was horrible. A grand disappointment which had such potential to be great. Firstly the movie should have claimed to be inspired by the novel not based on it. I say this because the movie was very different from the novel. All of Oscar Wilde's wit and beauty which truly made the novel classic was ruined and overshadowed by the changes the movie made. I understand that there can be biased when reading a novel before seeing the movie adaption but this movie adaption was appalling. I wont give anything away but the movie seriously ruined Oscar Wilde's vision and above all his memorable characters. Once the movie changed aspects in the novel the whole thing became horrible. Trust me you'll agree if you've read the novel first. Ben Barnes is simply gorgeous but he hardly brought any character development. I never felt pity for him throughout the movie compared to the novel. The novel brought the characters to life and described the reality of London life. The movie made the classic novel very shallow. I must add that as much as I love Colin Firth he was not convincing as Lord Henry. The character was someone who was vindictive and unchanging. He drained Dorian and was never affected by the consequences of his own evil Colin Firth failed at reincarnating the abhorred character. Whats worse is that the whole ending is changed which ruins the whole message of the novel. In the end Oscar Wilde's masterpiece remains legendary in its pages as opposed to its film adaption. Seriously I think my rate of 4 is being to generous.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is inevitable that when any classic novel Oscar Wilde's being no exception is adapted for the screen certain liberties will be taken to make it an engaging story to an audience present for 2 12 hours. In this 21st century execution Oliver Parker includes an interesting theme certainly real in Wilde's Victorian era and widely discussed on the social AND artistic scene today the failure of paternal figures. The longing for an admirable father figure serving as Dorian's ultimate Achilles' heel is a fascinating theory to draw from. It could've certainly presented itself as a unique theme to distinguish the film from Albert Lewin's 1945 version.Unfortunately this is all completely drowned in gaudy pornographic material not dissimilar to the undoing of Caligula overdone special effects and terrible performances.Ben Barnes is arguably a very promising actor who could've effectively played the role within a few years of performative maturity and growth. In this film the lack of the aforementioned makes his acting painful to watch. At this stage he simply lacks the severity and command of the famous character's evil to be believable. Barnes is weakly tossed from scene to scene and presents very little to persuade the viewer.The most appalling performance comes from Rachel HurdWood as Sybil Vane. It is perplexing as to why a more mature capable actress couldn't be chosen to play the role instead. HurdWood probably due to lack of experience and performative maturity is simply incapable of convincing anyone watching that it is a winsome naive theater girl we're seeing. One of the first rules of acting is to live and be the role NOT anticipate from line to line which she does obnoxiously every moment she's onscreen Mercifully she's only present for 15 minutes of the film but it's enough to be among the greatest of the film's flaws.Not even the remarkable Colin Firth can save this travesty of a film as his Henry Wotton fails to emit convincing sinisterness that his mere words will corrupt the young Dorian. When he illogically changes his tune in the film's final 15 minutes it only leaves awkward confusion and embarrassment. Understandably this could mostly be the fault of the director drowning character study in favor of saccharine visuals yet Firth is certainly capable of doing better even when his characters have limited screen time.Granted a film discussing the theme of selfindulgent hedonism will depict occasional free love just enough to get the point across as to what the central character is up to. Pornography running at the rate of every other scene however is too much. Parker has made the mistake assuming that this is necessary to appeal to a 21st century audience figuring the vast majority lack the intelligence to have understood long ago that this is among Dorian's long list of vices. A few scenes of the character smoking opium in a burlesque was already serving this purpose. The theme then plunges into the annoying with unnecessary and terribly performed scenes of midball rendevouxs and orgies that smack of pathetic attempts at convincing eroticism.Another item to note Wilde's novel was notably controversial during its time for its homeoerotic overtones. In this more tolerant age the visual beauty of male characters and settings is enough to represent this very theme Wilde presented. The addition of an absurd snog between two characters which not only strays from the plot's logic but also glaringly from the relationship dynamics depicted in the novel once again betrays Parker's belief that audiences are too stupid to gather the homeoerotic elements already present.A portrait that moans and emits maggots like a hungover zombie might frighten those who've been spared years of horror movie parodies. In watching this film the scenes with the ever changing picture provide an embarrassing orientation to this enough to have Wilde spinning in his grave. No sooner are syrupy pornographic scenes temporarily not onscreen than the film is dragged down again by overdone special effects that have been the undoing of many many movies in recent years. A director of Parker's caliber should've been aware of this long ago. Thus there is absolutely no excuse for this to be present in a film that is intended to carry a theme deeper than late 90's movie era eyecandy. There are no words to describe how utterly ridiculous even borderline laughable the ending to this film is. In brief it competes with the overthetop embarrassing ends of various characters depicted in Van Helsing. Once again visually already mentioned as ruining this film. If Parker was attempting to end this picture with a bang distinguishable from previous versions he renders it a complete joke. There is certainly pornography available that costs less than the price of a movie ticket. Corny special effects 101 can even be obtained for free in many places. That said anyone interested in this rendition of Wilde's work should save his money.Oliver Parker has directed some exceptional films. This one disappointingly is greatly under par having resorted to clich special effects reminiscent of cheap horror flicks and squanders artistic talent.What a shame.".

There is certainly pornography available that costs less than the price of a movie ticket. Corny special effects 101 can even be obtained for free in many places. That said anyone interested in this rendition of Wilde's work should save his money.Oliver Parker has directed some exceptional films. This one disappointingly is greatly under par having resorted to clich special effects reminiscent of cheap horror flicks and squanders artistic talent.What a shame.";

I dare say the story began with Basil the painter not wanting to show it to the public since he believed he had put so much of himself into it and then of Dorian's fear of anyone seeing his soul! HUH! not to bore and bitter you with my criticism. anyway the fact that the movie had distorted the original story to a great extent bothered me and the characters are very dull and lifeless compared to the book.

Yes we see the selling of souls here and the lamb to the slaughter and the hedonistic teachings of Lord Wotton but toward the end the whole sordid affair becomes predictable.Penned with an undercurrent of realism and too fantasy of the love of sin. It's a dark dirty dingy setting of a selfindulgent Victorian London that we are lead to believe is prim and proper on the surface but lurking just below this weak temperate society lies pure greed greed for experience experience that will transcend the mind body and soul to the wondrous dealings of what life has to offer. For as always a price a price both Oscar Wilde and Dorian Gray would pay the highest sacrifice.It is with a taint of sorrow that this latest performance too has paid a price too high sensationalism over content ironies aside the film seems too concerned to show the sordid details of this lifestyle and its inhabitants'. It lingers on too far in the bedrooms of London and strays too far from the mental anguish that may have been. We see the trouble mind of our young looking man but we see not enough of his fears regrets sorrows and repentance which are cast aside and squandered.

Still when I see a new version coming out I hope that it would bring more to the table than this sorry affair.Oliver Parker is apparently thinking less of Oscar Wilde and more of himself with every adaptation. The very same director who did a fantastic job with very loyal and conservative adaptations of An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest strayed this time so much from the source material that it's barely recognizable  and I mean less the plot and more the atmosphere the message the smart dialog and the fascinating characters who made the original novel so compelling. Parker chose instead to focus on the horror and erotic elements of the story making it a pretty standard DarkSideofLondon Victorian era horror film perhaps in a feeble attempt to cash in on the success of From Hell and Sweeney Todd  and at its worst moments it feels almost like a Twilight follower. Though the production values are clearly pretty high  cinematography costumes and sets are all pretty good  they're also uninspired and completely lacking in originality.Even worse are the cardboard characters and the shallow horrormovie dialog that replace the witty and dark banter Wilde was famous for. Ben Barnes is a very weak Dorian showing no emotion or development over the course of the movie but it's not solely his fault Colin Firty gives his whole to a very complex and interesting character but it's not enough to make the dialog ring with any kind of depth.Thanks to a solid production and a couple of good actors Dorian Gray is watchable but just barely and when it's supposed to be darkest it's the most ridiculous.

In fact the movie is so poorly executed and has altered so much of the original story that it might as well have been titled Screw You Oscar Wilde. This film is utter garbage and a a complete waste of time. All of the author's profound memorable and beautiful characters have been re written to become shells of their former selves. The shy romantic Basil Hallward who was so completely devoted to Dorian Gray became a flat background character with as much love for Dorian as a jealous horny teen with a stupid crush. His death was neither haunting nor pitiable. Sybil Vane a talented actress whose beauty was beyond compare was played by an actress with no talent whatsoever. Funny that the loss of Sybil's talent was never really portrayed in the film. Dorian himself was played by an actor who should have never been casted. Although Ben Barnes is a very handsome young man he barely matches Wilde's description of Dorian. Couldn't they have least dyed his hair blonde? His dark hair and pasty skin made him look more like and Edward Cullen clone than a beautiful Adonis. Additional characters didn't help to save the movie either. Emily Harry Wotton's supposed daughter was boring but laughable with no absolutely no personality or charm. Adding her into the mix ruined Harry and Dorian alike. Harry went from being a comedic carefree fellow to a typical overprotective dad. Dorian went from being a manipulative selfish and cruel individual to a misunderstood boy who just wanted to be with his lady. I mean really? This is what they came up with? It ruined the ending of the movie entirely. Dorian was supposed to die as he was a terrible corrupted soul. Instead he says farewell to a woman he is in love with. A cheesy overdone and predictable ending to a terrible movie.There is no chemistry between the actors and their acting is stale. Although it was shot well every second of this movie makes it look like a cheap Tim Burton ripoff from the scenery to the characters. The pacing is horrible the scenes are far too rushed. The script is cheesy and all of the romance the novel possessed was swept under a rug. There was nothing that saved this movie at all. It was just one big mess of crap. Just stay away from this movie and pick up a copy of the novel.".

I guess they had to cut all of that out in order to make room for a couple of sex scenes and a pointless subplot about Henrys daughter Emily which of course did nothing good for the film. I know that literature back in the 19th century was subversive but good Lord they really read between the lines. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't remember Dorian sleeping with half of London in the book. They also dedicated a few seconds to advertise autocompany Fiat which ddidnt exist at the time.One more thing the musical score made the film sound like a horror movie.The photography the visuals and production design were amazing but it is a missed opportunity.".

Nothing against Ben Barnes personally he may be a good actor but talented is something else. Good looks just aren't enough. I don't want to go into too much detail here about how it's not the most faithful adaptation of the novel etc. but watching Dorian Gray you get the impression they were trying to come up with a fresh interpretation of Oscar Wilde's famous novel but didn't quite know how to go about it.The one thing keeping this film from being a total letdown is Colin Firth no surprises there although it has to be said that his performance is a bit more lacklustre than we're used to. Still he hopelessly outacts everybody most of all Ben Barnes. The kid just doesn't stand a chance. Colin Firth has the only script worth mentioning although his character's pretentious oneliners do start to grate halfway though the film. Other than Firth there is nothing in or about this film that stands out or makes it a worthwhile exercise.In a nutshell it's bland it's boring and it does test your patience on a few occasions. Dorian Gray is not the kind of film you should have seen at some point in your life. If you have chances are you'll have liked it but are in no rush to see it again any time in the foreseeable future ... or indeed ever. It's the kind of film you want to watch relaxing on an evening without having to think too much and then feeling afterwards that you should've watched something else instead. It leaves you strangely dissatisfied.Worth a look but ultimately leaves you wondering 'why did they bother?'".

For those who haven't read it it is a rather short novel about a young noble who has a portrait of him made and through reasons never explained the portrait is supernatural aging and visually deteriorating while Dorian stays the stud that he is no matter how many years pass and how many evil deeds he perform. It is a nice idea and the book is a rather nice read. But was a screen adaptation really necessary? I mean it is a short book and not that much happens in that sense. The movie stays true to the book in a sense the slow descent of a handsome and promising man into a decrepit life within the facade of the lavish and luxury life of the rich. The environments are well detailed and the characters are well played out but to be fair there is very little to them. Dorian's betrayal of Sybilwho is played by maddeningly pretty Rachel HurdWood is so glossed over and artificial and although Ben Barnes portrays him as charming at first the character is not all that appealing to watch. In the book the portrait is never illustrated in full detail you have to assume what becomes of it as time passes. Here you see the creepy thing and worse the movie treats it almost as a horror movie object with groans and twitches emanating from it.admittedly freaky All in all I did not like the movie because there is just so less to see in it most of the scenes are padding between the portrait being painted and what becomes of Dorian. Nothing interesting happens in between and Colin Firth is nonexistent even with his usual charm and quirks he could have been the perfect Mephisto to Dorian's Faust yet he plays the role poorly. Not bad but not worth the time either.".

After reading the odd couple of reviews i wasn't entirely sure if this film was for me. i am not a fan of horror and like quite a few people i suspect was put off slightly by the horror classification that most reviews seemed to mention. However as it turns out it is not like your conventional thriller.i have never read the book and so i cannot compare it to the film but the story was extremely enjoyable. A young man who trades his soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth and beauty after seeing an incredibly lifelike portrait of himself does not seem entirely unrealistic given todays cult of appearanceobsessed celebrity youth and in fact most of the film stuck to the realms of reality. Set against a beautiful Victorian style backdrop of London the film managed to mirror life through a visually delightful time period that managed to modernise itself in its content and maintained a nice contrast between light and dark throughout.I was also throughly impressed with the casting. Ben Barnes was the perfect choice for Dorian Gray himself managing the conversion between the innocent young man to the seductive charmer to the fearpossessed psychopath effortlessly. Add that to the fact that he is breathtakingly perfect and even as an audience you begin to be drawn into his youth and extreme beauty. Colin Firth was unlike anything i've ever seen him in before much in contrast with his cheery mamma mia role as he played Dorian's enticer lord henry. Harsh and often sexist he very much had a frankensteins creator character desperately striving to corrupt Dorian's innocent nature. Ben Chaplain was also good as the creator of Dorian's special portrait Basil. And then of course there were Dorian's two main love interests Rachel HurdWood and Rebecca Hall both of their characters bringing contrasting characters to Dorian's affections.As for the content of the film it had what i believe most good films should contain  a shock. And it certainly shocked. It opens with a scene which you are certainly not expecting but succeeds in capturing your interest for sure. It then falls into a kind of lull as we meet the innocent and gorgeous Ben Barnes but then hypes up again as we are introduced to rude and obnoxious Colin firth. The film continues in this fashion for the majority of the time with a few unexpected shocks along the way as Dorian begins his soul destructing spiral. There is obvious sexual content but it is certainly not excessive and plenty of mild drug and alcohol abuse too although again the film does not go overboard with these. Also there is a reasonable amount of gore although not enough to spoil your enjoyment of the film and these moments are also fairly obvious and so the squeamish including myself can simply close their eyes during these short scenes. The only other thing to mention is the horror which occurs at the end of the film when Dorian's painting reveals his mutilated soul. I personally didn't watch this bit and would certainly recommend to those who don't enjoy being scared to not watch it either as it is apparently rather intense but again it is also fairly obvious of when it will occur.Dorian Gray is a fabulous fast paced dramathriller that provokes thought into our own celebrity lifestyle and the pressures we put on appearance as well as a visual description of the price of eternal beauty on the soul. I would definitely recommend this film  it is truly picture perfect.".

I have read the book and I have seen the 1945 rendition of the book and I must say that this abomination should not even be called Dorian Gray. Now I remember bits and pieces of the book and it has been a few years since I saw the 1945 movie but why is Dorian such an awkward goose in this movie? Dorian should be gregarious even when it comes to new company. He is pleasant wellspoken and charming even WITHOUT his looks however in this movie he stutters all over the place and does a horrendous job portraying somebody who is youthfully ignorant and superficial. Dorian should be all about his looks and just goes giddy over the simple things in life because he cannot see past his own nose in terms of planning ahead in life. It's all about the now for him so why can this socalled Dorian at least LOOK like he is young carefree and a little bit up in the clouds?This movie skips past important scenes that actually give character development and moreorless focuses on how many sexual situations they can throw Dorian in to make girls squirm in their seats. The scene where Basil is painting Dorian's portrait with Henry watching is the point where Dorian sees Henry as a cool person to follow! The numerous episodes with Sybil which shows that Dorian has no idea how love works! If this was a normal movie yeah go ahead Parker do what you wish but don't pull that mess with a classic. You look tacky and make a good read look boring.Why is this movie so dark and dreary? This is a moraltothestoryis type tale not a Twilight 2.0 tale. There are no vampires in this story you can cut the whole dark and mysterious look because Dorian as a character is not supposed to be dark and mysterious character. For all things right Dorian is bright with his golden hair and blue eyes!Even if you have not read the book this movie is bad just because it runs like a softcore adult movie. There is no character development scenes skip from one event to the next with no reason for it and it all just seems like a rush to get to the juicy parts. If you have read the book just stay away from this abomination you would HIGHLY wish you did so.Also it is LORD HENRY WOTTON. HENRY. Not HARRY. If your actors cannot get the NAMES right NUMEROUS TIMES then you need to find a new actor.".

The movie features nice pictures and decent playing  but the PLOT!!!! I am flabbergasted how one can take Oscar Wilde's masterpiece remove everything interesting and fascinating add random meaningless crap and call it a movie. There is nothing wrong about altering a book for a movie to make it more accessible in modern times but that does not mean that such a great book should be raped in a merely brutal way. Sure  the original has chapters that I'd have gladly seen to be omitted. Still the movie just did the book SO wrong  the characters have been changed  perverted in so many ways... I do not mind the introduction of some daughter but how Dorian was introduced how the relevance of Sybil Vane for him was shortcutridiculedstrippedargh... I lack words to describe my disappointment. The murder of Basil  it is not only an important chapter in the book but it also meant Dorian to cross the border to being evil  in the movie I do not know what it meant. The country girl in the book which Dorian spares attempting to be good in a vain way  replaced by some depressing love to a woman that accidentally happens to be Lord Henry's daughter oh what a twist.. HA!. Lord Henry the man who is not bad by definition but simply denies any moral  turns into a caring father for the sake of this parody of a plot. Oscar Wilde I am sorry to have given money to those morons that created this joke. For anybody not having read the book  enjoy the movie it is not really THAT bad by itself I think. But for me it was the worst disappointment I ever had watching a movie.".

	schema:headline " Veddy British Scandal Drama Penny Green Place";
	schema:reviewBody "An impressive array of talent was gathered for this morality story though no one winds up being particularly well served by the film. Always reliable Pigeon plays a writer in a small English village who's been passed over for a promotion by his rather dastardly employer and another associate. He's married to an impossibly shrewy and exacting wife Lansbury and dreams of a lost love Kerr who jilted him for another man a few years prior. When Kerr shows up in town again Lansbury's fur begins to rise though she tries to keep her cool. However when Pigeon befriends a rather shy and troubled girl Leigh who is in desperate need of help both emotionally and physically Lansbury loses it and leaves Pigeon creating a domino effect of angst for virtually everyone. The scandal costs Pigeon his job and his respectability within the community while Kerr attempts to aid him. The story line sounds more interesting than it actually plays out though there are a few decent things to recommend about the film. Pigeon though perhaps a little old to be playing a newlywed is solid throughout and remains likable the bulk of the time. This isn't easy considering how bullheaded and chokingly noble his character tends to be no matter what the cost. Kerr hasn't got very much to do. She comes off as mannered and stiff at times especially in her immaculate military ensemble. The two attempt to drum up some chemistry and do but not quite enough of it the fact that she disappears for a long stretch doesn't help convey their great love to the viewer! Lansbury who was only 22 and wearing age makeup thoroughly detested her role but at least her unendingly bitchy dialogue and attitude add a small amount of muchneeded spark to the proceedings. She seems to be a British Harriet Craig in some ways. Leigh in an early role doesn't embarrass herself as a Brit and gives a nice tender performance. Another dose of vinegar is given to the film by Barnes as a pushy mouthy neighbor and friend of Lanbury's. Many other terrific character actors dot the cast. Credit must also be given to the nice cinematography with its pleasant and crisp black and white contrast. The chief issue seems to be that the story is a dense and complicated one and there isn't time to really delve into the relationships and their progressions as much as one might like. There's also an ending which may please those who love to hold to their standards above all else but which may have some viewers shaking their heads in disbelief at the idiocy of it. It's a somewhat bleak affair with Pigeon unable to catch a break from anyone as practically the entire village becomes a lynch mob. It's worth seeing for the strong and talented cast but isn't likely to thrill most audience members.".

He is well respected and liked in the small town of Penneygreen where he lives. Though he is a shareholder in the company he will never be made partner because his boss thinks that Mark's political views are too radical. In fact he'd love it if Mark weren't even in the company. But the only way he can get rid of him is if Mark violates the morals clause in his contract.Mark married the formal somewhat cold Mabel Angela Lansbury on the rebound. Now his former love Nona Deborah Kerr returns to town with her husband after a long absence. Nona and Mark realize that they are still in love but decide for the moment that they can't act on their feelings.Mark's situation is complicated by a young pregnant woman Effie Janet Leigh who turns to Mark for help after her father turns her out. Mark takes the girl in and Mabel believing him to be the father leaves him. A scandal erupts and Mark's career and reputation hang in the balance.If Winter Comes is an absorbing drama with good performances. Walter Pidgeon was a solid leading man and is sympathetic and strong here as the principled Mark as the nasty Mabel Angela Lansbury then only 21 is very effective. With darker hair and the way her makeup is done Deborah Kerr continues to remind me of Maureen O'Hara in her early films. She gives a lovely performance a good juxtaposition to Lansbury's judgmental snobbish Mabel. As Effie Janet Leigh justifies her discovery by Norma Shearer she sports a good English accent and gives a heartfelt portrayal. Binnie Barnes Dame May Witty Reginald Owen Hugh French and Dennis Hoey round out the excellent supporting cast.Recommended and not only to people who liked Mrs. Miniver.".

	schema:reviewBody "I rate this film 3 stars  one for each good performance by three of it's stars. Walter Pidgeon is likable as Mark a kindly gentleman who reaches out to those in need and treats everyone with equal courtesy regardless of their social class. Angela Lansbury is convincing as his cold snobby wife. Janet Leigh tugs the heartstrings as Effie the pregnant girl Mark tries to help when she's cast out by her strict religious father.Acting aside I found the story too melodramatic with poor pacing. For instance there are several scenes in a row with Mark and his former flame Nona Deborah Kerr. Personally I would've spread them out a bit  inserted scenes with other characters inbetween to indicate more of a passage of time. The way it stands her character development and the evolution of their relationship suffers  and I suffered whiplash! First Nona's apologizing for the abrupt way she dumped Mark for another guy but they plan to stay faithful to their current spouses  in fact it's not clear that she still carries a torch for Mark anyway. BAM! Now she can't stand it anymore she's going to be selfish and throw herself at Mark. BAM! Next scene Nona's telling him they've made a mistake and giving him up. The way these events happen in quick succession didn't help endear this character to me.We're obviously meant to see her as Mark's one true lost love and Deborah Kerr gives a nauseatingly saintly performance. The script even contrives to give her perfectly nice husband who adores her a gambling problem  weakly implied by one latenight party scene  it doesn't really seem like a big deal to me but Nona freaks out. I assume this is meant to justify her infidelity and convince us that she belongs with Mark? Nevertheless she comes across as indecisive and incapable of true depth of feeling.Nona pretty much disappears til the end of the film Pacing! showing up to defend Mark when the town's turned against him. She loves him SO much that she burns the letter Effie wrote which would prove his innocent involvement in that girl's tragic circumstances. Nona would rather show him that she doesn't care about the wrongful accusations made against him  that she will stick by him even if the rest of the world thinks badly of him. Well isn't that nice. Nice for her martyrsaintguilt complex. But if Nona really loved Mark she'd be thinking more about him than herself and trying to show herself in a positive light! She'd want to restore his reputation and make all the people who believed the worst ashamed of themselves. She'd want to prove that he's a good person. At least I would in her shoes. I just can't stand this character. Maybe with another actress...but I'm not impressed by Deborah Kerr.I hated the ending and found the film dreary overall. Needed more humour  more moments like Walter Pidgeon's jokey interactions with the servants High and Low Jinx.".

Nevertheless she comes across as indecisive and incapable of true depth of feeling.Nona pretty much disappears til the end of the film Pacing! showing up to defend Mark when the town's turned against him. She loves him SO much that she burns the letter Effie wrote which would prove his innocent involvement in that girl's tragic circumstances. Nona would rather show him that she doesn't care about the wrongful accusations made against him  that she will stick by him even if the rest of the world thinks badly of him. Well isn't that nice. Nice for her martyrsaintguilt complex. But if Nona really loved Mark she'd be thinking more about him than herself and trying to show herself in a positive light! She'd want to restore his reputation and make all the people who believed the worst ashamed of themselves. She'd want to prove that he's a good person. At least I would in her shoes. I just can't stand this character. Maybe with another actress...but I'm not impressed by Deborah Kerr.I hated the ending and found the film dreary overall. Needed more humour  more moments like Walter Pidgeon's jokey interactions with the servants High and Low Jinx.";

But later the movie turned into a story about a young woman Janet Leigh doing a good British accent who turns to Pidgeon for help and inadvertently causes a host of problems for him.  Deborah Kerr is also good as Pidgeon's old girlfriend but even with the good cast the movie overall is little more than a confused soap opera and the ending doesn't make much sense.

Mark Walter Pigeon and Mabel Sabre Angela Lansbury have been married three yearsand it turns out he married her on the rebound. His old fiance Nona Deborah Kerr has just returned to her home town....the first time since she broke Mark's heart. Mark and Nona are foolish as the start spending time together alone 'as old friends'. Not surprisingly however it stirs up feelings within themdangerous feelings for both their marriages. Soon however Mark pushes Nona away and remains true to his wife.Over time it becomes painfully obvious that Mark is a very nice guy. While his wife is easy to dislike since she's so unpleasant he wants to fulfill his obligations to her and the marriage. He also is very kind to a young neighbor Effie Janet Leighas she lives with a puritanical and tyrannical father. When Effie becomes pregnant and is thrown out of her home Mark invites her to live with them. This throws Mabel into a nastier than usual mood. She verbally abuses her servants and so they quit then she lets Mark know that Mark must do nothing to help Effie. Mark chooses instead to tell his wife to get out...she's gone too far.After young Effie moves in Mark's boss uses this as an excuse to break his contract by firing him. They claim he's violated a morals clause. Can things get worse in this very soapy film....oh yeah! The moralistic town begins to boil like a cauldron...why and what happens is something you'll need to see for yourself. Be aware however that it is a bit racy for a 1940s film.While you do feel sorry for Mark because he's such a decent guy as you watch you might also feel that he's incredibly foolish and makes many dumb choices. Clearly he's backed himself into a corner and now it looks like everyone is ready to tear him to pieces.Despite Mark being a bit dumb and by the end he seems like a TOTAL idio the film is pretty good. As I mentioned above it is very soapylike a traditional soap opera with LOTS of salacious elements. But it works because the acting is so goodotherwise the film might have come off as too over the top and perhaps even silly. Worth seeing but blunted a bit because Mark was just too nicealmost a putz in the film. Otherwise I might have scored it a bit higher.".

I would guess most of our reviewers are from the U.S. where scandal has to be really scandalous to make much of an impact. I'm from the States too and generally don't like British films but once in a while one comes along that strikes me just right...and this is one of them. Of course this isn't really a British film...it was filmed by MGM in Hollywood...but it does feel like one...with a better pace my main complaint about older British films. Interestingly for a while I kept seeing Greer Garson as the perfect star in this film only to read later that it was to be her film. But the more I got into it the more I could see why Garson did not make this film.The story gets a bit complicated but suffice it to say a man Walter Pidgeon marries on the rebound and his wife Angela Lansbury doesn't appreciate him. He is still in love with another woman Deborah Kerr and she is still in love with him. So first there's that triangle. Then he insists on helping a young pregnant woman and many in the town feel it's an illicit relationship...which it isn't. The pregnant girl realizes she is dragging him down so she commits suicide and he is blamed if not legally than morally. Which brings on a heart attack...but also the return of his first love Kerr.Walter Pidgeon is superb here.He played his part perfectly. Angela Lansbury comes off well at first but later in the film becomes a real b. A logical transformation? You decide. For me it was a bit much although it did facilitate the story line. Kerr is the opposite  a homewrecker in the first half of the film but far more sympathetic later in the film. Logical...more so. Janet Leigh as the pregnant girl is excellent and this is a bit of a different role than what we came to expect of her later in her career. It's nice to also see Dame May Witty though her role is quite small...though important. Reginald Owen and John Abbott are excellent in their roles as the bad guys who fire Pidgeon for moral reasons.I liked this film very much and recommend it.".

Nice idea nice poster. But what a dud of a film.Walter Pidgeon plays a man of principle married on the rebound to a shrew of a wife Angela Lansbury. He has been thrown over for no seemingly good reason by the love of his life Deborah Kerr. When the film begins Kerr reappears to say that she made a mistake and will always love Pidgeon.

Pidgeon's bosses hate his liberal humanistic attitude and are constantly looking for a way to get rid of him. Enter Janet Leigh a young girl who lives with her heartless toetheline Bible reading father Rhys Williams. When she gets pregnant and tossed out by her Dad it is Pidgeon of course! who takes her in prompting Lansbury to file for divorce citing adultery. From there on it is one rung after another on the road to complete collapse for Pidgeon.Handled in a better way this might have been a good soaper but the screenplay is sloppy the editing choppy the direction almost nonexistent and the acting by Pidgeon Lansbury and Kerr all stiff as a board.

The best acting award at least from where I was sitting goes to young Janet Leigh who brought a quiet dignity and warmth to her role.Mean spirited to an astonishing degree and clunky at almost every level I have to wonder what MGM was thinking when they chose to make the film in the first place.After seeing IF WINTER COMES I intend to find a new one sheet for my friend maybe WINTER MEETING or WHITE Christmas anything in fact other than this nightmare from MGM the dream factory.".

Possible Spoilers ahead The story is a weepy about the upheaval and disruption caused to the residents of a small English village at the outbreak of WWII. A gentle young man living with his elderly mother is called off to war leaving her alone. A not quite socially acceptable young woman beautifully played by a young Janet Leigh is involved with a young man whose father has sacrificed everything in order for his son to rise in the world. The religiously affiliated book publishers are more concerned with their reputation than concern for their fellow men. The young woman in need is turned out by her bible thumping God fearing bigoted father. The writer has married a rather catty snob on the rebound from his real love although with Deborah Kerr's excruciating clipped British accent he would have to be deaf to live with it. Good intentions go awry and gossip ruins lives. In a quiet way this is an anti war film. Young men go to war and don't come back. The lives of those left behind are ruined but everyone still swallows hard and does his bit.".

In this movie she has no doubt about who is the love of her life and pursues Mark despite the steadfast love of her own husband. Finally Angela Lansbury is very cold efficient and downright mean as Mark's wife. Reginald Owen is the boss who uses a morality clause in Mark's contract to get revenge on a man whose generosity and common touch are too unconventional for his liking. I was pleased with the cast of the movie with Deborah Kerr shining in the final court room scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is based upon a novel by a longforgotten novelist Arthur StuartMenteth Hutchinson 18791971 who was born in colonial India and who earlier wrote a novel called THE HAPPY WARRIOR which was made into a silent feature film as long ago as 1917 in which Leslie Howard made his first feature film appearance. This film IF WINTER COMES was also initially made into a silent film in 1923 with a cast of actors all of whom are now entirely forgotten in the mists of time. The very powerful and disturbing story was thus a postwar tale but one told of the aftermath of the First World War but which is here recycled and set in the aftermath of the Second World War. Walter Pidgeon plays the lead a gentle and kindly man living in the fictional Surrey town of Tidborough and married to an embittered harridan of a wife played by Angela Lansbury who certainly knew how to play embittered women and have a pinched face and the tongue of a serpent. The film is chiefly notable for the second screen appearance of Janet Leigh aged twenty but successfully playing an innocent 16 yearold girl named Effie Bright who is all sweetness and light. And who ever had a sweeter smile than Janet Leigh at this age? Despite being American she manages a British accent successfully enough. The romantic female lead is played by an impassioned Deborah Kerr at her most intense. She has returned to the town and has her heart set on joining up again with Walter Pidgeon whom she had jilted three years earlier when she ran off and married the wrong man. Pidgeon is a bit wooden so that one wonders why all this passion is swirling around him. He is excellent at being kindly and noble and in fact during my brief acquaintance with him in my teens he was exactly like that offscreen. 'You couldn't find a nicer man.' But that is not the same as inspiring an controllable passion in Deborah Kerr when she is on heat. Oh well that's the movies for you. Victor Saville did an excellent job of directing and the film works very well. Dame May Witty has a cameo role and it is always a pleasure to see her. The story however is very powerful and upsetting. It is about a man with a good heart who through his kindness becomes a central figure in a vast misunderstanding where he stands accused of all sorts of terrible things which he did not do. Most of the people of the town are exposed as bitter and smallminded and they turn against him en masse. It is really very harrowing indeed. This makes for good drama and there is plenty of desperate tragedy.".

Whatever the reason circumstances are conspiring to ruin him because of his kindness. So how will things finally sort out.It's the kind of production MGM specialized inclassy players in classy surroundings British. Nonetheless the topic of unwed motherhood was rather daring for its time figuring quietly but importantly in the plot here. It's Britain 1939 and civil society is responding to WWII mobilization including the small town of Pennygreen whose sons are suddenly marching off to war. While on the homefront volunteers are flocking to boost civil defense. The movie's first part meanders some appearing to head in one direction namely straightening out Sabre's love life. But then his ladylove Kerr largely disappears from screen gone into civil defense. At the same time the second part changes direction picking up in suspense when the unlucky Effie enters the picture. Because of Sabre's selfless attitude we can't be sure how the movie will end. Still I wonder if there isn't a backstory to Kerr's abrupt absence and the resulting shift of direction.Anyway in my book a youthful Leigh steals the film with a highly sensitive turn as the starcrossed Effie. It's easy to see why she climbed the Hollywood ladder so quickly. At the same time the unknowns playing High Jinx and Low Jinx manage to spark proceedings with their imaginative character concepts. Of course vets like Pigeon and Kerr come through on cue while Lansbury's stony wife would send any guy packing.All in all it's well done soap opera with a few surprises that should please fans of tangled relationships.".

Bergman's fourth as director the film is a fairly straightforward melodrama dealing with a young man's attempts to accept a newlyacquired disability. However the film's techniques never strike one as being sentimental or manipulative in that classic Hollywood sense the main character is not a selfless humble martyr nor is he a selfish tyrant who regains his humanity through the kindness of others. Indeed Bergman paints a rather unflattering portrait of society as his blind protagonist is regularly exploited for money or otherwise disregarded as a useless cripple. Even the film's ending while seemingly ideal on the surface carries with it a sense of ambiguity the uncertainty of a future that could easily turn awry.When Bengt Vyldeke Birger Malmsten is struck blind in a military training exercise he is plunged into a debilitating darkness that robs him of everything he's come to expect from life. As he fights death in the moments following the accident he imagines himself clawing across darkened mudflats as grimy disembodied arms grope blindly at his limbs.

Almost immediately afterwards Bengt is abandoned by his friends including his girlfriend Blanche and finds sole consolation in the home of Mrs. Schrder Naima Wifstrand who agrees to teach him music. It is here that Bengt comes to meet Ingrid Mai Zetterling a pretty young servant from peasant stock who forms a touching friendship with her blind master one built on trust and understanding rather than pity. Whereas previously class differences would have kept the pair far apart Bengt's disability serves as a bridge of sorts.Throughout the film class difference does occasionally rear its ugly head to jeopardise Bengt and Ingrid's romance  at one point he refers to her as a little wench not realising that she is listening to his conversation. It is only when Bengt comes to accept that his place in the world has fallen that he can appreciate and accept Ingrid as a genuine love interest however alienating such a realisation must necessarily be. Curiously the film's blind protagonist ultimately regains his dignity through being punched in the nose. Bengt is competing with the handsome and ablesighted Ebbe Bengt Eklund for Ingrid's love but must suffer the humiliation of being totally disregarded as a potential rival. When he decides to stand up for his girl he unexpectedly suffers a fist to the face and this rather cowardly act from an unhandicapped man serves to liberate Bengt from his cocoon of helplessness and inconsequentiality. The marriage when it comes seems more an act of defiance than anything else and the audience is left wondering whether this illadvised gamble will ever pay off.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have nothing but love and admiration for Sweden's greatest director Ingmar Bergman and would see anything with his involvement. Music in Darkness is a very early work of his if I remember correctly it was one of his first. And it is interesting but I don't class it up there as among his best. I wouldn't say that anything in Music in Darkness is particularly bad it's just the matter of what was done here has been done better in his later films. Bergman is no stranger to melodrama and Music in Darkness is basically that but I do think his later films show it in a more expansive less broad way. The characters don't feel bland or indifferent there is effort to make the lead character not onesided but again the characters are rather broadlydefined and somewhat stereotypical later on merged with Bergman's intelligent way of dealing with complex subjects the characters felt somewhat more real. The acting is good there is some expression and enthusiasm though none of the performances are up there with the truly great performances in Bergman's resume. These aside Bergman does direct as intelligently and disciplinary as usual and the script does provoke some thought. The score is haunting and fits the melodramatic atmosphere very well. The story is more straightforward than most Bergman films but it is not dull and is interesting. But the standout here was the cinematography which is remarkably good for an early film of a truly great director. In conclusion interesting Bergman film but not quite what I call great. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "the story of 'Music in Darkness' could with little difficulty be transposed to Hollywood in its more sentimental attitudes  a handsome wealthy artistic young man becomes blind after an accident during military service after harrowing experiences of humiliation exploitation and degradation he learns to live with his disability guided by love.  And the young Bergman was not averse to manipulating the melodramatic tricks of Hollywood although his use of them are satisfyingly sadistic  the tense attempt in the opening sequence of the hero to rescue a puppy who has strayed into the line of an army firing practice  so much sentimental weight is attached to the cute liddel doggie that we barely register what actually transpires the shooting of a human being the nearHitchcockian sequence where the hero abandoned by a blind acquaintance stumbles onto a railway line with a train approaching behind him.Hollywood films dealing with disability have two functions  to wrest easy tears from an audience that generally thankfully doesn't have to deal with that kind of trauma in real life and to chart the process of socialisation of an unwitting outsider to bring a model citizen alienated by experience back into the fold.  Bergman isn't really interested in either of these things  his snobbish hero is not easy to warm to and the promised socialisation at the end is distinctly ambiguous and not sanctioned by many of the community members.  Where a Hollywood film might close with the exultant union of the disabled person and his lover Bergman ends with an uncomfortable coda where the lovers must put their decision to the social test and where the future stumbling blocks are disconcertingly laid out. It is anxiety we feel for the lovers and their uncertainty not a rosy complacent glow.Even at this stage in his career Bergman has other interests.  It is remarkable in a genre film how many of the themes figures and motifs of his later masterpieces are present  the artist hero whose journey with his art paralells a kind of spiritual or interior struggle the difficulties of even the bestintentioned heterosexual relationships battered not only by external circumstances but by pride whim cruelty selfpity etc. the obstacles of family and organised religion the mirroring of a physical disability with interior deterioration.Bergman's most characteristic work is identified by the tension between emotional excess in content and extreme austerity in form.  His early melodramas conversely are expressionist extravaganzas with their heavy use of twisted camera angles shadows deep focus and obtrusive music. Expressionism is generally a projection of interior states on the external world  what is interesting here is that the hero has no vision of any sort to colour the real world so that the expressionism is a genuine interior projection and the play of light and darkness in the miseenscene the heightened artificiality of certain scenes e.g. his reunion with Ingrid in a fogged wood all attest to his journey in a more honest way than the conventional plot.Bergman charts this journey as a kind of spiritual pilgrim's progress  in his first dreamvision after his accident as well as meeting big fish and sirens Bengt is dragged down into a hellish slime by disembodied hands  if we remember Dante's 'Inferno' Hell is defined by darkness.The film's central section where the hero's blindness is tested in social situations where he is rejected as an artist forced to find employment with thieves and grotesques who rob him where through his own class idiocy he loses the girl he loves is a kind of Purgatory where he must purify himself of the moral flaws the world had inculcated in him where he becomes genuinely humble and selfless.Heaven is concentrated in the marriage  there is a genuine spiritual bond between the two lovers from encouragement Ingrid gives him at the funeral even though he doesn't know she's there to her sense that he is in trouble with the train.  After all the woman who brings them together is called Beatrice!  Needless to say Bergman is less religiously ecstatic than Dante.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Cagney pulled off one of his greatest gangster roles fairly late in his career in 1949's White Heat. You could see he was starting to get a little pudgy in the midsection and gray around the temples for that kind of role but he still pulled it off.....bigtime. What a lot of people don't remember is that he did it one more time  with this film the following year.Yup Cody Jarrett was in business for one more toughguy gangster character. Here he plays Ralph Cotter and he is one nasty dude. It's great to watch Jimmy doing his cockythug routine. I wish he could have gone on forever.The supporting cast led by Ward Bond was very good in this film and worth noting. It isn't just all Cagney. Barbara Peyton is realistic as the tough blonde and Helena Carter as the spoiled rich man's daughter. Both are decent at heart and vie for Cagney's affections.Included in here are crooked cops a crooked lawyer and other assorted characters. It's a rough movie. Nobody is trustworthy in this story which is interesting all the way. It should be better known.".

You could see he was starting to get a little pudgy in the midsection and gray around the temples for that kind of role but he still pulled it off.....bigtime. What a lot of people don't remember is that he did it one more time  with this film the following year.Yup Cody Jarrett was in business for one more toughguy gangster character. Here he plays Ralph Cotter and he is one nasty dude. It's great to watch Jimmy doing his cockythug routine. I wish he could have gone on forever.The supporting cast led by Ward Bond was very good in this film and worth noting. It isn't just all Cagney. Barbara Peyton is realistic as the tough blonde and Helena Carter as the spoiled rich man's daughter. Both are decent at heart and vie for Cagney's affections.Included in here are crooked cops a crooked lawyer and other assorted characters. It's a rough movie. Nobody is trustworthy in this story which is interesting all the way. It should be better known.";

I also didn't get the feeling that this film was in reality WHITE HEAT 2 as some have said but it was a nifty follow up to that classic JC film. Cagney was indeed brutal and off his rocker but it was more controlled and offset with his characters smarts and sense of humor. In WHITE HEAT JC was just downright nuts out of control and a lot more frightening IMHO. In KTG Cags plays Ralph Cotter who after a daring and violent daylight prison break uses his smarts to prove that he is no small timer and formulates a grand scheme to garner lots of cash and protection which involves crooked lawyers and crooked policemen. Cotter in the end is his own downfall as he goes too far and his romance with a high society girl with a very wealthy and powerful father leads to his downfall because one thing you don't do is doublecross your moll! Excellent performance by all including Barbara Payton and a near film stealing performance by Luther Adler as JC's eccentric and very crooked lawyer. Direction is robust and swiftly paced by Gordon Douglas and in the end makes this film fun breezy yet violent but also a very good watch.".

I had honestly thought I had run out of surprises I had seen everything worth seeing.I was wrong.I picked up pretty much because of reviews I read here this movie KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE. A little nothing throwaway flick that was done on the heels of Cagney's wildly popular WHITE HEAT and was pretty much ignored upon release. It's said Cagney disliked the idea of doing another gangster picture. Thank goodness he decided to do it anyway because this movie... out and out floored me!It's hard to call a movie from 50years ago brutal and justify it. However that's just what this movie is deep in the bone teeth rattling brutal. In a world of Scorcese and Coppola Gangster riffs Hong Kong Cinema Slasher movies and the nightly news it's hard to account for this movies impact.There's nothing tangible in this movie in a world of shock cinema that one could call shocking. But yet... this movie has power and energy and yes a sense of brutality that blows away any dozen modern movies full of blood or body parts.This movies appeal is difficult to explain but I guess if you had to sum it up in three words it would be Cagney...CAGney...CAGNEY!!!Today's movies for all their CGI brilliance lack the type of center and if you like romanticism that actors like Cagney and Bogart and Raft and directors like Raoul Walsh and in this case Gordon Douglass brought to the table. Particularly in the hardboiled flicks a menace that was somehow felt rather than seen and therefore more powerful.I could go on but all you need to know is that this movie in a world that has forgotten it outgrown it outbled it is the finest of its breed. Better than those that came before superior to those that came after. It is the quintessential Gangster Pic. Highest Recommendation!p.s. And I have to mention I thought the courtroom scenes were well done and necessary and everyone turned in great performances especially the beautiful Holiday Carleton as Barbara Payton who becomes Cagney's reluctant partner in crime. Cagney turning in his most ferocious and seductive performance is matched by Holiday. Her tension and wild lilting ferocity and fear burning through the movie like a fuse until it explodes! Mesmerizing!! A must see movie!".

BUT because of his intense narcissism i.e. self love he cannot imagine his complex schemes and doubledealing NOT succeeding. He certainly BELIEVES in himself! At first this makes him a very successful hood which feeds his ego and so he takes another risk feeding his ego and another and another until he ultimately destroys himself due to his arrogance.So I like the plot and interesting character study.

	schema:headline " High Octane Cagney At His Brilliant Best";
	schema:reviewBody "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a violent thriller which simply exudes energy. Its story is told at an exhilarating pace James Cagney gives a superb high octane performance and the character he depicts is an incredibly driven psychopath who pursues his own agenda with an extraordinary sense of purpose and determination.Ralph Cotter Cagney is a real force of nature and his actions have a powerful effect on everyone he encounters. He's completely oblivious to the rule of law and totally cynical in his attitude to other people. Amusingly the fact that the other characters in the story are nearly all corrupt seems in a perverse way to almost vindicate his attitude towards them.Cotter is a vicious criminal who together with another convict escapes from a prison farm. When his accomplice is injured Cotter shoots him in the head without any hesitation or compunction to ensure that his own chance of freedom isn't jeopardised. As planned a car is waiting for him and accompanying the driver Jinx Raynor Steve Brodie is the dead man's sister Holiday Carleton Barbara Paynton. During the exchanges of gunfire that follow Holiday shoots a prison guard and later Cotter tells his coconspirators that Holiday's brother was killed by one of the guards. Holiday clearly dislikes Cotter initially but after an incident where he smacks her around the head with some towels her demeanour changes and she starts to become attracted to him and agrees to him staying at her apartment.Cotter and Raynor carry out a robbery and are subsequently traced by two corrupt police officers who relieve them of some money and order Cotter to leave town.

	onyx:emotionText "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a violent thriller which simply exudes energy. Its story is told at an exhilarating pace James Cagney gives a superb high octane performance and the character he depicts is an incredibly driven psychopath who pursues his own agenda with an extraordinary sense of purpose and determination.Ralph Cotter Cagney is a real force of nature and his actions have a powerful effect on everyone he encounters. He's completely oblivious to the rule of law and totally cynical in his attitude to other people. Amusingly the fact that the other characters in the story are nearly all corrupt seems in a perverse way to almost vindicate his attitude towards them.Cotter is a vicious criminal who together with another convict escapes from a prison farm. When his accomplice is injured Cotter shoots him in the head without any hesitation or compunction to ensure that his own chance of freedom isn't jeopardised. As planned a car is waiting for him and accompanying the driver Jinx Raynor Steve Brodie is the dead man's sister Holiday Carleton Barbara Paynton. During the exchanges of gunfire that follow Holiday shoots a prison guard and later Cotter tells his coconspirators that Holiday's brother was killed by one of the guards. Holiday clearly dislikes Cotter initially but after an incident where he smacks her around the head with some towels her demeanour changes and she starts to become attracted to him and agrees to him staying at her apartment.Cotter and Raynor carry out a robbery and are subsequently traced by two corrupt police officers who relieve them of some money and order Cotter to leave town. Cotter later records an incriminating conversation involving the two policemen and with the assistance of a shady lawyer turns the tables on them.Cotter then gets involved with another woman the daughter of a wealthy businessman and after the couple get married and jealous Holiday discovers who killed her brother Cotter's problems start to escalate alarmingly.Holiday's relationship with Cotter has an unhealthy dimension as can be seen on a couple of occasions when she responds positively to him following violent incidents.

I wouldn't say underrated because it seems that everyone who has watched it agrees with me.I woke up ten minutes before this movie started on TV flicked the switch and thought OK cool a James Cagney movie. I wasn't prepared for the rollercoaster plunge through abyssal night. Or the violent way with which the riders carom off into the void. The ending scene is totally classic with dialogue and revelation that pitches the film into the darkest reaches of noir.Everything about this movie is hyped Cotter Cagney hasn't got a bottle of champagne he's got a jeroboam he hasn't got a revolver he's got an automatic he hasn't got one honey he's got two we don't do 100 kilometers per hour we do 100 miles per hour and in a car the size of a carnival float. The guy's a total psycho but not in the Robert Ryan way that turns you against his character in the Cagney way where it's all like some big game to him.There are a lot of totally mesmerising scenes in this movie. Two stand out just for the sheer exhilaration factor  this is the bit where you coo out loud. When Barbara Holiday Carleton throws a pot of coffee at Cotter he says 'No cream?' so she throws the cream at him 'No sugar?' so he gets the sugar and finally 'No cigar?'. I was on the floor. Then there is the scene where Helena Margaret Dobson takes him out for a drive in her sporty little number. She takes it up to a hundred to scare him and then he stamps his foot on hers and takes it to 110 whilst she frantically swerves.Some people have commented on how the framing device of the courtcase doesn't work. But for me it's total brutality the director doesn't waste time with the minutiae of court proceedings he just uses them to makes plain right from the very start that its all gonna end badly. It's a complete train wreck of a movie there isn't an honest man in sight and the casual nature of the violence just shocks you. Cutting kills people like he's taking out the trash it's just another chore.There's also classic support from Ward Bond in this movie he always looks like he's gonna screw you up and toss you away. This role stands apart from the usual supporting roles he gets either buffoonish Fort Apache ineffectual Johnny Guitar foolishly vigilante On Dangerous Ground.OK so we got broads with pzazz we got dialogue to die for we got utter magnetism from the lead actor as only Cagney can be and we've got total anthracitic ebonic pitchblack noir. 1110".

	schema:reviewBody "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is directed by Gordon Douglas and adapted to screenplay by Harry Brown from the novel by Horace McCoy. It stars James Cagney Barbara Payton Helena Carter Ward Bond Luther Adler and Steve Brodie. Music is by Carmen Dragon and photography by J. Peverell Marley. Ralph Cotter Cagney career criminal escapes from prison and crudely murders his partner during the escape. Hooking up with Holiday Carleton Payton the oblivious sister of the slain partner Cotter quickly gets back into a life of crime and violence. But will his evil deed stay a secret? How long can he keep the corrupt coppers under wraps? And is his other romantic relationship with Margaret Dobson Carter doomed to failure? Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye it seems to have been lost in the slipstream of White Heat that was released the previous year. An undoubted classic of the gangstercrime genre and featuring one of Cagney's greatest acting performances White Heat has unsurprisingly dwarfed many a poor genre entry. However while it doesn't equal the searing ferocity of White Heat both in tone and character performance by Cagney Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is a seriously hard movie. Energetic from the off film is often brutal and cynical and awash with potently memorable scenes with some deemed as being too much resulting in the film being banned from theatres in Ohio! Female or a cripple it matters not to the menacing force of nature that is Ralph Cotter. Gordon Douglas was a multi genre director unfussy and able to keep things taut he gets some super performances from the cast while never letting the pace drag. Cagney is a given give him this sort of character and let him run with it in fact it is arguably a detriment to the film as a whole that it can't match Cagney's blood and thunder show? But Bond big bad corrupt copper Brodie Cotter sidekick and Adler shifty lawyer do shine through with imposing turns. Of much interest is the dual lady characters in Cotter's life. Both very different from each other this gives the film a double whammy of femme fatales in waiting. Payton takes the honours in what is the best written part in the film. Her Holiday Carleton is a good girl drawn in to a murky life by a bad man while Carter as bored rich girl Margaret Dobson is the polar opposite she likes fast cars and dangerous men allowing the actress to deftly sidle in with impact in the smaller role. Photography isn't out of the ordinary and the music is standard boom and bluster for a crime picture. But this is about Cagney's performance and the grim thematics contained within and much like Ralph Cotter it doesn't pull its punches. Finally sealing the deal with an ending that firmly pulls the movie into the film noir universe. 810".

	schema:headline " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is effective Cagney vehicle";
	schema:reviewBody "Although not up to the high standards of his previous work in White Heat the year before Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is still a worthy followup for James Cagney. Whereas Cagney's Cody Jarrett in White Heat was a deranged psychopathic killer his character here Ralph Cotter is more of a calculating cynic who plays on the fears and weaknesses of others. He's the type of ruthless criminal who could corrupt a cloister of nuns and he leaves a trail of misery wherever his path takes him. Unfortunately he has one lovely lady named Holiday who believes all his lies and will do his bidding without question. Played by the beautiful Barbara Payton Holiday does all she can to aid and abet Cotter until he takes away the only other person she loves in the world her brother. That's a mistake that Cotter pays for in one of the most wellremembered death scenes in 1950's cinema. Veteran director Gordon Douglas keeps the brutal action moving at a brisk pace and he employs a trove of famous character actors who weave themselves in and out of the twisted plot. Ward Bond is around as a suspicious cop with a shady past. Goodlooking Helena Carter plays a young and very rich socialite who Cagney takes advantage of so he can pass himself off as legitimate. Kenneth Tobey plays an honest detective and they're in short supply in this film. Barton MacLane John Litel Luther Adler and William Frawley Fred Mertz from I Love Lucy round out the stellar cast. Director Douglas had a prolific career directing a slew of famous and notsofamous films all the way into the late 1970's. Cagney as always dominates the screen whenever he appears and his performance definitely raises the level of this work quite a few notches. Without him Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye would've been a standard 1950's cops and robbers film with few redeeming values. As it stands the movie is not a classic like some of Cagney's other gangster epics but it certainly has its momentsespecially at the end. When Ms. Payton finds out that Cagney has murdered her brother she gets the opportunity to give new meaning to the title. She sticks a gun in Jimmy's face and spits out the words You can KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE!".

	schema:reviewBody "Man if this character Cagney plays doesn't appear to have the same look feel and over the topness of his character in White Heat I don't know what other film does.This was a pretty good but it's not in the same breath as White Heat. Cagney plays a guy who busts outta prison and gets together with a few corrupt officials and regulars to commit robberies for fast dough. In this we meet his helper in his escape Barbara Payton and the driver. They get involved with corrupt cops and lawyers whoever else to get ahead. The character Cagney plays so closely resembles Cody Jarrett that just by me mentioning it you'll immediately know what your in for. Cagney goes through this film doing whatever he wants to whoever without batting an eyelash. The best part is how all the people around him react. One comment on the time this film was made late 40's early 50's there probably wasn't an institute for cosmic consciousness in the south. How do we know this was in the south? Well I know of know other place in the US that had chain gangslike the one Cagney escapes from. In this film you see a corrupt exmob guy who's running this newage place and I can tell ya folks ain't know way that place would have existed in the south in that day and time. They would have run them outta the place. Another little fun nugget? Take a look at the end scene where Cagney falls after being shot. If you look close on the left hand side of the screen you'll see a crew members foot come into the frame for just a second. LoL now that's quality editing.Looking for overthetopness in your films? This one should suit you just fine. It was pretty obvious Cagney jumped on this one cause of how well White Heat previously. It works but don't expect White Heat.".

Ever the human dynamo he's dishing it out to both the competition and the dames. True it's a stretch when old man Dobson calls Cotter Cagney young man but you hardly notice. This is the legend's final gangster film. It may not be the best still it is fast tough and unsentimental. Once again Cagney's the outlaw entrepreneur working his way up the money ladder with little more than guts wits and a .45 automatic please. Along the way he corrals two crooked cops a shady lawyer a doublecrossing garageman and notorious Hollywood bad girl Barbara Payton. Looks like everybody's got an angle of some kind just the types Cotter can subordinate to his relentless drive. The ending is really ironic when you think about it. This is a stonecold movie. Hardly anyone's likable least of all Cotter. His cocksure ambition fascinates even as it repels. Only a secureinhisskin actor like Cagney would risk a role as unsympathetic as this.I wish IMDb had more on screenwriter Harry Brown not Harry Joe Brown of the Ranown cycle of Westerns. This Harry Brown did a number of high quality screenplays A Place in the Sun Ocean's Eleven et al. including the one here. Director Douglas manages several nice touches such as the true believer at the phony psychic session. Note however that the quarry killings are not shown at least in the version I've seen. In fact showing that may have pushed the producers over the censorship line.All in all it's a worthy slice of thick ear for gangster Cagney to go out on especially that last scene with it's great title line.".

If you do an image internet search on this car a very similar one comes up albeit with a spare wheel attached to the door but it wouldn't be unknown for this to be removed by the production company because it got in the way. What I can say though is that it can decelerate from 110mph to 20mph in half a second ha!I will watch this with interest.I agree that it is a great film though. Film4 have just shown it for the second time to my knowledge. Hope they show Love Me Or Leave Me soon a favourite of mine and apparently of Cagney himself. In both these films Cagney was in his early 50s being born in 1899 but still believable as a character.".

Everyone is suited to the part they played because they were believable. I just felt comfortable with the entire production as it included all the dimensions of crime films that are needed to make it successful. Whether it was a boxoffice smash when it released doesn't matter today.

	schema:headline " An Austrian madman well inspired by Greenaway";
	schema:reviewBody "Many stories have been told about Fritz Lehner's newest film whose production took more than five years probably the most expensive and costly Austrian movie ever. All the newspaper critics have torn it to pieces international festivals refused to show it now the future will show how the audience reacts to it.The story of Everyman in German Jedermann is old but it is best known from Hugo von Hoffmannsthal's play Jedermann' that is shown every year at the Salzburg drama festival. Apart from the very basic plot framework Lehner's movie has absolutely nothing to do with the play. It is a modern version about an Austrian couturier played by Klaus Maria Brandauer whose face is not exactly what one wants to see in closeup for throughout almost three hours who dies in a car accident and ruminates during his last hours about how one more night in his life could have gone by.Lehner's movie is long and often exhausting. But one does injustice to Lehner and Brandauer if one says that the movie is completely bad. Right the whole project is pretentious and megalomaniacal. Often it is just stupid and it may have been cut much shorter.Still a simple story about success and death is told in a coherent way with much symbolism and  that is the main point  in absolutely brilliant beautiful pictures and moods. I suspect Lehner of having been inspired by Peter Greenaway movies which is absolutely no problem for me because not many directors have followed Greenaway yet and the fact that it is an Austrian director who besides shows Vienna and its vicinity in a completely new light without any Lipizzaner or waltz clichs is quite exciting.So in spite of all the  indisputable  weaknesses that were pointed out in the reviews this is a wonderful a beautiful movie at least if one doesn't take it completely seriously and watches it with expectations as low as I did. I'm afraid it won't happen but it would be great if Jedermanns Fest' could be successful. I think we could even send it to the United States. The American audience would like it better than the Austrian and maybe this could finally result in an Oscar nomination. But again I'm afraid this will never happen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many stories have been told about Fritz Lehner's newest film whose production took more than five years probably the most expensive and costly Austrian movie ever. All the newspaper critics have torn it to pieces international festivals refused to show it now the future will show how the audience reacts to it.The story of Everyman in German Jedermann is old but it is best known from Hugo von Hoffmannsthal's play Jedermann' that is shown every year at the Salzburg drama festival. Apart from the very basic plot framework Lehner's movie has absolutely nothing to do with the play. It is a modern version about an Austrian couturier played by Klaus Maria Brandauer whose face is not exactly what one wants to see in closeup for throughout almost three hours who dies in a car accident and ruminates during his last hours about how one more night in his life could have gone by.Lehner's movie is long and often exhausting.

	schema:headline " One of the Best Finale's In Any Horror Film . . . Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I kept hearing all sorts of disappointing statements about Reincarnation. Needless to say I was a bit reluctant to see it in my local theater. But then I remembered that I have never seen a Japanese film on the big screen so I went mainly for the experience. Wasn't I surprised when I realized  after seeing the film  that it's pretty damn good.I'll keep things vague so as to not spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet. I admire originality and while Reincarnation is no Marebito or Tetsuo on the originality scale it definitely scores high. Sure there are a lot of horror elements used in this film that have been seen before but they are not used in quite the same manner. Perhaps the most impressive thing is that the concept of reincarnation itself is used to bridge and interconnect all of these elements in a new and satisfying way. It's like a chef who takes a bunch of foods that you've eaten before but uses a special ingredient to shake things up. In short Takashi Shimizu works well as a movie chef here.Some have complained that the ending is predictable but this is a misleading assertion. There are essentially three twists that occur back to back to back. Surely most viewers will probably be able to guess the first twist but there is very little probability that they will be able to guess either of the other two.Of course you can be sure that incompetent tasteless reviewers will criticize this film for lacking integrity and weight as well as entertainment value only to then recommend completely weightless trash like Friday the 13th in the same breath. For the rest of us who actually enjoy a quality horror film we'll stick with our Japanese gems. Other reviewers will claim that all Japanese horror movies are the same but a skim of my user profile will convincingly prove their ignorance. The pacing of Reincarnation is very similar to Audition although not nearly as violent in its culmination. The first 70 minutes is basically a slow paced setup for the finale with some dashes of formulaic scares. Fortunately the final 25 minute finale is one of the most interesting original and compelling horror sequences in recent memory. So for those planning to see it please be patient and rest assured the crap will hit the fan . . . hard. Quite frankly the final series of events in Reincarnation had this viewer giggling with amazement. Just when I thought I had the next scene figured out Takashi Shimizu would pull the rug from beneath my feet and turn the film in another direction.I think that the reasoning behind some negative reactions to Reincarnation is the fact that it was marketed ineffectively. There is nothing extremely violent in this film yet it was packaged within a Horrorfest of films that were allegedly very violent. I'm sure that the gorehounds entered the theater looking for lots of guts and blood in which case they must have been greatly disappointed. In addition no one knew the film was in subtitles. I watch East Asian films almost exclusively so I prefer subtitles to dubbings any day of the week but I must say that the audible groans and moans from the audience when the subtitles appeared was remarkably entertaining. Apparently reading a few lines on a screen is too difficult for American audiences.  All in all this was a classic horror film that scores relatively high in originality. I highly recommend it for those who can appreciate a slowburing plotdriven horror film with a fantastic finale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another one of the 8 Films To Die For from After Dark's Horror Film Festival this little Japanese chiller is a complex and spooky film. The movie follows Nagisa a Japanese actress who gets the part in a horror movie that is based on a real murder spree that took place in a large hotel fortysome years ago. At first she is excited that she has gotten the part and is looking forward to filming although it is a scary movie that she is being a part of. But things begin to get a little spooky when Nagisa begins seeing a ghostly little girl everywhere. Her visions intensify when the film's director takes the cast to the real hotel where the actual murders happened for inspiration. It seems she has a connection with the hotel and the grisly murders... but how and why? She may find out the answer very soon...I haven't seen a lot of Asian horror I saw part of the original JuOn and I've seen the remakes of those films but that was about it. Although I haven't seen much of it I know what it's like pretty well. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into this film  luckily I was pleasantly surprised. Reincarnation or Rinne in it's original language is a solid supernatural horror film that rose far above my expectations. The writing here is really nicely done I must say. It has a few inconsistencies here and there but nothing too major. About midway through the film I thought that I had everything figured out  I was almost positive that I knew what the whole plot twist was going to turn out to be. I was pretty confident that I had all of it figured out. Then during the final five minutes of the film my entire assumption disintegrated leaving me minorly shocked. I'm not sure about the rest of you but I did not see the plot twist coming. I suppose what I was expecting to be the twist in the film was a setup to trick the audience and I have to admit it worked on me.Along with the intelligent writing director Takashi Shimuzu who directed JuOn and JuOn 2 and both American remakes of those films The Grudge and The Grudge 2 has an eye for the eerie. Unlike the style that is found in The Grudge films Reincarnation boasts a subtle spookiness that I personally find much more menacing than those annoying 'jump scares'. There are numerous shots and scenes in this film that are hard to forget and the direction is great. Lots of creepy shots and disturbing imagery the homemade snuff footage is beyond eerie really make this a creepy film. The music is good as well and fits the movie perfectly. It's slow and subtle just like the film is itself. Actingwise I'd have to say the movie succeeds as well. The performers are pretty believable and while there is the language barrier I thought they were really good. Again the conclusion to this movie is the real kicker. I was surprised and creeped out by the way the entire thing came to a close.Overall Reincarnation is a really good supernatural horror film. Take your traditional ghost story throw in a hotel and the reincarnation theme and you've got this movie. If you enjoy slow moving horror films andor are a fan of Japanese horror I'd recommend this film. It has a few very minor problems but the good easily outweighs the bad. And the ending is really surprising. I'm not sure if it fits everyone's tastes but for me I couldn't have picked a better foreign horror flick. 810.".

Reincarnation goes in my book as the single greatest indie horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it is simply not giving it a chance or doesn't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. It is an intriguing story and has good acting in it and most of all the camera angles are really scary.

What is her connection to her character and the illfated hotel? I have two concerns with this film. First as the film was in Japanese I am left thinking there were certain aspects that were left out for the American audience condensed dialogue in the subtitles. Second the story is pretty simple and might have been better as an hourlong episode of something like Masters of Horror though by no means am I suggesting it was unworthy of being a film. I could also say certain parts were unclear there are what I assume to be spirits that are never explained but this does not take away from the film.I enjoyed the film taking place largely on the set of a horror film. Horror films referencing the making of horror films or in the case of Popcorn the watching of horror films have a unique style about them. A selfcritique. There is also something ironic about how the actress is told the director in the film will want lots of blood and gore while the film we were watching had relatively little and compared to some of the Japanese films I've seen I thought this was about as tame as you can get.The film also offers a great baitandswitch I cannot reveal. Through most of the film you will be expecting a particular direction or ending. But I assure you what you think you're going to see after the first several minutes will change considerably.If you find dolls creepy there's a doll in the movie for you to be creeped out by. Personally I did not find it very disturbing but I can see how for others it might be. Also there's something less scary about reading words on a screen rather than hearing them whispered ominously to you in a language you understand. Not a bad film by any means. As far as Asian films go I'd sooner recommend The Untold Story or The Eye but this one is alright. And if JuOn is any indication we'll soon be seeing an Americanized version of this piece. So catch the original first while you can.".

Are these specific events related or mere coincidence? We watch as the film dedicated to the victims is recreated with poor Nagisa experiencing more and more horrifying occurrences. Both Nagisa and Yayoi will discover terrifying truths about why they experience these visions..they do correlate with that hotel and we watch in disturbing detail as those events from 1970 unfold.I think both JuonThe Grudge  Marebito were stepping stones to reach Takashi Shimizu's masterpieceRinneReincarnation. He takes cryptomnesia phenomenon..or the idea of a past life viewed as a symptomand spins it as an unpleasant horror tale where those who are the proponentsthe human body is just a vesselof this are stuck with having to carry the burden of reliving the same grim fates of their predecessors.

The final closing minutes as Nagisa discovers whose reincarnated spirit represents her and those who seek after her is quite unsettling and haunting.

Although the description of the film may seem bloody and gory it was not necessarily the most explicitly violent movie i've seen. But it is by far one of the most psychological and suspenseful horror films i've yet seen. Let's just say I had at least two nightmares inspired by it but it's a good thing. The movie was well worth the scare as it was a masterpiece in its storytelling and how it pulls the audience into the film. I've just recently seen it in a film festival and i'm now ready to buy it on DVD.Rinne deals with the topic of reincarnation. If you like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining then you'll definitely love this film as it has similar creepy scenes of a hotel with little kids running around in it as well as visitors getting possessed by former guests at the hotel. But this film was 10 times scarier as you bare witness to the former killings through a poor quality homemade film reel created by the killer as he went on a rampage as well as flashbacks that surprise and confuse the audience with everincreasing plot twists. Watch out for faces in the forests and stay away from the hotel if you can hehe. There was one point in the film when my hand became numb as I didn't realize that i was gripping my seat so tightly as Shimezu did a great job in creating a foreboding atmosphere. Don't worry about getting jolted out of your seat by unfair surprise images popping out at you. Movies are scary when they do that but the feeling is only ephemeral. The uniqueness of Rinne is that much of the horror is implicit and created in your mind. One more thing. Shimezu Takashi was the director of Juon or it's American remake the Grudge. I haven't seen it but after watching Rinne I definitely want to check it out. It's well worth watching and probably will become a cult classic to share at a party or gettogether with friends and other film enthusiasts.".

The curious use of late 70's era horror music in a number of scenes was rather distracting I thought as it rather sucked back in the day as well. Worse this movie works on a twist and twists can have inherent issues. Movies like the Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects have effective twists as for the average viewer they're not easy to see coming but still logically make sense. Other movies leave you hanging though by either making the twist some manner of illogical impossibility or giving it away far too soon. For me this film spilled the goods far too early.The moment the second girl with memories of the hotel is introduced you're left to ponder if the little girl was reincarnated twice or if the main character in this film is in fact the killer. And you can't ponder that for long because it doesn't make sense. Obviously she's the killer.The isn't the only issue mind you. The fact that this is a film about reincarnation is a head scratcher since the reincarnated spirits exist as people now...but also as spirits still. And they're jerk spirits. Ghost stories always bug me a little if I think too hard about what possible motivation the ghosts have for acting like jerks all the time but it takes the cake in this movie. They work as a group to inexplicably kidnap andor marginally possess the people they already are? I'm not sure what's happening there to be honest.If they wanted to punish the spirit of their killer that's fine but why kill damn near a dozen innocent people in the process? Of course then there's the whole issue of the curious morality of the story anyway. The killer is reincarnated so now this poor girl has to be tortured in a nuthouse for the rest of her life. Well that's what you get for being born I guess. Kind of a flat ending if you ask me.Overall not a great movie but it has some good ambiance.".

Intense director Ikuo Matsumura an excellent performance by Kippei Shiina takes the cast and crew to the hotel to shoot the picture.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie Rinne also known as Reincarnation is truly a psychological horror. I watched this movie in Hong Kong in it's original Japanese with Chinese subtitles with a friend and half the time my hands were covering my eyes. It's not because it was a truly terrifying scene but just the fact that it had surprising elements that made it into a really freaky movie.I'll try to give a trailer summary without spoiling anything The story involves a bunch of characters in which the main character an actress begins to have hallucinations. She constantly sees a little girl holding a creepy looking doll typical horror item whom no one else notices. As the story progresses she's hired to act in a horror film that is based on a true story where a crazy professor has killed eleven people in a hotel. While acting she notices strange things seeing things that shouldn't be there and causes her to have a very bad feeling about the entire movie. At the same time another girl is convinced she's having memories from a previous life as she has had dreams about the same hotel ever since she was a young girl though she's never actually been there. So she begins to search for an answer. The music is absolutely killer it's really a perfect match to the movie. I find the actual storyline rather confusing unless you have actually seen the movie trying to read summaries of the story will be rather difficult. It has pretty good twists as the film moves along some of them are just so unexpected. I guess that's what makes it good. The process of filming was pretty well done switching from one filming element to another type. To be honest I'm still influenced by the psychological horror portrayed by the characters. Late at night I'm unwilling to turn off the light for fear of having to encounter a jochan and her ningyen. The doll is truly horrific. Go watch it! I'm sure you will be thoroughly surprised.".

As part of the filming the director crew and cast go to the actual hotel in which the multiple murders occurred. The main character is the female lead in the film. Almost from the start of the project she begins to have visions or hallucinations. She sees people who no one else sees. When the crew arrives at the hotel her visions become more extreme and frequent. You sort of understand what this film is about when it is over however the ending left me confused. This is not a haunted house or slasher horror film. Most of it takes place in daylight. Do not expect scantily clad bimbos or knifewielding maniacs to jump out from the closet. The story reminded me somewhat of the Roman Polanski film Repulsion about a woman who goes mad and has hallucinations. Overall I thought the film was on the slow side. In its favor it is not one of the gross torture porn flicks that are destroying the horror genre.".

Though I'm sure it will.Those hoping for an unremitting orgy of blood guts and violence will be left disappointed. Nonetheless there are still a few scenes here not suited to the squeamish well a child DOES get stabbed. This film is more about subtle scares and the power of suggestion which is usually one of the most effective ways of cranking up the tension but here they are guilty of overusing the ploy in a predictable way. For example how many times does a character need to be unsettled by something they've seen out of the corner of their eye? What really does make this film work is the combination of very good storytelling and a direction that lends it a very dark and intense feel which never lets go. The characters are mostly just an extension of the general mood and atmosphere of the movie. Under Shimizu's guidance it is the supernatural that takes centre stage.Reincarnation seems longer than its 95 minutes running time but it's worth sticking with it for a satisfying conclusion that you may want to relive again.Mark 710 Mel Dixon".

	schema:headline " An intelligent and creepy supernatural mystery in the Kubrick tradition.";
	schema:reviewBody "Many years ago a series of terrible murders took place at a particular hotel. These acts of homicide were executed by a professor undertaking an experiment concerning the idea of reincarnation. Some years later a horror movie director decides to make a film about the massacre. As he starts the production a young actress hired to take on the leading role becomes haunted by the souls of the murdered victims. Portraying the little girl who was the final victim of the massacre the actress Nagisa starts to believe that she is in some way the reincarnation of this character. That is until she goes to the place where the young girl was killed and finds someone else there instead...The thing I like best about Japanese horror is the sense of atmosphere. The use of lingering slow burning tension when a character approaches a closed door and we know they shouldn't open it but we still want them too regardless! For me it's everything that horror should be. No gratuitous gore no shock MTV style montages just a slow lingering feeling of dread that grows with intensity from one scene to the next. It also helps that the majority of these films are directed with flair and imagination whilst for the most part offering us intelligent characters and interesting scenarios. With this in mind Reincarnation 2005 is really one of the best Jhorror films I've experienced so far which is probably to be expected given the fact that it comes from the esteemed producer of The Ring 1998 and the highly acclaimed writerdirector of The Grudge 2000. The film builds on the style and ideas we've come to expect from films like Ring or Dark Water 2000 as well as other Asian productions such as The Eye 2002 and Bangkok Haunted 2001 with the bookish central character being drawn into a series of supernatural events that are seemingly beyond their control. Alongside this set up we also have further allusions to Stanley Kubrick's watershed ghost story The Shining 1980 with the use of the old abandoned hotel acting as the central focal point but with an added texture given to the proceedings with the notion of a film crew capturing the action creating something of a film within a film motif.This is something that director Takashi Shimizu developed with the original Japanese version of Ju On The Grudge 2 2003 which also involved the supernatural goings on that occur during the shooting of a film about a horrific murder. Alongside this his 2004 experimental metafilm Marebito also involves ideas of sight and perception with the central character of that particular film capturing his descent into fear and paranoia on a handheld digital video camera. So like those films Reincarnation is playing with the audience's notion of perception and how we see things... all of which is very important when we come to analyse the sub textual implications of the story at the end of the film. There is a also a great deal of doubling going on here doubling of character and events that we would expect from a film that deals with spirits and reincarnation as well as more psychological ideas about paranoia insanity fear etc.Like all the great Asian horror films or any great horror film in general for that matter it is the story that pulls us in but the great use of atmosphere that keeps us enthralled until the very end. Despite a brief setback with the interesting but not entirely successful Marebito as well as a career sideline in remaking his own films for the American market Shimizu is still an absolute master when it comes to creating mood and delivering the kind of slow burning chills that creep up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head. The scene in Ju On The Grudge in which the wife crawls down the stairs with that truly horrific look of torture in her eyes is one of the defining horror moments of this decade for me and Reincarnation comes incredibly close to topping that with a truly intense final thirtyminutes in which the character's back stories are revealed and retribution dealt out! Although some critical opinion has been mixed no doubt due to the overexposure of JapaneseAsian horror cinema over the last five or six years and in particular from tepid American remakes I feel that Reincarnation is a genuinely good supernatural ghost story that should appeal to anyone with an interest in horror that doesn't involve buckets of blood and severed limbs.Alongside Reincarnation you can also find two other films from the same producer Taka Ichise which both cover similar stories and ideas as the film in question. These films Infection 2003 directed by Masayuki Ochiai and Premonition 2004 directed by Tsuruta Norio were meant to be part of the larger Jhorror collection involving different supernaturalthemed films directed by some of Japan's most creative genre filmmakers which at the time of writing has subsequently been aborted. Regardless if you like Reincarnation and appreciate the slowburning sense of psychological and supernatural dread then Infection and Premonition are both worth checking out. For me though Reincarnation is probably the best of the bunch with Shimizu creating a fine little horror film with a cool Kubrickian approach to direction and miseenscene and a slow building and genuinely quite creepy atmosphere of dread and uncertainty.If you're already fond of Asian supernatural cinema from classics like Kwaidan 1964 The Face of Another 1966 and Kuroneko 1968 right the way through to recent hallmarks such as The Ring trilogy Dark Water The GrudgeThe Curse series The Eye trilogy The Quiet Family 1998 and a Tale of Two Sisters 2003 then Reincarnation is one film that is well worth checking out.".

Despite a brief setback with the interesting but not entirely successful Marebito as well as a career sideline in remaking his own films for the American market Shimizu is still an absolute master when it comes to creating mood and delivering the kind of slow burning chills that creep up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head. The scene in Ju On The Grudge in which the wife crawls down the stairs with that truly horrific look of torture in her eyes is one of the defining horror moments of this decade for me and Reincarnation comes incredibly close to topping that with a truly intense final thirtyminutes in which the character's back stories are revealed and retribution dealt out! Although some critical opinion has been mixed no doubt due to the overexposure of JapaneseAsian horror cinema over the last five or six years and in particular from tepid American remakes I feel that Reincarnation is a genuinely good supernatural ghost story that should appeal to anyone with an interest in horror that doesn't involve buckets of blood and severed limbs.Alongside Reincarnation you can also find two other films from the same producer Taka Ichise which both cover similar stories and ideas as the film in question. These films Infection 2003 directed by Masayuki Ochiai and Premonition 2004 directed by Tsuruta Norio were meant to be part of the larger Jhorror collection involving different supernaturalthemed films directed by some of Japan's most creative genre filmmakers which at the time of writing has subsequently been aborted. Regardless if you like Reincarnation and appreciate the slowburning sense of psychological and supernatural dread then Infection and Premonition are both worth checking out. For me though Reincarnation is probably the best of the bunch with Shimizu creating a fine little horror film with a cool Kubrickian approach to direction and miseenscene and a slow building and genuinely quite creepy atmosphere of dread and uncertainty.If you're already fond of Asian supernatural cinema from classics like Kwaidan 1964 The Face of Another 1966 and Kuroneko 1968 right the way through to recent hallmarks such as The Ring trilogy Dark Water The GrudgeThe Curse series The Eye trilogy The Quiet Family 1998 and a Tale of Two Sisters 2003 then Reincarnation is one film that is well worth checking out.";

I've never seen his other stuff but I guess he was at the helm fro the groundbreaking The Grudge. This one is about the filming of a movie based on a mass killingsuicide done at a hotel. There was only one survivor but many of the characters are connected to the incident because they are reincarnated versions of those who died. The main character who wins an important role of the youngest one killed begins having dreams and seeing visions after receiving the script. As each scene passes we start seeing how others are connected to the story. There are actually three movies involved here  the actual movie we're watching the making of the movie and the film made by the killer. The killer made a film supposedly because he wanted to prove his reincarnation theory and would be viewed by those reincarnated I guess. We really don't find out who's who until near the end of the movie which is the mystery behind the movie. The chills are done in the context of the story which makes the movie interesting instead of it just being a slasher film like American audiences are used to. OK so the Japanese are again better at something than we are  OK not better just different. All in all this is definitely an enjoyable and scary movie to watch but beware you may have nightmares after it's over.".

Instead it makes us able to laugh at those strange days with the nostalgic music balanced by fastedited and ironicsatiric pictures. And don't forget even if those were quite dark ages for a country still those people who were young in those ages could and had to find the fun in the thenpresent conditions. Whoever whenever and wherever grows up usually remembers his young ages as something nice even if they know that age was not politically correct at all.

	schema:reviewBody "Like Hungarian goulash Hungarian film is hearty stuff that sticks to your ribs. And Robert Koltai's latest work May Day Mayhem does indeed fill your plate yet doesn't leave you feeling too full just pleasantly satisfied.In May Day Mayhem Koltai stars as the delightfully mischievous Chocho a simple man born into complicated times. Set in post World War II Hungary May Day Mayhem opens up to show Chocho as a political prisoner locked away in a gulag for committing crimes against the State. Actually what he did was sing a few songs that were deemed antiCommunist. However Chocho is needed as he is the town's only hope to properly organize the May Day parade. He's also the only one who can keep the town's hapless soccer team focused long enough to win the championship game.And so we go following Koltai's Chocho from one curious happenstance to another rooting for Chocho the way we root for Buffalo in the Super Bowl. Koltai both as an actor and a director insinuates himself so cleverly and yet so gently that we are ashamed when we lose faith even for a moment. Unfortunately we do lose a bit of faith the film lacks the structural perfection necessary to keep us fully engaged with all the subplots. However Koltai doesn't lose complete control and the movie never really suffers. It's just that the second half lacks the perfection that was evident during the first half.Now on to the positives which are plentiful.The acting by the principles is excellent with a few standouts worth noting. One of them is Adel Kovats who plays the wife of the central KGB officer Lt. Colonel Gubinyi. Kovats is reminiscent of a young Shirley MacLaine both in her beauty and in the depth of her acting performance. Kovats will receive awards for this performance and is absolutely worth the price of admission.The writing is also excellent subtle and charming. In fact there is one moment of brilliance where Chocho tells a simple story intent on being pithy and disarming. But as it unfolds the story becomes a parable for the oppression of the Hungarian people. As the story goes a man is at his farmhouse where his wife is upstairs in labor. However out in the barn there is a fire building. So he has to make a decision Does he stay with his wife to help her give birth? Or does he save the cows in the barn? When it is over the baby is born the barn has burned down but the cows are safe. Why did he save the cows? Because says Chocho the cows wouldn't ever leave the barn and the baby would come no matter what else was happening. It is simple to see the parallel to the heartbreaking events surrounding the innocent victims of Stalin's reign over Hungary.".

	schema:headline " Austrian Cinema's Landmark Treasure of Glamour Feelings and Developing Self";
	schema:reviewBody "Proud of my achievements? Being humble is all that is left to me in this. Paula Wessely MASQUERADE IN VIENNA from the screen play by Walter Reisch is undeniably the most famous film that stars Paula Wessely the actress whom Sir Laurence Olivier appreciated as a film actress among the greatest ones of the twentieth century whose performances were studied by Bette Davis. And indeed her captivating performance in MASQUERADE constitutes a significant factor why the film is so much worth viewing and recently released on DVD. Yet before some deeper consideration of her charming portrayal let me address some other aspects that make this movie a pinnacle of both Austrian and European filmmaking.Willi Forst's movie is one of these cinematic treasures that appears to be clear entertaining artistic and respectful towards viewers. Actually much of its charm we owe to Willi Forst and Walter Reisch two people who had a decisive presence in the Austrian cinema of that time. After Forst's debut LEISE FLEHEN MEINE LIEDER about the composer Franz Schubert MASQUERADE brilliantly combines the lovable comedy with some dramatic tensions presents to us the atmosphere of Viennese society and within... a story of an unexpected feeling between two people who met in the most unpredictable circumstances and who overcome all and breathe life into everything including the coldest conventions. The movie clearly manifests a unique genre that is to be called a Wiener Film and explores the undeniable talent of Mr Forst one of the greatest directors who came from Austria except for Billy Wilder. Robert Von Dassanowsky nicely refers to this director in his book AUSTRIAN CINEMA seeing him Forst as one of its greatest filmmakers...and one more casualty from the negligence that has greeted Austrian cinema since the 1950s p.49.The whole atmosphere of the film can boast of truly innovative camerawork that appears remarkable in many memorable moments and Franz Planer's cinematography. It stirs and teases viewers' attention in a captivating manner. There is wit and symbolism. Consider the hilarious moment of how people read and spread a gossip...with animal sounds. Moreover the number of juxtaposing images together with certain closeups including feet and steps the static camera at ball scenes the lighting on Paula Wessely's face as well as some highlighted pieces of wardrobe a chinchilla muff that plays a decisive role in the storyline are only some of the significant visual merits. Some moments are so beautifully photographed that you can hardly find something equal elsewhere. What I mean here are three scenes the mask ball the tea party at Fuerstin and the blissful finale not to spoil much... just consider the use of snow. A bonus for curiosity and entertainment is added by Enrico Caruso's voice recorded on soundtrack. However let me now refer to perhaps the crucial virtue of MASQUERADE  performances or rather the Performance of PAULA WESSELY.I have discovered Ms Wessely thanks to my friend and MASQUERADE was my first encounter with this wonderful Viennese actress. I was overwhelmed by her performance. Yes after all these years she still enchants us and still touches us. Why? Because her role of one Miss Leopoldine Dur a name picked randomly and hilariously is so genuine and her performance so heartfelt. She convincingly portrays 'Die Kleine Person' a little person who barely represents the glamor of the high society yet a young person who once starts to believe in herself and pushes through to meet her destiny. 'Can an artist find any inspiration in a kind of person I am? A shy little innocent person while there are so many prettier ones? Why me? Actually WHY NOT...ME? The character partly resembles Ms Wessely herself who wins our hearts not by the distance and selfrespect but openness and respect towards others towards people her viewers she has always searched...and found. Besides her scene at the mirror that appears to be a sort of turning point for the entire story and particularly for her character her best scene includes the innocent entrance into the artist's studio with quite different expectations than what she found out actually and scenes she plays opposite Olga Tschechowa near the final moment.Other cast constitute no lesser effect. While Wessely's leading man Anton Walbrook as Heideneck does not captivate us to the extent we would perhaps wish...their scenes are worth consideration. Among many it is foremost the lovely waltz scene that has become in a way a landmark of the film much due to the aforementioned excellent camerawork. Mr Walbrook if not a captivating leading man for Wessely occurs to be acceptable at least. From the supporting cast the performances that deserve highest attention are Peter Petersen's Professor Carl Harrandt whose pride has to face doubts anger and compassion Walter Janssen's court opera director whose wit makes for the crucial humor of the script Hilde Von Stolz's sweet blonde Gerda whose interest is directed solely onto the artist rather than art Julie Serda Junkermann's Fuerstin M. who is only capable of looking at 'good old times' not seeing the positive events that may happen in the times of her elderly life Hans Moser as Herr Zacharias with his Viennese accent and some typical wit that appears to be a sort of irreplaceable entertainment. Finally it is Olga Tschechowa whose villainous intrigues make for an unexpected climax of events. Indeed the muff was there for...something...MASQUERADE is a highly recommended film a milestone among Austrian cinematic achievements a beautiful story of love where the mask of all social jealousy strict conventions and anger give in before the genuine feeling which makes all things as pure as snow. But MASQUERADE for me constitutes yet another pearl something more than just a great film...a loving memory of Paula Wessely whom people still discover though she is with us in a different way.".

	onyx:emotionText "Proud of my achievements? Being humble is all that is left to me in this. Paula Wessely MASQUERADE IN VIENNA from the screen play by Walter Reisch is undeniably the most famous film that stars Paula Wessely the actress whom Sir Laurence Olivier appreciated as a film actress among the greatest ones of the twentieth century whose performances were studied by Bette Davis. And indeed her captivating performance in MASQUERADE constitutes a significant factor why the film is so much worth viewing and recently released on DVD. Yet before some deeper consideration of her charming portrayal let me address some other aspects that make this movie a pinnacle of both Austrian and European filmmaking.Willi Forst's movie is one of these cinematic treasures that appears to be clear entertaining artistic and respectful towards viewers.

The camera darts with ease through ballroom scenes connecting the eyelines of characters as they scope each other's movements. He laces the film with clever tricks both visual dialogues filmed in silhouette and aural a montage of citizens making animal sounds while reading the gossip pages. Driving everything is a buoyant soundtrack of 19th century waltzes and opera whose lilting rhythms can be found in the film's pacing even when the music subsides.

Several strangers near by turned to one anther with the same question on their lips Is it just me or was that the best movie we've ever seen?' Quickly the electricity zoomed around the room and it was confirmed! The rapturous talk about this film spread like wild fire. IT'S A CHARMING MASTERPIECE! Now I'm a student of Ernst Lubitsch Frank Capra and Billy Wilder and this film should be shown again to the public where they too can celebrate this delightful film on par with the work of these masters.  Lets all support classic film and the screening of movies on the big screen where they were meant to be seen. And let's all support the film archives who's job it is to find preserve and present these forgotten wonders of early cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "Not quite what the legend surrounding it would lead you to believe Maskerade is a quite predictable movie in a Schnitzlerian mode stylistically akin to any of a number of better Max Ophuls movies of its time e.g. Liebelei La Signora di Tutti not to speak of such later Ophuls masterpieces as La Ronde or Madame de.

But this is also almost the only positive achievement I can mention about this movie. The writer and director is Willi Forst one of the most prolific and successful Austrian filmmakers of his time. But his effort here does not get me interested in checking out more of his works. The cast includes a handful actors who were successful and prolific too back then but the performances are all mediocre at best and the script is soso as well. I cannot say I cared a lot for any of the protagonists and I did not find the film funny either although there are many sequences where it attempts to be. Same can be said about the romance aspect. In general this film lacks expertise and a defining touch in most areas. I do not recommend the watch. The only maybe good thing is that it is not Nazi propaganda despite being from 1934.".

Rosa von Praunheim a former underground filmmaker has been breaking cinematic sexual taboos these past two decades. Von Praunheim's made in Berlin avantgardism gives him much common ground with Hirschfeld. So much so that major European institutions lent their financing to von Praunheim's first mainstream film. In THE EINSTEIN OF SEX von Praunheim mixes what is really known about Dr. Hirschfeld with actual newsreel footage of the 19101934 period and adds trademark von Praunheim humor to fill in the unknown details. The true to life location shots those of Berlin and the Vorpommern Baltic coast in particularare used to good effect. The result is a crowd pleaser as the film's ranking in the top ten of audience votes in the recent Sao Paulo Film Festival see mostra.org will confirm. That's where I just saw it so it was no surprise to see it listed on the Festival's top ten audience vote. Many von Praunheim purists however may feel the director sold out to the conventional European film funds German state sponsorship and cable TV companies who coproduced the project. More conservative audiences may feel offended by the contents though quite tame by von Praunheim standards. Nevertheless the film is legitimized by the appearance of several of Germany's bestknown actors in supporting and cameo roles including Ben and Merrit Becker of the COMEDIAN HARMONISTS and solid technical standards.".

Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld a Jewish homosexual set up an Institute in 1921 to research problems concerned with sexuality.  This was an unexplored field.  People from all over Europe consulted him about their own sexual problems including the young Austrian Baron Hermann von Teschenberg who became his lover.  In 1933 the Nazis destroyed the Institute of Sexual Science. Research papers and museum pieces were lost for ever.  Male nudity in this film is acceptable because it is relevant to the subject.  The museum is filled with phallic objects carved from ivory penis protectors from Papua New Guinea an intriguing masturbation contraption which perhaps is the forerunner of the modern vibrator tattooed testicles belonging to the Chinese emperor's brother and other socalled sinful objects.  All this is portrayed in a clinical and straight forward manner. The good doctor is called upon to do surgery and one can get a bit squeamish when he goes to work on the transvestite Dorchen or the removal of a penis from a pleading hermaphrodite.  It seemed to me it was executed with a very quick snip done under the most unhygienic conditions.  Some of the other characters worthy of mention are the young Karl Giese Hirschfeld's lover who fights a losing battle to protect the Institute from the Nazi madness and Adolph Brand an important gay rightwing writer who writes extravagant poetry about the physical beauty of German youth.  Direrctor Rosa von Praunheim has done a magnificent job in bringing the life and work of Dr. Hirschfeld to the screen.  It is a frank and honest approach and it is not without its little touches of humour.  This film is worthy of attention.  It's one of the most entertaining I've seen for a long time.  How nice it is to see something very different. I rank it high on my list of favourites.".

Who developed theories explaining human sexuality 60 years before Kinsey. Von Pranheim gives us a drama with a touch of sense of humor like for example when Magnus takes the chief of police to all the gay places in town and makes him dance with his transvestite collaborator! Other sweet moments are when Magnus masturbates using an antique plugged onto his penis or when he invites the visitors of the institution to feel the warmth of a giant penis carved out of an elephant's horn. Praunheim doesn't save on commentary and opinion either he ridicules the role of the so called male homosexuals that follow the Greek tradition and reject sissies and fairies by showing the excessively strong handshake and their failed bravery they go to war and get killed through which they seek to overcompensate for their sexual orientation. It's also notable how he puts his transvestite maid Dorchen in a role where she makes herself get respected by the Nazi youth towards the end. The director isn't short on explicit images he's not afraid of showing nude men closeups of genitalia or a scene of spanking this is also a way of protesting against the conventionalism and censorship that cinema imposes on itself in order to appeal to the masses. Despite being a low budget telefilm with subpar photography and camera work I think this movie is a jewel of freedom irony and shows the style of a director that within the kitsch is also as advocate as Magnus Hirschfield himself was for the rights of the LGBT community.".

	schema:headline " Not the Einstein of filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Der Einstein des Sex or The Einstein of Sex is a German 95minute movie from 1999 so not too long anymore and this one will have its 20th anniversary. The director is Rosa von Praunheim and one of the two writers is Valentin Passoni who worked with RvP on many occasions. The other writer is Chris Kraus a fairly successful German writer who also made the script for 4 Minuten for example. This film here is the story of Magnus Hirschfeld and I am certain that he would not really be too well entertained by watching this one. Of course there are many people less deserving of a film like the German sexual equality pioneer from the late 19th and early 20th century but you also have to deliver quality and I don't believe this is the film that Hirschfeld deserved. I did not feel as if we learned half of the things we should learn about the man during this film. Instead it was filled with homosexual stereotypes from start to finish be it in terms of how they looked acted and talked. And yes we already know there was discrimination back then and the way this part was depicted in here also offered really anything new or particularly creative. And everybody with minimal interest in Nazi Germany knows how Nazis thought about samesex relationships so scenes of Nazis beating up gays added nothing memorable either just went for cheap shock and thrill moments. The lead actor is Kai Schumann and despite the heavy makeup he rarely never makes a lasting impression and I am not surprised that he has not been a lead in other memorable German films. Maybe the problem here is the writing. Rosa von Praunheim usually was at least cowriter in his own movies and here according to IMDb he had no role in the creative process of the script. It is a bit of a pity as you rarely never find mainstream movies by von Praunheim who is a very successful indie filmmaker in his own right. But if he has a shot at stardom like this film here it's really sad to see it turn out so generic and forgettable. Also the inclusion of known actors like Otto Sander his children Ben and Meret Becker and Wolfgang Vlz added almost nothing of value here. Thumbs down. I don't recommend the watch.".

The movie paints the entire gamut of emotional family experience with delicate yet powerful brush strokes but it's not a sentimental film nor an opportunity for actors to grandstand. It's Japanese so all the strong undercurrents of emotion are held in check by equally powerful restraint both cultural and directorial. A brother and a sister attempting families of their own go to visit their parents in Yokohama. The parents have lost a son and the family's devastation hangs heavy in the air. You can actually feel it bearing down on your shoulders from the first frame. Anybody who has ever spent the night at the house of relatives will feel the weight of family history that this film captures so truthfully.The parents are engulfed by their quiet ongoing grief and the surviving children resent all the attention given to the one who is not there anymore. The movie is surprisingly mordant touching cruel sad funny human. The mother is this wonderful woman who cooks up a storm I so wanted to be invited to that house. She is from an older generation which means she has been forever in the shadow of her husband the doctor cooking and cleaning and feeding the children but she is not a pushover nor a saint. She is mischievous catty and petty prejudiced funny generous and cruel at the same time. She is a marvel and the actress who plays her is astonishing.This movie has many emotional surprises that make the audience gasp but they are presented with a sure light touch never falling into easy sentiment never shying away from human complexity. It's a film about family and love and duty and regret and it is stunningly beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few other nations can capture the beauty of family drama with such subtlety and grace as the Japanese can. Perhaps it is a blessed legacy left behind by the master Yasujiro Ozu who in his lifetime made over 50 films all of which are family dramas that often dealt with generational gaps. Japan more than any other nation struggles with the problem of generational gap being a nation that has continued to endure conflict between the young and the old the traditional and the modern. Stepping into Ozu's shoes is the acclaimed director Koreeda Hirokazu whose films Nobody Knows and After Life has already garnered universal praises.Still Walking begins as a family reunites to commemorate the death of one of its members. With new members joining the family and old wounds resurfacing everyone tries their best to pass the two day gathering with as little problem as possible. Sounds simple doesn't it?

	onyx:emotionText "Few other nations can capture the beauty of family drama with such subtlety and grace as the Japanese can. Perhaps it is a blessed legacy left behind by the master Yasujiro Ozu who in his lifetime made over 50 films all of which are family dramas that often dealt with generational gaps. Japan more than any other nation struggles with the problem of generational gap being a nation that has continued to endure conflict between the young and the old the traditional and the modern. Stepping into Ozu's shoes is the acclaimed director Koreeda Hirokazu whose films Nobody Knows and After Life has already garnered universal praises.Still Walking begins as a family reunites to commemorate the death of one of its members. With new members joining the family and old wounds resurfacing everyone tries their best to pass the two day gathering with as little problem as possible. Sounds simple doesn't it? Well therein lies the plain and subtle beauty of the film.

Selected as the best film at the Toronto International Film Festival in a poll of film critics and bloggers Hirokazu Koreeda's Still Walking is a familyoriented comedydrama about generational conflict and the consequences of loss. Unfolding in real time over a twentyfour hour period it has been compared to Ozu's Tokyo Story in its intimate interchanges that accurately capture the way families relate to each other but lacks Ozu's warmth and subtlety.The day is spent with routine activities such as preparing meals and playing with the small children. Kyohei remains detached and hides in his office pretending to be occupied with medical business. He only emerges to bicker with his wife Kiki Kinn and play with his grandson. Ryoto who did not look forward to the reunion is put off by his father's disdain for his profession of art restoration and his coolness toward his new wife Yukari Yui Natsukawa. She craves acceptance for herself and her son Atsushi Shoehi Tanaka from a previous marriage in which her husband died. A picture of the deceased Junpei is placed in the center of the Yokoyama family house reminding Ryoto that whatever he does he cannot measure up to Junpei who was to be his father's heir.He also notices that his sister Chinami You has no such expectations and her life with her carsalesman husband and two children seems outside of the range of family conflicts. When the boy that Junpei rescued visits the family sneering remarks are made about his bulky frame and lack of ambition and old resentments come to the surface. After Chinami and her family leave it is clear that Ryoto wishes he had not agreed to spend the night but conflicts seem to soften with the passage of time. Based on a novel by the director and occasioned by the death of his mother and the discussions of his childhood they had during her last days Still Walking has a sense of naturalism and simplicity that is endearing.".

This is a masterly film by Koreeda following an ordinary middle class Japanese family has they have an annual reunion to commemorate the older brother who died rescuing a boy from drowning. In its slow gentle poetic way this film brings us into the heart of the family so well you feel it is your own  indeed the characters are so real so richly portrayed that you almost come to believe you know them as well as your own family.A simple plot prcis doesn't do justice to what this film is about. It shines a light into those repressed areas of resentment sentimentality nostalgia guilt and desire that are so often hidden behind a facade of politeness. Koreeda is too subtle a director to have any big blow ups or surprises  he reveals his characters in a gentle manner as detail is laid upon detail. When the ending comes it is not a surprise but it is still profoundly moving and thought provoking. This is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.A lot has been made about the films debt to Ozu. I think this is very overstated  although there are one or two stylistic nods to Ozu at the beginning Koreeda is a very different type of film maker. Unlike Ozu he uses tiny surreal moments of beauty to contrast with the realism of the rest of the film. His use of editing and camera work is far less formal and rigorous  instead he allows the camera to follow the characters revealing the layers of the home. And most importantly while Ozu emphasised the death of the traditional Japanese family and considered it with sad resignation Koreeda sees families as all alike stuck in a series of inescapable cycles. In many respects this film reminded me more of some of Naruse's classic films than Ozu.The cast is uniformly excellent with Kiki Kirin utterly wonderful as the grandmother. The only very small quibble I have with the casting is that Koreeda succumbed somewhat to casting some characters who are a little too elegant and good looking for the 'normal' people they portray. Hiroshi Abe and Yui Natsukata are maybe a little too good looking to be convincing as the less than 100 welcome family members. But that is a very minor criticism of what is a terrific ensemble piece.I think this film is one of the finest of the year and may well come to be seen as a classic. It can certainly sit comfortably with any of the great films of Japans golden era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I very much enjoyed Nobody Knows Dare Mo Shiranai and After Life Wonderful Life immensely and found another good and engaging movie with Still Walking. Kore Eda seems to be in a small group of directors who use minimal music and other traditional movie elements in order to convey the story to the viewer. Just as talking in a low voice will elicit the heightened command of a listener so too does Kore Eda use subtle dialogue and action to focus the viewers attention to what's going on.I can totally relate to the family in Still Walking because they come across as anyone's family. Literally. I felt as though I could have been watching my own family and not some Japanese family to whom I could not relate. All the elements are there from the bigcity adult children coming to visit their smalltown parents with their children en tow. The interplay between the fast pace of urban life and slow pace of rural life meet somewhere in the middle. Throughout I felt as I usually do in a Kore Eda movie a silent and invisible observer.The premise of the movie is that the family gathers together once a year on the anniversary of the death of the eldest son who we learn had drowned saving the life of another person who himself was attempting to commit suicide by drowning in the sea. As you may know in Japanese society if you save the life of someone who wishes to commit suicide you effectively are responsible for their life going forward. In this case the person doing the saving the eldest son had died in the process. So we see the person who he saved return year after year to be reminded in an indebted but somewhat cruel manner that he is alive and that he will be for the rest of the parent's of deceased lives be required to suffer the cultural humility of being alive while their son is dead.We also see the typical social dilemma of what to do as ones aging parents and additional interplay between the surviving son and his new but widowed wife and her child. We've seen the transaction a million times in other movies mother in law has her comments and opinions wife complains to the husband about her and her son's treatment son has to either stand up to the parents or find some middle ground.All in all it's well played out and I was very pleased by this film. It's an amalgam of growth change sacrifice forgiveness and the road we all have to travel as we get older or if we have children ourselves. Oddly though the film's title doesn't make sense until near the end of the movie.".

He competes with not one ghost but two  his brother and his wife's first husband. Who can shine in comparison with martyrs?Families can be joyous and awful and Koreeda captures that to a tee. The film seems to go on a beat too long past a line on the bus that seems the natural ending but then the final narration reminiscent of Twilight Samurai and graveside scene pull it all together poignantly. Granddad thinks they will be back at New Year  they won't. Chinami thinks her mother wants them to move in  she doesn't. Yoshio thinks he is welcome every year  he isn't. Families are destined to misunderstand each other.

	schema:headline " A subtle exploration of bereavement and family dysfunction.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Still Walking' the stunning new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda begins with a premise so stale and overused that to read a plot synopsis of the movie is discouraging enough to prevent you from seeing it. A family reuniting for the anniversary of a loved one's death is nothing new in the world of cinema and American TV movies have been churning out cloying sickeningly saccharine variations on it for the past fifty years. Yet here is a film so refreshing and truthful that it restores your faith almost completely in the domestic drama.The similarities to Ozu are obvious had this been directed by him it might stand quite comfortably alongside his masterpieces. The comparisons that have been made between the great Japanese director and Koreeda are fully deserved. Like Ozu he makes extensive and inventive use of a stationary camera always arranging his shots to perfection often after a moment of discussion or 'drama' we are taken away from the characters and the camera lingers providing a seemingly superfluous shot. This was an Ozu trademark and it is used with reverence here at times the camera focuses on seemingly trivial things such as broken bath tiles or a flower in a glass pale in the twilight. It allows us to digest what we have seen. The detail in his shots is quietly breathtaking Koreeda has an eye for family meals and rituals in particular and these scenes are handled masterfully.The film follows Ryota his wife and his stepson as they return to his parents' home on the anniversary of his elder brother Junpei's death. It is gradually revealed that he was drowned while rescuing a young boy now grown older. In Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' it was the parents who were the caring couple becoming victims of their children's' greed and selfishness in their old age here it is the parents who bicker both with themselves and their children making petty insinuations due to their outdated ideals and the tragedy they have suffered it is their living children who suffer as a result. Yet there are no earth shattering arguments among smashed crockery and very rarely a raised voice by the time we meet these people the arguments are past only to be replaced by stifled politeness and bitter mutterings. They have settled into a routine it is at once their refuge and their weapon their greatest ailment but their only means of communication. If it weren't for the fact that it was Ryota's duty to return home each year on the anniversary of his brother's death he might never return at all his father quietly chastises him for never calling his mother to which Ryota's reply is that she always complains when he does.How wise this film is in comparison to so many of its counterparts where oversimplified long standing feuds are rectified in a single visit! This film is far too mature to fall into that trap. It contains layer upon layer of characterisation we get the sense that what we are seeing is a real family not a TV cardboard cut out. Their issues are buried deep in the past and as Koreeda notices it is almost always the tiny minute details that a family argues about  often referenced briefly and indirectly. And what an abundance of these we see some never explained it is through these microscopic specifics that Koreeda with delicate precision provides insight into his characters and their lives the fact that the old patriarch a retired doctor refuses to go shopping because he is too proud to be seen by his neighbours carrying a shopping bag the fact that his wife would have preferred her son to marry a divorced woman rather that a widow. These are some of the more trivial. There are mounds to discover.Perhaps the finest scene in the film is one in which Ryota and his mother Toshiko are talking in the kitchen together. It is nearly the end of the day and Ryota will be leaving in the morning. Earlier in the afternoon the boy that Junpei saved when he drowned visited to pay his respects. We learn that he does this every year as Toshiko always invites him and it is painful to notice the subtle ways in which Toshiko with a sympathetic smile and polite tone gently treats him with derision and belittles him. In the evening Ryota and Toshika are making small talk about a sumo wrestler. The way in which that small talk gradually leads to Toshiko's painful admission of why she invites the boy every year is so subtle it is almost indiscernible but what an honest heart wrenching cruel admission it is. There is no background music and the camera stationary provides a close up of the side of Toshiko's face downcast as she speaks. It's an amazing scene.And when the twenty four hour visit is over very little is rectified. Meaningless promises are made resentments still fester they are still awkward with each other. These people are desperate and as we begin to learn they want desperately to reach out to each other. But it is too awkward and the honesty it would require would be far too painful. They are distinctly human ignoring the problems and running away. And then of course it's too late and all that's left is the broken pieces and the disappointment. What a sad meditative film this is handled with such astounding tenderness and compassion. But there are bittersweet moments and even hope is to be found here! Far from being simple and cloying this is an extraordinarily complex gem of a film containing emotional truths and nuances that even the longest essay couldn't fully disclose. Words just can't be found to explain some things... and what a mess that fact makes of their lives!".

	onyx:emotionText "'Still Walking' the stunning new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda begins with a premise so stale and overused that to read a plot synopsis of the movie is discouraging enough to prevent you from seeing it. A family reuniting for the anniversary of a loved one's death is nothing new in the world of cinema and American TV movies have been churning out cloying sickeningly saccharine variations on it for the past fifty years. Yet here is a film so refreshing and truthful that it restores your faith almost completely in the domestic drama.The similarities to Ozu are obvious had this been directed by him it might stand quite comfortably alongside his masterpieces. The comparisons that have been made between the great Japanese director and Koreeda are fully deserved. Like Ozu he makes extensive and inventive use of a stationary camera always arranging his shots to perfection often after a moment of discussion or 'drama' we are taken away from the characters and the camera lingers providing a seemingly superfluous shot. This was an Ozu trademark and it is used with reverence here at times the camera focuses on seemingly trivial things such as broken bath tiles or a flower in a glass pale in the twilight. It allows us to digest what we have seen. The detail in his shots is quietly breathtaking Koreeda has an eye for family meals and rituals in particular and these scenes are handled masterfully.The film follows Ryota his wife and his stepson as they return to his parents' home on the anniversary of his elder brother Junpei's death. It is gradually revealed that he was drowned while rescuing a young boy now grown older. In Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' it was the parents who were the caring couple becoming victims of their children's' greed and selfishness in their old age here it is the parents who bicker both with themselves and their children making petty insinuations due to their outdated ideals and the tragedy they have suffered it is their living children who suffer as a result. Yet there are no earth shattering arguments among smashed crockery and very rarely a raised voice by the time we meet these people the arguments are past only to be replaced by stifled politeness and bitter mutterings. They have settled into a routine it is at once their refuge and their weapon their greatest ailment but their only means of communication. If it weren't for the fact that it was Ryota's duty to return home each year on the anniversary of his brother's death he might never return at all his father quietly chastises him for never calling his mother to which Ryota's reply is that she always complains when he does.How wise this film is in comparison to so many of its counterparts where oversimplified long standing feuds are rectified in a single visit! This film is far too mature to fall into that trap. It contains layer upon layer of characterisation we get the sense that what we are seeing is a real family not a TV cardboard cut out. Their issues are buried deep in the past and as Koreeda notices it is almost always the tiny minute details that a family argues about  often referenced briefly and indirectly.

	schema:reviewBody "Still Walking aka Aruitemo Aruitemo Yet another superb delivery from Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda who gave us Nobody Knows in 2004. It's like we're eavesdropping on a private family reunion event. Central to the story is from the viewpoint of the second son Ryota at age 40 going home to his parents' house via public transport with his new wife a widow and her 10 year old son from previous marriage. Yes he doesn't own a car like his sister and brother in law. He's actually wary about hiding the fact that he doesn't have a substantial job and asks his wife not to breathe a word at the family occasion. His parents will be disappointed especially his father who has counted on the second son to take on the family medical clinic business and be a doctor rather than any other trade  since the eldest died 15 years ago. Ryota has 'imprisoned' himself by these expectations which he is unable to and frankly does not want to fulfill. Underneath the pleasant bantering with his mother we can tell he is struggling to find himself make peace with himself and go on with his life. Writerdirectoreditor Koreeda's passion provided us a close look ever so casually unhurried at its own pace so we get to be familiarized with each member of the family on how a Japanese family might function on such a reunion gathering. We are put at ease watching mother and daughter preparing food in the kitchen the whole family huddled around the meal table the spontaneous exchanges. By and by subtle clues are displayed and we may see the other side to each person's personality and hidden desires. Then there are pause moments to relish some family coziness or motherson cordial exchanges. The storyline is far from 'flat' at its leisurely pace familiarity breeds contempt or absence makes the heart grows fonder  either could be true. As the evening goes on more aspects surface  be it mother father son daughter in law or grandson  we share their sentiments satisfied or empathized.Still Walking is a rich film. We are fortunate to experience it with so many levels rendered to us. I appreciate the reverence paid to the traditional family ritual of honoring the dead. Yes a chance for a family outing seeing Ryota and his 'new' family  wife and stepson  together is encouraging. The 'yellow butterflies' folklore is heartening. The film also brings to mind quotes from Louise L. Hay's book Heart Thoughts  A Treasury of Inner Wisdom on forgiveness page 90 We do not have to know how to forgive. All we have to do is be willing to forgive. The Universe will take care of the how. And on happiness page 94 Happiness is feeling good about yourself. The theme music by Gonchichi is just right for the mood and state of inner peace  its guitar playing chords and melodic strains is quietly serene. What a soothing melody giving the film a resigned calming happy with himself again leisurely tempo  simply apt to the story of Still Walking. Visit the official site 'www.aruitemo.com' and you can listen to the music and check out 'Director's Statement' with Koreeda talking about his film.".

Certainly there is a genre of Japanese movies that fall into the movies where nothing happen category and as with many forms of art sometimes we mistake emptiness and simplicity with great meaning. Sometimes it's hard to tell where greatness actually exists and where we make it up for ourselves although I suppose since the final result is the same it is a bit of a moot point.This movie borrows heavily from Tokyo Story another glacially paced movie of the intergenerational genre but whereas the thrust of that movie was the younger generation's indifference and lack of time for the older generation this one is more about the simmering conflicts related to the death of a son barely concealed resentments related to career choices the failure to meet fatherly expectations a mother's long held grudges etc. As a family meets to commemorate the death of a son we see a fine web of cracks start to radiate all bubbling away nicely within the perfectly regimented framework of Japanese politeness and etiquette. The cracks are delicate but deep as the characters tiptoe around the many issues that interconnect 3 generations. Lurking below the surface of civility we see unpleasant aspects of most of the characters but in true Japanese style there are no raised voices no shouting matches no slammed doors no accusations no resolutions no explosions no car chases no nudity no violence  just swirling undercurrents. Some people will like this others will not and that is fine.I enjoyed this movie but it was not a world shattering event. I thought some opportunities for development were missed and I was particularly annoyed when the movie did not finish immediately after the narration near the end. This could have been a totally killer statement at last a statement of truth and brutal cruelty to contrast cataclysmically with the hour of banal politeness and withholding of feelings that preceded it. This would have given the whole movie some meaning and bite but no they had to spoil it by reverting to the pretense of everyone playing happy families.In summary a good movie that those used to the japanese pace will enjoy but probably not one that will change your life.".

Well in reality It's much more subtle than that and actually brings out why in reallife reconciliation is much harder than we may expect or like it to be even among family members. Some disagreements that you may have have with your mom or dad may be such that you will have to go against your principlesvalues if you want to make peace with them. These are the kinds of issues that are portrayed in this film with beauty and emotional intensity. But there is a message of reconciliation as well because although the characters have their differences they try their best to get through the occasion without hurting each other's feelings and at least trying to pretend as if their differences do not matter when they're together. I am starting to really like Hirokazu Koreeda's works. If you like watching films that have a strong socialfamilybased narrative you should really check out Koreeda's films. In a nutshell  Is it a deeply moving film? yes. Is it a realistic portrayal of common family issues? Yes. But is it one of those and they happily lived together ever after films? No.".

It is not an ordinary day exactly but one in which the family gathers together in remembrance. Gradually and naturally the backstory unfolds.The way that the story is told is really what is so wonderful about it. I cannot think of any other film off the top of my head that tells this kind of a story so well. It seems so natural and the filmmakers make it look easy but it's not.The way the family interacts the dialog each character's little idiosyncrasies it's all done perfectly and flawlessly. There a is a point near the beginning of the film where the matriarch tells a story of an interaction with her neighbors years earlier. The way the story is told and the other characters' reaction feel so real and lifelike.Everything about the film feels like an ordinary family. Even though this family is in Japan a country I've never visited I felt connected to them while watching this. Everything was so relatable to the point that this could have been a real day in the life of a real family shot using hidden cameras.The way the mother manipulated the daughterinlaw and dishes out underhanded compliments the way they all tell boring stories that they've all heard a hundred times the way the son is hesitant to leave his wife alone with his mother out of fear that she'll accidentally give away his little white lies that no one really even cares about but him...all of it feels just like real life made even better by the wonderful acting from even the children.And of course the camerawork is great. Everything is done extremely well here. I won't give away too much of the ending which on its surface could be considered mundane except to say that it is bittersweet and perfect.".

Ryota's father's family consists of father Kyohei Yoshio Harada mother Toshiko Kiki Kirin and daughter Chinami Kataoka YOU her husband Nobuo Kazuya Takahashi and their two children Riku Ryoga Hayashi and Satsuki Hotaru Nomoto. In a way father who's a retired family doctor and his family has never recovered from the death of Ryota's brother Junpei who died while trying to save a drowning boy Yoshio Imai who survived and was visiting to offer incense to Junpei's spirit. When Ryota and Junpei was a child they had aspiration to become a doctor like their father. Something changed Ryota and he never pursued becoming a doctor and became an antique restorer. His father still moans the loss of Junpei who he was counting to take over his business. Father sees Ryota as a failure and their relation is not quite good. Ryota who's currently don't have a job feels uncomfortable in every situation. He even says to Kyohei Is being a doctor so great !? We don't know how brother would have been eitherIf he had lived.. As the story progresses history and the story of each of the character's life gets revealed. Toshiko bring out an old record titled Bluelight Yokohama Performed by Ayumi Ishida at the family dinner and plays it. It was a song she heard 30 years ago when she went to check out the apartment of a woman Kyohei was having extramarital affair with. But family tie dies hard and Ryota says to Kyohei Some day I'll take you to see a game of soccer. Seven years later both Kyohei and Toshiko are dead and Ryota's family has a new member  a daughter. Together they return to pay respect to the grave of their family. Nothing spectacular happens in this movie but as I watched the first 10 minutes I was already enthralled by the acting and the story. I honestly felt that I don't care if nothing happens I'm intrigued by this family and I want to see more.. Details are written superbly. The discomfort Atsushi feels with his cousins the obligation Yukari feels towards Ryota's parents. All adds to the friction each are feeling in their lives. Mother played by Kiki Kirin is so perfect for the role. Without her this movie wouldn't have been as good as it is. Hiroshi Abe and Yui Natsukawa reprises the duo after Kekkon Dekinai Otoko and are superb match as modern husband and wife.The people in this movie seems to have lived their lives without a plan didn't know when to let go and plan their actions for the future. The death of Junpei seemed have negatively affected the whole family forever. Good movie that reflects the life of Japanese family in an authentic way. Only Japanese movies seems to be able to go so deeply into subtleties of family affairs as this one. You need to see this movie to appreciate family affairs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aruitemo aruitemo is about ordinary Japanese people. Comparable to the 1980 Robert Redforddirected film starring Timothy Hutton this Far East import also deals with a mom and how she distributes her love among the children unequally forcing the left behind son to compete against the dead one the favored one the first born. Fifteen years ago Ryo's brother died in the ocean while trying to save another boy. With a wife and child among him RyotaHiroshi Abe has returned home for a reunionto commemorate the fifteenyear anniversary of his sibling's untimely passing where he faces not just a frosty mother but a father who's the antithesis to the sire played by Donald Sutherland in the Redford film. Ryota brings home damaged goods his wife and child are widow and stepson and they rate far below their daughter's husband and two children in spite of the Japanese people's partiality for boys over girls. Whereas Calvin JarrettSutherland loved his son unconditionally KyoheiYoshio Harada admonishes Ryota for not following in his footsteps by becoming a doctor. Although the surviving son is in the restoration business too artwork can't begin to compete with the prestige of fixing people thus the wedge was set between them years ago and festers there still throughout the duration of what will be his final visit back home. The motherplayed by Kirin Kiri who seems to be the more congenial parent entertains Ryo's wife with her son's childhood things and pulls out an old school essay in which the boy had expressed an admiration for his father and the medical profession. But that fatal accident at the beach had brought out the truth in how the family worked so Ryo turned to art history probably to spite his father who loved him half as much as the first born. Sympathetic portrayals both the widow and the stepson nevertheless they follow the pattern of reduced expectation in which Ryo had his brother lived on would have married more prudently and summoned a blushing bride for procreation. Told in retrospect Aruitemo aruitemo takes place perhaps about ten years in the past the amount of time it took Ryota to make peace with his parents and love them unconditionally once again.Your family isn't normal says Toshiko to her son on the return trip from a pilgrimage to the dead son's grave. She doesn't count Ryo's stepson as his real child. Such bluntness shocks the cruelty of her words. Clearly the tragedy had curdled her heart. At the outset the mother makes corn tempura for her familial guests especially the children but on this same walking tour the moviegoer learns that she can barely stand kids and shudders at the thought of her daughter's filial plan of moving back home with her family. The filmmaker excels at showing how oblivious the young children are to the anger that bubbles beneath the surface of each family gathering. They don't see that the grownups are ready to implode. The mother's worst behavior however is reserved for the boy who survived an overweight dropout with no career prospects whom the family invites every year so that he remembers the sacrifice made on his behalf a sacrifice in vain. The mother tells Ryota that he wants the boy to suffer just as she had suffered. The father calls him trash. In Ordinary People the surviving brotherHutton was at the scene of the boating accident and is made to feel by the motherplayed by Mary Tyler Moore that the wrong son lived on. In light of the parents' disapproval over his family life and occupation it's easy to see how Ryo might feel that mom and dad are projecting on the hapless guest their disappointment over himself being the only surviving male heir.When Ryota returns home his parents are longdead but now he has a new addition a daughter who joins her parents and brother in honoring the grandparents she never met. As he pours water over their tombstone the moviegoer speculates as to why Ryota finally made peace with his folks. Our eyes turn to the little girl and we remember the old woman's words. The moviegoer wonders if he agrees with her. The dousing of the tombstones can be read as a son waking up his parents in order for them see the grandchild they always wanted. Considering how Ryota's parents felt about the widow and stepson it's somewhat perverse for them to participate in the ceremony. Aruitemo aruitemo is very very Japanese. They're not like American people. They're not ordinary people.".

As Julius and Stefan become friends they constantly talk and complain about women. But neither of them can stay away from them. This only means one thing. No matter what men say about women they just can't stay away from them.My favorite character in this movie is Julius the husband that comes up with a really fantastic plan to get his wife back from the unemployed artist Stefan a man his wife is having an affair with. He is determined to find out what his wife sees in this man. As he develops a close friendship with Stefan Julius manages to turn him into an image of Julius himself. An image his wife does not find very attractive. I think this plan is very unusual but very good and very funny. It's what makes this movie very interesting.Definitely worth watching. Very funny.

The proven point is simple nothing in the world can keep men from being addicted to the opposite sex! I'll admit that it also has one of the silliest catchiest endings I have ever seen not to mention the actual crew members showing up on the elevators in the final credits.

	schema:reviewBody "Mnner... is a West German movie from over 30 years ago. It runs for 95 minutes and was the breakthrough for writer and director Doris Drrie and lead actor Heiner Lauterbach. His colead Uwe Ochsenknecht was already a bit more famous at this point thanks to Das Boot. The film is basically about two men and their interaction with each other and with the women in their lives. Occasionally their professional life business creativity also becomes part of the story. But it is really all about masculinity or lack thereof and what women really prefer. Unfortunately I cannot say I found this film as good as awards bodies everywhere around the world did. One problem is that Lauterbach and Ochsenknecht may have good charisma and recognition value but they do not have great range or talent in terms of acting and this is as true today as it was back then as both actors are still pretty famous here in Germany.Sadly this movie is evidence that the 1980s really weren't the greatest decade in terms of film for Germany. It's a sad state of affairs when a film like this gets picked up to represent Germany at the Academy Awards. needless to say it did not manage to get nominated. As for Drrie I have seen some of her other works and it shows that she wasn't even 30 when she made this. It is nowhere near her best in terms of storytelling or character evaluation. It is extremely showy and many fell for it but it lacks besides great acting convincing subtlety and relatable characters. It is still better than Drrie's most recent work Gre aus Fukushima but this does not make Men... a satisfying watch. Not at all. I give it a thumbs down as this is a mix of bad and mediocre and nowhere near the filmmaker's best work even if it is still despite the age among her most known. Not recommended.".

And the humor which is evident in the script is somewhat amplified in the American release by the weird dubbing. This is far from the worst dubbing I have ever heard but it does have them saying things I find hard to believe were in the original.Unfortunately at the time of this writing January 2017 it seems that the best way to see the film is on a DVD that is very obviously a VHS transfer. The picture is bad. Really really bad. In the age of 2K and 4K scans hopefully someone comes along and gets a better release out there.".

However I believe that the film also advances a radical argument with respect to women they inspire carefree romance in men but also inspire the souleating corporate indenture that leaves men mere husks of themselves.That women are regarded as possessions and prizes is made explicit in the final sequence of the film which is both so absurd and such genius that it would be a crime for me to ruin it in the way Stefan and Julius resolve the conflict between them. That women are the root of this competitiveness as well as the reason why men gradually lose their luster is also argued in the readiness with which Stefan takes to Julian's suggestions and in Paula's ultimate decision.Not really groundbreaking stuff of itself but a position almost never taken by comedies of the sexes just another reason why this film is a true cinematic gem.".

The story is all about accepting different people in this case homosexual transvestite  old person and delinquent. The music adds to the soft and tender mood of the film. I must say that the cast in supporting roles give a touching and heartwarming performance. Though it could have been a very sad story the director always gives a touch of hope.

Also contrary to what another reviewer seems to feel the story isn't improbable and the plot is well fleshed out. If you have no appetite however for nuance and complex emotions then don't see this film. One of the key ideas epitomized by Saori the main character is that of being true to oneself  risk the truth because living a lie will not only cause pain to yourself but also to others  her father didn't start his life truthfully and so the result is that she's become an angry young woman. This idea is also evident in her almost love scene with the capricious Haruhiko where she senses that he's not truly into her  she just happened to evoke an admiration from him at a moment that he's been particularly vulnerable sexually due to his lover's illness his desire is mutable but ultimately she knows she's not really what he wants to satiate him and perhaps he's not what she wants to satiate her. Contrast it to the forceful grasping of her boss which she does respond to. Also she comes to accept and even like the other characters but without denying her own sullen and angry nature. The acting is very good and the dialogue is succinct so you have the opportunity to read more story in the characters' faces. And you want to because the characters each have a lot of appeal. The movie is not full of flaming gay stereotypes but anyhow how could it be truthful if it didn't have any queens? There's definitely humor sadness and longing and hope it's a gentle storytelling with nice music by the way. Definitely makes me want to see other films by this director.".

No. How can you have a movie that doesn't feature hetero romance? The trans people are a caricature Ruby is obviously not on hormones but she had a sex change somehow?!. Himiko and her relationship with the world around her is a poor joke. They have rare moments highlighting homophobia but even then it's exaggerated. The only reason I am giving this 5 stars and not 0 are the long shots of Odagiri Jo not the character the actor. Every time someone talked I'd get kind of mad but then they would do a close up of his beautiful face and generous drawnout full body shots and I would be utterly pacified.

There is nothing connecting the seemingly random things that happen on screen and there is nothing to draw the viewer in or make the viewer sympathize with any of the characters. In short there is nothing tying the video together into a movie. Seriously what is with the plot? So the main girl is 20 or so and has an 80 year old dad who suddenly turned gay one day and ran out of the house? Now her nearlydead dad is lovers with a 20something hot ambivalently gay guy? Then there is the proposed subplot with the mom who seems to maybe have still been involved with the dad even after he turned homosexual but that whole thing is never explained. Then the girl falls in love with the young gay dude and they start going at it but stop and she goes and does her playboy boss instead all the while wailing like a 5year old and fantasizing about the gay guy??? Not to mention all the rest of the cast is full of stereotypical flaming gay people.

One of the most effective cinematic touches is that in nearly every scene the camera is slowly swaying back and forth to give us a sense that we really are at sea. Something Titanic completely missed. We follow the journey of ten survivors through the inverted ship to their hopeful rescuenarrowly escaping fires explosions and flooding corridors every step of the way. The sets are epic and nothing less than spectacular. Especially the inverted dining room when the Atlantic Ocean comes crashing in and the engine room which is now a horrifying twisted metal inferno. The cast is good however Gene Hackman Shelly Winters and Stella Stevens are best. Hackman is our handsome hero Winters is our unselfish caring mother and Stevens is absolutely radiant precapsize and adds a welcome touch of humor to the mess. No the movie is not perfect and it is of course starting to look a bit dated. However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored. Poseidon Adventure is a true classic. A must see for everyonenot just disaster movie fans.".

I thought they were a rather odd pairing at first but it worked seeing how they both needed each other. Linda Rogo was my favorite character. She knew what to say and how to say it. She even told her pompus husband off a few times. The fact that she's an exprostitute and her husband being the cop that arrested her made their story rather interesting. Mr. Rogo and the Preacher's quarrels were amusing and heated. I liked the Rosens they were the strong ones and you could truly see the love they had for one another. The kid was annoying but useful and I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Susan and the Preacher. Their scenes were my favorite. This movie has a cast of truly rich characters that were more entertaining to watch than the actual effects. Ah! The good old days where character development and an actual plot outweigh the special effects and the disaster itself. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Poseidon Adventure has gotten its reputation as the best of all the disaster films of the seventies not just for the Special Effects good as they are. It's that select group of people trying to survive they're a bunch you do get to care about even though some of them can be annoying as all get out.The film is an adaption of Paul Gallico's novel which was written in the Thirties but it was updated to the present for the film. While on the luxury liner Poseidon as a New Year's Eve Party goes on Captain Leslie Nielsen takes note of an undersea earthquake and the tidal wave that will hit the ship in about fifteen minutes. But he's certainly not prepared for the wall of water that smacks the Poseidon broadside and capsizes it.Before the big event and the special effects that got The Poseidon Adventure its Oscar in that department we are introduced to the group of people who elect to try and climb up to the keel of the capsized Poseidon while the rest remain in the grand ballroom. Leading the group is minister Gene Hackman and the rest are married couples Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens musiciansinger Carol Lynley hypochondriac Red Buttons steward Roddy McDowell and teenager Pamela Sue Martin and her little brother Eric Shea.You do get wrapped up and sucked into the conflicts especially with Ernest Borgnine who's simultaneously got a war going with Gene Hackman and with his wife Stella Stevens. She's an exhooker who he busted several times and eventually married. He's got a rambunctious nature and Borgnine provides a lot of the interest here.Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters are the typical elderly Jewish couple who are on a trip to Israel to visit the grandchild they've never seen. They're a calming and steadying influence on the others. So is Red Buttons who finds courage he never thought he possessed and he helps Lynley out who's devastated at the loss of her brother who was in the band performing at the New Year's Eve Party.Gene Hackman as a minister takes his gospel from that noted skeptic Benjamin Franklin who said that God helps those who help themselves. For those who believe in a divine plan he seems divinely sent to get these people to safety. Not all of them make it though.The Poseidon Adventure got another Oscar for Best Song for The Morning After. Maureen McGovern's recording of that tune was playing everywhere in 1972.

	onyx:emotionText "The Poseidon Adventure has gotten its reputation as the best of all the disaster films of the seventies not just for the Special Effects good as they are. It's that select group of people trying to survive they're a bunch you do get to care about even though some of them can be annoying as all get out.The film is an adaption of Paul Gallico's novel which was written in the Thirties but it was updated to the present for the film. While on the luxury liner Poseidon as a New Year's Eve Party goes on Captain Leslie Nielsen takes note of an undersea earthquake and the tidal wave that will hit the ship in about fifteen minutes. But he's certainly not prepared for the wall of water that smacks the Poseidon broadside and capsizes it.Before the big event and the special effects that got The Poseidon Adventure its Oscar in that department we are introduced to the group of people who elect to try and climb up to the keel of the capsized Poseidon while the rest remain in the grand ballroom. Leading the group is minister Gene Hackman and the rest are married couples Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens musiciansinger Carol Lynley hypochondriac Red Buttons steward Roddy McDowell and teenager Pamela Sue Martin and her little brother Eric Shea.You do get wrapped up and sucked into the conflicts especially with Ernest Borgnine who's simultaneously got a war going with Gene Hackman and with his wife Stella Stevens. She's an exhooker who he busted several times and eventually married. He's got a rambunctious nature and Borgnine provides a lot of the interest here.Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters are the typical elderly Jewish couple who are on a trip to Israel to visit the grandchild they've never seen. They're a calming and steadying influence on the others. So is Red Buttons who finds courage he never thought he possessed and he helps Lynley out who's devastated at the loss of her brother who was in the band performing at the New Year's Eve Party.Gene Hackman as a minister takes his gospel from that noted skeptic Benjamin Franklin who said that God helps those who help themselves.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1970's were the heyday of disaster films and this was one of the better ones. An overacting allstar cast graced the screen in all of them. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the very first bigbudget moneymaker that spawned a whole slew of knockoffs involving tidal waves fires hurricanes floods earthquakes and volcanoes. It is also arguably the best. Producer Irwin Allen was the mastermind behind most of them known for spending millions of dollars on special effects and his bigname stars.A simple plot a tidal wave knocks a ship upside down and a handful of survivors have to climb to the bottom of the ship at the surface before the ship sinks. They are led by a fanatical preacher Gene Hackman who conflicts with an excop Ernest Borgnine and his exhooker wife Stella Stevens. Jack Albertson WILLY WONKA and Shelley Winters are an elderly Jewish couple who are on their way to see their new grandchild. Pamela Sue Martin TV's Nancy Drew and Eric Shea like Bobby Brady but more annoying are brother and sister on their way to meet their parents. Roddy McDowall a fantastic actor is wasted as a ship hand who dies rather quick. Red Buttons PETE'S DRAGON is an elderly gentleman who helps the ship's lounge singer Carol Lynley retain her sanity. Arthur O'Connell is a strict reverend who refuses to go along with Hackman. Leslie Nielsen makes a cameo as the ship's captain who dies during the tidal wave.The cast really isn't very important it's the special effects and ongoing tension that makes the film so much fun. I absolutely love the claustrophobic and wet feeling that is so important to the execution of the film. While a lot of the acting hasn't aged well Shelley Winters Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are especially guilty of overacting! the special effects aren't too cheesy and the entire set of the ship is wonderfully wellmade still standing as an achievement on its own. Lots of unintentional humor abounds the obese Shelley Winters swimming underwater displaying her underpants clinging to her bulbous buttocks which makes the viewing experience all the more enjoyable. The theme song The Morning After won an Oscar and is rather lightweight but highly listenable.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE definitely does have some twists and turns that surprise the viewer not everyone gets out alive and holds the audience's attention throughout the entire thing even though things do get a little soap operaish at times. This makes a great double bill with THE TOWERING INFERNO which I find a better picture but POSEIDON is a very fun viewing and is if anything a great movie to watch if you have 2 hours to kill.".

I have not read the book of this film so I cannot say if it is an accurate adaptation in the spirit of the original. I will say that it is a wellproduced piece of fiction. The plot is quite good. The writing is good and has very realistic great moments. Dialog is welldone and delivered equally well. The characters are credible and wellwritten. There is a reasonable amount of development and background for them. The special effects are undeniably excellently done. They are convincing throughout. Nature itself becomes the threat with realistic physics. The camerawork and editing are nicely done save for an awkward cut or two. Cinematography is effective. The pacing is solid for the whole film. As far as the technical aspect goes the film is great. The acting is of high quality. The kid isn't the most annoying ever seen. The tension is admirable. I haven't watched particularly many disaster films... in fact this film may be 50 of the total amount... so I can't say if this is an outstanding one. I'm not sure you can really watch this without noticing the theme of passivity versus activity... or blind faith versus a more critical independent faith. The film takes a definite stance on that. All in all entertaining and worth your time. I recommend this to any fan of the actors andor the genre. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Although not perfect this is a very entertaining disaster movie. It has all the elements of who will survive movies of the '70's but delivers with creative originality that most of the similar movies that followed it lacked.One of the weaknesses of the movie is that some of the characters are written much more volatile than an ordinary person would be even under these circumstances. A great cast however make these characters as believable as possible and the audience gets a chance to see who they are and how they respond to situations and the crisis in general. Reverend Scott Gene Hackman a fiery maverick cleric leads the campaign to escape as their antagonist the water keeps on systematically pursuing the group from deck to deck. Mike Rogo Ernest Borgnine a tough cop provides plenty of conflict with an equally strong personality.The cast also includes Stella Stevens Shelly Winters Roddy McDowell Jack Albertson Arthur O'Connell Red Buttons and Leslie Nielson. All are terrific in their roles and bring plenty of emotion suspense plot twists drama subplots character development and more to make this an exciting film. There are a few contrivances such as explosions always occurring at the worst possible moment but overall the story works well.

The waters Flooding in.This was the original and with nearclassic status did not need to be remade.

	onyx:emotionText "Although not perfect this is a very entertaining disaster movie. It has all the elements of who will survive movies of the '70's but delivers with creative originality that most of the similar movies that followed it lacked.One of the weaknesses of the movie is that some of the characters are written much more volatile than an ordinary person would be even under these circumstances. A great cast however make these characters as believable as possible and the audience gets a chance to see who they are and how they respond to situations and the crisis in general. Reverend Scott Gene Hackman a fiery maverick cleric leads the campaign to escape as their antagonist the water keeps on systematically pursuing the group from deck to deck. Mike Rogo Ernest Borgnine a tough cop provides plenty of conflict with an equally strong personality.The cast also includes Stella Stevens Shelly Winters Roddy McDowell Jack Albertson Arthur O'Connell Red Buttons and Leslie Nielson. All are terrific in their roles and bring plenty of emotion suspense plot twists drama subplots character development and more to make this an exciting film. There are a few contrivances such as explosions always occurring at the worst possible moment but overall the story works well.

Yes the initial prologue and set up is rather inane yet we grow to appreciate and care for these characters. Flashing back to when this was a new release this had as much buzz going as TITANIC. You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing THE MORNING AFTER being played. I just about drove my mum off the deep end filming a THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE with her Kodak super8 camera. It starred all of us kids in the neighborhood and I turned the house topsyturvy to get that perfect upside down look. It's a wonder she didn't end up in a straightjacket on that one. Anyone in possession of those reels could own my home via extortion.    The nucleus of the film of course is megawave capsizes the SS POSEIDON. Passengers make their attempts to survive and escape the ship if possible. The acting gets a little heavy at places yet we are swept up into the saga. Anything that we're not alienated or disenfranchised from is bound to win us over to a certain degree. You can't help but get involved in their struggle. The script dawdles here an there however it's a well above average movie.         Special kudos for Red Buttons who does turn in an understated performance and shines superbly. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every so often over the years I have found myself in a room  at a doctor's office the auditorium where I had my high school graduation even in a church during a funeral  and I find my mind wandering and wondering about what it would be like should the entire place turn upside down. Where would I land which heavy object would I have to dodge to keep from being squashed etc. Such is the power of movies they have the ability to alter perspective not in some deeply profound way but with the subtle way you perceive the world.My upside down view of the world is an outgrowth from having seen THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE dozens of times over the years and gotten a kick out of the moment on New Year's Eve when the entire boat capsizes and everyone goes head over heels. The movie took something readily recognizable and made it fascinating just by flipping it over.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the first and the best of the socalled disaster movies of the 1970s. Okay the original AIRPORT and long before that 1939s SAN FRANCISCO were first but the airborne disaster in one and the earthquake in the other were mere threads in rambling soap operas POSEIDON was the first where the catastrophe was the focal point and the starting point. As such producer Irwin Allen was mining new territory and essentially created the genre  though its value as a cinematic art is certainly debatable.Anyway I think that the original POSEIDON works where so many of those that followed didn't because it has a sense of humor. Certainly while many imitators EARTHQUAKE THE TOWERING INFERNO POSEIDON's two woeful remakes etc. were laughable they weren't humorous in a humane sort of way. The film recognizes that its basic premise is absurd but doesn't dwell on it placing the emphasis on the people not the situation.The disaster movie became quickly known as a vehicle where stickfigure characters burdened with cumbersome and melodramatic backstories and played by bigname stars shamelessly emoting all over the place bided their time as the impending doom of the special effects polished them off one by one. As such the disaster became the star not unlike Freddie Krueger or Michael Meyers or other horror movie boogie men and the point of the film was less about survival than about not surviving about how and when the special effects and the stunt team would give which character the next big adios.You'd be hard pressed to remember let alone care who played what character in EARTHQUAKE or THE SWARM or AIRPORT 19whatever. That's the beauty of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE even if you think the characters are caricatures their backstories lame and the whole film silly they nonetheless stick with you. Part of this is due I think to the fact that the characters are more real there are no multimillionaire industrialists no fading movie stars no international terrorists or jewel thieves no phoneybaloney VIPs of any sort. The final voyage of the SS Poseidon carries a rather mundane passenger list of tourists honeymooners doting grandparents and lonely singles. They're ordinary people who end up in extraordinary circumstances. Likewise the cast is made up of ordinary movie stars none of the cast with the notable exception of star Gene Hackman hot off his success in THE FRENCH CONNECTION were at the height of their careers but they are an immensely likable ensemble of recognizable character actors Red Button Roddy MacDowall Stella Stevens Shelley Winters Ernest Borgnine Jack Albertson Arthur O'Connell etc. They are performers who the audience is so comfortable with that you instantly are concerned for their safety. Bigger stars might have overwhelmed the story like in THE TOWERING INFERNO or EARTHQUAKE but here if you don't like Shelley you just might identify with her character. Bottom line you really do care who survives and you are hurt when soandso meets his unexpected and untimely end.Even Hackman manages to be larger than life and yet rather ordinary as the movie hero. Though he plays a minister  in itself an odd choice for an action hero  his Rev. Scott is something of a rebel an outspoken liberal cleric like those who popped up during the antiwar movement of the 60s. Instead of the icy grim hero of most of these films as the story's Christ's figure Hackman's Scott is guided as much by his emotions as by his selfrighteousness. He's certainly no Charlton Heston  and that is just fine. Through Scott the film delivers a fiery sermon that puts a strange spin on the usual Darwinism that rules this type of film. While the film pays due respect to the old it's God's will style of religion as embodied in Arthur O'Connell's Chaplain John the main message of POSEIDON is that of self confidence and selfdetermination. Darwin's survival of the fittest ideology is not seen as a contradiction to the theology of the meek shall inherit  perhaps suggesting that the meek must survive in order to inherit.Though not handled with very much grace the film's religious themes nonetheless give THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE a bit of backbone arguing that religion without action is futile and that one of God's greatest gifts is the will to survive.As an action machine POSEIDON hasn't aged all that well it's special effects and production values now seem sort of quaint. Yet at the same time these things give it a bit of character a remembrance of when drama was defined by a good cast an intriguing story and a sense of adventure not just by how cleverly a CGI technician can manipulate images. Like the ship itself THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE may be a fine lady that's seen better days but unlike the ship in question it seems to sail on and on seemingly unsinkable.".

As such producer Irwin Allen was mining new territory and essentially created the genre  though its value as a cinematic art is certainly debatable.Anyway I think that the original POSEIDON works where so many of those that followed didn't because it has a sense of humor. Certainly while many imitators EARTHQUAKE THE TOWERING INFERNO POSEIDON's two woeful remakes etc. were laughable they weren't humorous in a humane sort of way. The film recognizes that its basic premise is absurd but doesn't dwell on it placing the emphasis on the people not the situation.The disaster movie became quickly known as a vehicle where stickfigure characters burdened with cumbersome and melodramatic backstories and played by bigname stars shamelessly emoting all over the place bided their time as the impending doom of the special effects polished them off one by one. As such the disaster became the star not unlike Freddie Krueger or Michael Meyers or other horror movie boogie men and the point of the film was less about survival than about not surviving about how and when the special effects and the stunt team would give which character the next big adios.You'd be hard pressed to remember let alone care who played what character in EARTHQUAKE or THE SWARM or AIRPORT 19whatever. That's the beauty of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE even if you think the characters are caricatures their backstories lame and the whole film silly they nonetheless stick with you. Part of this is due I think to the fact that the characters are more real there are no multimillionaire industrialists no fading movie stars no international terrorists or jewel thieves no phoneybaloney VIPs of any sort. The final voyage of the SS Poseidon carries a rather mundane passenger list of tourists honeymooners doting grandparents and lonely singles. They're ordinary people who end up in extraordinary circumstances. Likewise the cast is made up of ordinary movie stars none of the cast with the notable exception of star Gene Hackman hot off his success in THE FRENCH CONNECTION were at the height of their careers but they are an immensely likable ensemble of recognizable character actors Red Button Roddy MacDowall Stella Stevens Shelley Winters Ernest Borgnine Jack Albertson Arthur O'Connell etc. They are performers who the audience is so comfortable with that you instantly are concerned for their safety. Bigger stars might have overwhelmed the story like in THE TOWERING INFERNO or EARTHQUAKE but here if you don't like Shelley you just might identify with her character. Bottom line you really do care who survives and you are hurt when soandso meets his unexpected and untimely end.Even Hackman manages to be larger than life and yet rather ordinary as the movie hero. Though he plays a minister  in itself an odd choice for an action hero  his Rev. Scott is something of a rebel an outspoken liberal cleric like those who popped up during the antiwar movement of the 60s. Instead of the icy grim hero of most of these films as the story's Christ's figure Hackman's Scott is guided as much by his emotions as by his selfrighteousness. He's certainly no Charlton Heston  and that is just fine. Through Scott the film delivers a fiery sermon that puts a strange spin on the usual Darwinism that rules this type of film. While the film pays due respect to the old it's God's will style of religion as embodied in Arthur O'Connell's Chaplain John the main message of POSEIDON is that of self confidence and selfdetermination. Darwin's survival of the fittest ideology is not seen as a contradiction to the theology of the meek shall inherit  perhaps suggesting that the meek must survive in order to inherit.Though not handled with very much grace the film's religious themes nonetheless give THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE a bit of backbone arguing that religion without action is futile and that one of God's greatest gifts is the will to survive.As an action machine POSEIDON hasn't aged all that well it's special effects and production values now seem sort of quaint. Yet at the same time these things give it a bit of character a remembrance of when drama was defined by a good cast an intriguing story and a sense of adventure not just by how cleverly a CGI technician can manipulate images. Like the ship itself THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE may be a fine lady that's seen better days but unlike the ship in question it seems to sail on and on seemingly unsinkable.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a generally nice film with good story great actors and great songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to attempt some originality Abbas? Mustan? Anyone?The film is about a newly married couple Raj and Priya Salman  Rani. Priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother who will carry their child. They pick Madhubala a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic I mean isn't it easier to adopt? And even if they pick a girl does it mean the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway I guess if the writers had heard of all this the film wouldn't have been made so the concept is apparently intentional.Salman acts very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. Come on it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is just about OK she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta.The film belongs to Preity who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. She makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives the film emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time partly because of her role partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of her careerbest performances. There is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. She just should do more such roles.The film's ending only highlights what I said above. It is tearjerking exciting and very wellacted. Watch it for Preity.710 for the film! 1010  for Preity!".

But in this CCCC they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama. Hardly there is a single action scene when Preity was being raped by Salman's colleague in her apartment Salman slapped him.The movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc. which are required to make a movie hit. But of course for Salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him. Why? Because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance lalala all around. His role as a rich young businessman who has nononsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive. After all Madhubala a prostitute role performed by Preity is amazing. Later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention. Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her. Her previous role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not that hearttouching as it is here. Of course this can be termed as improvement. Then Priya a very innocent and helpless wife of Raj who only depends on him for a better result. She has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of Preity.Finally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself. In real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother. Perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret.

	schema:reviewBody "The year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad. The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. The film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. Salman And Preiti give a good performance where Salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all..must be special effects!! Rani plays Salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main leads confirm after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistryapparently. Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses. Rani's Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. The songs are all picturised well  especially dekhne walon and the main title song. The other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family. Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..I say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!".

Unfortunately Rani miscarries and is told by her doctor that she can't have any children anymore. For fear of disappointing their grandfather they decide to find a surrogate mother which they do in the prostitute Preity. Things go horribly wrong when Preity falls in love with Salman and her maternal instincts start kicking in...The premise of 4C is quite innovating but too bad it is badly executed.

Or should I say lack of? Salman and Rani fleetingly meet at a party and promptly her family makes an offer for marriage. What a coincidence... Is this destiny at work? Or does her family make offers to all relatively handsome wealthy men? Her miscarriage forms the turnpoint of the movie. Ofcourse this is a very tragic tearjerky moment that the viewer saw coming miles away. It's kind of like watching Final Destination and wondering which kitchen utensil or household appliance will prove to be 'fatal'. It was sort or reminiscent of the miscarriage scene in Dil Kya Kare except for the actual means.Then Preity enters the frame. Which is also where the nails hit the blackboard. Although adoption seems to be the most obvious alternative it is certainly understandable that they both want the child to be 'fathered' by Salman. But why a prostitute? I suppose there is a certain truth that in traditional Indian culture an unwed woman would not be willing to get pregnant. But does that mean that there are no such women? Maybe not in India but what about the rest of the world? Even without taking all this in account a prostitute is hardly the obvious choice given the time we live in. Ever heard of AIDS or other STD's?What really makes my hair stand at end however is the actual getting pregnant bit. There was absolutely no need for Salman to sleep with Preity. Artificial insemination is a complicated procedure which I'm sure the Swiss where they are staying have heard of. And even not being interested in AI there are more primitive methods. For a long time I thought that the turkey baster method was a myth but if they can do it in If These Walls Could Talk 2 and Popcorn and Chutney I have two words for our three musketeers... turkey baster.Nonetheless if ignoring these DETAILS it is still entertaining to watch Rani and Preity at work. You can almost taste Rani's desire to become a mother even if her motives are a little skewed. The star however is Preity. She really is Pretty Woman in her transformation from working girl to... to what? ... herself I suppose. It's hardly surprising to watch her fall in love with the first man who has ever shown her true affection and respect. In Salman and his family she finally finds the love she has been craving for. Which makes her sacrifice even more noble and touching. Well done Preity. Her love interest is another matter. Salman Khan is a great actor. Unfortunately his character lacks depth. He gets married because his grandfather wants him to. He wants a child because his grandfather wants a great grandchild. He finds a surrogate because his wife wants him to. The makers should have take an extra page out of Pretty Woman and given Salman Richard Gere's spine.Finally the dance sequences and songs are wonderful. Especially No. 1 Punjabi and ofcourse the title song Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.5 stars".

She considers adoption but for certain reasons settles on the idea of a secret surrogate pregnancy. Raj finds a young prostitute Madhubala Preity Zinta who is willing to carry a child for the couple. As can be expected the path chosen by Raj and Priya is not a smooth one.For the most part this is a solidly good film that has the viewer uncertain as to what will be the eventual outcome. Those familiar with Hollywood's Pretty Woman will recognize certain scenes but they work quite well in this setting too. Khan seems to have only one emotion in this movie and Mukerji spends most of her time weeping. However they are generally convincing in their roles especially as they are the backdrop for Zinta's exceptional performance as Madhu. Regardless of how one feels about the topic the movie is worth watching for her alone. The cast also includes Amrish Puri Farida Jalal Prem Chopra and Johnny Lever.".

So it's really fortunate that this film has terrific performances to bank on. There's no questioning Preity and Rani's capabilities. They're among Bollywood's best performers and they certainly help to liven up CCCC. Surprise surprise Salman comes with a good performance himself. His restrained acting is a fresh change for the better!. For once he doesn't take his shirt off and I thank God for that. It would have done damaged to the film. One thing I like about CCCC is that it doesn't drag. It comes straight to the point. Rani and Salman's courtship is short and sweet. They don't take ages to introduce Preity's character. And I especially love the scene where a pregnant Rani dances in her room. There are subtle suggestions of impending doom and I truly commend directors AbbasMustan for executing that particular scene with style! All said and done CCCC makes for good entertainment and hopefully Rani and Preity will get Filmfare Award nominations if not the Awards themselves for their roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many Keaton shorts the plot is only a vehicle for Keaton to explore his imagination and to give him an opportunity to devise clever gags. When one watches a short such as this it is important to think of it as a cartoon.  It is not meant to be Citizen Kane but only to be visually entertaining and to keep the audience guessing as to what Buster will do next.  His physical comedy is wonderful here and I can't help but think that the creators of the Warner Brothers cartoons were great Buster Keaton fans. Keaton's reaction when he realizes that a burly convict whom he had just antagonized escaped from his cell and is standing right behind him is priceless right down to Buster's cartoonish exaggerated heartbeat.  This is followed by a move that would make Jackie Chan jealous.  Convict 13 succeeds brilliantly at its goal and much of the humor is timeless.  If you have the proper expectations you will really enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buster Keaton's films will always be amusing but that doesn't mean they are flawless. This is a good short comedy he was making on his way up and shows he is learning his craft. But the key to this film is a little flaw that is not really resolved until the last shot. The short is really two shorts stitched together. In the first we see Buster playing golf and trying to impress an expert female golfer Sybil Seeley. The highpoint is a spoof by Keaton of water traps his ball goes into a stream full of trout and he has to try to locate the trout that swallowed his ball. It works because of the typical Keaton determination to get to the heart of the matter  he goes through several fish before he finds the trout and removes the ball. Probably that would have been the conclusion for most comics but not Keaton. He tops it with two other jokes hitting the ball out of the stream back into the fairways and then paddling his makeshift river raft to shore with his golf club.Had he stuck to the golf game only the resulting short might have been a 10. Likewise when he goes into the prison section the prison section could have been a 10 also. But when pushed together that stitching shows as does it's resolution at the conclusion. Supposedly while Buster is golfing a convict flees a nearby prison. Buster manages to knock himself out with his own golf ball. The escapee sees Keaton lying on the ground and exchanges clothes. Buster ends up Convict 13 in the local prison and he discovers he is to be hanged soon. He also discovers the girl he likes is the daughter of the warden. He is prepped for his hanging by hangman Eddie Cline who would be a successful director in Hollywood. One of the best moments in this section is when Buster corners Sybil in the prison yard puts a handkerchief on the ground kneels on it announcing how he loves her forever and wants to marry her and is dragged up by the guards and hustled over to be hanged! Sybil does try to help ruin the hanging by substituting an elasticated rope for the hangman's rope. Cline is left puzzled by Buster bumping up and down in a weird anticipation of bungee chord exercise. Another nice touch in the hanging sequence is that the other prisoners are enjoying the show from bleacher seats.The final section is dealing with the meanest of the prisoners Joe Roberts. We see him effortlessly beating up on guards until confronted by Buster now having switched his prison garb with a guards and threatening Buster. There is even a repeat of the hanging business this time varied with Joe being attached to the rope from the wrong end. Buster ends up thwarting a prison break set at 300 P.M. and being made Assistant Warden.If you noticed how effortlessly Keaton steps from golf player to prisoner to guard to Assistant Warden something would tip you off as to what is going on. That comes out in the last moment of the film when all these crazy switches that everyone accepts are resolved. I won't explain how but look over the sequence of events and you'll probably figure it out.It is a very funny comedy with Keaton using his physical abilities to show he could have had fun with an Argenine bolo if one came his way. It's just the seams that ironically keep it from being one of his best shorts.".

The policemen wrongly arrest the player instead and once in prison he realizes that he is going to be hanged in the afternoon. The player swaps clothes with a guard and fights against a rebellion in the prison.Convict 13 is a very naive and silly but also funny Buster Keaton's short comedy. The gags are very similar to Charles Chaplin style and most of the time the situation looks like a cartoon.

But Sibyl is visiting the prison that day and takes a liking to Keaton. She notices the elastic exercise rope her father uses.

Eventually he's made assistant warden for breaking up a prison riot with a cannon ball tethered on a rope after the other guards have been knocked out by Joe Roberts with his sledgehammer. Unusual for comedy shorts of this era several guards and inmates apparently are killed in the riot. Many others are unconscious and possibly dead......Returning to the beginning after knocking himself down trying to tee off Keaton hits the ball into a pond. Stepping on a small raft he wonders why the ball isn't floating. He guesses that a fish swallowed it. Hence he grabs several fish with his hand and squeezes them. Finally the ball pops out of the last one which he spanks before letting it go. He puts the ball in the water and hits it with his club. We don't see where it lands.

His game is interrupted when a convict escaping death row finds Buster unconscious after one of his attempts at golf gone awry and swaps clothes with him to make it seem as if Buster's the real convict. There's a sparkling sequence where Buster unaware that he is wearing prisoner's uniform readies himself to hit the ball as two cops stand to his left and right looking incredulously at him. On realizing the change in his appearance he gives them a slip and does manage to evade the notsobright cops until he finds shelter in a prison! Then begins the prison saga beginning with Buster meeting the love of his life  the socialite daughter of the prison guard  who tries to save Buster from death by switching the hanging noose with exercise rope. Another unforeseeable circumstance  a heavyset prisoner creating chaos in prison  leads to further mayhem. We wait and watch how Buster wriggles his way through each problem only to land into another until the film finds a fitting resolution to his tale.Along with The High Sign Convict 13 is probably one of my favorite Keaton shorts. It's like a harmless firecracker that sets off a chain of bombs missiles and then the nuclear weapon itself! What was especially marvelous about watching Keaton was that while his character always had a smart solution for his problem he never anticipated the possibility of a worse problem to occur. Consider the scene where he tries to escape from the army of cops Buster walks in front of them as they follow him like a marching army so when Buster turns in the opposite direction the cops stupidly follow turn along with him. That's when Buster sneakily escapes and finally hides behind a gate. Before he can take a sigh of relief he turns to see where he is and finds out that he has reached right into a prison. Later when there's a riot in the prison and all the guards have been beaten unconscious by the burly cop our Buster again in dark about the riot tries escaping the cops by knocking out one and wearing his uniform. He confidently enters the section wearing prison guard uniform where the burly prisoner's waiting to knock him down thinking he's a cop. But Buster's not a prisoner and neither is he a cop he is no professional golf player either so what is he? This is answered in the next short The High Sign. He's a man going nowhere you'll find him anywhere and he'll land up somewhere. In a way he's a wandering gypsy living probably the most adventurous life you can imagine. He's very unlucky as evident by the number 13 given to his prisoner but he never loses hope that he'll find a way out almost.".

Then again he was only in his early 20s when this was made. Sybil Seely who plays his love interest was even younger. The villain is played by Joe Roberts a fairly prolific actor usually typecast for enemy roles because of his threatening physique. And Keaton made this a family affair by casting his two younger siblings and his dad is also in here. After some golf action early on and a bad fashion choice the protagonist ends up in jail. Unfortunately it did not turn out so well. The humor wasn't too funny really on my opinion and consisted mostly of something like a big bald guy throwing people around. So there is some violence and also some gunfire but it's all harmless and playful as always with the short films of Lloyd Chaplin and Keaton. It's not horrible but it's also not really good compared to some of Keaton's later works. Not recommended.".

All Joe wants is a job and a chance to make a new life for himself. He faces continual racial prejudices and injustice. Being a peace loving man he takes it all in stride.

Can Joe's Kung Fu skills save him from these guntoting knifethrowing bounty hunters? The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe has a lot of things working against it. Chen Lee in the title role isn't the most engaging sort of actor. He's actually rather bland. Klaus Kinski who gets top billing is on screen for less than 10 minutes. Mario Caiano brings nothing inventive of note to the direction. And the score by Bruno Nicolai while entertaining is not very original. But none of that really matters. This isn't art  it's about having a good time. And on that level The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe works. Watching Joe kick the crap out of a bunch of cowboys is a real blast. The fight scene between Lee and Kinski is the highlight. If you've ever wanted to see a Kung Fu master fight after being shot in both legs this is your movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fight Fists of Shanghai Joe 1973 sounds like one of those awful genre bending films that repeatedly crop up over the years however this kungfu Spaghetti Western is actually pretty decent and has certain similarities with the television series Kung Fu with David Carradine. It is directed by Mario Caiano who made a number of Spaghetti Westerns and stars Chen Lee as the eponymous Shanghai Joe.The story is straightforward almost verging on the simplistic. Joe is a recent immigrant from China to San Francisco where in search of work he heads to Texas. Here he gets on the wrong side of a powerful racist rancher Stanley Spencer Piero Lulli after he witnesses the massacre of Mexican slave labourers.This Western tries to say some interesting things about the West and how Chinese immigrants helped do a lot of the dirty jobs that Whites wouldn't do. Sadly most of this is drowned under its comic book style and some pretty bad kungfu. Yet it does have some good parts most of the action scenes come with Peckinpahesque slow motion and exploding bloody squids. Some of the violence is pretty strong too with Lee pulling a bad guy's eyes out on screen. But due to its lighthearted mode it never feels dark or repellent. In fact it is all rather comic lacking the seriousness as Django Kill If You Live Shoot! 1967 has from its strong violence.Acting wise Chen Lee is probably as wooden as his martial arts but Piero Lulli makes a fine villain and Klaus Kinski's virtually cameolike role is memorable. The scene where the Mexicans are killed is welldirected as are a number of other action scenes sufficient enough to make sure that the Western is at least fast paced.It isn't a brilliant piece of cinema but as the Spaghetti Western genre went down the drains it is refreshingly old fashioned in a way occasionally recalling the past Golden Era of the late sixties that makes it worth checking out for the Spaghetti Western enthusiast.".

Some of the violence is pretty strong too with Lee pulling a bad guy's eyes out on screen. But due to its lighthearted mode it never feels dark or repellent. In fact it is all rather comic lacking the seriousness as Django Kill If You Live Shoot! 1967 has from its strong violence.Acting wise Chen Lee is probably as wooden as his martial arts but Piero Lulli makes a fine villain and Klaus Kinski's virtually cameolike role is memorable. The scene where the Mexicans are killed is welldirected as are a number of other action scenes sufficient enough to make sure that the Western is at least fast paced.It isn't a brilliant piece of cinema but as the Spaghetti Western genre went down the drains it is refreshingly old fashioned in a way occasionally recalling the past Golden Era of the late sixties that makes it worth checking out for the Spaghetti Western enthusiast.";

	schema:headline " Spaghetti Western mixed with Martial Arts Wuxia film genre didn't really enhance the flavors of this cup of Joe that well. It looks awkward but still fun to drink.";
	schema:reviewBody "1973's film 'Shanghai Joe' is no 2000's 'Shanghai Noon'. It's not even in the league of 1975's TV Show 'Kung Fu' with actor David Carradine in my opinion this Italian Wuxia Western movie was below average. Don't get me wrong Shanghai Joe' is no average Joe Schmoe. It's entertaining but it's just wasn't that good. Directed by Mario Caiano 'The Fighting Fist of Shanghai Joe' also known as 'My Name Is Shanghai Joe' 'The Dragon Strikes Back' 'To Kill or to Die' and 'Karate Jack' tells the story of a Chinese immigrant Shanghai JoeKarate JackChin Hau Chen Lee seeking a new and peaceful life in America only to find out that he's not exactly welcomed with open arms by cattle ranchers led by owner Stanley Spencer Piero Lulli who using Mexican slaves as cattle. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say Chen Lee isn't a good actor. A 'deer in the headlights' boring performance. His acting is so mundane by his emotionless delivery. Yes I guess he supposed to be rather calm cool and collected but he doesn't show any range to anything that is happening on screen like people dying. What happen!? Did he went to the Tommy Wiseau's school of acting!? Not only that but his character is such a Gary Stu! He seems seemingly perfect in every task he does. It doesn't make sense. Like how in the world did he get so good in playing cards while training in martial arts!? Also how did Shanghai Joe able to walk after getting shot in the legs after a few days of healing!? It doesn't add up! Also Chen Lee's badly made choreography fight scenes were just as bizarre and silly with his unrealistic slowmotion flips mediocre hitskicks and awkward cries. I was laughing my head off when action scenes like the bullchopping fancy jumping a horse and bullet catching scene were on screen. It was so overthetop! However the gore and visual effects were alright for the time even if they didn't film it that well. I was really confusing on how Shanghai Joe went to eye gouge and heart pull his enemies because of that. Despite that I have to say the music score by composer Bruno Nicolai is a notable asset that really help set the tone of the film even if it's recycle from 1970's western film 'Have a Good Funeral My Friend... Sartana Will Pay'. While the picture quality is decent some speckling and the colors are indeed washed out. Also the sound is sometimes rather indistinct but all of the English dialogue is understandable no gaps in the Italian translates. Yet by far the best thing in this movie are the supporting cast that plays the series of villains that Spencer hires to take down Shanghai Joe. Actors like Gordon Mitchell and Klaus Kinski really made their characters Burying Sam  Scalper Jack really stood out by their cunning action. Even the over the top gory unrealistic fight sequences with Japanese fighter Mikuja Katsutoshi Mikuriya  Tricky the Gambler Giacomo RossiStuart were memorable. Yet I wish they could had done more with Pedro the Cannibal Claudio Undari. His scene was a bit disappointing. Talking about disappointing. I really don't like how Carla Romanelli's Cristina was just there to be the force love interest and damsel in distress. Her character really didn't add anything to the film at all! Another problem with this film is the pacing. Honestly did we really need to see his journey from California to Texas or his scenes with previous ranchers!? It takes forever for the main plot to start. Also for a few dollars more they really could had work on the production value a little more. First off the Almerian locations look so small and uglylooking. San Francisco is a good example. It doesn't look or feel like San Francisco at the time. Also the subtitles really got it wrong with St. Francisco. It wasn't never call that!? Another problem is the costumes some of the characters look like they're wearing clothes from a 1940's gangster movie rather than more westernlooking costumes! It was very jarring. Anyways while this film gives us a rather bleak view of the United States as an intolerant country uneducated racist and violent which still traffics humans that might offend some viewers. As an American I kinda like this movie despite its flaws. After all the film was enough of a success to boast a sequel 1975's 'The Return of Shanghai Joe'. Overall Enjoyable eastmeetswest fare that is a little bit awkward. Still highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Successfully violent combination of kung fu and spaghetti western";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably one of the oddest subgenres in cinema is the kung fu spaghetti western. THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE is one of the best and most popular of this genre which saw Italian producers deciding to combine the thenpopular martial arts film with the spaghetti western which like the peplum ten years previously was crying out for fresh ideas and imagination. The result was about halfadozen productions which mixed chopsocky action with grizzly cowboys and desert town locations to unique effect. THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE is actually a very wellmade movie benefiting from strong direction from Mario Caiano a rather overlooked genre personality from the period who could usually be relied upon to deliver a watchable movie. The plot is simple and straightforward and a basis for the neverending scenes of action which are hardhitting and often violent.Although the premise is silly and could be played for laughs this is actually a very dark film in which the hardedged action is often punctuated by merciless violence and surprising gore effects. The main themes that the film explores are racism and oppression our hero Shanghai Joe must suffer both of these throughout the film. First come the expected encounters with racist cowboys whose vocabulary usually seems to contain only racist taunts before Joe teaches them a lesson in manners. Later he defeats a gang of slave labourers quite happy using Mexican peasants to do their dirty work thus invoking the wrath of a criminal boss and setting the latter half of the film in motion.Whereas the first half of the movie spends a fair amount of time developing Joe's character and the new landscape in which he finds himself also exploring his relationships with other people the second half loses all exposition in favour of a series of fight sequences against increasingly difficult opponents thus reminding one of a computer game. The first baddie for Joe to fight is a guy named Cannibal! The second villain is Italian regular Gordon Mitchell in a blond wig. The third villain is all brains and no brawn as played by Giacomo RossiStuart. The final villain is a scalphunter played by the inimitably sleazy Klaus Kinski at his manic best.The final battle of the film is the only one with any memorable choreography seeing as Shanghai Joe gets to fight a fellow martial artist instead of an unskilled cowboy. Caiano throws in some good use of slowmotion leaping not as silly as it sounds some creepy music which comes as a surprise after the rest of the jolly Morriconestyle score and a wonderful 360 sweep around Joe as he searches for his opponent. The film's hero is played by Chen Lee who is pretty decent in the part and succeeds because he's actually an actor as well as a martial artist and seems charismatic in his role. Tons of action armlopping gore memorably deranged characters and steadfast direction combine to make this one a whole lotta fun.".

	schema:headline " weird mashup of 2 exploitation genres";
	schema:reviewBody "Ahhhh the Kung Fu Spaghetti Western a weird hybrid that existed for a brief flash in the world of exploitation cinema. This film known by various titles including DRAGON STRIKES AGAIN and most commonly THE FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE came out in 1974 probably the zenith year for such attempts. FYI 1992 was the peak year for the CyborgKickboxer mashupbut that's another story. Directed by undistinguished Italian genre hack Mario Caiano the pic presents the tale of a Chinese loner ambling his way through the American Old West. The lead is played by the littleseen Chen Lee. Lee has only three movie credits to his name each in an Italian film which begs the question of whether he is an actor per se or merely a expert martial artist that happened to be living in Italy at the time. But whatever the explanation Lee manages to acquit himself rather well in this performance. He has an easygoing laconic presence that is pleasantly free of the stiffness sometimes on display among nonacting fighters. Of course his dialog is dubbed but so is everyone else's here so it's hard to judge him in that respect. After a few vignettes depicting Lee's troubles in finding transportation food and ranch work due to the locals' bigotry and bullying we settle in to the main thrust of the story wherein Lee aims to help liberate Mexican peons who are being enslaved by evil rancher Spencer played by the familiar Piero Lulli. Along to help him is the pretty Mexican Cristina Carla Romanelli and she turns into a sort of love interest for him.There are a few weird quirks about the pic that are worth noting. First our hero goes unnamed for about the first 34 of the filmno one asks his name an he is never addressed by anyone. Then out of the blue he offhandedly refers to himself as Shanghai Joe in a chat with Cristina. OK after 80 minutes we learn his name... the in the very next scene Spencer calls for Joe to be killed and shouts Go get Chin Hao! a name by which Joe is referred for the final few minutes. What the heck? How did Spencer learn this guy's Chinese name? Is this a sloppy scripting gaffe a botched dubbing mistake poor exposition? Whatever the reason it's weird.Another oddity is the plot twist where late in the story Spencer and his men meet to decide how to deal with Joe. They opine that four notorious hit men would each be perfect for doing away with the Chinaman. What follows is a quick series of pretty ridiculous vignettes as colorful baddies with names like The Cannibal are dispatched by Joe. Among these hit men are topbilled stars Gordon Mitchell as Buryin' Sam and Klaus Kinski as Scalper Jack. Their scenes are so brief basically cameo appearances that neither of the two have a real chance to flex their wild woolly acting chops. A wasted opportunity.The hit men sequences display another unusual aspect of this picture a great number of grotesque gory and explicit wounds and deaths. Kinski's character obviously relishes cutting his victim's scalps off Mitchell builds a spiked gravetrap for his victim to fall into. Also seen elsewhere in the film are an eyeball gouged out homemade acupuncture on a bullet wound and a man's hand shot off. Gruesome stuff and oddly disconcerting these shots don't give a visceral thrill or gasp rather they make you do a doubletake in disbelief like what was that? Also unusual to the modern viewer are the camera tricks and staging used to suggest Joe's jumping and fighting prowess. Quite a few times we see the ol' reverse footage trick to depict someone jumping from a standstill up onto a tall perch. In '74 that might have wowed 'em but by now we can see right through that trick.In the end the various exploitation elements can't make this a cohesive engaging feature. Caiano's pacing is suspect as little momentum carries over from one scene to the next giving the 93minute picture quite a plodding pace. And with no protagonist other than the stonefaced Joe there is no charismatic heart to the story. As capable as Lee is an effervescent sidekick or partner might have livened things up. What we do have to stir the soul however is the absolutely BRILLIANT theme music by Bruno Nicolai which plays several times throughout. As great as the Morriconetrained Nicolai is I will without hesitation call this the greatest theme that I've heard of his career. It is a rousing epic delight that will stay with you long after the flick is done.In all I think the idea of this film is better than the actual finished product. Kung Fu cowboys cartoonish violence and gore eastern philosophy gunfights ... it ought to add up to a better picture that what it is. Not on anybody's mustsee list but a watchable curiosity. Call it a C or 610 stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ahhhh the Kung Fu Spaghetti Western a weird hybrid that existed for a brief flash in the world of exploitation cinema. This film known by various titles including DRAGON STRIKES AGAIN and most commonly THE FIGHTING FIST OF SHANGHAI JOE came out in 1974 probably the zenith year for such attempts. FYI 1992 was the peak year for the CyborgKickboxer mashupbut that's another story. Directed by undistinguished Italian genre hack Mario Caiano the pic presents the tale of a Chinese loner ambling his way through the American Old West. The lead is played by the littleseen Chen Lee. Lee has only three movie credits to his name each in an Italian film which begs the question of whether he is an actor per se or merely a expert martial artist that happened to be living in Italy at the time. But whatever the explanation Lee manages to acquit himself rather well in this performance. He has an easygoing laconic presence that is pleasantly free of the stiffness sometimes on display among nonacting fighters. Of course his dialog is dubbed but so is everyone else's here so it's hard to judge him in that respect. After a few vignettes depicting Lee's troubles in finding transportation food and ranch work due to the locals' bigotry and bullying we settle in to the main thrust of the story wherein Lee aims to help liberate Mexican peons who are being enslaved by evil rancher Spencer played by the familiar Piero Lulli. Along to help him is the pretty Mexican Cristina Carla Romanelli and she turns into a sort of love interest for him.There are a few weird quirks about the pic that are worth noting. First our hero goes unnamed for about the first 34 of the filmno one asks his name an he is never addressed by anyone. Then out of the blue he offhandedly refers to himself as Shanghai Joe in a chat with Cristina. OK after 80 minutes we learn his name... the in the very next scene Spencer calls for Joe to be killed and shouts Go get Chin Hao! a name by which Joe is referred for the final few minutes. What the heck? How did Spencer learn this guy's Chinese name? Is this a sloppy scripting gaffe a botched dubbing mistake poor exposition? Whatever the reason it's weird.Another oddity is the plot twist where late in the story Spencer and his men meet to decide how to deal with Joe. They opine that four notorious hit men would each be perfect for doing away with the Chinaman. What follows is a quick series of pretty ridiculous vignettes as colorful baddies with names like The Cannibal are dispatched by Joe. Among these hit men are topbilled stars Gordon Mitchell as Buryin' Sam and Klaus Kinski as Scalper Jack. Their scenes are so brief basically cameo appearances that neither of the two have a real chance to flex their wild woolly acting chops. A wasted opportunity.The hit men sequences display another unusual aspect of this picture a great number of grotesque gory and explicit wounds and deaths.

It's a typical kung fu east meats racist west movie set in the west for those of you who find that concept original there was a popular TV show on at the time called Kung Fu so this is along those same lines except since its a movie they can do a lot more in the violence department. As the concept goes it would rate just a 5 or so but the violence is soooo over the top that it definitely elevates the ohh and ahh factor for me to a solid 8. This guy goes through at least 6 to 8 fights pissing off the whole west as he goes and meets at least 4 video game type bosses in fact he meats so many bosses that the movie ends before he gets the guy behind it all! I think they saved the big boss for the sequel that I'll probably never see as it's not included in this movie pack deal I got although someday I will run across it I'm sure and probably hate it lol. This is a great flick to watch with friends and laugh along the way and then say dang! when he starts pulling bosses eyeballs and hearts out 8 of 10 for over the top cheesy violence it set new ground for me for a movie from the 70's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fighting Fist of Shangai Joe The 1972  12 out of 4 Extremely weird blend of the Spaghetti Western and Martial Arts genres has a Chinese immigrant Chen Lee showing up in Texas where he receives all sorts of racial slurs as well as people trying to mistreat him. He breaks up a slave ring but then finds himself being hunted by professional killers including one played by Klaus Kinski. I'm rather new to both of these genres but I must say I really enjoyed this film for the most part even though you can never really take it too seriously. This movie seems to get a lot of mixed reviews which is understandable because if someone comes into this movie expecting a serious western then they're going to be disappointed because there's more camp than anything else. The film is strange on so many levels but we can start with the violence which starts off rather weak and standard but quickly turns violent and over the top. There's one sequence where a man has his hand blown off and this here leads to some really graphic violence as an eyeball is ripped out as well as a heart. Lee is pretty good in his role as is Kinski but for some reason he's only in the film for less than five minutes so if you're tuning in to see him then you're going to be disappointed. The American version I watched had some very bad dubbing which included a white man doing the voice of Shangai Joe but this did deliver a few laughs. Caiano is best known for his Italian horror film Nightmare Castle but he does a good job with the material here and delivers a memorable if quite silly film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emmas Glck or Emma's Bliss is a German movie from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year and it runs for almost 100 minutes including credits. The film received some actually great awards consideration winning prizes at all kinds of festivals. The exception were perhaps the German Film Awards where the movie was nominated as well but came short in all categories. In Germany the film maybe went a bit under the radar in general because 2006 was the year for Oscar winner Das Leben der Anderen. But looking at the number of ratings here on IMDb it seems that the movie is getting some more attention the more time has passed. This may also have to do with director Sven Taddicken and for him it is still the most known work. We will see if he can ever top the success as he is still a prolific filmmaker these days. For lead actress Jrdis Triebel it is probably also still the most known work as of today. I don't think it is anywhere near her best though and I think I am a good judge of that because I have seen many of her performances and the fact that she is among the Alist of German actresses now is really not because of this film even if it helps her popularity a bit I guess. Her colead in here is Jrgen Vogel and he is really the most known cast member I guess. He also won an important prize for his performance. I cannot say I agree with that though. Vogel is an actor in my opinion who shines more through charisma than through range unlike Triebel and the role of a suffering man with a tragic fate is not really wellsuited for him I would say. He has some pretty good films and performances under his belt. This is not one of them. As for the supporting characters Feifel is much better than what he can show us here. Schnemann I am quite a fan of and I think he did a good job too. The German Film Award nomination may have been a bit too much but he was ignored for other strong performances frequently so I am fine with it. Overall I have to give this film here a thumbsdown. I felt that Triebel and Vogel really did not have any great chemistry at all and as the film is basically all about them together I would say that that's really crucial and a negative deal breaker for me. I also don't like the violence against animals in here early on. The biking scene really also very early felt like a weak remake of the one in Mdchen Mdchen a film admittedly way worse than this one here. And towards the end the scene with the knife and the neck just did not work for me at all. Nobody would want that to be done. Nobody would want to do that. There's a difference between men and pigs. Overall I think this film is certainly a bit on the overrated side. I give it a thumbsdown and suggest you watch something else instead.".

This was probably made partly in response to Hollywood's The House of Rothschild 1934 which was sympathetic to the Rothschilds.In 1806 Mayer Rothschild the patriarch of the family residing in Frankfurt receives a huge sum of money for custody from the local margrave who is on the run from the Napoleonic troops. Mayer decides to send the money to his son Nathan who lives in England and is trying to build the British side of the dynasty. Nathan who is increasingly envied and seen as a foreign upstart by the other financiers in London decides to offer his services to the British government as a paymaster to the army of the Duke of Wellington who is fighting Napoleon in the European continent using the considerable connections of the family in the continent. Eventually and thanks in part to the advance knowledge of the outcome of the battle of Waterloo Nathan would be able to make a considerable fortune at the expense of the other London merchants. The final note tells that while the present Rothschilds have escaped from Europe that is after Germany's victory in the battle of France in June 1940 they remain in Britain where they basically control the government.Compared to other antiSemitic films made by the Nazis like Jud Suss or Der Ewige Jude this movie is relatively restrained the Jews here are portrayed as devious and slimy but not as downright evil. I guess the movie's message is about how the Rothschilds profited greatly from the wars in this case the Napoleonic wars. One of the surprising things about this movie is how literate it is and how intricate is its plot. Nowadays a plot so complicated would probably not make it into production the filmmakers would be told to lighten it up and dumb it down in order for the audience to understand it. Erich Ponto and Carl Kuhlmann are suitably sneaky as Mayer and Nathan Rothschild the other actors cause less of an impression and there is a completely unnecessary subplot about a British officer trying to woo the daughter of an English financier. But if you can see beyond the questionable ideology this is a well made movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Review Might Contain SpoilersDIE ROTHSCHILDS AKTIEN AUF WATERLOO or THE ROTHSCHILDS' SHARES IN WATERLOO 1940 was the first antiSemitic film produced by the Nazis. Unlike their virulent 'documentary' THE ETERNAL JEW it's propaganda disguised as a historical biography but nowhere as skillfully inflammatory as JEW SUSS another historical 'biography' that had a stronger impact on audiences than the other two films released the same year. Goebbels produced these three films as a reaction to earlier foreign versions with the same titles that were sympathetic to Jews. The film begins with Erich Ponto the most recognized cast member who was a popular character actor seen in DAS MADCHEN JOHANNA 1935 and DIE FEURERZANGENBOWLE 1944 and after WWII in THE THIRD MAN 1949 cast as Mayer Rothschild the head of the banking family making a deal to hide the Mayor of Frankfurt's 600000 pounds in England from Napoleon and with the help of his sons Nathan in England and James in France the family uses this money to build their fortune and finance Wellington's army. Nathan is first seen violating the Sabbath to further the deal and later treated with disdain and blackballing by the snobbish members of the British Stock Exchange when he attempts to ingratiate himself into their business and social world because he's 'not one of them' i.e. a Jew and worse a foreign one. After Nathan seizes the opportunity to give a rival's wife a ride in his carriage her husband coldly asks he if wants to be reimbursed and a surprised Nathan says politely You're trying to insult me. The husband replies No Mr. Rothschild. I'm just trying to prevent you from losing. a dry dig about how Jews stereotypically must be making money every minute of the day.Nathan frets over his risky wheeling  dealing with England and the antiNapoleon French and eventually he makes a fortune unlike his brother James's negotiations with the French Chief of Police who must receive high kickbacks for them to do business. Nathan ruins his enemies by spreading the wrong news about the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo to manipulate stock market prices. The Mayor's money is safely returned with a bill for the Rothschild's handling fee and he questions James in how much more they really made off him as nothing is more disgusting than one pickpocket telling lies to another. The film ends with the Commissioner of the Treasury and a victorious Nathan showing him a map of the world and connects the cities where his family's banks are located by drawing a hexagram then superimposed with a flaming Star of David. The closing title tells us By the conclusion of this film the last of the Rothschilds have left Europe as refugees. The struggle against their English accomplices the British plutocracy continues. Not only is ROTHSCHILDS antiSemitic it's equally antiBritish as outlined in scattered titles. The film's production history should be noted as the film's original title was lengthened later when the film was reedited Beyond its indictment of Jewish intrigue and avarice THE ROTHSCHILDS aimed to show the 'Judafication' of British society at Rothschild hands and thus demonstrate why in Goebbels' words Britons had become the Jews among Aryans. Yet the film's dramatic conventions did not always mesh with its racial politics and when the film was released in July 1940 German audiences were left unclear as to just who they were mainly supposed to hate. Goebbels had it pulled from distribution a year later a muchrevised version purged of any conceivable sympathies for its British characters was released. The revamped movie was renamed THE ROTHSCHILDS' SHARE IN WATERLOO and this is the only version available.Even in the film's existing state it's not as antiSemitic or anti English as you would expect something the filmmakers miscalculated with mixed results. You do feel some sympathy for Nathan who's continuously snubbed by his rivals and when the Commissioner of the Treasury questions their motives in denouncing his actions he advises them not to be prejudiced because Nathan is Jewish and sends them away. At this meeting the Commissioner seems sympathetic to Nathan's plight which goes against the film's propaganda intent or should audiences think it's a sign of his naivety and a warning for them not to trust Jews but at the film's conclusion we learn he's not naive because he's seen with Nathan who's gloating over his victory meaning the Commissioner was shrewd in surmising who would be the better moneymaker to help England and most likely himself as the English go handinhand with the Jews as stated in the end title quoted above. However not all the English are portrayed badly. You will probably feel more sympathy for the lower classes who lose their savings when their banks fail. There's also a subplot concerning a decent young man who wants to marry a broker's daughter but is rejected by her father because he isn't wealthy and is hired by Nathan not for altruistic reasons but to acquire favorable military info. The handsome couple is protected by an Irish woman who constantly speaks her mind against English hypocrisy and Nathan's flattery as Nazi films fantasized the Irish as their antiEnglish 'allies.' THE ROTHSCHILDS' SHARES IN WATERLOO is a provocative costume picture heavy on plot and dialog so you might have to see it more than once to follow the monetary and political intrigue There's also a love story nicely fitted into the plot to make it appeal to a wider audience. There were some earlier films with mild bits of antiSemitic humor like ROBERT AND BERTRAM 1939 but that comedy's emphasis was on the two Aryan leads avoiding working for a living. ROTHSCHILDS was the first of Goebbels's major propaganda weapons and a serious drama where the main character was Jewish and also the villain and not a comic one.".

In many ways this is the same story and seeing both films can tell you a great deal about the medium of film and its value for propaganda when you tell the same story but slant it differently.In the American version the Rothschild family is shown as canny business people but patriots who staked their personal fortunes on the outcome of the Napoleonic Wars and that final Battle Of Waterloo. They faced the antiSemitic prejudice and triumphed. The same prejudice that Joe Goebbels and the German film industry was trying to spread.The Rothschild sons go to different parts of Europe in both films and Carl Kuhlman playing Nathan Rothschild here is working for a consortium of Jews looking to make those profits no matter how things turn out. The plot could have been taken from The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion it's that vicious.The British themselves are shown as a bunch of greedy speculators anyway and the French don't really deserve a guy like Napoleon Bonaparte running things. The saviors of Europe were of course the Prussians. They certainly arrive in the nick of time to insure victory for the Duke Of Wellington in real life. But overall their performance in the Napoleonic Wars wasn't all that great.Note that the film's release came on July 17 1940. The end of the film had a coda saying that the Rothschilds and their Jewish agents are all refugees from Europe now but we still have to deal with those left in Great Britain. That's about the time Mr. Hitler did start dealing with the British home land in his usual fashion.The Rothschilds a great example of Hitler's use of film to fan anti Semitism. Getting rid of these Jews and their evil practices it's what our crusade is all about.You can't watch this film without a shudder.".

This was obviously a way in which Nazi Germany tried to explain their behavior towards Jews as reasonable and appropriate. I myself must say I was not impressed at all though. It is neither a good film in terms of acting nor in terms of storytelling. The only reason I somehow see is from a political perspective in terms of how the medium film was used in order to send a certain political message to the people.

The man was Yukio Mishima one of Japan's greatest and most celebrated novelists. With four members of his own private army  the Tatenokai  Mishima had taken the commandant hostage and called upon the assembled military outside the Ministry to overthrow their society and restore the powers of the Emperor. When the soldiers mocked and jeered Mishima he cut short his speech and withdrew to the commandant's office where he committed seppuku  the samurai warrior's death  tearing open his belly with a ceremonial knife before being beheaded by one of his colleagues. What was Mishima truly trying to express through his actions? And what did he witness during his final moments?";

	schema:reviewBody "In Japan this film is being positioned as the last installment of director Wakamatsu's Showa Trilogy Showa being the name of the era covered by the reign of Hirohito 1926  1989 and tells the Mishima story in the context of the tumultuous Showa 40s mid 60s  mid 70s. As in United Red Army and Caterpillar the two previous installments Wakamatsu sprinkles his opus with plenty of newsreel footage about mainly political incidents leading up to his climax which in this case means violent demonstrations in central Tokyo against the U.S.Japan Security Treaty and the Vietnam War the occupation of Yasuda Hall at the University of Tokyo and the Red Army hijacking of a commercial flight among other things. But Wakamatsu wisely opens with an event that took place a bit earlier the 1960 assassination of the leader of the Socialist Party by a rightwing youth who later hangs himself with a torn bed sheet after scribbling characters meaning Seven lives I'll give for the country! Long live the emperor! on the wall in his own blood presumably. This in turn leads him further back to what is known as the February 26th Incident an attempted coup led by selfstyled patriotic young officers in 1936. The Incident is no less than an archetypal model of ultraright ideology and action in the modern period and is still presented in a romantic light in Japan. Wakamatsu correctly discerns the thread linking these two events with Mishima's and indeed all the other rightwing lunacy that followed and is still sporadically occurring.This however is precisely the problem with his film. Wakamatsu focuses exclusively on the political strand and so ignores the many other strands that went into the complex and conflicted psyche that was the real Mishima  his homoeroticism his narcissism his flamboyance his taste for rococo and admiration of Greece his delicacy his fecund imagination. Granted Wakamatsu did not set out to make a bio. But as a result Mishima appears in only his last incarnation whose makings we are told nothing about. He has about as much depth as cardboard and is about as interesting. Ditto for the character of Morita who comes off to me as a simpleminded fanatic. Viewed in a purely political light their thought is beneath consideration and doesn't deserve the term for it is nothing but sentimentality proceeding from wrongheaded and dangerous notions about bushido the way of the samurai the emperor and above all Japanese identity. Indeed the last day is obviously best construed not as a political act but as spectacular I would say stock as well theater by an author and playwright stepping into and playing out in reality the persona he had come to idealize following an anachronistic script complete with all the de rigueur elements right down to the oaths written in blood swordplay headbands with heroic slogans Seven lives... again the rousing exhortation death poems and of course the bellycut itself.Another thing that bothers me is the way Wakamatsu seems to fall for these trappings himself. The camera dwells lovingly it appears to me on the formulaic death poems of each member. And in a burst of pure bathos it cuts to a scene of petals fluttering down from cherry blossom trees at the moment of decapitation. I audibly groaned at the resort to this incredibly hackneyed clich of Japanese cinema. At least no petals fell on the paper on which the death poems were written. Do we really want more romanticizing of this sort of ironically selfindulgent behavior?Arata Iura and Shinnosuke Mitsushima as Mishima and Morita respectively emote like crazy but in a losing battle for the film per se is extraordinarily illconceived and the script tedious. One little thing  I did wish Arata had hit the gym more and pasted some hair on his chest for the part for his physique did the real YM a dishonor. I would recommend this film only to viewers who are interested in seeing a recreation of the events leading up to and on the fateful day for these were reportedly wellresearched. For a portrait of Mishima all would do much better to see the 1985 film Mishima  A Life in Four Chapters directed by Paul Schrader and starring the late Ken Ogata a firstrate actor who is much missed in Japan. And for those curious about Japanese fanaticism by all means see the real thing in the documentary Yasukuni the 2007 stunner directed by Li Ying.I saw Mishima in a theater in Tokyo's Shinjuku district the scene of some of the rioting depicted in it on the very first day of its run. Given the pervasive political ennui in the country it was hard to believe things were once so overheated. The movie ends with Mishima's widow asking a former member sitting at a bar counter what the militia had bequeathed. He offers no answer but merely unfolds his hands holds them palms up empty in other words and turns to the camera. Wakamatsu seems to be looking for an answer from the audience. But judging from the fact that the theater was barely half full the question is apparently of little concern to the theatergoing public. One can only conclude that there is a resounding lack of interest in either Mishima or Wakamatsu or both. If that is their reaction to Mishima as portrayed by Wakamatsu anyway I think it is the right one and a good thing too.".

	onyx:emotionText "In Japan this film is being positioned as the last installment of director Wakamatsu's Showa Trilogy Showa being the name of the era covered by the reign of Hirohito 1926  1989 and tells the Mishima story in the context of the tumultuous Showa 40s mid 60s  mid 70s. As in United Red Army and Caterpillar the two previous installments Wakamatsu sprinkles his opus with plenty of newsreel footage about mainly political incidents leading up to his climax which in this case means violent demonstrations in central Tokyo against the U.S.Japan Security Treaty and the Vietnam War the occupation of Yasuda Hall at the University of Tokyo and the Red Army hijacking of a commercial flight among other things. But Wakamatsu wisely opens with an event that took place a bit earlier the 1960 assassination of the leader of the Socialist Party by a rightwing youth who later hangs himself with a torn bed sheet after scribbling characters meaning Seven lives I'll give for the country! Long live the emperor! on the wall in his own blood presumably. This in turn leads him further back to what is known as the February 26th Incident an attempted coup led by selfstyled patriotic young officers in 1936. The Incident is no less than an archetypal model of ultraright ideology and action in the modern period and is still presented in a romantic light in Japan. Wakamatsu correctly discerns the thread linking these two events with Mishima's and indeed all the other rightwing lunacy that followed and is still sporadically occurring.This however is precisely the problem with his film. Wakamatsu focuses exclusively on the political strand and so ignores the many other strands that went into the complex and conflicted psyche that was the real Mishima  his homoeroticism his narcissism his flamboyance his taste for rococo and admiration of Greece his delicacy his fecund imagination. Granted Wakamatsu did not set out to make a bio. But as a result Mishima appears in only his last incarnation whose makings we are told nothing about. He has about as much depth as cardboard and is about as interesting. Ditto for the character of Morita who comes off to me as a simpleminded fanatic. Viewed in a purely political light their thought is beneath consideration and doesn't deserve the term for it is nothing but sentimentality proceeding from wrongheaded and dangerous notions about bushido the way of the samurai the emperor and above all Japanese identity. Indeed the last day is obviously best construed not as a political act but as spectacular I would say stock as well theater by an author and playwright stepping into and playing out in reality the persona he had come to idealize following an anachronistic script complete with all the de rigueur elements right down to the oaths written in blood swordplay headbands with heroic slogans Seven lives... again the rousing exhortation death poems and of course the bellycut itself.Another thing that bothers me is the way Wakamatsu seems to fall for these trappings himself. The camera dwells lovingly it appears to me on the formulaic death poems of each member. And in a burst of pure bathos it cuts to a scene of petals fluttering down from cherry blossom trees at the moment of decapitation. I audibly groaned at the resort to this incredibly hackneyed clich of Japanese cinema. At least no petals fell on the paper on which the death poems were written. Do we really want more romanticizing of this sort of ironically selfindulgent behavior?Arata Iura and Shinnosuke Mitsushima as Mishima and Morita respectively emote like crazy but in a losing battle for the film per se is extraordinarily illconceived and the script tedious. One little thing  I did wish Arata had hit the gym more and pasted some hair on his chest for the part for his physique did the real YM a dishonor. I would recommend this film only to viewers who are interested in seeing a recreation of the events leading up to and on the fateful day for these were reportedly wellresearched. For a portrait of Mishima all would do much better to see the 1985 film Mishima  A Life in Four Chapters directed by Paul Schrader and starring the late Ken Ogata a firstrate actor who is much missed in Japan. And for those curious about Japanese fanaticism by all means see the real thing in the documentary Yasukuni the 2007 stunner directed by Li Ying.I saw Mishima in a theater in Tokyo's Shinjuku district the scene of some of the rioting depicted in it on the very first day of its run. Given the pervasive political ennui in the country it was hard to believe things were once so overheated. The movie ends with Mishima's widow asking a former member sitting at a bar counter what the militia had bequeathed. He offers no answer but merely unfolds his hands holds them palms up empty in other words and turns to the camera. Wakamatsu seems to be looking for an answer from the audience. But judging from the fact that the theater was barely half full the question is apparently of little concern to the theatergoing public. One can only conclude that there is a resounding lack of interest in either Mishima or Wakamatsu or both. If that is their reaction to Mishima as portrayed by Wakamatsu anyway I think it is the right one and a good thing too.";

	schema:reviewBody "...was the tagline for this flick so it caught my interest. Burning Palms is a film that tries to push boundaries and would only upset tight conservative folk. It seems to try too hard and comes off a bit juvenile. There are 5 stories they act as their own stories and do not interconnect with one another as some ads might say. They are told from a comic book a tales from the crypt style thing minus the hilarious Crypt Keeper.The first deals with a couple who are getting married. The husband to be is seeing his daughter for a week she is flying down from wherever she was. Innocent enough until you find out that the relationship between the two is a little too close for comfort. They openly talk about sex sunbath nude and dance erotically. The soon to be wife is taken back and tries to get the the bottom of the relationship. The second deals with a couple in college or university. He loves big boobs she has small ones During sex the man asks the girlfriend to stick her finger in his anus. She does so because she doesn't want to lose him to a bigger chested woman. After the act she gets it stuck in her mind that her finger smells like poo so she scrubs and scrubs until she finally decides to cut the finger off. The third story has two gay men adopting a black child from the black market. She seems to be straight out of Africa because she doesn't say a single word to anyone yet grabs a spear and throws it at an animal and growls. Thinking they are over their heads with a child they leave her alone in the woods and get a dog instead. The fourth story is the least exciting one. Three young and spoiled boys hold a Court TV bit in their house when a valuable item from the housemaid goes missing. We discover a dark secret from the housemaids past that turns things upside down in the house. Their stoner babysitter laughs at the sticky situation. The final and last segment actually happens to be my favourite and the one redeeming factor in this film. The story opens with the Rape of Sarah. After the rapist flees she finds his wallet under her couch and decides to track him down. When she does he soon finds out she has some sick and disturbing plans of her own. The final segment with have one thinking of a rape revenge bit but that's where the story wants you to go and the direction it takes itself is something I applaud. I was surprisingly taken back at the last one and it had the best performance. It helps that the two leads were Zoe Saldana and Nick Stahl.Overall a lackluster film that wants to be more 'dirty' than it actually is. Who knows maybe I'm one demoralized sicko and this film actually is twisted. But if you've seen half the films I have you'll find this pretty tame and immature.".

In the first segment there is very little to make me laugh.The most entertaining segment was certainly the gay couple and their mission to adopt either a child at any cost or a dog as an alternative and then the two guys with their 'pet child' meeting another similar couple with a 'pet child' in a shopping boutique.The last segment merited closer scrutiny but we were denied the opportunity to understand how the young lady found courage to handle her rape situation after the event and approach the guy who did it. I feel there was such a wasted opportunity with this storyline in particular to take it further.for example the rapist could possibly have been one of the children holding the Kangaroo Court a few years before not sure about link to the other story.There was momentary humour in the second story when it was explained to the girls parents what was the reason for her psychological paranoia but it was humour misplaced because the scene was essentially a sad one.Not sure at all why it was called 'burning palms' unless it is reference to being caught 'red handed'? The film is NOT rubbish and is worth watching. Certain scenes may offend but overall sexuality is moderated considering the extremity of the concept to the story lines and profanity is not as bad as you might think.You could easily watch this movie and feel you 'get something' out of it.

There was nothing remotely funny nothing emotionallyengaging but everything filled with crimes being committed or people who should be committed to a mental institution.I'm assuming the entire point of such a film was for the shock value. But shock only matters if there's something to care about in the first place. These filmmakers do not want you to care about these characters even if they do deserve care and support they just wanted to laugh at them. But let me repeat there is nothing remotely funny about any of this. Rape victims child murderers and suicidal women are not funny.These filmmakers are probably sitting back laughing at me right now because I didn't get it. But what they don't understand is that the art of offending relies on either an underlying truth to the situation or a greater meaning or purpose. There is no redeeming value to Burning Palms just inappropriate actions being played out for no reason or for inappropriate reasons but either way this is not acceptable filmmaking.".

Another user felt it necessary to also write his first review but to warn others of this film yet I felt I feel compelled to write the opposite as the first 5 reviews are quite mixed so far..I had to wait four months from the time I saw the trailer until the DVD arrived. The DVD is not even offered here in Vancouver Canada at future shop best buy or in video stores which is pretty strange. I had to find it online! So I'm not sure how many people are even going to hear of this let alone find a copy other than online.The film itself was definitely different but very entertaining in a good way. I don't see a need to explain the stories as other users have already but feel it necessary to say this is not as shocking or offending as I thought it would have been after watching the trailers and waiting for months in anticipation. I did love this film but it takes a lot to shock people nowadays so not sure why some people find it so terrible instead of treating it like a dark comedy... It portrays somewhat 'weirdodd' plot themes but don't feel this should turn people off from enjoying the film but only make it more enjoyable as it's a good change in pace from your average film. It also makes it more comedic that they've focused a plot on such stories..I don't feel that everyone will be offended or shocked and feel it laughable that someone would call viewers psychopaths and sociopaths for enjoying such a film. I do feel that Shannon Doherty could have played the psychologist in all 5 scenes but maybe due to time restraints they chose to only put her in 2. But they could have used her to interrelate the stories in my opinion. I also wish the order of the stories had been a little different. I thought the 5th story 'man eater' could have been told first. After laughing for an hour and a half at the other 4 stories I felt the last 20 minutes were a bit more of a drama than a comedy and I wish I could have finished the film on a comedic note. All in all this was an excellent film. I only gave it a 9 as I felt the 5th story should have been watched first to keep comedy going until the end. Excellent job Christopher Landon...Hopefully he has 5 more of these stories up his sleeve for a sequel! Go see this film!!!".

The second story This Little Piggy which I also dubbed The Poo Finger was downright hilarious. What's more if you've done some PSYC you'll know that there are certain disorders that result in this kind of behaviour there is a term for association to odours. In any case we know that Ginny is experiencing a psychological problem when she sees Jesus on the cross telling her to break off her finger.The third story Buyers Remorse was also very entertaining and the music was perfect. The gay couple interacting with each other made for hilarious scenes and really brought to mind memories of drama sketches. I laughed real hard when the first word Mahogany said was faggot. Great!I think the movie did a great job at being original and I credit it for its unique approach. There were certainly some pitfalls such as the storyline and plot but overall I found the acting to be superb. The script needed some work.Overall I would recommend this movie as a rent. It's definitely worth seeing if you want to be entertained. But I warn watchers to open their minds to the meanings of each of the stories as they can be interpreted in many ways. And really if you don't laugh at the Poo Finger ask yourself why.Also as a sidenote for anyone wondering I'm pretty sure I heard variations in the psychologist's accent and as the boy in the Kangaroo Court suggests to her I am also inclined to believe she was faking an accent. That boy would have to be pretty bright to piece together the nanny's murdering of her child.".

I looked up Psycopathy on Wikipedia and this is what it saysThe prototypical psychopath has deficits or deviance in several areas interpersonal relationships emotion and selfcontrol. Psychopaths gain satisfaction through antisocial behavior and do not experience shame guilt or remorse for their actions. Psychopaths lack a sense of guilt or remorse for any harm they may have caused others instead rationalizing the behavior blaming someone else or denying it outright.Psychopaths also lack empathy towards others in general resulting in tactlessness insensitivity and contemptuousness. Psychopaths can have a superficial charm about them enabled by a willingness to say anything to anyone without concern for accuracy or truth. Shallow affect also describes the psychopath's tendency for genuine emotion to be short lived glib and egocentric with an overall cold demeanor. Their behavior is impulsive and irresponsible often failing to keep a job or defaulting on debts.Psychopaths also have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions not only for others but also for themselves. They do not deeply recognize the risk of being caught disbelieved or injured as a result of their behavior.Researcher Robert Hare whose Hare Psychopathy Checklist is widely used describes psychopaths as intraspecies predators. Also R.I. Simon uses the word predator to describe psychopaths. Elsewhere Hare and others write that psychopaths use charisma manipulation intimidation sexual intercourse and violence to control others and to satisfy their own needs. Hare states that Lacking in conscience and empathy they take what they want and do as they please violating social norms and expectations without guilt or remorse. He previously stated that What is missing in other words are the very qualities that allow a human being to live in social harmony.To everyone who watched this Thing and found humor entertainment or value of any kind need to seriously check themselves against this description and evaluate their state of mental social and emotional health.".

If you think that ditching a child out in the middle of a forest or giving her crystalmeth is comedy then you are sick. Likewise if you think that rape portrayed in such an indepth fashion is funny you are very sick and need help. I understand if there was some sort of psychological or social context behind the rape in this movie to justify the 'Man Eater' sequel however the filmmakers seam to have put it in there because they get a kick from portraying human suffering and exploiting the sickest most perverted crevices of the human mind to an extent where storytelling looses its potential and only revulsion is left.I actually enjoy a fair share of darkcomedy and movies that are meant to gross you out and to disturb you but the film must have some meaningful backbone. In the sense that it must either have some metaphorical or personified meaning. 'Street Trash' 1987 is a movie I can recommend to anyone who truly wants to be shocked and not come out of the film feeling like a terrible person for laughing at societal taboos. The portrayal of sexual violence which isn't actually shown in 'Street Trash' goes overboard to the point where it's unbelievable and although crude and sickening it doesn't take you into the perception of the victim and the overall feeling is unreal with obvious humorous intent. Whereas 'Burning Palms' takes the victim and exploits such sensitive emotions close up on her face while being raped going further into her insecurities as her wanting in fact begging to get raped again.If people enjoy this and insist on it being a comedy then I have to ask what kind of society are we leaving in where people knowingly create films that exploit peoples insanity and insecurities in such a perverse way and have the audacity to call it comedy. Some of these so called 'taboos' that the film tries to explore are actually deeply serious and very unfunny problems that people deal with on a daily basis illegal adoption trading children on the black market abandonment of children rape and the psychological effects that it can have on a victim. So don't tell me it's just a movie. 'Buyers Remorse' and 'Man Eater' are the inscrutably offending segments of 'Burning Palms'.I can see the potential for humor in the third segment 'This Little Piggy' however I found the first and fourth segments to be in bad taste however I can see that this was the intention. I was surprised that well known actors agreed to star in this poor excuse for a movie and have lost respect for each one of them especially Lake Bell Boston Legal and Zoe Saldana Avatar.If you read my review and then think to yourself 'hmm I might as well just watch it out of interest sake' please don't you have nothing to gain from the film unless you're a sociopath who gets a kick at watching the indepth misery of people. I know that much more sick movies exist out there but irrespective Voyerism needs to have a line drawn through it at some point.".

Then there is the gay couple...this story is offensive on SO many levels. Drug abuse infidelity buying a black market child who isn't the perfectly adjusted living doll they desire so they abandon her in the woods? HOW IS THAT IN ANY WAY FUNNY!? Then the rich brats with the horrible nanny and babymurdering housekeeper who hangs herself in their front yard? Sorry I'm still not seeing the humor.Then let's finish off this comedy with a woman being raped then tracking down her attacker and making him do it again. While this is not at all funny this piece was the only reason I rated this movie with a 2 rather than the 0 it otherwise deserved. This one was a little more thought provoking and well acted and I feel it would have been a better standalone short film had it been explored a little more deeply rather than just thrown in for shock value.It's not that I don't get this movie. I get that they wanted to push boundaries and buttons but that counts for nothing if done at the expense of weaving a great story and creating characters people can feel anything for.".

While 'Burning Palms' is not a complete disaster the disturbing and entertaining moments were too far and between much of it being in bad taste and not for the easily offended.The best of the five anthology stories were for me This Little Piggy and Maneater. The former being the most entertaining where the few humorous parts that worked were present just wished that the ending was better rounded off and the latter being the creepiest and most compelling. Didn't care for the acting on the whole but some are decent. Coming off best are a sincere Jamie Chung an intense and touching Zoe Saldana and a suitably sleazy Nick Stahl. Rosamund Pike doesn't have all that much to do but brings a sense of urgency and intensity without being melodramatic that makes Green Eyed Monster watchable. Some of the music score is used to unsettling effect not being bombastic onenote or intrusive though most of the time it does its job serviceably but with not much distinction.Sadly two good segments a few decent performances and some nice moments musically were far outweighed by the numerous things that didn't work at all. Aside from Pike Green Eyed Monster is forgettable and doesn't really do anything with its incest subject matter. It also suffers from its ending feeling the most incompletefeeling and anticlimactic of all the five stories in a film where neither ending feels that wellrounded off. Kangaroo Court is similarly not that memorable and is further let down by a bland atmosphere a particularly limp pace and very predictable shocks. The worst of the five this viewer found to be Buyers Remorse which was an embarrassment with the film's most cringeworthy dialogue vicious gay stereotypes galore and even Africans will find the film's depiction of African stereotypes verging on offensive or even worse offensive fullstop.Visually 'Burning Palms' has an unfocused and monochrome visual style that fails to bring any atmosphere of any kind while there are also too many superfluous shots of people and objects that have nothing to do with the storytelling seeming only to be there for director Christopher Landon to revel in his cynicism and selfindulgence. Those are also the two words selfindulgent and cynical that is that would describe Landon's directing here am aware that this was his film debut but those characteristics completely take over any tension pace or suspense Landon could have provided.'Burning Palms's' script is at best sloppy only showing spark really in This Little Piggy. The funny parts are crass and vulgar with as said the supposed humour in Buyers Remorse enough to make even those with a strong stomach cringe. The parts intended to shock especially in Kangaroo Court are timed limply feel predictable and either too disgustingly crude or too tame with the film never feeling dark enough. The satire is next to nonexistent and if there was any it was nowhere near biting or sharp enough. Whatever points were made about stereotypes and such were done so viciously especially in Buyers Remorse and the film's general treatment of women that it all felt bigoted and misogynistic.Generally the storytelling apart from in two segments doesn't come off that well. Not enough of 'Burning Palms' entertains or disturbs pacing is slack the subject matters for all five stories are trivialised and not explored enough being completely lost in the film's content the five stories as well as ending on anticlimactic notes don't seem related to one another and little attempt is made to tie them together instead limping from one segment to another any parts intended to be dark are not dark at all being too tame and too safe like the writers were afraid to take the plunge properly and at the end of the day the viewer question what the point of the film was. Nothing is done to make the characters emotionally investable or easy to root for they are written too blandly and others are downright annoying.All in all not unwatchable but generally it didn't entertain and it didn't disturb or at least not enough. The only thing that was shocking was how distasteful much of the film felt. 310 Bethany Cox".

A father has intimate relations with his underage daughter a girl has problems with hygiene after a bizarre practice with her boyfriend a gay couple buys a daughter then realizing it's better to buy a dog. A housekeeper is mocking by a rebellious kid and then stolen by something that seems out of the ordinary and a young woman is a victim of a rape then she seeks the aggressor and put it in a position to repeat the scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Most of German and Austrian mainstream cinema of the fifties was light musical comedy sentimental drama or Heimatfilm escapist love stories set on the countryside  the Alps Black Forest or Lneburger Heide  glorifying natural environment folklore and the virtues of the plain and simple country folk. There was hardly a realistic view of WestGerman society during the years of the Economic Miracle. Young author Will Tremper did not like that sentimental stuff. Obviously influenced by Hollywood teen dramas The Wild One The Blackboard Jungle Rebel Without a Cause he and director Georg Tressler in 1956 realized Germany's first look on juvenile delinquency a film that is now regarded a classic of German postwar cinema. This one is hard raw and realistic omitting any false sentimentality or romanticism. Out of all German film made in the fifties it is my personal number one! The cast is fantastic above all the lead triangle Horst Buchholz as Freddy the leader of the pack barely 16yearold Karin Baal as Sissy a teenage femme fatale Don't mind her name she has absolutely nothing in common with the Romy Schneider character! and Christian Doermer as Freddy's ambivalent younger brother Jan. The rest of the gang are roughly characterized and do a great job as well. Paul Wagner and Viktoria von Ballasko as Freddy's and Jan's parents as well as Stanislaw Ledinek as the Italian running an icecream parlor also give great performances. The storyline is as follows  In an indoor swimming pool Jan meets his brother Freddy who had moved out after a quarrel with his father an embittered tyrant. Jan knows that his parents need 3000 Deutschmarks quite a lot in those days to pay their debts. Jan asks Freddy who pretends to have a good job if he could help them. Freddy says yes while preparing a mail car robbery that would not only allow him to help his parents but to fulfill his dream  buying a Buick Cabriolet. Jan who seems to smell something fishy nevertheless accompanies his brother... No spoilers but young Baal has a great scene as the bad girl. The film was shot on location in West Berlin and has nearly everything you are longing for  dark alleys petticoats leather jackets American cars dances sex and crime. The only thing missing is Rock 'n' Roll. The jukebox only plays conventional jazz music. But all in all this is of minor importance. In 1957 Die Halbstarken could be seen  in a dubbed version titled Teenage Wolfpack  in Britain and the US as well. After Die Halbstarken Tressler made many films and TV productions until the 1990s. Tremper continued as a screenwriter and director of nonconformist films. He passed away in 1998. While Buchholz became an international Star and died in 2003 Baal and Doermer have made their own careers in German Film and Television. They are still 2006 around and can frequently be seen on TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Halbstarken or The Hooligans is a German 90minute movie from 1956 so this one has its 60th anniversary this year. It scored a win for director and writer Georg Tressler at the German Film Awards and his two lead actors also received some nice attention with their nominations. Tressler was not as young anymore at this point as one may think judging from the award he won as he had already made a whole lot of short films before that but it was his feature film debut and for that it was really impressive. Also for lead actors Horst Buchholz and Karin Baal this film was easily among their most careerdefining performances. For almost the entire film we think Buchholz' is the main antagonist but at the very end we find out the truth something that was occasionally indicated throughout the movie. As for the reference in my review's title it is very much obvious how there are many parallels to the very successful Rebel Without a Cause. Buchholz is clearly channeling Dean and Brando as well in terms of his brute role here and the scenario with two young men one strong one rather weak and a woman who has a major impact on both their lives is obvious. But that's not a bad thing as the film still offers enough in terms of originality to be wort seeing in his own right. I also liked that it felt extremely realistic from start to finish despite being pretty showy on some occasions. The atmosphere is interesting and this can certainly seen as what wild new film looked like in Germany maybe even as an epitome when it comes to the 1950s. I recommend the watch. Thumbs up for one of the better works from what is generally considered not exactly a strong decade for German film.".

UFA and the other studios with Goebbels enthusiastic encouragement provided plenty of slick entertainment to take people's minds off such matters as rationing arrests deportations and mounting casualty lists.Die Grosse Liebe The Great Love was the most popular movie of the period and ranks as the key film in Nazi popular culture.  Quite simply it has everything that a German audience could have asked for in the summer of 1942.First and foremost it stars Zarah Leander an actress who combined many of the talents of Garbo and Dietrich.  Unknown in America then or now the Swedish Leander was the greatest star of the German cinema from the late 30s to well into the war years.  Here she plays a popular singer named Hanna Holberg who for all intents and purposes is Zarah Leander.Second Die Grosse Liebeoffers a stalwart German hero in Viktor Staal whose characterization of a Luftwaffe officer comes off as strong but nowhere near as steely or should I say Nazi? as Carl Raddatz's efforts in Stukas or Wunschkonzert.   Staal has a soft side that Raddatz never projected and he's certainly the better physical match for as imposing a figure as Leander.Third its tone manages to be earnest and serious without being melancholy. By the time the film was in production the invasion of Russia was underway and there could no longer be any illusions that the war would be short or easy.  The essential spirit of the film is sacrifices yes  but no regrets. Not coincidentally this is the lesson Leander's character must learn in the course of the story and that the audience must take to heart as well.Finally Leander sings two of her biggest hits which together present conflicting emotional responses to Germany's increasingly desperate situation  Davon geht die Welt nicht Unter and Ich weiss es wird einmal ein Wunder Gescheh'n.  The first freely translated as It Isn't the End of the World is cheery and upbeat.  As Leander sings her soldier audience literally swings and sways to the music and momentarily forgets the war. The second a prayer as much as an anthem could be translated as I Know One Day a Miracle Will Happen.  Here the clear message is one of hope that the war will soon be over but the mere expression of this urge serves to acknowledge that things aren't going all that well.As we know the miracle never happened for Nazi Germany and after only 12 years it came to the end of its own twisted world.  But to German audiences in 1942 there was still hope and Die Grosse Liebe was the cinematic expression of that heartfelt emotion.  No wonder the film was the greatest box office success of the Third Reich.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 12 years that were the 1000jhriges Reich the UFA produced four types of movies. First there were films like Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph des Willens which had the purpose of winning more and more social strata over to the ideas of fascism 'Fhrerprinzip' 'Volksgemeinschaft' 'Opferbereitschaft' etc.. Recruitment by means of  impressive visual iconography. Secondly the ministry of propaganda tried to prepare the Germans for the socalled 'Endlsung' by intensifying the existing antiSemitism to the most extreme degree with films like Veit Harlan's notorious Jud S. These films are the most vile and abhorrent but also the most clumsy and gross concoctions in filmhistory.In the last years of WWII the UFA put great effort in socalled 'Durchhaltefilme' most infamous example Harlan's Kolberg. With these Goebbels tried to force the warweary soldiers and civilians to hold out to the end and keep on fighting to the last bullet.However the most popular and successful UFAmovies during the third Reich did not belong to these three categories but were primarily made in order to entertain the audience and take it's mind off the war. The propaganda for the Nazicause in these films was much more subtle yet still evident in most cases. Die groe Liebe is a prime example for such an 'UFAUnterhaltungsfilm' because it was seen by 28 million viewers till the end of the war and thus still holds the record for any film in Germany as far as I know for comparison Titanic had 'only' 17 million viewers and that was considered a unique success. Nevertheless Die groe Liebe is almost forgotten today albeit every German still knows the two songs that Zarah Leander sings in this film Ich wei es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen and Davon geht die Welt nicht unter. The lyrics of these songs seem to be smarter than their author because they work both as 'Durchhaltelieder' as intended and as sarcastic commentaries on the last years of the 3rd Reich. As such they were used by directors like Fassbinder and Vilsmaier.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die groe Liebe or The Great Love is a German blackandwhite sound film that has its 75th anniversary this year and it is from the days of World War II and that makes it not too surprising that some pathos and militarywar references are included in here. But it is not really on a propaganda level despite the addition of Swedish lead actress Zarah Leander who is today known mostly for her connection to Nazi Germany. It runs for 100 minutes approximately and was directed by Rolf Hansen also one of the people who adapted the novel for the screen here and this may be his most known work at this point in time. The title already gives away that at the center of it all it is all about the love and the drama that comes with it when two people fall in love a pilot and a singer and their careers make it a pretty big challenge for them to get together but when they du sparks fly even if they argue. Sadly I must still say that neither of the performances except Leander to some extent made a really big impact on me. I would not say it is a particularly great film to watch with your significant other. You will find successful names from back then in the cast here like Preiss and Hrbiger for example but they did not have the material to really deliver sadly. So while it is a somewhat relevant film for its time and age I would not say it has aged very well. The one thing I do like about films from back then is that they almost never go for a 100 forced happy ending. Even if it may be somewhat happy with the two united at the end there is still a certain dark shadow hanging up there above them. Like literally here in fact even. Times were just too devastating back then to take that route. Finally the one thing really memorable here is probably the music. The Wundermiracle song is one that is still very wellknown in Germany to almost everybody born before 1990 I guess. All in all this film has its moments but as it did not deliver at all from the romanticemotionaltouching perspective for me I cannot give it a positive recommendation. My suggestion is that you watch something else instead.".

The Wundermiracle song is one that is still very wellknown in Germany to almost everybody born before 1990 I guess. All in all this film has its moments but as it did not deliver at all from the romanticemotionaltouching perspective for me I cannot give it a positive recommendation. My suggestion is that you watch something else instead.";

Through dealing with challenging situations e.g. he is appointed commander of Bernau talks to many disillusioned Germans and is once and again attacked by scattered groups of German soldiers he grows more confident that not all hope is lost for postwar Germany.

	schema:headline " East German war flick to put in your DVD collection right besides Untergang.";
	schema:reviewBody "War propaganda movie? Pullheeze. And what do you think Guns of Navarone Sands of Iwo Jima and SPR are? Of course for the popcornfed fan of Hollywood war flicks those are instead accurate realistic depictions of war so more credible than anything coming from beyond the former Iron Curtain. As for me let me put it this way if I was abducted by sadistic goons and given the choice of having to watch non stop SPR or IWN I'd choose IWN hands down. This is why.For a propaganda film IWN is pretty restrained. So much so even if we are here in the weeks of the final Red Army assault on Nazi Germany the moment of greatest military glory for the URSS you won't see a single Soviet flag. The only flag seen here is one made of bed covers to be used to identify a Command Post. And that in a movie 2 hrs. long longdid you see that Steven?. No triumphalism or braggadocio either. Nowhere you'll see here the gunho attitude of the soldier eager to kill enemies so present in so many Hollywood war flicks neither the blatant jingoism nor the spiteful treatment of the enemy. But in all fairness more than a war film this is one about things happening during a war as there are few combat scenes and those shown are mostly to remind us of the realities of war. But IWN isn't about Russians either but about a 19year old from Cologne Germany whose parents had to emigrate to the URSS when he was 8 because of Hitler and who comes back in 1945 with the victorious RA. So this is really about returning to your roots which in his case are German.It has been said many times that IWN is about memory but I disagree. To me it's mainly about identity national or cultural. Greg Hecker is now a Lt. in the Red Army and perhaps because of that he's picked as CO in Bernau. That takes the whole first chapter of the film where we see him grappling with his new obligations which include taking as POWs a few Germans who have already stopped fighting anyway and deals with two girlsGerman  Russianwhose lives have been destroyed by war thus giving occasion for the most emotionally charged scene in the film and one of the best dramatic scenes I have seen in a war flick. What makes the power of this scene as of most is the authenticity of the people playing the parts. They really live their roles this isn't just a job or a chore for themand that right from the lead down to every soldier farmer child parading in front of the camera. All that make for IWN one of the most gratifying movies you'll ever watch.IWN could be a bigger treat if you watch it back to back with Downfall. One amazing thingconsidering that it was made when East Germany was still a satellite of the URSS and that DF was shot in a free united Germanyis how much both resemble each other. You may even put them together in your mind and get a good global idea of what was going on while the RA was taking Berlin. They really complement each other the events of one fitting to perfection the other. See for ex. the rant of the Nazi boss in Spandau in the dark catacomb that has become his last refuge how eerily echoes that of Hitler to his generals and his end also he shoots himself when Spandau falls. And his previous chat with the tankdestroyer kid reproduces the medal giving ceremony in the Chancellery. And the kid himself could have been Peter Krantz had not been for him becoming a POW hours later. The German officers debating the Spandau surrender also mirror the discussions in the Berlin bunker at that time and the officer amongst them using the Russian truce bearers to conceal his own escape could have well been Fegelein. As for Russian raping  pillaging don't ask Germans to delve on that and they know well why.As said the acting is superb all across the board while understated at the same time. No Rambos here. There is for ex. one episode on the surrender of Spandau where Gregor and his pal succeed in an almost suicidal peace mission but this is treated with the utmost simplicity just a Thanks from the General. No medals nor patriotic speeches just Thanks.The pacing is fast from its beginning IWN takes an intense suspense filled rhythm and it never lets up. You never know what's gonna happen nexteven if you know already the end of the overall storyas the plot takes an episodic nature. At any given moment the action could take an unsuspected turn except during a brief lull for May Day celebrations.The cinematography is masterful despite the BW and the soundtrack hauntingly evocative. I could watch some scenes many times over the hanged soldier floating down the river Spandau and its catacomb like corridors. But most of all the scene where a truck leaves a girl and we see her disappearing from our field of vision as the vehicle takes a turn then she appears again barely visible in the morning haze then she disappears again. Simply genius. But what I loved most here is Greg being recognized by every German as one of their own and that bothering him a lot.Vastly ignored underrated classic. 8.510.".

In 1945 the son now a nineteen yearold lieutenant returns as a member of the Soviet army. Among the many things he experiences on his way to Berlin is a tour of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. There a demonstration of the workings of a gas chamber is performed. The film as a whole however suffers greatly from having been produced in East Germany. The protagonist's Jewish identity is never introduced. This seriously weakens the ambiguous impact of his return home. Also in general the Russian soldiers invading Berlin behaved badly. For example a hundred thousand rapes or more are said to have occurred. Yet the film presents not even a whiff of this. Indeed only one German girl is shown to be worried and she is reassured and sent upon her way. Meanwhile throughout all the movie Soviet personnel deport themselves in noble and gentlemanly ways.

My wife who was 11 in 1945 when this film takes place says that it was much worse then than the movie shows particularly with regard to the utter devastation starvation and behavior of the Russian soldiers. Few women between ages of 13 and 50 escaped being raped and most boys of her age and a bit older were taken away and never seen again. After reunification the mass graves of many of them killed by Russians have been found. Her father who was never a soldier or Nazi was shipped off to slave labor in Kazakhstan for about ten years. In the movie it is implied that the surrendering German soldiers were rewarded with extra food and then sent home. Get real. The intent of the movie made in the GDR at a time when they were barraged with propaganda trying to make them believe that Russians were their friends is obvious.Nevertheless I did enjoy watching it because even propaganda can be interesting for what it is. Example Triumph of the Will which is infinitely better than this movie. The events involving the surrender of Spandau prison to the 19 year old Russian commandant which may have been based on fact and the director's own experience were of particular interest and well dramatized.".

	schema:reviewBody "The main problem with Ich war 19 is that glosses over several essential realities. It seems like a Soviet propaganda movie trying to white wash the past. The invasion of Germany by Soviet troops in 19445 was nothing short of barbaric. 18 million people were driven from their ancestral lands  over 2 million civilians were brutally murdered. More than a million POW's were liquidated and another 2 million Ukrainians Poles and White Russians of German descent were also exterminated by the Soviets. The landscape was almost completely destroyed by allied bombing and soviet artillery. 80 of the buildings were destroyed. Women and boys were frequently raped on the spot. The boys were lucky  they were invariably bayoneted afterwards  but the women were passed to next comrade. Of course we can argue that this was justified because of the Holocaust and the German barbarism in Russia and Poland. But women and children? The film does not even suggest this was happening. It represents the war as a sort of part time activity in which a few unlucky people got killed. The buildings are all intact. The people all look well fed. The faces look completely undramatized. It doesn't bring home the reality of truth. 1945 was truly horrific for everyone between Berlin and Konigsberg KaliningradIt is an indelible scar on the memory of everyone old enough to remember it. This film does not convey that horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually wanted to give this film a 7 or 8 yet there are some terrible problems with the entire premise of it. The story comes from the memoirs of a former Soviet soldier whom the protagonist is based upon. Filmed in the German Democratic Republic East Germany it portrays a person with his background born German though raised in Russia as being somewhat unusual which it was and still is but nonetheless a good or noble person.In the 1930s the communist party was at it's zenith in popularity in the United States. In that day and age it was not uncommon to meet a communist in the United States who did not have an accent Jack Reed of Reds fame was not the only such person in the United States. This is understandable due to the horrific Great Depression. However Communists or Socialist Workers were still a minority party in our country. A few of them progressed from being members of a minority party to being total lunatics and actually migrated to the Soviet Union to live and work. During the Stalin purges of the late 1930s many of them were seen running to the U.S. embassy being chased by KGB agents and waving their by then useless passports trying to find asylum with their embassy of their former country. Usually they were gunned down before they reached the embassy. A movie dealing with similar emigrants to Russia after WWII is EastWest.Anyway the protagonist of this film is the son of similar wackos who lived in Germany prior to emigrating to the USSR. Most Germans at that time who fled the Third Reich such as Albert Einstein went to the west NOT to Russia. One really has to question the motivation of the author's parents and the burden they saddled him with having to live in a totalitarian regime for a long time afterwards. Anyway this kid essentially became a freak by being a Soviet citizen born in Germany. His parents were obvious wackos andor weirdos.Still I will have to admit that as bad as the Soviets were they palled in comparison with the Third Reich. That unfortunately is the truth. And it shows just how terrible that regime was. Interesting film showing the conflict of a pretty bad system USSR with an utterly terrible one war time Germany. The film shows as other reviewers have noted the hope for a reconciliation between post war Germany and Russia. Fair enough except the reconciliation was to include a socialist German ALL of Germany not just East Germany. Fortunately like the battle of Spandau Fortress in the film that never happened.".

There were so so many films that elaborated on the subject of World War II also from the German perspective and here we have one of the most known approaches from the Eastern Side of the Wall. Also it has lots of autobiographical impact in terms of Wolf's early years. All this is a good basis for an interesting and convincing film but sadly I must say the overall outcome did not impress me at all. It is tough to say what the major problem is but I just felt that it was never interesting in terms of the characters story or historic context. Lead actor Jaecki Schwarz is also a bit known today because of the work he did later in his career and he is still pretty active especially in German television. Unfortunately his performance here is nothing that got me really curious about his other works. This film is slowly dripping forward in its massive slightly under two hours but there were no moments at all where I was really impressed or which I would call memorable. I give it a thumbsdown.

At a constantly high quality he manages to tell his detective stories drawing a bleak portrait of a hypocritical and morally rotten Austrian middle class with the cynical humour typical for that nation.As with all Wolf Haas film adaptations so far the acting in this one is first rate. Especially Josef Hader pulls off an even better version of the likable but chronically downtrodden detective Brenner. However also some side characters such as the Lschenkohl impress with their performance.As for the film itself it unfortunately has a few deadbeat moments and some dialogues that move too slowly and are on the fringe of getting boring. Some scenes might also be considered as being more violent than necessary. Certain characters such as the Russian mobsters are too stereotypical to be really enjoyable.However the movie also features great dark humour throughout and finishes off with a furious and really enjoyable ending. Overall I'd highly recommended it if you are into cynical society satire.".

Overall an excellent movie but if you watch it as a foreign speaker with subtitles only you miss out the subtile humor in the dialogs which probably then results in some weird subtitles like constant yes and nos which probably resmble the local Austrian dialect word Eh which is not quite the same and if applied in the correct situations and Haders down to the bottom intonation quite humorous. This is probably one of those many things which are lost in the translation. As for the main actor Josef Hader he is actually a comedian and one in the dark austrian humor tradition which is close to the English humor. He has done a handful of movies and all of them are worth watching. This movie is the third of a series of criminal movies. The first one being komm ssser tod  come sweet death and the second one being silentium. The first one is the one which could be considered to be the most humorous of the three while the secod one being the one with the least humor.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Knochenmann or The Bone Man is the third entry to the crime franchise starring Austrian actor Josef Hader. The director is Wolfgang Murnberger as always and the script comes from Wolf Haas also as always. The first film came out back in 2000 the latest installment was released last year. But back to this one here. I truly enjoyed the watch and this film was just like all crime thrillers should be. First of all there is lots of subtle comedy in here from start to finish which helps a lot in the movie not taking itself so serious. The title refers not to Hader's Brenner but to the main antagonist played by Josef Bierbichler. Bierbichler is a complete scene stealer here and in my opinion he felt as much of a lead as Hader. Both are excellent actors of course and carry this film nicely even if they do not really have that many scenes together. Bierbichler plays a butcher and restaurant owner who gets in trouble with some scary guys but finds his very own way of dealing with the issue. A touch of Delicatessen. Enough said.One perfect example of how this film combines comedy with thriller is when he goes off to get his chopper or cleaver in the end and Brenner says something like No point in going away. as he obviously has no clue yet what Lschenkohl Bierbichler has on his mind. The script oozes creativity in the most absurd way also with the way we find out in the end what happened to Horvath. I also really loved the contrast between the scenes that were shown at the same time the wild party with loud music and everything that was going on at the slaughter room. It's a bloody film and there are some scenes that some may find disturbing but I found it just harrowing in the most positive sense. One example would be the camera looking inside the car when we hear Lschenkohl approach with his car pushing the car wreck into the water. Great directorial effort there.I have seen the first 3 films including this one a while ago already but the fact how much I enjoyed this movie here and its characters and its story and its comedy motivates me a lot to give them a new watch and also watch the newest installment. I can only say that I wish more crime films were like this. Austrians sure have their very own approach to the subject and it's a wonderful one. Little downside you may need subtitles even as a German as the accent is sometimes so thick that it's almost impossible to understand the dialogs. However if you let this keep you away from watching the film it is definitely your loss. 2 hours of great crime entertainment. Certainly grew on me upon rewatch highly recommended.".

Because he was unhappy with the way football is taught to children in the Fyouth of professional clubs the director Joachim Massanek founded and coached a little league football team for his sons and the children of some of his friends also called Die wilden Kerle and later wrote successful children's books about their adventures.

	schema:headline " Everything is fine as long as you are wild";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the title of this first film. However nothing is fine with this movie. The script is ridiculous the lead actor is horrible and his brother in the supporting cast has even less talent if that is even possible. Also it's disgusting how the film's director and writer Joachim Masannek cast so many of his own kids for this one. He also worked with Heiner Lauterbach's daughter later in his career and this film here also has the son of one of Germany's most famous boxers. And the worst thing is that they made four more films in the years after this. But why not if the German Film Academy nominated this piece of crap for Best Children's movie of the Year. At least it did not win. The Ochsenknecht brothers would never have a career without their famous dad. There are many great kids movies these days but this one here from over 10 years ago has to be one of the worst. Unbesiegbare Sieger is already a very cringeworthy name for the enemy team and their face painting just took embarrassing to new heights in the end.Possibly the weakest aspect is the music. The songs from the Bananafishbones are disastrous and yet they made new songs for all of the next four movies too. Rufus Beck and Cornelia Froboess are probably the most famous actors from the cast besides Father Ochsenknecht. They did well in not returning for any of the next films. This is not a funny movie. this is not a good drama movie. Not even a mediocre one and it gets worse the longer it goes. It's a story about tolerance towards girls towards weaker football players about teamwork but none of it is convincingly written. The first 3045 minutes were probably still a 410. All these superlative references best trainer wildest team greatest players world class solo wildest girl on the planet... are fairly ridiculous. It seems as if this movie aspires to be so much and yet came up with so little due to lack of talent in the entire castcrew. The kids actors mostly suck and it is not surprising that almost none of them still have a career. Sadly most of the adults aren't much better. And the ending is exactly what you could expect. No surprise no wit. A disgrace of a film. The only wild thing about it is how wildly chaotic and unrealistic it is. Stay away.".

Also it's disgusting how the film's director and writer Joachim Masannek cast so many of his own kids for this one. He also worked with Heiner Lauterbach's daughter later in his career and this film here also has the son of one of Germany's most famous boxers. And the worst thing is that they made four more films in the years after this. But why not if the German Film Academy nominated this piece of crap for Best Children's movie of the Year. At least it did not win. The Ochsenknecht brothers would never have a career without their famous dad. There are many great kids movies these days but this one here from over 10 years ago has to be one of the worst. Unbesiegbare Sieger is already a very cringeworthy name for the enemy team and their face painting just took embarrassing to new heights in the end.Possibly the weakest aspect is the music. The songs from the Bananafishbones are disastrous and yet they made new songs for all of the next four movies too. Rufus Beck and Cornelia Froboess are probably the most famous actors from the cast besides Father Ochsenknecht. They did well in not returning for any of the next films. This is not a funny movie. this is not a good drama movie. Not even a mediocre one and it gets worse the longer it goes. It's a story about tolerance towards girls towards weaker football players about teamwork but none of it is convincingly written. The first 3045 minutes were probably still a 410. All these superlative references best trainer wildest team greatest players world class solo wildest girl on the planet... are fairly ridiculous. It seems as if this movie aspires to be so much and yet came up with so little due to lack of talent in the entire castcrew. The kids actors mostly suck and it is not surprising that almost none of them still have a career. Sadly most of the adults aren't much better. And the ending is exactly what you could expect. No surprise no wit. A disgrace of a film. The only wild thing about it is how wildly chaotic and unrealistic it is. Stay away.";

The story is about a bunch of kids who love playing soccer nothing wrong with that. After a school break they discover that some hooligans have taken over their favourite soccerfield. How do they get it back? And more importantly why should we really care? Die Wilde Kerle is a movie about teamwork and respect. Both good things to make a movie about. But why put it in a form like this one? There is actually one funny scene in which the bad guys attack Camelot a tree house that also functions as a fall out base for Die Wilde Kerle. But sadly that was actually the only thing worth mentioning. All in all Die Wilde Kerle is great for kids but I advise parents to either avoid it on TV or burn the DVD's when you have the chance!".

But the cinematography and the acting were both excellent and completely made up for the fact that I understood at most 10 of the spoken language. It only proves that picture is worth a thousand words. And since a 96 minute movie contains more than eight million pictures...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It made me feel young again.

No time for adequate farewells.And the years slip by without any news. Has he forsaken her?

And just as the Olympic torch ignited the flame in Berlin so this request ignites again the feeling of hope in our young Inge. There must have been a reason for his silence. The road to reunion is not an easy one however and both circumstance and misunderstandings conspire to keep them apart until the very happy end.Interwoven with this light melodrama is some rousingly patriotic newsreel footage of both the Olympic opening ceremony and the Condor Legion in action but there is also a second important theme the significance of the actual Wunschkonzert performances themselves as necessary morale boosters for both the serving troops and their families at home. Goebbels understood this perfectly and apparently provided the inspiration for director Eduard von Borsody.There are moments of comedy as we follow the escapades of two enlisted men who were also a noted comedy due of the period bringing a captured pig to Berlin and great pathos as a mother sitting alone at home listens to the powerfully moving voice of Wilhelm Streinz singing Gute Nacht Mutter. Her young son had recently saved his unit but in the process had sacrificed his own life.For me it was worth the price of admission simply to see not only the stunningly beautiful Ilse Werner but also the actual musicians and performers who had hitherto been merely voices.The movie and associated music CDs are highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy totalitarian entertainment as much as the next man which maybe is why I was so let down by this movie recently shown at the 16th International Film Historical Congress in Berlin.  I expected singing dancing and good cheer.  But it was straight propaganda instead.  Ilse Werner meets craggy Aryan Carl Raddatz when he gives her tickets to see the opening of the '36 Olympics in particular Hitler and the crowd of 500000 Hitlersaluting.  They fall in love that weekend but then Carl is ordered to go to Spain on a secret mission for the Luftwaffe.  After we presume bombing Spanish peasants he comes back three years later and wants to find Ilse but the new war gets him distracted flying missions locating British shipping for UBoots to sink.  This means a lot of really loud heelclicking and outlandishly fascistic uniforms Carl has the usual eagleandswastika badge then a gold Nazi eagle pin on his breast pocket and a little ceremonial sword hung from his hip.  Nearly all of the comic relief is military e.g. a fat butcher in the Wehrmacht who steals French pigs Luftwaffe mechanics with thick Berlin accents.  And every third shot is framed to include a a Nazi eagle andor swastika b a framed photo of Hitler or c a poster shouting Watch out for spies!  Be careful in conversations!Despite the hurried appearance of bigname stars there's almost no music in this picture and a lot of that isn't hit songs but Nazi children's choirs in regional dress blond and muscular UBoot sailors singing mournfully to an accordion and rousing march music played alongside documentary footage of aerial bombardment.

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoy totalitarian entertainment as much as the next man which maybe is why I was so let down by this movie recently shown at the 16th International Film Historical Congress in Berlin.  I expected singing dancing and good cheer.  But it was straight propaganda instead.  Ilse Werner meets craggy Aryan Carl Raddatz when he gives her tickets to see the opening of the '36 Olympics in particular Hitler and the crowd of 500000 Hitlersaluting.  They fall in love that weekend but then Carl is ordered to go to Spain on a secret mission for the Luftwaffe.  After we presume bombing Spanish peasants he comes back three years later and wants to find Ilse but the new war gets him distracted flying missions locating British shipping for UBoots to sink.  This means a lot of really loud heelclicking and outlandishly fascistic uniforms Carl has the usual eagleandswastika badge then a gold Nazi eagle pin on his breast pocket and a little ceremonial sword hung from his hip.  Nearly all of the comic relief is military e.g. a fat butcher in the Wehrmacht who steals French pigs Luftwaffe mechanics with thick Berlin accents.  And every third shot is framed to include a a Nazi eagle andor swastika b a framed photo of Hitler or c a poster shouting Watch out for spies!  Be careful in conversations!Despite the hurried appearance of bigname stars there's almost no music in this picture and a lot of that isn't hit songs but Nazi children's choirs in regional dress blond and muscular UBoot sailors singing mournfully to an accordion and rousing march music played alongside documentary footage of aerial bombardment.

	schema:headline " The best of all Frankenstein films!";
	schema:reviewBody "Their are few sequels that are superior to their predecessors however Bride of Frankenstein not only equals it's masterful original prototype Frankenstein 1931 but infinitely surpasses it in every way. Despite the first films reputation as a classic it's honestly not quite as witty and is much too straightforward when being compared to much more satirical Bride of Frankenstein. Not to mention it lacks much of the sophistication in the effects and eccentricities that the immortal sequel possesses. Needless to say both films are justly hailed as classics but it's the immortal sequel where James Whale's combining of horror and wicked humour and hidden inflammatory work is expressed more clearly and more prominently.After initially refusing to do a sequel to Frankenstein director James Whale would eventually falter when Universal agreed to let him have complete artistic freedom. Production was muchpublicised as early as 1933 however Whale who was following his towering success with Frankenstein The Invisible Man and The Old Dark House wouldn't begin working on a sequel until late 1934 which was originally entitled The Return of Frankenstein. The film was adapted by William Hurlbut and John Balderston from an incident from the Mary Shelly novel Frankenstein in which the monster demands a mate. However in the novel Dr. Frankenstein creates the Bride but instead of bringing the monster to life he decides to destroy it greatly differing the film adaptation from the novel.Most of the original cast remained as the film reunited Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein with Boris Karloff as the Monster but Mae Clarke a blonde who was dropped from Universal was replaced by then seventeen year old Valerie Hobson a brunette as Elizabeth. Clark was acceptable in the role as Elizabeth in the first film however Hobson excels when in comes to chewing up scenery therefore handles the role much better in the sequel. Both Marilyn Harris Little Maria from Frankenstein and Dwight Frye Fritz from Frankenstein would return as well but as different characters  Harris appearing uncredited and Frye appearing in another memorable role as Karl. Also new characters were brought to the forefront Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius with Una O'Connor as Minnie and Elsa Lanchester having a dual role as both Mary Shelley and The Bride.Unfortunately Clive had suffered from a broken leg during most of the filming  a result from a horseback riding accident  and most of his scenes were shot sitting or laying down. However once again Clive did an absolutely incredible job portraying Dr. Henry Frankenstein and proved to be a perfect choice yet again. Though for much of the film he takes a backseat to the fine and unique acting of Thesiger who gives an unforgettable performance as the mad scientist named Dr. Septimus Pretorius who much of the film revolves around. There is a sexual uncertainty to Pretorius' character and many suggestions of homosexuality. With the films masterful blend of horror and black comedy it's Thesiger who shines best and in many ways the film is stolen by him when he's seen on screen the equally charismatic O'Connor works best when playing directly opposite of Thesiger.Bride of Frankenstein is also presented with the same terrific German expressionist camerawork by cinematographer John J. Mescall although reportedly drunk through much of the production uses brilliantly effective camera movements and angles that added eminently to the creation of the Bride scene. Mescall also composed a number of bizarre and inventive angles that intensified Thesiger's skeletonlike frame and vivid characteristics aiding his already superb performance. Although for Karloff the four hour makeup job done by Jack P. Pierce which was bluegreen in colour gave Mescall nothing but problems. The film is also accompanied by a fascinating score composed by Franz Waxman which is nothing less than a masterpiece of excitement and melody. Though it wouldn't be Waxman's most mature work it most certainly remains one of his most famous and probably his most influential.Much of the film concerns itself mostly with the Monster Karloff trying to find a place in the world and his growth much of his character is seen as a humanely being craving for the company and acceptance of others but is mostly rejected. He fails to seek friendship with the young shepherdess Ann Darling with the Monsters experience in the first film with Little Maria he knows that he must save her from drowning. Of course everyone finds him too frightening however in one of the many incredible scenes the film provides the Monster is eventually provided with sympathy and encouragement when he encounters the old blind hermit O.P. Heggie who becomes the Monsters first true friend. Karloff's performance is truly remarkable as it was in Frankenstein. Although he opposed that the Monster speak his character benefits greatly from this as he finds room to expand on his already brilliant craft.The memorable sequence of bringing the Monster's Bride Lanchester to life is unequaled  even the original scene in Frankenstein pales in comparison. The presentation of the birth of the Bride is stunningly as well as Clive exclaims She's alive! ALIVE! Lanchester who only stood 5'4 tall was placed on stilts that made her 7'0 tall as well as her unforgettable shock hairstyle which stood up and hinted that the electricity had shocked her to life was held by a wired horsehair cage. Also her darting swanlike movements were inspired by the angry swans in London's Regent Park. Although the Bride's appearance is extremely brief it's most certainly worth it especially when she finally encounters the Monsters.The macabre satirical Bride of Frankenstein is a key film to the horror genre perhaps the best and one of the genuinely great films of any genre. It's one of the most wonderfully crafted films in cinema history and is easily lauded as Whale's finest screen hour. This one has rightfully deserved it's ranking amongst the best of what Hollywood has to offer.".

	schema:headline " One of the all time classics from the silver screen";
	schema:reviewBody "This review also refers to FRANKENSTEIN 1931.The epitome of the Universal horror classics made by one the greatest practitioners of the genre James Whale. He always wanted to be an Alist director and used to have mixed feelings about his horror work. Reluctant to make a sequel he managed to assure himself of complete creative control over the project putting together a unique blend of horror suspense and tongueincheek comedy that was quite unlike anything made before and has rarely been equaled ever since.It has been noted but the original 1931 FRANKENSTEIN should be seen first as this one picks up the storyline where FRANKENSTEIN left off. Considering the combined running time of about 140 min both films can easily be watched back to back.The story sets off with a clever prologue between Mary Shelly a short but great performance by Elsa Lanchester who also plays The Bride and Lord Byron who asks her to continue the tale of Dr. Frankenstein. Still recovering in his castle after the escape of the Monster he is visited by the even more insane Dr. Pretorius Ernest Thesinger. He is also experimenting with creating life the miniature humans and tries to persuade Frankenstein to join forces in order to create a female companion for the Monster Boris Karloff that is still at large wreaking havoc in the surrounding countryside.Although both films are justly hailed as classics in my opinion BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN holds up much better to modern audiences than the original. Basically two things stand out a great music score is added which make everything seem much more alive and fast moving than in the original film. Secondly the black humor and it's sense of selfparody spoofing the genre and even underpinning Whale's earlier films greatly adds to the fun compared to the much more basic and primitive FRANKENSTEIN. Admittedly this is partly due to a larger budget but combined with the fabulous production values splendid sets stunning photography and absolutely striking special effects that still look pretty amazing even by today's standards. I was stunned by the scene in which Dr. Pretorius shows off his miniature people that he keeps in the glass jars. Even modernday special effects specialists couldn't figure out how they did it. I don't know anything that comes even close until computergenerated effects took over.The eccentric Ernest Thesinger plays the role of his life and almost walks away with the film with his wonderful portrayal of the menacing Dr. Pretorius who delivers one classic line after another. But the rest of the cast is just as good with particularly outstanding roles for  off course  Boris Karloff as the Monster Elsa Lanchester in a dual role as The Bride billed as ? and Mary Shelley and Una O'Connor as Minnie Frankenstein's servant. I think it's one the very few films that can be enjoyed at almost any level equally fun for older children and lovers of classic horror. This film proves that horror can be funny and intelligent and can be combined with splendid cinematic virtues. Not just Whale's best this is one of the alltime great films.Camera Obscura  1010".

Basically two things stand out a great music score is added which make everything seem much more alive and fast moving than in the original film. Secondly the black humor and it's sense of selfparody spoofing the genre and even underpinning Whale's earlier films greatly adds to the fun compared to the much more basic and primitive FRANKENSTEIN. Admittedly this is partly due to a larger budget but combined with the fabulous production values splendid sets stunning photography and absolutely striking special effects that still look pretty amazing even by today's standards. I was stunned by the scene in which Dr. Pretorius shows off his miniature people that he keeps in the glass jars. Even modernday special effects specialists couldn't figure out how they did it. I don't know anything that comes even close until computergenerated effects took over.The eccentric Ernest Thesinger plays the role of his life and almost walks away with the film with his wonderful portrayal of the menacing Dr. Pretorius who delivers one classic line after another. But the rest of the cast is just as good with particularly outstanding roles for  off course  Boris Karloff as the Monster Elsa Lanchester in a dual role as The Bride billed as ? and Mary Shelley and Una O'Connor as Minnie Frankenstein's servant. I think it's one the very few films that can be enjoyed at almost any level equally fun for older children and lovers of classic horror. This film proves that horror can be funny and intelligent and can be combined with splendid cinematic virtues. Not just Whale's best this is one of the alltime great films.Camera Obscura  1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Forget the likes of The Godfather II and The Empire Strikes Back  Bride of Frankenstein is THE greatest example of a sequel completely surpassing the original in terms of sheer brilliance. Coming four years after the original 'Frankenstein' in 1931 director James Whale was originally reluctant to make a sequel but changed his mind after being allowed to make the film more on his own terms. No other director has ever managed to blend horror comedy and pathos as successfully Whale. The film features some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history notably the monster's encounter with a lonely hermit and the introduction of 'The Bride'. The film has it all superb casting tremendous sets and make up memorable dialogue To a new world of Gods and monsters and a brilliant score by Franz Waxman. Boris Karloff must surely be one of the greatest actors to ever appear on film. He manages to improve on his initial characterisation of the Monster due mainly to the addition of dialogue Friends good! and unlike in the first movie actually makes us feel total empathy for the Monster. Colin Clive returns as the reluctant Doctor F Una O'Connor makes a wonderful addition as the twittering and hysterical Minnie but it is Ernest Thesiger who steals the film with his hilarious performance Have a cigar. They are my only weakness as the sinister Dr. Pretorious. Although Elsa Lanchester appears as the Bride for only about 2 minutes at the film's finale it will be the role for which she is forever associated. The film is regarded as the high point of the Universal horror series and stands as a testament to the genius of James Whale.".

Although Karloff portrayed the monster only 3 times this was undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career and the film that most fans will remember him for. Mention should also be made of the excellent performance given by Ernest Thesiger as Doctor Pretorious.

	schema:reviewBody "When Ernest Thesiger points and says The bride of Frankenstein rolling his r's he creates one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. I do consider the second film superior to the first though I love them both because of the complexity of the characters and more specifically the monster. In Shelley's book the monster is lonely but articulate. He seeks out a bride. Frankenstein creates one but then destroys her making his creature furious and vengeful. This monster actually has a kind part to him. For him to be blunt force thug can only go so far. It works in the first film but how much more growling and stomping could there be? The scenes of him wandering in the countryside meeting the lonely old blind man in the house in the woods and being shown kindness by him is very touching. The monster is allowed some humanity some privacy. We know this can't last because his creator has doomed him. We often see Victor as some kind of hero but in reality he has committed an incredible sin against another being. He wants a companion but she turns on him and destroys his hope.The setup with Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley talking with the foremost romantic poets of the time Percy Shelley and Lord Byron who also rolls his r's is a great lead in as she brags about writing a story that will make your skin crawl. She must have been something in that male dominated society. Of course her mother was one of the first to demand rights for women. When she reappears as the Bride it is awesome. And who came up with the hair. It is one of those things like the monster's neck bolts that has become such an icon for our culture. These early Universal films deserve to be judged as major movies. Just because the subject is horror doesn't mean they should be dismissed. James Whale was a great director with an amazing vision.".

The beautiful Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clarke as Elizabeth a smart move! and the eagle eyed with spot future stars John Carradine and Walter Brennan in bit parts but the best thing about the movie apart from Karloff is the addition of Elsa Lanchester as The Monster's bride and the wonderfully eccentric Ernest Thesiger as the nutty and sinister Dr. Pretorious. Karloff Thesiger and Lanchester between them are responsible for some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history particularly the I...love....dead....Hate....living exchange the sequence with the blind hermit absolutely heartbreaking! and of course the totally unforgettable meeting between The Monster and his mate!

The bride of Frankenstein can easily be considered as the best horror movie ever made and it even ranks high it the list of best movies in general ever made.

He realizes he scares everybody away and only found friendship with a blind man. During this absolutely beautiful and magical scene he learns to talk and express his emotions. When he's hunted down again he meets Dr. Pretorius and demands him to make him a friend. Because of this Dr. Pretorius can force Frankenstein to create life again. If he doesn't Elizabeth shall die... This movie gives a completely other meaning to the word sequel. When this word is heard people usually think about an inferior product which was made to make more money. This certainly isn't the case for The Bride of Frankenstein. Hard to believe but this movie in fact ADDS a lot of great things to the saga of Frankenstein. It handles even more about the human emotions and contains some very important lessons. We also see a lot more about the personalities of the characters. The Monster of course but also Dr. Frankenstein and his girl. And a few great new characters are introduced. The blind man to begin with...An adorable man who is as lonely as the creature. He doesn't judge on what he sees  well he can't of course  and searches for deeper feelings. The character of Dr. Pretorius is fantastic also. A wicked and obsessed man who doesn't care about normal life. He's rude and emotionless and terrific as the bad guy in the story.The story opens with Mary Shelley telling the complete story. This immediately sets the perfect atmosphere which is held during the whole movie. No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet do whatever it takes to get a copy !!! I gave the original Frankenstein a rating 10 out of 10 so I guess there isn't a rating that is high enough to praise The Bride of Frankenstein. Just as good as cinema can get !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Series note Although not imperative it is strongly suggested that viewers take time to watch Frankenstein prior to Bride of Frankenstein. This is a linear continuation of the story of the first film and the characters and motivations will have more meaning if you watch the series in order.Despite appearances to the contrary at the end of the first film Frankenstein 1931 the monster has survived. The quickly recuperating Dr. Henry Frankenstein Colin Clive is paid a visit by Dr. Pretorius Ernest Thesiger who has been engaging in similar research into the creation and restoration of life. Although Frankenstein wants to quit the business after the atrocities documented in the first film Pretorius tries to persuade him to continue while at the same time the monster starts to become more sophisticated.Although many fans prefer Bride of Frankenstein to Frankenstein they are both 10s to me. Given tastes and typical comments about modern horror films it is surprising that this film is the usual preference as it is even more rooted in surrealistabsurdist fantasy and it is loaded with a wicked campy humorat times the film is more of a spoof of the first than a sequel.But at that I love it. I love fantasy surrealism and absurdism and I like my horror to be campy and humorous as much as I like it to be serious. Director James Whale had acquired more Hollywood clout in the four years since making the original film and said that he wanted to treat Bride as a hoothe found the premise to be highly amusing. And that it is.

The cinematography is as crisp as can be and just as atmospheric occasionally more so as the first film. The presence of a score this time around works well although the first film is just as notable for its ability to be just as dramatic without a score.The story in Bride of Frankenstein is much more sprawling and epic than in the first film. That fact neither makes it better or worse but pleasantly different compared to Frankenstein's relatively tight almost claustrophobic plot which is appropriate for the subject matter. While Karloff's zombielike muteness from Frankenstein was perfect in that context it makes sense to have him mature here and provides for some fantastic scenes such as his interaction with the blind hermit O.P. Heggie. Whale also chose to be much more literal and straightforward with the ethical and religious subtexts of the plot and this film is notable for the large amount of verbal and visual references to God and Christianitythe visual references include the monster being hoisted on a pole as if being crucified the monster descending into a grave with a crucifix looming over him and a crucifix over a bed upon which the camera lingers.I actually prefer to think of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein as two halves or a single film and given their short running times they can be viewed back to back in about two and a half hours. If you haven't seen either one yet you owe it to yourself to watch them at least once.".

	onyx:emotionText "Series note Although not imperative it is strongly suggested that viewers take time to watch Frankenstein prior to Bride of Frankenstein. This is a linear continuation of the story of the first film and the characters and motivations will have more meaning if you watch the series in order.Despite appearances to the contrary at the end of the first film Frankenstein 1931 the monster has survived. The quickly recuperating Dr. Henry Frankenstein Colin Clive is paid a visit by Dr. Pretorius Ernest Thesiger who has been engaging in similar research into the creation and restoration of life. Although Frankenstein wants to quit the business after the atrocities documented in the first film Pretorius tries to persuade him to continue while at the same time the monster starts to become more sophisticated.Although many fans prefer Bride of Frankenstein to Frankenstein they are both 10s to me. Given tastes and typical comments about modern horror films it is surprising that this film is the usual preference as it is even more rooted in surrealistabsurdist fantasy and it is loaded with a wicked campy humorat times the film is more of a spoof of the first than a sequel.But at that I love it. I love fantasy surrealism and absurdism and I like my horror to be campy and humorous as much as I like it to be serious. Director James Whale had acquired more Hollywood clout in the four years since making the original film and said that he wanted to treat Bride as a hoothe found the premise to be highly amusing. And that it is. Whale gives us whimsical elements from minor characters such as Minnie Una O'Connor who provides a healthy dose of comic relief during the monster's resurrection to major characters' mannerisms such as the Karloff's portrayal of the monster's newfound abilities and subtlety.

Heggie. On the surface the sequence would seem to be about how cruelly we judge people by appearances and how true kindness can lift the fallen. It was not until I had seen the film several times that it dawned upon me that Whale has essentially endowed the a scene with a host of covertly homosexual overtonesand then tied them to a series of Christian elements for good measure.

In BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN comic relief featuring the usually marvelous Una O'Connor and E.E. Clive is much too broad and the monster's meeting with the blind hermit is maudlin. Mel Brooks did not have to add too much to get laughs from scenes that were already unintentionally funny.Also a giant continuity gap opens when Elizabeth Dr. Frankenstein's actual bride who was being held captive in a cave suddenly and with no explanation appears at the door of the laboratory pleading for Dr. Frankenstein to escape with her. In John L. Balderston's original treatment they all die. And a sub plot about murders committed by Dr. Pretorius' assistant Karl played by Dwight Frye who bears some resemblance to M star Peter Lorre was edited out of the original release along with a scene showing the body of a child being carried away. These were changes the studio demanded because of negative public reaction during previews and they point to a much darker story.Whale may not have wanted to make another monster movie but when he began work he did try to deal seriously with themes he explored in FRANKENSTEIN. Only after Whale's homosexuality became the subject of legend did critics motivated by cultural politics reinterpret the film as a dark comedy of sexual identity.Having said that I do think Ernest Thesiger's Doctor Pretorius is deliciously wicked. But his character is not obviously homosexual and I can only surmise that such a reading is a retrospective interpretation based on Thesiger's openly Gay lifestyle. Pretorius' character seems to have been suggested by the villainous alchemist Oliver Haddo in Somerset Maugham's THE MAGICIAN a book that was filmed by Rex Ingram in 1926 starring Paul Wegener of THE GOLEM.Whale may have seen Ingram's film. He may have read the book. The thing that made the best directors of the '20s '30s '40s and '50s better than the best directors of today is they created the art of cinematic storytelling by reading literature not by viewing film. Details from Maugham's novel  Haddo's celibacy and his obsession with creating homunculi little people  are elements of Dr. Pretorius' character that could only have come from the literary source because Ingram never used them in his film.Negative comments aside the film is a masterpiece of art direction Whale's and Charles D. Hall's cinematography John J. Mescall's and music Franz Waxman's. And there is the brilliantly edited set piece of the bride's creation and Elsa Lanchester's performance as the bride that bookends the story with the wonderful prologue where she plays FRANKENSTEIN author Mary Shelley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bride of Frankenstein is definitely one of the more memorable sequels of all time. The first Frankenstein film was a truly memorable exploration of horror and was extremely advanced for its time dealing with issues of modernity when the doctor starts talking of space travel and also pushing censorship to levels it hadn't been pushed to before having characters exclaim they 'knew what God felt like' and also including images of dead bodies and murder. With Bride of Frankenstein certain elements of surprise have been lost but the film delves deeper into its characters and explores different things to make it more of an 'entertaining' film.The film doesn't hang around and cleverly introduces the story through the original author Mary Shelley Elsa Lanchester dictating what it is that happens next. For a film in 1935 to use such a technique and manage to include elements of heartbreak when we assume Dr. Frankenstein is dead horror when The Monster reemerges AND murder when someone mistakenly crosses him all in the first ten minutes or so is extremely impressive and is only the result of fantastic direction through great inventive ideas.Then the film uses the character of The Monster as a sort of MacGuffin. It is reduced to a wondering babbling hulking thing getting into mischief as it makes its way through the forests nearby but this isn't a bad thing. What we see is the first example of the characters in this so far series of two films develop. The Monster starts to develop emotions of pity when it sees someone in the forest in trouble and attempts to rescue them as well as intelligence because it manages to get itself out of trouble when danger threatens it  there is no excuse for this development of ideas and intelligence but it's interesting to see anyway.What's more this wondering and random character is a great excuse for it to cause havoc andor get into adventures of its own and this it does to a basic level. Apart from stumbling across a picnic of some description when everyone assumes its safe since when last they heard he'd been captured The Monster gets involved with a seemingly lonely man who lives in a log cabin in the woods. The curse here to me is that I'd seen Kenneth Branagh's 1994 Frankenstein before this so I knew what was up and how things would develop.As a result it was predictable to me but to fresh eyes what follows between The Monster and this man is an education and a friendship that truly supports evidence that this film really is all about developing characters such as The Monster further away from the 'dead' tag and closer to the 'human' tag. Not only this but Dr. Frankenstein himself is leaning more and more towards a 'normal' life away from insane experiments tempted back only by blackmail. About half way through Frankenstein's creation manages to get himself into a bit of trouble and is caught but escapes so soon afterwards the sequence passes off without too much suspense or interest which was disappointing also the character of Minnie is so obviously an attempt at comic relief that she becomes annoying quite quickly although I suppose they had to include this character to stop the film appearing too dark.If Frankenstein from 1931 was an out and out horror shockfest for the time Bride of Frankenstein remains a character piece full of 'what would happen if.....' a mindless homicidal lab creation was loose in rural Europe. Some of the later scenes still made me squirm a little when the 'mate' is being created and if you can look past the rushed ending you'll see a sequel to a film miles ahead of its time ahead of its time.".

	schema:headline " Impressive Though Over Analyzed Horror Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "One problem with film criticism is to over analysis a film and read things in to its subtext which just aren't there . THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a very good example of this . Once someone points out the fact that director James Whale was a homosexual it opens the floodgates for people reading the film in a way no one originally envisaged . We're shown an opening scene where Lord Byron describes himself as  England's greatest sinner  and as the film progresses we're introduced to nods and winks to a sin of that dare not be explicitly referred to . Instead we see Doctor Pretoruis  a sort of precursor to Quintan Crisp who is described as  queer looking  drinks gin  makes a queen and suggests that he becomes a partner of Baron Frankenstein . Oh purleese . Do you honestly think Whale made this film as a type of gay manifesto ? I'll say one thing about movie directors and that is they have kept a lot of pretentious pseudo intellectuals in a job As a form of entertainment  Yes films are produced as a form of entertainment and to make money for studio investments  THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is very impressive . There is an irony showing the character of Mary Shelley because our thoughts of FRANKENSTEIN owe more to James Whale and Universal studios than they do to Shelley . I doubt if very many people have read the original text but we're all aware of the image of Boris Karloff staggering around a studio interior forest growling .

	onyx:emotionText "One problem with film criticism is to over analysis a film and read things in to its subtext which just aren't there . THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a very good example of this . Once someone points out the fact that director James Whale was a homosexual it opens the floodgates for people reading the film in a way no one originally envisaged . We're shown an opening scene where Lord Byron describes himself as  England's greatest sinner  and as the film progresses we're introduced to nods and winks to a sin of that dare not be explicitly referred to . Instead we see Doctor Pretoruis  a sort of precursor to Quintan Crisp who is described as  queer looking  drinks gin  makes a queen and suggests that he becomes a partner of Baron Frankenstein . Oh purleese . Do you honestly think Whale made this film as a type of gay manifesto ? I'll say one thing about movie directors and that is they have kept a lot of pretentious pseudo intellectuals in a job As a form of entertainment  Yes films are produced as a form of entertainment and to make money for studio investments  THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is very impressive . There is an irony showing the character of Mary Shelley because our thoughts of FRANKENSTEIN owe more to James Whale and Universal studios than they do to Shelley . I doubt if very many people have read the original text but we're all aware of the image of Boris Karloff staggering around a studio interior forest growling . The studio forest depicted in this film are obviously stage sets but are very impressive What Whale has done is to mix pathos with a grotesque sense of humour .

Those sets were used over and over again you can recognize them if you're a real student of the genre.

Ernest Thesiger is Doctor Praetorious a scientist whose reputation is more dubious than that of Frankenstein. He's been experimenting with bringing people back to life and he shows his little creations to Frankenstein. What he describes sounds a lot like cloning Mini Mes as Doctor Evil did.

Who knows if the big guy gets a little something something at home maybe he won't have quite such a bad attitude. When the monster after wreaking havoc again on the countryside is finally back in the Frankenstein laboratory he insists on a 'friend' for himself. It's a real mess that Clive has gotten himself in again.Bride Of Frankenstein with that incredible climax when the monster tries to court his bride will still give you frights for weeks on watching it. The Gothic horror atmosphere that James Whale created on the Universal sets is still capable of creeping one out. Boris Karloff did not repeat his monster role after this and Colin Clive died in 1937 before the next Frankenstein film was made. Still the cycle may have been the most successful of all the Universal monster franchises. It certainly my favorite of all of them.".

Most seriously the most important role and one played by the same character goes from being a mute walking corpse to a chatty dancing machine albeit still with homicidal tendencies.Okay the Monster Boris Karloff doesn't dance so much as bob his shoulders in time to violin music and his chattiness is mostly monosyllabic. Though last seen pinned under a burning rafter he emerges in Bride none the worse for wear. Soon he is loose in the countryside again while Dr. Frankenstein Colin Clive is approached by the mad amoral Dr. Pretorius Ernest Thesiger. Pretorius demands Dr. Frankenstein take responsibility for his creation and replicate his success by building another beast.The comedy of Bride would be more welcome if it worked within the context of horror. Instead it feels absurd for the sake of absurdity like Una O'Connor playing the hysterical servant Minnie or the tiny people Pretorius keeps in jars. Frankenstein works as an exercise in existential bleakness. Bride plays itself off as a nihilistic joke less a true horror film than a Monty Python bit with lamer humor.What does work in the film is Karloff as the Monster. Despite the miscue of letting him speak this time Karloff does bring empathy to his role. It's enough to almost allow for Whale's unsure handling of his character. Half the time the creature is a mad killer and the other half of the time merely misunderstood. At least with Karloff at the controls you know the Monster will give the right amount of chills and he does.Also good is Dwight Frye returning from Frankenstein this time in the role of another henchman figure just as compellingly creepy. Thesiger is also compelling that way a lively figure amid an otherwise sleepy cast. You and I have gone too far to stop nor can it be stopped so easily he tells Frankenstein. To the Monster's comment I love dead...hate living Pretorius deadpans You're wise in your generation. He's a bit problematic in his arch drollery but at least he adds to the proceedings even if he distracts from the film's menace.Whale doesn't do nearly so well with the other actors. Even Clive seems miscast playing the role he established so effectively four years before. The story goes off in weird unresolved tangents like the strange fate of the Neumanns that never are properly explained. None is weirder than the opening where we see Frankenstein's creator Mary Shelley with her lover Percy Shelley and their friend Lord Byron. I should say Lorrrrrd Byrrrrron for the way the guy rolls his R's. I enjoyed haygraphs bright comment from March 2004 about how the prologue has the characters looking back on events taking place a century hence.Whale may be celebrated today as an early gay director but his penchant for jump cuts awkward closeups and florid overacting should have stayed in the closet. Bride may have a certain camp sensibility its enthusiasts enjoy but as a horror film it is neither scary nor successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "While most films celebrated as genre classics generally function to fulfill the set of expectations associated with them in the cultural lexicon James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein marks one of the most pointed examples where one's enjoyment of the film could prove largely contingent on watching without being bogged down by expectations. After vocally disdaining the idea of a sequel to his initial horror classic Whale instead runs with the opportunity to play with an expanded budget and deliver even more surreal somber yet gruesomely funny metaphoric musings on life death conventional relationships and sexuality and more all under the guise of straightforward Gothic horror. And Bride of Frankenstein could still easily be appraised as a classic 'traditional' horror movie strictly but remaining unaware of Whale's fiendish playfulness would doubtlessly leave many a viewer scratching their heads as to many creative choices. The trick is to regard Whale's approach as half selfparody half serious and all willfully weird extrapolating and in many ways 'remaking' his initial classic in a subtly experimental conflicting yet successful tonal fusion. Alternating between moments of high camp the bizarrely flamboyant character of manipulative scientist Dr. Pretorius feels a cheeky prodding of the regulations of the Hays code and heartbreaking poignancy the Creature's infamous encounter with a blind hermit and the unforgettable reaction of the Bride laying eyes upon her 'friend' for the first time Whale's film is a perpetually unsettling watch darting between tone and approach for the sake of an unexpectedly arresting product.This is not to say the film is without fault the reigniting of elements of the first film feels largely contrived turns out the Creature isn't dead! Nor is Frankenstein! Let's toy with morals and build another monster! though whether this is a selfeffacing joke on Whale's part or not is unclear. Equally when viewed without the context of its predecessor the primary characters do feel noticeably underdeveloped and there lies an uneasy use of cinematic metaphor whether religious one scene in which the Creature is bound and carried on a log blatantly evokes Christian iconography or a bizarre underlying theme of the dangers of substance abuse the Creature's gruesome reputation is partially equated with its gorging itself on cigars alcohol food and lusting after women. Nonetheless Whale retains his flair for filling films with delightfully gruesome cartoonish supporting players Una O'Connor's screeching maid toes the line between hilarious and infuriating and phenomenal set design torn between solemn Gothic and discordant expressionist terror giving the film a uniquely disturbing aesthetic. No matter how much the film creeps into oddity Whale always capably anchors it throughout from descending into surreal chaos delivering a remarkable balancing act whose clashing elements serve to only make their points more effectively. Reprising his iconic horror creation Boris Karloff proves most adept at bleeding aching pathos from his misunderstood Creature's whimpered attempts at human contact as scenes of him ferociously snarling and stumbling around risk being un?intentionally funny. Colin Clive the 'straight man' anchor to the variable strangeness surrounding him hits a sturdy balance between charm and nervy perfectionism as Dr. Henry Frankenstein and Valerie Hobson instills a considerable earnest glow into her limited scenes as Frankenstein's fianc. Elsa Lanchester delivers a dual triumph of performances as both a savvy Mary Shelly in the film's prologue and matching her astounding hair and makeup job with an equally nervy and fascinating performance as the Creature's 'Bride'. That said it is truly Ernest Thesiger who walks away with the show as the delightfully strange Pretorius. Though verging on feeling downright out of place Thesiger's grimly knurled face and mad giggle somehow manage to epitomize the spirit of the picture though almost too strange to fit somehow ambitious and deadly twisted enough to transition from comical spectacle to deadly serious moral manipulation. Though it seems the cultural lexicon has largely forgotten how strange and selfeffacing the film truly is Whale's Bride of Frankenstein boasts a fearless flair for experimentation thematic exploration and tonal fluctuation to match its iconic visuals. As telling as any of the potential for mad visions unleashed on mainstream entertainment Whale's work though more tempered by age than many of its kin still stands out as essential viewing for fans of horror cinematic fun and psychoanalysis alike. 8.510".

	schema:headline " The Monster Returns!";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1818 Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus was first published anonymously in London. Audiences in France would later discover in its second publication that the story was a product of a young and dark imagination. That imagination aged 19 years was Mary Shelley. No one could have predicted that her novel would be produced into a film over a hundred years later and her beloved monster would instantly become one of the most recognizable faces since the inception of film. It was never Whale's intention to make a followup film to 1932's Frankenstein but under certain contractual obligations and a substantial amount of pressure from executives he finally agreed to make another film based on the Frankenstein monster. The original working title was known as The Return of Frankenstein but was changed to Bride of Frankenstein based on a small story arc in Shelley's novel. So now that we've thoroughly explored the in's out's and around's we have a solid background to build upon and we're ready to continue onward. Soonward!The story opens with Mary Shelley Lord Byron and Percy Shelley seated comfortably in a sitting room discussing the horrors of her novel. Mary states that a moral lesson is to be drawn from her tale and goes on further to explain that other events occur after the initial story's final act. Subtle screen transitions then depict the closing scene from the first film as the Frankenstein monster escapes from the burning wreckage and flees into the woods. Meanwhile Dr. Henry Frankenstein's body his name was originally Victor but for reasons unclear to me they changed it for the sequel is recovered and brought back to his fiance Elizabeth Valerie Hobson replaced Mae Clark who played Elizabeth in the first film. Henry is approached by his former mentor Dr. Septimus Pretorius Ernest Thesiger and expresses an interest in furthering their research. These introductory elements head smoothly into a classic moral tale.Bride of Frankenstein celebrates the same lavish sets and cinematography that helped make the first film beautiful. If you take the time to admire the set design it becomes clear that amazing things were produced 75 years ago  there are still several sequences where I had to ask myself I wonder how they did that? We could agree on how similar these devices are but a welcome addition that you'll find in Bride of Frankenstein is the use of comic relief especially from Dr. Frankenstein's housekeeper Minnie played by character actress Una O'Connor. The presence of this comedic effect is quietly slipped into the dialogue but if you pay close attention and have an offbeat sense of humor you may pick up on it. In some ways it's refreshing to watch an enjoyable sequel without the overuse of marketing campaigns and slogans that slowly bleed dry the film's worth  but even in the '30's sequels exhibit clich moments to capitalize on the first film's success. Show business is show business but I've chosen to exercise a more lenient approach this time and ignore the negative attributes that plague most sequels. What may be the biggest issue with Bride of Frankenstein though is how little screen time that the Bride has. With a title that openly proclaims the main attraction and a female monster that is easily in the top ten of all horror icons her part is a small one. The Bride is played by Elsa Lanchester who also fills the role of Mary Shelley in the film's prologue.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1818 Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus was first published anonymously in London. Audiences in France would later discover in its second publication that the story was a product of a young and dark imagination. That imagination aged 19 years was Mary Shelley. No one could have predicted that her novel would be produced into a film over a hundred years later and her beloved monster would instantly become one of the most recognizable faces since the inception of film. It was never Whale's intention to make a followup film to 1932's Frankenstein but under certain contractual obligations and a substantial amount of pressure from executives he finally agreed to make another film based on the Frankenstein monster. The original working title was known as The Return of Frankenstein but was changed to Bride of Frankenstein based on a small story arc in Shelley's novel. So now that we've thoroughly explored the in's out's and around's we have a solid background to build upon and we're ready to continue onward. Soonward!The story opens with Mary Shelley Lord Byron and Percy Shelley seated comfortably in a sitting room discussing the horrors of her novel. Mary states that a moral lesson is to be drawn from her tale and goes on further to explain that other events occur after the initial story's final act. Subtle screen transitions then depict the closing scene from the first film as the Frankenstein monster escapes from the burning wreckage and flees into the woods. Meanwhile Dr. Henry Frankenstein's body his name was originally Victor but for reasons unclear to me they changed it for the sequel is recovered and brought back to his fiance Elizabeth Valerie Hobson replaced Mae Clark who played Elizabeth in the first film. Henry is approached by his former mentor Dr. Septimus Pretorius Ernest Thesiger and expresses an interest in furthering their research. These introductory elements head smoothly into a classic moral tale.Bride of Frankenstein celebrates the same lavish sets and cinematography that helped make the first film beautiful. If you take the time to admire the set design it becomes clear that amazing things were produced 75 years ago  there are still several sequences where I had to ask myself I wonder how they did that? We could agree on how similar these devices are but a welcome addition that you'll find in Bride of Frankenstein is the use of comic relief especially from Dr. Frankenstein's housekeeper Minnie played by character actress Una O'Connor. The presence of this comedic effect is quietly slipped into the dialogue but if you pay close attention and have an offbeat sense of humor you may pick up on it. In some ways it's refreshing to watch an enjoyable sequel without the overuse of marketing campaigns and slogans that slowly bleed dry the film's worth  but even in the '30's sequels exhibit clich moments to capitalize on the first film's success. Show business is show business but I've chosen to exercise a more lenient approach this time and ignore the negative attributes that plague most sequels. What may be the biggest issue with Bride of Frankenstein though is how little screen time that the Bride has. With a title that openly proclaims the main attraction and a female monster that is easily in the top ten of all horror icons her part is a small one. The Bride is played by Elsa Lanchester who also fills the role of Mary Shelley in the film's prologue. James Whale did this intentionally not on account of budget constraints but with the purpose of portraying the duality of man. The small increments that the Bride is available are without a doubt classicit's wonderful how much of an impact her character has on the genre which is why many film critics hail this film as Whale's masterpiece.If you love old movie monsters from the silver screen and have always wondered what the hoopla was about especially that of Frankenstein The Monster and the Bride you HAVE to see this.

The Bride of Frankenstein is a wonderful sequel to an already wonderful film and surpasses it technically I feel. Even if the acting is a little forced in the beginning scene with the exception of Elsa Lanchester that is such a minor flaw compared to how good and enjoyable this film was. If you ask me Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest achievements in the history of horrordom.First of all it is extravagantly produced. The sets are really imaginative the cinematography is beautiful and the costumes are extravagant. Along the way I noticed two improvements compared to the first film. One is that Bride of Frankenstein is faster in pace and two the music score is more haunting and melancholic here Franz Waxman was the perfect choice for composer. Bride of Frankenstein also has some really effective scenes the ending was very well done as was the unveiling of the bride to the sound of wedding bells and the miniature people in the bell jars but I found the scene between the monster and the blind hermit especially touching. James Whale's direction is innovative just like in the first film and the script is also very good and adds to the atmosphere. The acting is excellent Colin Clive is very good once again as the eccentric Henry Frankenstein and Ernest Thesiger gives a genius turn as Doctor Pretorious. Valerie Hobson is alluring and sympathetic as Elizabeth occasionally overdoing it with the hysteria but she was fine overall while Elsa Lanchester is good as Mary Shelley but electrifyingly beautiful as the bride. Once again though Boris Karloff gives the finest performance his towering presence and frightening look ensures for some scares but he is very poignant as well as his monster only wants to fit in and is rejected by everybody.Overall a wonderful sequel and not to be missed! 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Although its opening ten minutes are melodramatic and a little ludicrous the remainder of the running time of James Whale's sciencefiction classic Bride of Frankenstein proves to not only be superior to its predecessor but also a surprisingly moving and imaginative motion picture which explores Frankenstein's monster the way that Mary Shelley had originally intended when she conceived of the creature for her novel long before.The original 1931 film also starring Boris Karloff as the monster and Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein sparred and still spars controversy because there's very little resemblance between it and Mary Shelley's Gothic novel. The original film was based more on a stage production of the same name. So for the sequel now that Whale had further backing from the studio he decided to more or less take the material from the book that was left out for the original film and incorporate it with a new story to make a worthy sequel. And he did.The film picks up almost immediately where the first one ended. Dr. Frankenstein turns out to be alive after being thrown from the burning windmill by his own creation who then later turns out to have survived the collapse of the mill and is on a new rampage throughout the country. The movie focuses on two stories. The monster and its excursions and Dr. Frankenstein's acquaintance with another discoveryhungry scientist Ernest Thesiger who has also stumbled upon a way to instill life into the dead.I personally am not the biggest fan of the original 1931 Frankenstein so I had not so high hopes for Bride of Frankenstein. Its ostentatious opening did not really boost up my spirits but I was delighted to see how moving and beautiful and poignant the film became afterward. For once I felt sympathy for the monster. Boris Karloff is no longer simply waving his arms about and grunting but he's displaying a wide variety of emotions that were described in the original book such as this very moving and classic scene where he befriends a blind hermit while being hunted. I was enthralled by Colin Clive's performance in the first movie but he outdoes even that classic image in this sequel as the scientist who has learned from his mistake about playing God. Ernest Thesiger is also very good as the maniacal Dr. Pretorius. And the inclusion of a music score more elaborate special effects more characters and a broader budget really boosted the results.In a way the movie deserves a different title. Not only does Bride of Frankenstein sound ludicrous and it's wrong since it's the monster who desires a bride not Frankenstein but the whole subject of the monster's bride has very little to do with the story. If I had the nerve to retitle a classic I would pick something more appropriate for this film but nevertheless it doesn't detract away from my enjoyment levels.I still say that the first Frankenstein picture is an overrated film but its sequel is more than worthy of its title as a classic. I started out rolling my eyes but ended up being really absorbed by the story. For it's not only about the monster rampaging or Frankenstein going mad.".

Another thing that could have worked against the film is that it is immediately obvious that they had a much higher budget and there is a slickness that wasn't present in the original. The relative crudeness of FRANKENSTEIN worked in its favor the smaller budget and lack of a score only added to its weirdness.Fortunately James Whale overcame all of these factors including his initial reluctance and delivered not only one of the greatest horror films ever made but probably one of the greatest films ever made in any genre. Just compare the scene of Frankenstein and Pretorius bringing the Bride to life to the equivalent creation scene in the original movie and you'll see how they ramped everything up to a whole new level for this picture. The editing the production design the sets the performances are so over the top yet dead on it almost creates a giddiness or a frenzied feeling for the viewer. In fact as the movie progresses the editing becomes more frantic the camera angles more abstract the overall effect more otherworldly. By the creation scene the film feels halfcrazed the viewer somehow intoxicated. Ernest Thesiger as Pretorius as absolutely brilliant his performance equaling that of any contemporary actor and Colin Clive delivers yet another delightfully manic performance as a Henry Frankenstein torn between what is morally right and scientific curiosity. But of course it is Boris Karloff who gives an outstanding performance as the Monster duly credited this time instead of being billed as ? as he was in the first movie one that may even bring you to tears he when befriends a blind hermit.There is a great deal more humor in this film most of it delivered by Thesiger in laughoutloud lines that are not funny at all taken out of context You're wise in your generation for example and I don't want to ruin any of the witty and florid dialogue for you. The film careens wildly from humor to pathos creepiness to zaniness in a roller coaster ride of styles and emotions. The slickness doesn't detract from the atmosphere and since the first film was an enormous hit for Universal to try and duplicate the lowbudget look of the first film would have been pretentious.This is just about as close to a perfect movie that one will encounter and certainly a perfect Universal horror flick. And who wouldn't enjoy that?".

The previous film gave us this trailblazing if misguided scientist bringing life to the dead ... only to find out Pretorius got there first and in miniature. The scene with the miniature people in bottles is amusing and for 1935 a marvel of special effects but it took me right out of the film.The script is just awful for much of the film. It's as if someone mainlined Shakespeare and tried to regurgitate it back as a Frankenstein movie. Although Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein actually comes off quite well as does the Blind Man everyone else comes off sounding like idiots. And speaking of idiots  James Whale might have been a great director and an icon but he should have been shot for allowing the shrill cackling character of Minnie to exist in this movie. More than once I was tempted to turn the DVD off because I couldn't take her caterwauling. If The Monster had killed her at some point it might not have been so bad but to let her live is cruel and inhuman punishment for the viewer.The performances range from excellent to campy. Karloff as usual does a terrific job and his charisma lessens the blow of the silly dialogue he is forced to utter. Elsa Lanchester in a dual role as Mary Shelley and The Bride is magical to watch but it is to film lovers' eternal regret that she didn't get more screen time as The Bride. Valerie Hobson is gorgeous as Elizabeth but betrays her acting inexperience in a few scenes it's hard to believe she was only 17 at the time. Colin Clive despite being given more theatrical less realistic dialogue than in the first film does his usual good job. Ernest Thesinger is embarrasing as the mad Dr. Pretorius. I'm told he was James Whale's drama instructor or something like that  it shows. It's always hard to direct your teachers.And Una O'Connor's performance as Minnie is worthy of the worst Ed Wood film and not much else.There is also sloppy continuity with the first film. Aside from changes of actors  which is fair enough  there are errors that should have been caught such as giving a different name to the character whose daughter was killed by The Monster in the first film. Despite my criticisms Bride of Frankenstein isn't a terrible film on its own merits. Karloff steals the show as usual and Elsa Lanchester is electrifying pun intended. But to this Frankenstein fan it utterly pales in comparison with the first film.".

It's always hard to direct your teachers.And Una O'Connor's performance as Minnie is worthy of the worst Ed Wood film and not much else.There is also sloppy continuity with the first film. Aside from changes of actors  which is fair enough  there are errors that should have been caught such as giving a different name to the character whose daughter was killed by The Monster in the first film. Despite my criticisms Bride of Frankenstein isn't a terrible film on its own merits. Karloff steals the show as usual and Elsa Lanchester is electrifying pun intended. But to this Frankenstein fan it utterly pales in comparison with the first film.";

The cinematography is excellent with many fascinating shadowlike shots particularly with facial closeups.A surprise is that the actual bride of Frankenstein is only created and then seen in the final minutes of the film. The title can be misleading as we expect most of the story to be about her. Instead most of the movie is simply a sequel to the original Frankenstein picking up where that film left off with the monster somehow surviving his fiery doom.I would like to have seen more of the bride who was fascinating to view. Elsa Lanchester who played that character also played Mary Shelley in the beginning of the film. The most interesting character I thought was the devillike Dr. Praetorious played by Ernest Thesiger. Now this guy had a true face of a mad scientist!Most films need to be trimmed 1015 minutes but here is an exception. This movie needed another 10 to 15 minutes tacked on so we could see more of the bride. It's still considered one of the best horror films of all time and at just 74 minutes would certainly be worth your time to check it out if you've seen it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In short Fish Story will take you on a wild improbable ride that will leave you smiling once the credits begin. It is a film that rewards multiple viewings as it will leave you thinking and desiring to watch it again almost immediately. Great acting and an incredibly well put together set of events leads to a movie that definitely should be seen. My favorite film of 2009 so far.If you haven't seen Fish Story yet you may want to stop reading this review after this paragraph. There aren't spoilers in my review but it is one of those movies that is best viewed with no preconceived ideas about the plot. Watch the film and enjoy the twists and turns that the story takes. It is a ride that most will undoubtedly enjoy.Fish Story is about a punk band named Gekirin that recorded a single called Fish Story in 1975 a year before the Sex Pistols popularized punk music. Despite knowing that their music won't sell Gekirin and their supportive producer decide to record this song knowing that one day it will impact the life of at least one person. The film jumps around different time periods ranging from 1975 to 2012 where a meteor is on a collision course for Earth. Going through the movie the viewer is shown different stories without knowing what is going on or how they factor in to the main narrative.Each part of the film is captivating despite the fact that we don't really know what is going on in the film as a whole. Every new story reveals a piece to the puzzle and when they all come together at the end you'll feel like jumping up running outside and telling everyone that they NEED to watch Fish Story. Then you'll want to watch it again. This movie has one of the most satisfying endings that I have ever experienced.I love the cast in this film. Acting was solid but no awardwinning performances. I particularly enjoyed Omori Nao who played the producer that discovered Gekirin as well as a music shop owner whose store is open despite the pending destruction of Earth. I also thought Kora Kengo playing Gekirin's singer and Moriyama Mirai playing a guy trained since birth to be a champion of justice his action sequences were really cool stood out. Based on a novel by Isaka Kotaro and adapted by Hayashi Tamio Fish Story has a great script. Also the cinematography is good though certainly not groundbreaking as well as the directing. Music is great especially the song Fish Story which was written specially for the film.I can't really name many faults with this film other than it was a little bit draggy in some spots. Also some may not enjoy the girl's Tabe Mikako overenthusiastic acting but I found that it fit her character. The film was just under two hours but I felt that length was not a problem.Fish Story jumps around to different genre's thriller martial arts action comedy music documentary etc which I think keeps the movie incredibly engaging constantly changing up the pace. During my second viewing I couldn't help but think that I would enjoy watching a film that just took any one of the multiple stories presented and made it featurelength. All of them are that interesting. Having each individual story in the span of a single film though is what helps make Fish Story a magical experience. From beginning to end you will be engaged and entertained. I advise everyone to see Fish Story.John Kincaid  jkfilmjapan.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "What the Fish!!! So I'd thought that it'll be somewhat of a chore to sit through almost two hours late into what's left of a Friday night with Fish Story directed by Yoshihiro Nakamura and based on the novel by Kotaro Isaka. But I was utterly blown away leaving me feet tapping and head bobbing all the way through to the end credits roll and a smile plastered on my face all the way home. It's an Armageddon film done with pizazz and creative flair and not to mention that dash of comedy and great music that I'd feel is a hard act for the rest of the festival lineup to keep within touch for the Audience Choice. I know it's still early in the festival but Fish Story has established itself as one of the best films I've watched this year and one of the rare few that will likely give you that familiar fuzzy feeling after you've sat through an awesome film.The story unveils itself in nonlinear fashion and somewhat like Sandcastle has a little lingering mystery  a punk rock song that contains a minute's silence  to what it actually all means which comes altogether as a climax when everything gets to show hand. It tackles that wonderment of how events in the past will inevitably shape what's to come in the future even if it doesn't make sense in the present. And Nakamura takes this premise and through the narrative structure enables the audience to experience just that. We're brought from timeline to timeline that at the point of presentation the scenes seem disparate to one another and don't make much sense but contains enough in their individual segments to entertain. Hinging on a song called Fish Story that's performed by a punk rock band called Gekirin it's amazing just what this one song can do to carry the entire film not only because it sounds great those not into punk rock I'd think you'd find it hard not to enjoy this especially when the cast members go into overdrive in their performance but has an intriguing story on how it got produced that forms the bulk of the film. Like most songs that seem fated to fade into obscurity without proper promotional or marketing power or fans to ensure some longevity or worst a band that's being condemned as talentless and to be let go by their record company little do the band members know that one day this song will just about save humankind.And in that respect with Japanese fantasyscifi stories in a similar mould such as the Twentieth Century Boys trilogy Fish Story tackles the same doomsday scenario and that plot element of a song of hope yet unfulfilled and unexplained in a succinct fashion that doesn't meander unnecessarily. Spanning almost 40 years we're treated to one off stories such as a timid driver Gaku Hamada resembling a youthful looking Jackie Chan with that hairdo he spots who finds some resolve to stand up for himself and for others after being told of a prophecy about saving the world and another tale where a young cook onboard a ferry saving a schoolgirl Mikako Tabe and other passengers from gun totting hijackers. They're as disparate as they can get and if you're wondering just what's going on when you see recurring characters or instances in each I'd say to enjoy the moments crafted from a tinge of horror to an all out actionadventure before the payload at the end truly hits you.All these and more based upon the single introduction set in the year 2012 where the world is threatened by a comet on a collision course for Earth and a group of strangers gathering in a niche music shop. It's 5 hours to impact and the shopkeeper whips out the rare Fish Story vinyl record for them all to give a listen to thinking that it's quite futile to head toward Mount Fuji to avoid an impending tsunami scenario and of course hoping for a miracle to come from a country that on one hand is not expected and on the other totally plausible for the maths and science experts it produces.There are references to other Japanese icons such as Godzilla and GoRangers and for fans of Hollywood films you'll probably be able to identify the ohsofunny references and cheeky dissing of films from The Karate Kid not the Jackie Chan version though and Michael Bay's Armageddon in fact quoting the whatif scenario of having the nuclear bombs on the comet but yet to be exploded because well of what happened to Bruce Willis. Some stories are played out in tongueincheek fashion and they complement one another really well which of course makes the finale all the more fun especially when everything starts to make sense and goes the full circle.".

You see what appears to be a series of unconnected events somehow gel. The song itself is a proto punk song recorded before the Sex Pistols and its actually a good song. The acting goes all over the map as there are flashbacks with disparate characters but it is pretty much all good. Whatever the ending you have to stay for it to see how things tie together. The world could come to an end Japan would be pretty much submerged if the comet hit so just watch. It has a kind of new wavish sensibility especially the scenes with the band who recorded Fish Story. Not perfect it drags slightly at times but its worthwhile. I recommend it.".

All will be revealed there are no cheats in this film and it has that rarest of creatures a completely satisfying ending without loose ends.

So from a 1950's man desperate for work translating a book into Japanese via a dictionary  to that book being recalled and pulped  to the single surviving copy  to a struggling band using that copy as the basis for their one and only album  which has their one great song  which has a mysterious silent minute  which allows a boy driving home to hear a scream  which lets him save a girl from rape  which leads to him marrying her  which leads to their child being raised as a defender of justice  who then saves a lost schoolgirl from murder  who is the maths genius that makes the plan to destroy the comet... The story is built in little layers until it makes a magnificent whole. i rate it 910 very rarely will i go that high. Enjoy!".

The film then spins out telling the story of the song the group that created it and the sequence of events of which it is but one part that lead to the saving of the earth and to the men standing in the record store.A frequently funny and smiling producing film this is a movie that will occasionally confuse you you will wonder how it all ties together a mystery which remains until they reveal how it all ties together at the very end. It's a film with enough plot for five or six movies as threads are spun out and dropped once we see the relevant bits. We could have probably followed any one of them to the conclusion as well but many are just stops in the greater scheme of things.I liked this whimsical little film a great deal. My only real reservations come from my unhappiness with the over selling that the film got from the staff of Film Festival where I saw it. Many people went out of there way to tell everyone how great it was. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but its not quite the religious experience that at least one person inferred. Over selling or not I don't think I would have ever raved about the film. It's too rambling and too fragmented to ever be a full meal of a movie I think some of the threads especially the story of the band would have been a better focus it's really good after dinner piece of chocolate. This isn't to say that there is anything wrong with it there isn't its more something that you need to discover for yourself and not have handed to you with an impossible level of expectations.

It's the sense of whimsy perhaps or the sheer longwinded shaggydoggedness of the storytelling. The fact that the production values are high the script is very funny and the actors nail the characters too. About halfway through I relaxed a little when I realised I was enjoying what I was watching and then I started having fun.Things get better right up until the big reveal at the ending which is so stupendously good that I can say right here and right now that FISH STORY features one of my favourite endings in a film full stop.

He can't understand why they are there who wants to buy music on the day the Earth is destroyed? The man behind the counter isn't concerned though he is convinced that the Earth isn't doomed and more than that he is sure that an obscure punk record that nobody bought will somehow he the cause of the planet's salvation. The then see a variety of stories intertwined with the story of how the record came to be made and why there is a one minute silence in the middle of it. The stories involve a shy young man who stops his car and hears a woman being assaulted nearby a group who foresee the end of the world and a school girl who falls asleep on a ferry misses her stop and gets caught up in a hijacking only to be saved by a man who had just told her he had been raised to be a 'champion of Justice'.This film was a lot of fun it successfully mixed genres so that we had moments of action a main plot that directly referenced the film 'Armageddon' plenty of laughs and finally a nice link that explained how each of the separate stories was related. I loved how the song which the band thought was deep and meaningful was based on a book that was so badly translated it no longer made sense. The actors seemed to do a fine job although relying on subtitles to understand them I can't judge them as well as somebody who speaks Japanese could. The way the story skips about kept things interesting none of the individual stories went on too long and the way we weren't shown how each ended till the end of the film kept me eager to find out what happened in each case. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want to watch something rather different and don't mind subtitled films.".

And like other reviewers by the end of it a huge smile has been smeared on my face by the time the credits started rolling.In this unique Japanese apocalyptic story the world is going to end by meteor strike. But somehow a punk song called Fish Story with a mysterious a minute of silence in it might just offer the salvation the whole world has despaired from expecting. To find out whether it will and how four seemingly separate tales need to be told. But don't worry writer and director Yoshihiro Nakamura does a great job the four tales are all entertaining on their own and when I realized how they are connected I was not disappointed at all. The unfolding events though weird and unusual made complete sense and none of the plot twists seemed contrived in the least.There aren't many downsides to this movie and the only thing I would complain about is some scenes with slower pacing. But I enjoyed it so much that I still remember it fondly many months later as an extremely welldone unique and entertaining film.".

It's a very unusual multicharacter multiera film that was a lot more enjoyable than expected. The down point for me hence only giving it a 6 is because the sequences that focus on the band that wrote the song in the 70's are really dull and drag on for far too long. All the other plot lines featuring a hostage situation on a ferry rectified by a kungfu expert a currentday record shop employee who discusses the said band's history with a customer and a strange chance meeting seemingly orchestrated in part by a legend of a screaming girl in a song are quite entertaining.It's still silly overall as you would expect from such a premise but it was enjoyable nonetheless.".
