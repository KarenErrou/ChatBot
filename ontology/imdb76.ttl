But in the end you have learned little about someone who is shallow and unappealing. This film portrays the journey of a motorcyclist tormented by demons vaguely hinted at in mysterious stops he makes in route. You see that he is attracted and repulsed by women. Cheryl Tiegs for those of you old enough to remember her from the 1970s is perfect in what amounts to a cameo. But his encounters with women are so fleeting and glancing that you learn little until the end of the journey. Then what you learn is too trite to support your having endured the trip with him.

	schema:reviewBody "While I give the film kudos for a story that I didn't see coming after the first few minutes of needless and extremely boring motorcycle racing I could see that I was NOT in the hands of a professional editor. The story could have been told far more effectively in half the timeor less. Gallo definitely needed to step away and let a professional editor do hisher thing and mercilessly cut scenes that didn't move the story forward.While I could see that the author wanted the audience to crawl inside the protagonist Bud during the road trip it didn't take that darned long to do it. Plus his point of view changed too frequently. If we are inside his skin then why are we looking at him for minutes in an excruciatingly long and tedious long shot? We need to see what he seesat least with more consistency. I couldn't get my bearings in terms of what I was supposed to be experiencing and from what viewpoint.There were other technical problems such as an inconsistency in lighting and shot quality with no apparent reason. And that spotted windshield drove me nuts. If a sign of depression and the carelessness that results from it I'd have appreciated technique that didn't interfere so much with the visuals. Speaking of visuals extending driving sequences to cover a song also seemed visually uninspired.Probably most important Gallo ignored common expectations of audiences and wanted things his way. I can't believe there wasn't an acceptable compromise. I'm pretty patient when it comes to art and film as art but don't appreciate my sensibilities and expectations to be pushed beyond the breaking point when there appears to be no artistic justification for it. Too many scenes suffered from too few cuts and ran far too long engendering more audience frustration than heightened emotionalism. I think this may be a result of an inexperienced and slightly selfindulgent filmmaker.These technical problems aside I'm usually able to spot a twist a mile awaybut not this time. I wondered why all the women he encountered had flower names but that was just a hint that didn't make much sense until the end. But his name? Bud as in flower bud and clay as in a substance in which flowers grow he couldn't have named the character dirt or mulch after all might have been a bit over the top. Again typical of an immature filmmaker.Was the encountered women's immediate sexual response to a complete stranger fantasy on the character's part or the filmmaker's? I'd like to know how many men run into so many compliant females. From what I hear not manyeven when the guy is young goodlooking and clearly pitiable. In this day and age we ladies are a bit more cautious than that. Sorry Vincent. While this may have been believable for males I don't expect it was for very many female viewers.I watched the film largely because I wanted to see if and how graphic sex could be incorporated into a drama without lowering it to the level of high brow pornography. I think the film did a good job on that score although I'd have preferred the use of a realisticlooking prosthetic such as that used in Boogie Nights. Perhaps the budget didn't allow for it or...who knows? It was certainly an interesting artistic choice and one that leaves me scratching my head in terms of the motive for including it. Symbolically I'm a bit confused about it.As effective and surprising as the end twist was there could have been more in terms of Bud's descent into depression. But then I'm a psychologist so am aware that symptoms are more than seeking surrogates crying and looking forlorn and depressed. Gallo missed IMO a chance to show more about what guilt and loss look like and how they affect people. Perhaps this again is a result of his inexperience. Personally I think Redford's Ordinary People did a better job of showing a wider breadth of feelings of grief and loss.Bottom line although I thought the story had merit and did an excellent job of building to a surprising twist I think it suffered severely in the journey towards the denouement. I hope Gallo matures and grows as a storyteller and filmmaker as I think he's got something to say worth watching.".

And in fact that's what I loved the most about the movie  how Gallo has the artistic wherewithal to be true to HIS vision of what a film can be to how a plot of a film and there IS a plot can be played out in a different less recognizable way which leads to one of the reasons I think people are calling this a vanity project aside from the infamous scene toward the end  which I have to say is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to the film once you find out what's really going on with our sick puppy Bud Clay  because the movie doesn't follow a 'typical' setup requiring a bit more patience on the part of the viewer a lot of people feel more comfortable dismissing this unbelievably profound piece of work as a 'vanity project'. In reality I believe the opposite is true Gallo is giving his audience more credit than they perhaps deserve in presenting such a stark uncompromising character study. The fact that a lot of this audience chooses not to accept him on his terms does not diminish his power and the power of this movie.  Can't wait for the next one Vincent.".

I think what bothered me more than the endless driving was how these women seemed to think that he was a hot boy. They would just randomly go with him although he looked and acted like a crazy person. Sane people wouldn't ask a stranger to drive across country w them especially when she's like 16.Although the scene was well hyped if you've ever seen given or received head you've seen it before. More interesting to me was to find out that he just couldn't accept what happened and he was still w her in his mind. But I sat through 60 minutes of mindless driving for 10 minutes of an OK movie? So not worth it!".

What the trailer and all the hype didn't prepare me for was the fact that The Brown Bunny could also be considered one of the most original American films ever made. In a time of overblown budgets and enormous productions with endless crew lists Vincent Gallo has almost singlehandedly made a concise wellthought out conceptual filma poignant touching love story. It's not often that a director's second film is more daring than his firstmoney greed and Hollywood power seem too tempting to most and sophomore efforts usually represent the big sell out. Not so The Brown Bunny not so Gallo the iconoclast. He manages to make a second film more interesting more intimate more revealing and more memorable than his first. And he manages to do it outside the system.Gallo's instincts as a director are spoton. Not only does he pull from Chloe Sevigny the performance of her career he also solicits from a cast of complete unknowns and nonactors including Cheryl Tiegs painfully believable performances. I have always thought his talents as an actor were underrated but surely The Brown Bunny will provide him his due as Bud Clay a motorcycle racer undergoing a breakdown while driving across the country. Simply put Gallo as Bud is devastating. At one point during the film I was so tense watching him fall apart that I realized that I had been holding my breath through the entire scene. When you stop to think that he is also directing himself and directing the photography it's that much more impressive. I don't know how someone circumvents the Hollywood system to make a movie in this day and age but it seems that Gallo has not only done that but done it in a way that is memorable haunting and visually stunning. This is a truly radical film made by a very courageous filmmaker someone willing to tell a story tell it honestly and suffer the consequences of his convictions. Pasolini would be proud.".

What entertainment! What an artistic scene that was where we got to see him put a nozzle in and out of his vans gas tank. It made me horny I mean snorey. What a f'n bore fest.The film is presented in a way that is obviously meant to be a very artsy piece but seriously. It's no better than Andy Warhol's least inspired pieces Like a painting of a can of soup WOW! Amazingly dull stuff Made either by dumb people or ones who are too hopped up on some very good drugs to realize how overly stupid the stuff they are creating actually is.The story overall is not that bad in the end. However on the way there exists a few totally pointless scenes and the lead up is far too long to make the climax of the film anything we give a crap about. By the end people are throwing popcorn at the screen and screaming Shut the hell up you bumbling moron..Without the much talked about real oral sex scene featuring the very talented Chloe Sevigny I can't imagine many people in the entire world giving this film any more than a 2 out of 10 rating. Personally I don't even think the sex scene is that great. It certainly could have been much better. Chloe gives a better oral performance than Paris Hilton does in her widely known sex tape. But that isn't really saying much. I've been a long time fan of Chole's in terms of her acting and I don't take anything away from her for attempting to push some limits with this scene. In fact it's kind of cool to see a well known Hollywood actress that I have watched for years take a chance and do a scene like this. However I wasn't that impressed with the scene though it is certainly the highlight of this film.310".

	schema:reviewBody "This is literally the first time I have seen a movie that was almost purely ruined due to the poor dialogue. Browse through some of the quotes to get an idea. The second and arguably equally or more important flaw is simply put This movie is literally one of the most boring films of alltime that tries to present itself as a serious piece of cinema. There is absolutely no semblance of a plot until the last 20 minutes of the movie which beforehand is largely led by a string of seemingly random and nonsensical events the most perplexing of which is when Budd stops to get a drink at a vending machine passes a woman sitting on a bench then sits next to her and the two begin inexplicably making out for minutes until he departs as suddenly as he arrived while the two never exchange a single word of dialogue. Also the scene in the beginning where Budd convinces a corner store worker to get into his van and drive off with him to California after the two say barely more than a few words to each other ending with him saying Please.... Please come with me. felt painfully staged unrealistic and sappy.Finally when the plot revealed itself to us during the last 20 minutes I would like to make clear that unlike a lot of people I DID finally understand the point of this film and what it was trying to express. Essentially this is a movie about a man who is clinically insane and has hallucinations and therefore nothing displayed on screen is necessarily reality. I was in fact a strong advocate for another poorly received film which like this film was showing what an insane character with a mental disorders sees rather than what the reality is The Hand. One major difference between both movies is The Hand shows context behind the displayed events whereas in this film there is no context whatsoever in any scene aside from the last 15 minutes. Nothing displayed beforehand makes any sense and it could mean or represent ANYTHING.If at least there was meaningful dialogue it could have been interesting but with every scene and every character droning out 3 or 5 word sentences at the same tepid pace it is not how people converse it is not engaging and it quite literally seems as though the actors are forgetting their lines. Compare this now to a movie like Warum Lauft Herr R. Amok Which like this film has literally no plot until the last 5 minutes. All the conversations in it were very engaging very realistic and played out almost like a documentary which is what this film NEEDED to do in order to succeed in what it set out to do and how it set out to do it but quite simply the people involved in this film thought they were vastly VASTLY greater than they really are to have made this DO not know good cinema and did not put the effort here.To be fair the ending when a plot was finally established was quite powerful and the talk between Budd and Daisy IN ITSELF was moderately well conceived which is why I gave this film a second star. This moment would have been quite effective in its own contained capsule as everything that happens before these 15 minutes is completely inconsequential to this scene and moreso when it is revealed that the scene was Budd's hallucination so then too was everything that preceded this scene which was the ONLY scene of the movie with any shred of value to it though appearing rather cheap and amateurish when the best it can do is to utilize such visionary artistry as seen in Japanese porno films with the censored fellatio scene in which Chloe Sevigny claims that the sex act was not simulated which absolutely floors me for since it is censored and given that any real sex act would therefore be irrelevant to the viewer that is basically like saying I don't suck dick for any artistic end I do it just for the taste of it. I find that very amusing but nonetheless it has to be said if this scene was its own short film it would have been effective.I hate to use the word arrogant but when you produce a movie that 1. Has awful dialogue 2. Has plot devices that make no sense and have no context. 3. Is essentially an entire illusion of the main character. 4. 50 of which is comprised of nothing but shots of driving on the open road which have NO artistic point if they expect the viewers to find meaning and value in illusions which essentially have no meaning or context and are not even interesting that is pure arrogance and this film is indeed nothing but self indulgence. The point is if you're like me and you watch a new movie a day some of which are very well done and MUCH more clever witty well crafted and have real meaning and an actual why bother INVENTING a context behind an entire illusion of a movie to give it value and meaning when it is painfully boring illogical and staged and 50 of it literally consists of watching a man driving and walking.".

The seemingly endless blurry shots of the side of Vincent Gallo's head as he drives his van across country were excruciating. And Bud's damaged yet sensitive attitude toward women was like a 13 yearold boy's wet dream. The formulaic device of giving all the female characters flower names was especially contrived and annoying. It seems as if the entire purpose of this movie was to show that Gallo knows how to ride a motorcycle and has a larger than average cock.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Brown Bunny' is the kind of independent art film that was always destined to polarise the opinions of critics and audiences alike. Gallo's controversial decision to incorporate a graphic hardcore oral sex scene between him and costar Chloe Sevigny was interpreted by many as gratuitous and the film's modest pacing and minimalist plot inevitably alienated a large section of mainstream filmgoers.'The Brown Bunny' which was written directed edited produced and photographed by Vincent Gallo is essentially an existential road movie that departs from traditional modes of narrative filmic communication. The film treads a similar thematic terrain to his directorial debut 'Buffalo 66' in that in both films the central protagonist is struggling to come to terms with certain events that have taken place in his past. However in this film Gallo dispenses with his uniquely black sense of humour and with any real linear narrative in favour of providing a character study of a man deep in grief carefully detailing every subtle nuance and trait of his increasingly pathological behaviour. The journey that Gallo takes us on is an entirely subjective one. Throughout the film Gallo forces the spectator to scrutinise Bud and his facial expressions in extreme closeups. We look on as Bud spontaneously breaks down and weeps within the confines of his van. The spectator is made to feel like a voyeur because what we are witnessing seems so personal and private. These extreme closeups make two things clear Firstly Gallo is committed with the Brown Bunny to present Bud's state of mind visually and not by resorting to the traditional Classical Hollywood method of using dialogue or voiceovers. Secondly they emphasise the impossibility of this task. Ultimately we cannot tell how Bud is feeling simply by looking into his eyes or observing his facial expressions at close proximity. In this sense Gallo also seems to be exploring the limits of the filmic image in representing a character's subjective mental state.Gallo's cinematography is characterised by an abundance of static shots precise compositions and long takes that are all employed in a methodical manner creating a slow and rhythmic pace that accurately evokes a pensive atmosphere of romantic grieving. His decision to shoot on Super 16mm film with a nonlinear digital blowup to 35mm gives 'the Brown Bunny' the grainy visuals of Independent American cinema of the early seventies. It is difficult to fault Gallo's eye for aesthetic detail. Beautifully photographed shots of the open road and the picturesque American landscape are accompanied by the wistful and haunting melodies of folk artists like Gordon Lightfoot and Jackson C Frank. These incredibly evocative musical interludes serve to heighten the cathartic experience between the spectator and Bud encouraging us not only to ponder the provenance of Bud's turmoil but also providing us with an opportunity to reflect on our own lives and loves. The film's major shortcoming is Gallo's blatant and overstated use of metaphor. We are left in doubt that Bud Clay is the proverbial bunny of the film's title. Gallo's symbolism is at its most contrived in a peculiar scene in which Bud randomly visits a pet store to inquire about the life expectancy of the rabbits. This notion of Bud as the symbolic bunny who only has a short time to live if he cannot reestablish his emotional equilibrium is again overtly reinforced visually through Bud's entire brown apparel in the film's final reel. The spectator's sense of voyeurism is sustained throughout the film and culminates in the penultimate fellatio fantasy sequence between Bud and Daisy which is beautifully bathed in speckles of blue light. Gallo ingeniously integrates icons of pornography into the narrative which he then juxtaposes against his protagonist's feelings of insecurity jealousy and guilt to formulate a scene that is both genuinely disturbing yet emotionally insightful. Far from being erotic or exploitation's this scene marks Gallo's most significant achievement with 'the Brown Bunny' a personal study of masculinity masochism and the male ego. It is Bud's ego that initially leads him to view himself as the victim of the events surrounding Daisy's death by interpreting his pregnant girlfriend's brutal rape as an act of infidelity. His masturbatory fantasy explores the gulf between sex and intimacy in the context of a couple who have had their emotional ties severed. Bud makes a vein attempt to try and recapture the intimacy that he once shared with Daisy through an act of physical gratification. When he cannot find solace in this ritual and realises that it does not satisfy his emotional needs he is forced to confront his own masculinity and that ultimately places him on another spiritual road to either redemption or suicide. Gallo deliberately leaves the ending wide open through his use of a final memorable freezeframe. I admire any man who takes three years out of his life to singlehandedly create a movie that he wholeheartedly believes in no matter what the end result. As anyone in the industry will tell you it's hard enough to get a terrible film made let alone a truly great one. 'The Brown Bunny' stands up as an undoubtedly brave and ambitious meditation on love and loss that despite its flaws retains a remarkably powerful cumulative effect.".

Even as it is I was surprised at how ambitious a project this is.Gallo is an actor that believes it possible for the nature of a character to animate a story even when the story isn't revealed conventionally. So what he does is give us a couple hours of just looking at him so we can infer the story or at least the effect of the story. Only at the end are we told what this was all about.The story  at least the presented version  is that our boy gave his pregnant girlfriend a chocolate bunny on which they gorged. She then got high and incidentally gangraped and choked on the brown bunny and died. Our man imaginesdreams her visiting his motel room where he gives her a metaphorical brown bunny.That's when we learn that nothing we have seen is to be trusted. Likely even the fact that he is a motorcycle racer is in question only the aimlessness of his path is likely. Womencentric events are shown all based on a Beatrix Potter  Peter Rabbit notion of him visiting Alice's flower garden Lilly Rose Violet and Daisy.In the first he visits Daisy's mother who he lived next door to. She both doesn't recall him and owns a brown bunny. The second is the sequence that made this for me. He encounters a woman sitting outside and has a near wordless miniencounter with her that packed years of a relationship into a couple minutes. The similar fantasy sequence in Buffalo 66 is when Christina Ricci does a Big Lebowski inspired dance in a bowling alley.The woman he works with in this sequence is Cheryl Tiegs who gives the performance of the year. I wish I knew what Gallo said to her.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

That may be true but what's unsettling about the reviews is that they influenced director Vincent Gallo to cut the film in half leaving it more concise and marketable for mass audiences. Well I don't like to form opinions based on unnecessary gossip but I can't help but be bothered by it. If Gallo were a visionary filmmaker why would he drastically reedit a film just after its premiere? I know this has happened many times with other directors but there is a part of me that has a hard time taking Gallo seriously. It's not his acting. I can see he has a quality that is rare and unique to most other contemporaries. His beautiful acting range is evident in his previous film Buffalo 66. I just sense from his egocentric attitude of being the star writer director producer and the fact that he's in 95 of every shot in the film that he is just being creatively oblivious.Most artists will tell you that selfportraits are the most difficult subjects to tackle because they involve erasing your preconceived notions about who you think you are to showing how everyone knows who you are. Nobody said that The Brown Bunny is autobiographical but it certainly feels personal. This film reminded me of Dennis Hopper's The Last Movie an unfinished existential sequel to the 1969 film Easy Rider. Hopper and Gallo seem similar in their egos and their American cowboy persona's but there seems to be a void here. I'm not sure a longer movie would be the answer. All I know is that Vincent Gallo's character Blake should look more pathetic and less cool to his audience. I may see this again and see something different. For now I am tired of seeing another road movie that really looks rehashed and broken down for its artistic value. This just doesn't feel self conscious. It feels clueless and arrogant.".

	schema:headline " Awesome solid fifth underrated Dirty Harry action flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Pool 1988 is Clint Eastwood's most underrated and the fifth final flick in the Dirty Harry series. I love this movie and I think is better than The Enforcer. It is one of my personal favorite action movies of all time. It is the last Dirty Harry movie and it is well done with action sequences and great music opening theme. This was the third film I saw in my youth as a child. The first and the second movie were Dirty Harry and Magnum Force. I grew up with this film. The scene where Rook David Hunt kills with a knife Walker's Patricia Clarkson cameraman scares the hell out of me. Evan C. Kim as Al Quan also did a great solid job Harry's partner since than I don't see him in the film business anymore. I don't agree with critics this film is bad which is not. I have always loved this movie I even saw the VHS tape in 2003 on a sale sadly I didn't bought it but I have now whole collection on Bluray disc. Patricia Clarkson was in my opinion much better than the actress Sondra Locke. I love the theme music in the opening scene and I love this action flick. This is the first time I see Jim Carrey in this flick as Johnny Squares who gets murdered in his trailer which the killer fills him with drugs. Liam Neeson is also in here as Peter Swan the movie director who becomes the murder suspect in this flick on a dead pool list of people who also Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood becomes the target as him self in it. This movie was directed by Buddy Van Horn who directed previously Any Which Way You Can 1980 the sequel to Every Which Way but Loose 1978 Clint Eastwood films and Pink Cadillac 1989. The Dead Pool is the fifth and final installment in the Dirty Harry film franchise. The 1988 sequel finds Inspector Callahan Clint Eastwood trying to solve a series of murders that appears to be linked to a list of celebrities that were deemed likely to be dead in the near future. The film's cast included Liam Neeson Evan Kim as well as the feature film debut of Jim Carrey. I think this movie is close to The Rookie 1990 another Clint Eastwood flick that Clint directed it him self and I love it. Because Michael Goodwin who plays the character Lt. Ackerman the last name Ackerman was later used in Charlie Sheen's character The Rookie 1990. Both of the movies are each other like and they are both good. Just in The Rookie Clint plays different character than Harry Callahan. The basic plot about this film is more about a psychopath killer who stalks Hollywood stars including the director and making his own movies. The film does have a plot wholes like the killer was revealed by the end of the movie and his motives. Just trough whole movie the actor David Hunt is shown by the end of the movie. This great last chapter in the career of Inspector Harry Callahan can not be missed! You have got to check out the remote controlled car chase...reminiscent of that great Sunday drive scene in BULLITT with Steve McQueen! Look for the great Jim Carrey acts to GUNS N' ROSES' Welcome To The Jungle as a junkie rock star...side splitting stuff!! Eastwood delivers the goods in his last appearance as the San Francisco cop who took care of the bad guys...HIS WAY!! BANG...with that .44 Magnum Smith  Wesson handcannon!! Be sure to add this movie to your collection. I got the DIRTY HARRY 5 film collection on Bluray !! I recommend this movie as well as the others!!The Dead Pool is a 1988 American action film directed by Buddy Van Horn written by Steve Sharon and starring Clint Eastwood as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan. It is the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry film series set in San Francisco California.Back in the day Roger Ebert called this final Dirty Harry film the best since the original. I'll take it a step further I think it's the greatest Harry film of all. And he even gets the girl at the end! An awesome end to one of the greatest film series in history...Please just don't let them start remaking these films! I'll have to smother myself! Anyway this movie is great and none I repeat NONE of the Dirty Harry movies are bad they are all great and I love them all. This movie deserves 9 from me. This is my fourth favorite film in the series the last one will be The Enforcer.".

The 1988 sequel finds Inspector Callahan Clint Eastwood trying to solve a series of murders that appears to be linked to a list of celebrities that were deemed likely to be dead in the near future. The film's cast included Liam Neeson Evan Kim as well as the feature film debut of Jim Carrey. I think this movie is close to The Rookie 1990 another Clint Eastwood flick that Clint directed it him self and I love it. Because Michael Goodwin who plays the character Lt. Ackerman the last name Ackerman was later used in Charlie Sheen's character The Rookie 1990. Both of the movies are each other like and they are both good. Just in The Rookie Clint plays different character than Harry Callahan. The basic plot about this film is more about a psychopath killer who stalks Hollywood stars including the director and making his own movies. The film does have a plot wholes like the killer was revealed by the end of the movie and his motives. Just trough whole movie the actor David Hunt is shown by the end of the movie. This great last chapter in the career of Inspector Harry Callahan can not be missed! You have got to check out the remote controlled car chase...reminiscent of that great Sunday drive scene in BULLITT with Steve McQueen! Look for the great Jim Carrey acts to GUNS N' ROSES' Welcome To The Jungle as a junkie rock star...side splitting stuff!! Eastwood delivers the goods in his last appearance as the San Francisco cop who took care of the bad guys...HIS WAY!! BANG...with that .44 Magnum Smith  Wesson handcannon!! Be sure to add this movie to your collection. I got the DIRTY HARRY 5 film collection on Bluray !! I recommend this movie as well as the others!!The Dead Pool is a 1988 American action film directed by Buddy Van Horn written by Steve Sharon and starring Clint Eastwood as Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan. It is the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry film series set in San Francisco California.Back in the day Roger Ebert called this final Dirty Harry film the best since the original. I'll take it a step further I think it's the greatest Harry film of all. And he even gets the girl at the end! An awesome end to one of the greatest film series in history...Please just don't let them start remaking these films! I'll have to smother myself! Anyway this movie is great and none I repeat NONE of the Dirty Harry movies are bad they are all great and I love them all. This movie deserves 9 from me. This is my fourth favorite film in the series the last one will be The Enforcer.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was the fifth and last Dirty Harry movie with Clint Eastwood playing the hero again Inspector Harry Callahan cleaning up the streets of San Francisco from all the scumbag criminals. I've always found The Dead Pool to be one of his best in this series.It's entertaining with pretty taut suspense and always fun to go back and see a young Jim Carrey. It's always cool too to watch those little remotecontrol cars with bombs attached go speeding through the streets underneath automobiles. At an hourandahalf there are no dry spots in this film either.The female lead Patricia Clarkson is not one of my favorites. Eastwood seems to like those skinny blonds. Evan Kim playing Harry's new partner Al Quan was a likable guy. Even Harry's slightly more lowkey in this movie his language more tame and he gets in a few comedic zingers as well. Carrey plays a totallydespicable druggedout rock star but he doesn't last long in the film. Carry and Liam Neeson play lowlife people and combine to put some sleaze into the story.Despite the usual lessthancredible action scenes at the end where the villains miss from pointblank range etc. this is still a very entertaining movie and one of my favorites among the Dirty Harry films. Clint went out in style with this film.".

It's not that he is such a great actor but I can't take my eyes off of him when he is in a scene. His face conveys such hysterical expression when he comes out with Swell! or Marvelous! He's irreverent gritty rude shoots criminals in the back beats the sht out of them antagonizes everyone and so what. He gets the job done! I liked everyone in the cast even Patricia Clarkson and her nasal voice. Liam Neeson was great sounding for all the world exactly like Ralph Fiennes. And the music in all five of the series was terrific the best! What a treat!".

Swan has developed a macabre but harmless game called The Dead Pool in which he drew up a list of local celebrities whom he believed would all die in nasty seemingly accidental ways. These include his harshest film critic Molly Fisher Ronnie ClaireEdwards drug addict rockstar Johnny Squares Jim Carrey and Inspector Callahan himself. The demented film buff proceeds to murder the people on the list one by one in horrific ways which correspond to Swan's movies. Callahan finds himself not only tracking down this crased psychotic but also has to contend with various attempts on his life organised by a disgruntled crime boss whom Callahan put away and a new colleague a Chinese American karate expert called Inspector Al Quan Evan C Kim.THE DEAD POOL is Eastwood's fifth and final incarnation as Dirty Harry to date. The series always reworked the seemingly routine premise of Callahan's unorthodox approach to police work his dislike of workplace politics and his relationships with work colleagues. However these are essential characteristics to the series no matter how much our film critics moan about them. A bit like how much the same old smutty seaside postcard humour is valuable to the Carry On films. If the filmmakers abandoned them they would lose out at the box office. THE DEAD POOL in itself has all the characteristics of it's predecessors and the action is plentiful and Eastwood is superb as always in one of his most famous roles. One of the best setpieces involves a car chase through the streets of San Francisco with Callahan and Quan being chased by no other than a radio control car only this is more than a harmless kid's toy it's a bomb! The film is also memorable for featuring future stars Liam Neeson who is excellent as the arrogant filmmaker and Jim Carrey as the illfated rockstar before he went into making those overblown comedies like DUMB AND DUMBER.".

	schema:headline " Rather obvious stuff but fans of Dirty Harry may enjoy the basic formula even if it is only average stuff spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "'Dirty' Harry Callahan has finally brought top mobster Lou Genaro to justice and seen him sent to jail. The side effect of this high profile case is that he has become something of a media favourite  the 'hard nosed cop who brought down the mob'. Sadly Genaro doesn't see it the same way and puts a price on Harry's head attracting all manner of hit men. As a result of this Harry's celebrity status also means he gets involved in 'the dead pool' a game where players list celebs who will they reckon will die by a specified date. An innocent enough game but somebody has gotten hold of one of the player's lists and is killing them off one by one. Of course the main suspect is the player himself  director Peter Swan but Harry suspects it is someone else but can he stay alive long enough to find out who?Watching it now in 2004 I did wonder whether or not Callahan's rather rough form of justice would wash today shooting bad guys in the back etc and in a way I suppose that depends on your own politics but as a film this stands up as well as it did back in the late eighties. Of course this is not saying much because the film was never much cop pardon the pun and even if it had dated badly the effects of time could not be used to explain away an average plot some silly action and a film that is driven by its star's personality rather than anything else. The plot is simple enough but it gets things like Genaro thrown in to pad out running time not to mention a completely unnecessary red herring which continues for about an hour after the audience have worked out that it isn't who the film wants us to think it is. For these reasons a lot of the plot is unengaging never dull of course but you do feel like a lot of stuff was added to make the film run longer or something like that.The action is typically tough and fans of 'Dirty' Harry's hardline approach to criminals judge  jury etc will enjoy this stuff  but one has to wonder why the writers did try harder to integrate some scenes into the main story rather than throwing in the Genaro thing to seemingly create a few shoot outs not to mention a robbery simply to create a few more quips and bad guys for Harry to kill. It all smells of overkill and audience pandering  claims that must surely be put out there whenever you witness Harry murder the unarmed no bullets anyway baddie with a massive harpoon! A car chase through the streets is fun but it needs you to be really into the film if you are going to be able to accept that a chase between a car and some tiny remote control toy.Of course the attraction for most people will be the draw of Eastwood in one of his most famous characters  playing totally on his tough personae all the way. Despite the weak material he is allowed to do his usual stuff and he is enjoyable for that. He is pretty much the main reason to see the film and when he is handing out justice in his own way it is easy to forget that the narrative is all over the place to allow him to do so. Clarkson is OK in a side role but she is used to hammer home a rant about the media's obsession with violence potkettle stuff but she is good enough despite this aspect. Kim is good but underused but still quite fun as Harry's partner. Neeson has nothing to do except be a red herring and his accent is all over the place wandering from English Irish and American. The support cast of goons and tough guys all fall over just as they were required to do but are hardly much good although an early role for Jim Carrey is worth noting.The film is worth seeing and it will please those fans who shudder at the onset of the PC police and Harry does all the stuff we have come to expect from him. However as a film in itself the plot is padded to create 'Dirty Harry' moments outside of the story while the main thread just doesn't really have enough to it to really engage and it is a rather average ending to a series that starting with such a bang.".

I don't normally go for A grade material but the dead pool was made some time ago so now let me get to it. Eastwood plays the role of dirty harry Callahan once more and he plays it very well. Yes he may not be in his prime anymore but he still had it in him to pull off a fifth film. The plot with the film director and the celebrities getting knocked off all over the film was not really original but guess what it was the 1980's and they could get away it. Jim carrey's performance was almost forgettable but every actor has to start somewhere i guess. Liam neeson did an half decent job at the role he was playing and the remote control car scene was really good as well. I will not be holding my breath of a dirty harry 6 cause it will never happen so i will just have to be happy with what has been made.".

	schema:headline " Slightly Aged But Just As Dirty";
	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Pool of 1988 is the final of the Dirty Harry films with Clint Eastwood and it certainly doesn't reach the quality of its predecessors but the old formula of the grouchy supertough nononsense cop still works and Eastwood is great as always in his role of Dirty Harry Callahan whom he plays for the fifth time. This last Dirty Harry flick may not be imaginative. It only readopts the exact scheme of its predecessors. But that's a good thing in my opinion since I love the entire Dirty Harry series and it certainly didn't need a change. In case you have seen the other films you more or less know what to expect. The story isn't too imaginative allthough it's good enough to keep the viewer's attention throughout the movie and the new characters aren't too special either. What really makes this film a joy to watch is once again Dirty Harry Callahan his hate of reporters his disrespect for his superiors his bad temper his ability to shoot a whole bunch of attackers in few seconds and his unbreakable will to 'do what's right' without mercy and regardless of consequences. Dirty Harry is simply THE tough incorruptible cop and The Dead Pool does everything to emphasize this image. Dirty Harry is just as dirty as ever in this film which makes this a real joy for lovers of the series. Even apart from Harry the movie leaves out no clich. Harry's partner in crimefighting who happens to be a ChineseAmerican for example is of course a kung fu expert who has a superstitious Chinese grandfather And these clichs make this movie so fun to watch. The Dead Pool is certainly not one of the great Dirty Harry films my favorite is still the 1971 original Dirty Harry followed by the fourth Eastwood's very own Sudden Impact of 1983 but it definitely is another badass and highly entertaining Harry film that is great fun to watch and that no lover of the previous films can afford to miss. And what would be more entertaining on a quiet evening than to have a beer and watch Insp. Harry Callahan take down three assailants in two seconds and shoot the fourth one in the back when he's trying to flee?  In my opinion nothing is! Highly recommended to all the Calahan fans out there!".

They all have their weak spots but but this one brings new meaning to the word weak. A few examples 1. We know Harry can take on all kinds of bad guys with the six bullets in his Magnum but cmon 2 thugs armed with machine guns? How does lying down at the bottom of a glasswalled exterior elevator protect you from machine gun bullets by the way?2. Can someone really drive a vehicle in a highspeed chase thru SF and yet still be able to handle the controls of a remotecontrol toy car? Back in 1988 did they really have RC cars that could go 60 mph while loaded with an explosive device? What kind of battery powered that thing... plutonium? 3. Would the Mafia chief in the prison really fall for Harry's scam... to the point of hiring bodyguards for Harry? Really??4. Weakest partner ever for Harry... Kim has done some good work in film and TV but he has very little to do here beyond the one obligatory martial arts fight scene. His becoming yet another wounded partner is becoming oldespecially where this time we haven't even had a chance to get to know the guy.5. Harry's bosses griping and complaining about Harry... again becoming very old and tired. Especially when the actors have no personality to speak of. Bring back Leslie Nielson!6. Liam Neeson's character... pure stereotype. Very uninteresting. The villain is a total nullity. Really bad writing here. He's not scary not interesting and not very believable. Compare him to Andrew Robinson in the first DH movie. Wow... talk about contrasts!7. The subtheme about the media exploiting the pain of ordinary people to increase ratings and circulation... gee I doubt this was groundbreaking even back in 1988. The fact that Clarkson is converted to Harry's point of view after getting machinegunned... well at least she catches on quick!8. The final confrontation where Harry harpoons the bad guy... did anyone else LAUGH when Harry comes out with the harpoon gun in his hands? It's a nice twist to have the villain holding Harry's Magnum but really?! Also anyone else notice the ethical problem here Harry kills a man he knows to be unarmed out of bullets and who is offering no resistance. He never did that in the first DH... that was the whole POINT of Do you feel lucky Punk? Even when he shoots Robinson in the football stadium his INTENT isn't to kill an unarmed man it's to coerce information about the poor kidnapped girl out of him. Sure it's extreme but it isn't an execution. IMO this presents a major degradation in Harry's character perhaps betraying a failure in the writer's appreciation of Callahan's ethical mindset. If they wanted the villain dead at the end which makes some sense why not just have him pull another knife out of his pocket and charge Harry?9. Filmed like a onehour TV episode of a show like Cannon or Hawaii 50. Actually I've seen better episodes of ordinary TV dramas than this and I'm sure they cost a LOT less to write and to film.Ultimately it isn't so much that one could reasonably expect Dirty Harry 5 to come close to the quality of the first DH. But one could expect a movie of this significance to be far superior to an ordinary TV drama. Right?Worth watching once if for no other reason than to appreciate how great the first DH is.".

It feels like there is an attempt to show Harry as more of a well rounded individual. This movies marks the turning point where PC started affecting how movie characters were written. At times the conflict between he and the bad guys plays second fiddle to the romantic conflict between Eastwood and his romantic foil Patricia Clarkson who plays gutsy but beautiful reporter Samantha Walker. This duality works really well since its been well established throughout the franchise that Harry absolutely detests journalists. The chemistry between the two is good second only to Eastwood and eventual wife Sandra Locke.Other costars include Jim Carrey who does just an okay job playing a frantic junkie in a performance that is somewhat amateurish its more zanybad than zanygood. Carrey fans though will warm to the first inklings of this immensely talented comic's ability his performance in this movie is a poorly executed version of the zany characters he would later perfect in Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber.Taken fans will likewise be surprised at how young Liam Neeson is in this. Neeson is marginally better than Carrey playing one of the many scuzzbuckets that usually people Dirty Harry's America.This was Dirty Harry's swan song. As is the case with Eastwood's career by this point this movie is lean and mean barely scraping into a 90 minute running time. He learned cinematic economy from legendary crime director Don Siegel. As you move forward through the Dirty Harry franchise you can see this increasing and you can certainly see it in Eastwood's post Dirty Harry directing career Lean and mean just like Clint Eastwood himself. It's not the best Dirty Harry film but there are only five films in the franchise so watch them all but watch this last.".

While Clint Eastwood was getting a bit old for the role he still played it well the other actors were pretty good too. The most memorable scene in the film has to be a rather unusual take on the classic car chase this one is different as Harry is chased by a remote controlled toy car which contains a bomb.While this isn't one of Clint Eastwood's best films I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the early Dirty Harry films and for people for like cop films in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dead Pool is set in San Francisco where crimeboss Lou Janero Anthony Charnota has put a hit out on Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood while dodging attempts on his life  with his new partner Inspector Quan Evan C. Kim Harry has to investigate the death of rock star Johnny Squares Jim Carrey when he is discovered dead in his trailer on the set of a horror film. With help from a local new reporter Samantha Walker Patricia Clarkson Harry discovers the existence of a dead pool a list of celebrities which horror film director Peter Swan Liam Neeson  some of his friends bet on who will die before a certain date. It quickly transpires that someone is systematically going through Peter's list  killing the celebrities off onebyone  Harry learns that his name is on the list which makes him a potential victim...Directed by Buddy Van Horn this was the fifth  to date final Dirty Harry film I haven't seen all of them as yet but I thought The Dead Pool was a pretty good if unspectacular 80's tough cop thriller. The script by Steve Sharon is alright it has a fairly good story that tries something different for the genre although one has to say I felt it had more potential than it ultimately delivered. The idea of a dead pool lottery style bet about celebrities dying could have made for a great film but here the idea is underdeveloped it's never revealed what the point of the dead pool is in the first place. I mean it's seemingly nothing more than a silly bet between a horror director  a few of his friends it's never revealed what the actual prize was meant to be or just how seriously those involved took it  it gets forgotten as the number of murder victims grow. What I'm trying to say is that I never felt there was sufficient reason behind the killings  the climax which reveals it was the work of a lone psychotic was somewhat underwhelming. The Dead Pool also tries to say something relevant about media coverage of crimes  cops this is quite well handled  the point is made effectively enough. The makers could have had a lot of fun with the dead pool  turned this into a gripping thriller as it is it's a decent action thriller that passes the time but ultimately doesn't live long in the memory once it's over.Director Van Horn does alright it moves along at a decent pace there's some good action scenes  shootouts along with an imaginative car chase in which Dirty Harry is chased across San Francisco by a remote controlled car packed with explosives! Harry himself is still a great character  he has everything it took to be an action hero back in the 80's the utter  total contempt for authority the droll oneliners  the need to use excessive  deadly force at all times which he also had during the 70's of course. He has it all he's maybe a bit old but he still holds his own as he blows bad guy's away left right  center. There's some violence  a bit of blood which helps things along nicely.Technically the film is good it has that solid Hollywood big budget feel to it  it's well made especially the car chase. Shot on location in San Francisco despite according to the IMDb the cities residents people with obviously too much time on their hands protesting that 'Dirty' Harry Callahan would be a bad character to represent the city! The acting is OK there are early roles for Liam Neeson  Jim Carrey while the members of Guns N'Roses appear as extras at the funeral of Johnny Squares.The Dead Pool is a solid action thriller it's not the best one ever made but it's far from the worst. Dirty Harry fans should like it  general action fans should too worth a watch if nothing else. This was a sequel to Dirty Harry 1971 Magnum Force 1973 The Enforcer 1976  Sudden Impact 1983.".

With help from a local new reporter Samantha Walker Patricia Clarkson Harry discovers the existence of a dead pool a list of celebrities which horror film director Peter Swan Liam Neeson  some of his friends bet on who will die before a certain date. It quickly transpires that someone is systematically going through Peter's list  killing the celebrities off onebyone  Harry learns that his name is on the list which makes him a potential victim...Directed by Buddy Van Horn this was the fifth  to date final Dirty Harry film I haven't seen all of them as yet but I thought The Dead Pool was a pretty good if unspectacular 80's tough cop thriller. The script by Steve Sharon is alright it has a fairly good story that tries something different for the genre although one has to say I felt it had more potential than it ultimately delivered. The idea of a dead pool lottery style bet about celebrities dying could have made for a great film but here the idea is underdeveloped it's never revealed what the point of the dead pool is in the first place. I mean it's seemingly nothing more than a silly bet between a horror director  a few of his friends it's never revealed what the actual prize was meant to be or just how seriously those involved took it  it gets forgotten as the number of murder victims grow. What I'm trying to say is that I never felt there was sufficient reason behind the killings  the climax which reveals it was the work of a lone psychotic was somewhat underwhelming. The Dead Pool also tries to say something relevant about media coverage of crimes  cops this is quite well handled  the point is made effectively enough. The makers could have had a lot of fun with the dead pool  turned this into a gripping thriller as it is it's a decent action thriller that passes the time but ultimately doesn't live long in the memory once it's over.Director Van Horn does alright it moves along at a decent pace there's some good action scenes  shootouts along with an imaginative car chase in which Dirty Harry is chased across San Francisco by a remote controlled car packed with explosives! Harry himself is still a great character  he has everything it took to be an action hero back in the 80's the utter  total contempt for authority the droll oneliners  the need to use excessive  deadly force at all times which he also had during the 70's of course. He has it all he's maybe a bit old but he still holds his own as he blows bad guy's away left right  center. There's some violence  a bit of blood which helps things along nicely.Technically the film is good it has that solid Hollywood big budget feel to it  it's well made especially the car chase. Shot on location in San Francisco despite according to the IMDb the cities residents people with obviously too much time on their hands protesting that 'Dirty' Harry Callahan would be a bad character to represent the city! The acting is OK there are early roles for Liam Neeson  Jim Carrey while the members of Guns N'Roses appear as extras at the funeral of Johnny Squares.The Dead Pool is a solid action thriller it's not the best one ever made but it's far from the worst. Dirty Harry fans should like it  general action fans should too worth a watch if nothing else. This was a sequel to Dirty Harry 1971 Magnum Force 1973 The Enforcer 1976  Sudden Impact 1983.";

He's ever so slightly anachronistic these days but he is what he is take him or leave him. There is some nice characterisation  Clarkson does a good job as the reporter waking up to her industry's shallow cultural contribution Neeson has fun as the badtempered hack filmmaker with a camp accent somewhere between Ballymena and Dick Van Dyke and Kim is great as Harry's latest hospitalbound partner. As ever with Eastwood's slick Malpaso crew the film looks terrific and stunt expert Van Horn turns in a nifty chase sequence involving a radiocontrolled toy car rigged to explode. The subtext of the film takes some swallowing though  that ghoulish media jackals and gory horror films are to blame for a sick society very rich in a movie with a nonstop litany of violence and popular antiauthoritarianism.

But check out prefamous Liam Neeson and Jim Carrey! I was in 7th grade when I first saw this and remember it was the first time I heard the expression You're sht out of luck. Of course no one has ever said it as great as Eastwood. I miss Dirty Harry. And it's interesting to read the various reviews in this site that criticizes Dirty Harry or even Eastwood because some of the dialogue and actions in the film is so not PC. I remember flipping through the channels and saw Oprah going on about how great Dirty Harry was when Eastwood was on her show. It's unbelievable how PC everybody has to be these days. I had seen all the Dirty Harry films growing up. Since my dad is a big Eastwood fan I bought him the Dirty Harry series on DVD. I started watching them again and I still love them.".

The ghosts aren't very scary nor do we see anything really supernatural but the atmosphere and uneasiness of this film makes for an incredible who done it story as you wonder who will get it. The set is intoxicating inasmuch as you never really see all of it nor is it really explained what such a dangerous pit is doing in such a precarious spot in the basement. Such a matter isn't important. On the other side of the coin the music and the special effects are rather hokey but then when this was in the theaters a lot of the teenagers would have been making out to have really bothered to pick this movie apart. It is only in recent years that movies have turned away from gore and back to movies with style and substance that we appreciate films like this.".

The set is intoxicating inasmuch as you never really see all of it nor is it really explained what such a dangerous pit is doing in such a precarious spot in the basement. Such a matter isn't important. On the other side of the coin the music and the special effects are rather hokey but then when this was in the theaters a lot of the teenagers would have been making out to have really bothered to pick this movie apart. It is only in recent years that movies have turned away from gore and back to movies with style and substance that we appreciate films like this.";

	schema:headline " Vincent Price is outstanding";
	schema:reviewBody "Vincent Price plays Frederick Loren an eccentric millionaire that invites five very different people to a haunted house for a party and offers them 10000 if they can stay the night... This film benefits emphatically from the presence of the legendary Vincent Price. As usual Price gives a commanding performance and completely steals every scene he's in. Price is undoubtedly the star of the show but he's not the only star in the show Elisha Cook in particular gives excellent support playing the wimpy owner of the house much the same character that he played in the Kubrick masterpiece 'The Killing'. The rest of the cast is largely made up of unknowns and bgrade actors but they also all perform to relatively high standards in their respective roles.House on Haunted Hill's best feature other than the legendary Vincent Price is undoubtedly the atmosphere of the house. Throughout the movie there is an abundant sense of dread that is perpetually present and it serves the film well in that it brings the house to life at every point in the movie the audience is made to believe that there is something unseen in the house that will cause bad things to happen and this is obviously exactly what a haunted house film needs. The film is very creepy in that way. That's not to say that this film is without its flaws at times the plot meanders and as the film only has a 75 minute running time that's not good. It can also become a little dull at times as there isn't always a lot going on. This is however somewhat combated by the acting performances and defined characters as they usually manage to keep it at least interesting if not enthralling throughout. House on Haunted Hill is topped off by a brilliant double twist and it is also given certain originality by that also although the twists do beg the question of whether or not the film has an appropriate title. The walking skeleton is hilarious though and worth watching film for alone.Overall House on Haunted Hill is a lovely little b movie it's creative it's atmospheric and it stars Vincent Price. Highly recommended viewing especially for horror fans. Definitely not recommended for anyone though is the dire 1999 remake of this film and the equally appalling remake of William Castle's other ghost story '13 Ghosts'.".

This version is better than the newer one mainly because Vincent Price is so good here much better than anyone in the new version made in 1999.  It is also relatively short and goes by quickly.  This movie has some of the same plot elements of the one from 1999 but thankfully the ending to this one is a lot better.  I really enjoyed it as I was hoping the one character would come out on top.  This one is about a party being held in an old house that is supposed to be haunted.  The people were invited by Price's character and offered 10000 dollars if they were to stay the entire night. There is tension between Price's character and his wife there is a girl who is very nervous and wants to leave immediately and then there is the doctor who does not believe in ghosts.  There are three others as well who are invited to stay the night.  During the night strange things happen as one of the guests is murdered and there seems to be supernatural things happening.  A very well done movie that for me ended perfectly.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Castle liked to promote his films with gimmicks and the gimmick for THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL was EmergO at the peak of the action a glowing skeleton emerged from the screen and flew out over the audience on a wire. By most accounts EmergO caused more laughter than chills but fortunately Castle never relied on gimmicks alone he also liked bona fide stars and for HAUNTED HILL his star of choice was none other than the legendary horror star Vincent Price.Like most Castle films HAUNTED HILL's plot reworks a wellworn theme. Millionaire Price and his wife Carol Ohmart give a haunted house party for five strangers chosen at random and promised ten thousand dollars if they last the night. The catch the doors lock at midnight after which there is no escape until the caretakers return in the morning. While the story itself doesn't hold many surprises the script is unexpectedly witty and Price plays it in a slightly prissy very highcamp manner with a tremendous dose of the black humor for which he was so famousand the littleknown Carol Ohmart is every bit his match snapping out memorable lines Darling the only ghoul in the house is you! in every scene. Together they elevate the film well above what you might otherwise expect and when combined with the largely wooden supporting cast and some of the silliest thisissupposedtoscareyou effects imaginable the result is a cult classic with plenty of camp appeal.In addition to Price and Ohmart the film is also surprisingly atmospheric. Shot in and around one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more famous structures the grainy late show look of the film due more to accident and age than deliberate intent is very entertaining the cinematic devices everything from disembodied heads irises and jumpcuts are very appealing and the sound track which sounds like a mix of piano bass keyes synthesizer and soprano vocals is exactly what you'd want for this obvious but extremely entertaining flick. Of all the Castle films THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is my personal favorite and it should rate very high with fans of cult camp and Vincent Price. And I'll go further than that of all his memorable appearances I do believe this was among Price's best. A great choice for both family movie night or a sophisticated Halloween howlvery recommended!

Of course there can be mixed settings a film about Dracula may take you to the Transylvanian outdoors to streets or graveyards as well as into the castle or mansion or whatever. But one way horror movies can be categorized is by whether most or all of the film is within a residence or not.  Bearing this in mind I think something special about horror films is having the victims enclosed inside a mansion or home with escape difficult or impossible and terrorized by anything one can imagine  moving furniture metamorphosing paintings spooks in the attic odd remnants lights on and off  as part of the buildup for a real or expected attack by a person or whatever.  The terror suspense is believing someone or something is or may be there but where and when will it strike?  The Shining Die! Die! My Darling Beyond the Door Behind Locked Doors The Haunting.   Although claustrophobia might generally be a negative for me in a movie such as Rear Window unlike most people I do not really like it in horror movies it is great it makes the day.  If one looks at things this way House on Haunted Hill can be seen as the quintessential horror film.Start with having Vincent Price in it hopefully no arguments there.  He plays Frederick Loren the affluent host of a party in which he invites five people not including himself and his wife to a haunted mansion on a hill in a challenge for each person to win 10000 at today's value about 100000 if that person stays in the mansion all night.  Among the five are Watson Pritchard Elisha Cook Jr. an alcoholic whose endemically spooked countenance sets the tone for what everyone is getting into.  Frightface or not he bears an eerie? resemblance to evangelist Pat Robertson whether or not he is actually as scary.  Altho Pritchard owns the house he has spent little time in it but he is nevertheless the expert on the circumstances surrounding seven deaths including that of his brother on the premises over many years.  Quickly the other four get the message they may be facing trouble.  And trouble begins quickly.  Part of the idea is that there is no escape out of the mansion after midnight when the caretakers leave and barricades ensure this.   Price's wife Annabelle is played by Carol Ohmart.  She is striking blond gorgeous with very fair skin.  In several scenes that I will not specify her lightness is artfully contrasted against surrounding darkness by Director William Castle  very beautiful no special effects needed. Price has a jealous rage toward her and she in turn wants to get rid of him as she has tried to do in the past.  What will happen tonight? Of the other four characters the two with the stronger presences in the first half are Lance Schroeder Richard Long a handsome pilot and Nora Manning Carolyn Craig a pretty typist for one of Loren's companies and the early lead screamer.  The other two are newspaper writer Ruth Bridgers Julie Mitchum who has a gambling problem and Dr. David Trent Alan Marshal a psychiatrist interested in the subject of scared people.  A plot twist brings one of these latter two to greater prominence in the second half.The creaky doors the body parts the unexplained incidents all do their part in a movie in which black  white is such an essential.  The black  white cements the atmosphere we need for the house mansion  from a distance from a closeup at the start of the movie and then inside the mansion everywhere.  For those who profess love for Casablanca and cry sacrilege when they see the colored version I say OK the true version to me is the original but the colorized version is just the colorized version what's wrong with watching it too?  The movie still works in color doesn't it even if it is preferable in black  white?  To me anyway.  But as to House on Haunted Hill  even if I similarly would not cry sacrilege to a colorized version I ask can you think of any other movie in which black  while is so essential in which a colorized version would lose so much?  Maybe you can but I can't.Loren with his ulterior motives has a smug rather commanding aura knowing that each of the five needs the 10000.  There can be skeletons in people's closets yes.  And as Loren's plans are threatened with derailment keep this in mind.".

However we grow up and even camp value only goes so far and this thing can only survive on the very dregs of camp. Absolutely everything that occurs is laughably implausible andor comically overdone in particular Nora's sighting of the old lady ghost in the basement. This is a movie that sees no need to explain why if this 'ghost' was really just the very unattractive caretaker's wife as we see later on she felt the need to hiss and hold out her hands in a ghostlike fashion while inexplicably in an empty cellar room. And by the way float and not walk. There's a lot more. Best moments Richard Long plopping the severed head on a living room table and Vincent Price reeling in the skeleton he used to scare his wife to death a skeleton maneuvered by huge ropes somehow not visible earlier. Oh whatever happened to Mystery Science Theater 3000??? This film was made for them.".

Here are a few of its more noticeable liberties  and note that I don't call them goofs. That would suggest that director William Castle and scriptwriter Robb White gave a tinker's cuss about whether it all made sense or not...1 The title  neither the house nor the hill is haunted. 2 Exterior and interior matching  the house is a boldly modernist design by Frank Lloyd Wright apparently but all the fittings and furnishings are junkshop Victoriana. 3 How come a house built in the 1930s isn't wired for electricity? 4 And if it isn't what magic power controls the timelocked outer doors and gates? 5 Why does the script stipulate the lack of electricity anyway? It doesn't have any plot significance at all. 6 In a story with only seven characters three of them have no function in the plot  and one of them hardly gets to say a word. 7 How come years after someone was murdered in it that hole in the cellar floor is still full of acid? Poor housekeeping? 8 Ever tried making a rope coil up by pushing it from one end? 9 If noone could get out of the house how did villainess Carol Ohmart manage to appear outside Carolyn Craig's bedroom window? 10 Floating at least one storey off the ground at that? 11 How did Vincent Price's wife know he would invite her lover whom he shows no sign of having met before to the party? 12 And how did Price know about their fiendishly complicated plot to bump him off in time to construct a still more fiendishly complicated plot of his own? 13 Both of these plots  just to be picky  require the unwitting cooperation of another guest whom none of the three principals has ever met before the party ... 14 ... and one of them requires a hysterical girl who's never handled a gun before to shoot a man dead quite spontaneously and purely out of fright. Is her real name Annie Oakley? 15 How does the scary old housekeeper pull that glideacrossthefloor stunt? Does that long black dress conceal a unicycle? 16 And if the butler wanted to encourage Carolyn Craig to get out of the house was there no way less oblique then menacing her from around a door with a rubber werewolf mitt? 17 And then he locks her and everyone else inside the house anyway... 18 Another murder method I wouldn't care to rely on scaring someone with a plastic skeleton and hoping she won't notice it's moving on ropes you could use to dock an aircraft carrier but run away from it  backwards  into that convenient vat of acid. There should have been a preparatory line in the script about how she'd lost her glasses like Velma in Scooby Doo. 19 And another one laying the foundations for the same scene making casual mention of Price's prowess as an amateur ventriloquist. 20 Why couldn't Price  a millionaire industrialist  just have shot the guilty couple out of hand and hired a good lawyer? Well I'm glad he didn't because that wouldn't have made half as delightful a film. House on Haunted Hill isn't the way it is through ineptitude nor is it a spoof nor is it a pioneering postmodernist essay in the sobadit'sgood aesthetic. It's just a piece of strictly functional disarmingly honest filmmaking that goes beyond mere unpretentiousness to deliberate disregard for craft professionalism and sense  because it knows it doesn't need them. William Castle cuts to the chase and doesn't care how he gets there. His audience didn't care either. Like me though probably in a different way they were too busy having fun.".

It's far better than the remake though. What you get is a wellmade shocker which is still by the numbers but what sets it out from the rest is energetic performances throughout the feature which it highly benefited from the daunting exterior of the haunted house and the real hammy LOW budget effects that don't hamper but add more to the charm and fun. But most of Castle's films are rather out there in context and more remembered for the gimmicks and tricks and this one is no exception. This case a skeleton was used to move above the audience's heads while watching the film in the cinema. Some of its weakness is more in the screenplay when there are many unexplained moments sometimesdodgy dialogue one of us is guilty and the rest of us is innocent and the story's outcome felt rather sudden and lacklustre leaving me rather unsatisfied. I was hoping for more ghoulish fun! Vincent Price turns in a superb and deviously suave performance. Most of his dialogue is priceless! The rest were topnotch although female lead Nora became a real pain listening to her screams. The bw cinematography fits exquisitely in capturing a rather eerie feel and the house's spooky features and bone rattling score also provide to the atmosphere. But don't be expecting anything particularly frightening as I found the suppose shocks 99 more hilarious than scary. Although I said the dialogue was sometimes dodgy but it had its gripping moments that builds on the buzz of the plot. Anyhow you can't go wrong when a thunderstorm pops up in the film you just know things can't get any better! This is a film that doesn't rely on special effects like the cough remake which was special effects overload but actually on the performances and also throw in some nicely added black humour.Overall a lot of good will equals good campy fun!".

As I remember it I fidgeted in my chair giggled uncontrollably and never for a minute took my eyes off the TV.The plot for House on Haunted Hill is kind of ingenious but it's also kind of absurd. There are a few holes in it and by that I mean HOLES... but the atmospherics are great and the witty nuanced dialogue is head and shoulders above what horror fans are accustomed to.At the center of course is your host Vincent Price at his sly elegant best. Price said of William Castle He wasn't a great filmmaker but he knew how to make this kind of film. His respect for the material shows and he nails the part of the mysterious morally ambiguous Fredrick Loren with every word that comes out of his mouth. His final soliloquay at the denouement is delivered with all the care that actors usually reserve for Shakespeare. Obviously he's having a great time.Of course some gorehounds and younger viewers aren't going to get this. There are not many special effects no monsters and the severed heads look phoney. The House on Haunted Hill is tame by today's standards but it holds up well for its atmosphere and wit. Sophisticated and silly at once.Other highlights include Carole Ohmart as Fredrick's wife Annibelle Elisha Cook as Watson Pritchard the halfmad halfvisionary owner of the house and some terrific theme music.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a very prolific career directing Bmovies and serials of genres such as Western and Crime films director William Castle entered the rejuvenated horror genre in 1958 with Macabre a murder mystery that maybe would not be as well remembered if it hadn't started what would become Castle's trademark for the following years the horror gimmick. Castle's horror movies would become wellknown for the innovative tricks it used to scare the audiences however his next film House on Haunted Hill showed not only an improved gimmick but also a huge improvement in terms of the overall quality of the film. William Castle had found his style and House on Haunted Hill was only the beginning.The story of House on Haunted Hill is at its core a new twist to the old Dark House kind of Gothic horror tales that had existed since the literary origins of the genre. Vincent Price is Frederick Loren an eccentric multimillionaire that decides to give a horrorthemed party for his wife Annabelle Carol Ohmart in a very bizarre way. The strange party consist of inviting 5 strangers to an allegedly haunted house where many murders have taken place and to reward them with 10000 if they manage to survive the night. As the challenge begins strange events begin to happen and soon everyone wonders if there may be some true in the legend of the House on Haunted Hill.Written by Robb White the story may be clichd but it's filled with excellent black comedy and has some very clever twists that give the film its very special charm. To expect a terrifying horror experience is to watch the film with the wrong attitude as House on Haunted Hill moves more on the lines of subtle dark comedy with a dose of campy fun instead of graphic horror. Despite this tone the film plays very good with the mystery that represents the House and the murders and the ending still is one of the best surprises on film.William Castle directs this film following the conventions of the Gothic horror to the letter but even when may had been a businessman first he still was an artist and shows off a very clever use of the camera to create mood an atmosphere. Castle was a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock and it shows as Castle's visual style in House on Haunted Hill owes a lot to Hitchcock's inventive use of the camera to tell a story The master of suspense would return the favor a year later with his very own bmovie Psycho. Castle's elegant camerawork contrasts with the dark campy humor of the story giving the film its distinct tone favored by the classic performances of Vincent Price and Elisha Cook.The legendary Vincent Price who delivers an unforgettable performance with his enormous presence that makes his intentionally campy delivery even more enjoyable. Elisha Cook Jr. plays one of the guests at the party Watson Pritchard and his scenestealing performance almost overshadows Price's not an easy feat to accomplish. The surprise comes from Carol Ohmart who plays Annabelle Loren being a worthy counterpart to Price's character as his character's gorgeous but treacherous wife. The rest of the cast is somewhat effective with Carolyn Craig and Richard Long playing the heroes of the story with good results although some other members of the cast are pretty average when compared to the previously mentioned actors.The biggest mistake one can make when watching House on Haunted Hill is to expect a frightfest as this is not a movie to watch for the scares as they play along the camp humor the film has but to enjoy with its witty written black comedy and the excellent deliver of the cast. While Castle's use of atmosphere and his camerawork do give the chills it's never with the intention to actually scare but simply to add to the tension and suspense the story has. I would recommend to watch the 1999 remake as it follows the same basic plot but with no intentions to amuse as it is a fullfledged horror film. Along with this movie it makes a nice contrast as it's always fun to check two VERY different ways to tell the same story.House on Haunted Hill may look dated now but it still packs the chills and the fun as if it had been released yesterday. One can only wonder about how it was to watch the film on the big screen and with Castle's gimmick at its peak but still it is a nice experience for a dark rainy night. Vincent Price and Elisha Cook's performance worth the ticket. 810".

Compared with most of their collaborations in the 80s this is a diamond in the rough and quite an offkilter oldfashion adventure  mystery story that sets out to be intriguing and creates a nice feel of the times than anything relying on Bronson handing out nasty punishment. Well on that point the violence when it does eventuate is surprisingly brutal if quick and too the point. When it happens it comes from nowhere. However Bronson is given a chance to spread his wings and act with confidence and stalwart appeal. It's a terrifically surly downplayed performance by Chuck in a suitable heroine role. Working off Bronson is a tremendously solid cast. Jason Robards' is subtly powerful in a fine turn and Fernando Rey's sly style always amuses. Dominique Sanda displays a potently classy presence. The support cast rounding it off are just as good with Simon Mac Corkindale Dennis Millar Clifton James and Camilla Sparv.Looming from the presentation is a filmnoir tone and I don't really get the 'Casablanca' references from it being a ripoff to an unfunny spoof made about it. There's no denying it's rather talky though but the script is involving and smartly weaved together. This works due to the screenplay having a busy if muddled plot and still keeping a breezy almost brooding air to it. Some contrived and convenient actions occur and the drama can seem a little uncertain. But it never becomes a worry. Also how they used the breathtakingly erotic Mexican backdrop in the action was accordingly staged and wellframed. Talk about nice sight seeing. The swirling widescreen camerawork had that ability to capture that organic sense of place although the underwater shots came off terribly murky. Thompson's direction is undoubtedly workmanlike slow and effective on a much larger scale despite the dreary look to its visual styling. Jerry Goldsmith's rousing melancholic score is pictureperfect. Everything boils up to an thrilling climax as the calmness makes way for a stormy literally confrontations of two men who share something in common but how they go about things are entirely different. They have a past they like to forget and this is their chance for that to happen and put away that lingering fear of something catching up.One of Bronson's interestingly obscure oddities which unjustly flopped and deserves an audience.p.s I would love to see a good DVD print of this film because the grainy VHS copy I rented doesn't do it any justice.".

The deluxe hilltop mansion the thatched hotelbar that Bronson's character runs palapas lined up at the water's edge a barebones dingy police office and so forth you can't ask for a more convincing backdrop for this tale of international skullduggery.Caboblanco also gets points for Bronson's spoton portrayal of an expate living in Mexico because he probably can't go home the complex and riveting performance by Fernando Rey and for filling out the cast with several supporting players in a nonlinear presentation. There is a denouement at the end but the film's mood and pacing are not obvious in working to that conclusion. In other words Caboblanco succeeds in making a viewer feel heshe is eavesdropping on lives in progress.Admittedly this is a piece of entertainment but it strives for something more and it is NOT an imitation of Casablanca by a long shot.My one complaint is that the great Gilbert Roland was not used to more advantage.".

The deluxe hilltop mansion the thatched hotelbar that Bronson's character runs palapas lined up at the water's edge a barebones dingy police office and so forth you can't ask for a more convincing backdrop for this tale of international skullduggery.Caboblanco also gets points for Bronson's spoton portrayal of an expate living in Mexico because he probably can't go home the complex and riveting performance by Fernando Rey and for filling out the cast with several supporting players in a nonlinear presentation. There is a denouement at the end but the film's mood and pacing are not obvious in working to that conclusion. In other words Caboblanco succeeds in making a viewer feel heshe is eavesdropping on lives in progress.Admittedly this is a piece of entertainment but it strives for something more and it is NOT an imitation of Casablanca by a long shot.My one complaint is that the great Gilbert Roland was not used to more advantage.";

There are only a few movies where Bronson puts down the gun and turns up his acting charm. Throughout out the 80s he starred in a huge bunch of Cannon PopcornActioners. They where just mindless and fun comic book thrillers. Caboblanco is one of the few Bronson suspense films where he gives an allstar performance. He doesn't need to be in an action film to give a solid performance. His scenes with Dominique Sanda are a joy and fun to watch and his scenes with Robards the greatest in the film.Like any good movie it did have it's flaws. Caboblanco has been labeled as an action film and a remake of Casablanca. I highly disagree with both. It's more of a suspensedrama. The plot was a little boring and some scenes are just that. Of coarse it's not a real Bronson movie without some violence so there are a few action scenes placed nicely in the film. He throws quite a few punches and handles a gun here and there. But like I said earlier it's not about the action in this movie. There are a few DVD copies on the net so if your a hardcore BronsonRobardsThompson fan I recommend you check this out. Although there are a few boring scenes it's a well made suspensedrama with a great cast. Scenes with Bronson and Robards are the best if the film! They make a great team. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Caboblanco is not a bad movie but you can easily divide its strengths and weaknesses. Fernando Rey and Jason Robards are the strongest actors. They both deliver great performances as they usually do. Charles Bronson does a solid job too. I think that he is often underrated as an actor because of the decent quality of most of his movies. J. Lee Thompson directs this one in classy oldschoolmanner that could have produced a far better movie in case the script would have been above average which it is not. The cinematography the photography and the choice of locations are truly first rate. And J. Lee Thompson had the spirit and the feel of a director. He was born to do what he did.Most of the supporting actors are pretty cool as well. But Dominique Sanda was a miscast. Her wooden and strangely impersonal acting did confuse me from the very beginning. She seems to be completely lost in nearly every scene and any suggestions of mystery to her character are not convincing at all. The chemistry between her and Cliff Charles Bronson doesn't work out at all and that's a pity because everything else and everybody else seem so carefully chosen.But the main point to criticize is the script. It delivers some nice ideas but too many loose ends and open questions. Why do scuba divers let the submarine explode that obvious though they must have known that the wreck was not the one everybody's looking for? Why did they kill the fisherman who was diving for oysters for centuries? How come that Cliff was perfectly placed to rescue him when the British agent Lewis was trying to escape through the jungle? These plot holes do not fit to an excellent script which only could lead to an excellent movie. It's a pity because Caboblanco already got many fine ingredients competent actors a perfect score by Jerry Goldsmith marvelous locations and a stunning cinematography! In the end it's only a decent action flick worth watching once for fans of Charles Bronson andor J. Lee Thompson.It's interesting to realize that the theatrical version of Caboblanco shown in Argentina is 15 minutes ! longer than the one we watch nowadays in the US or Europe on DVD. My whole impression of the movie might have been influenced by the fact that it was heavily cut which seems to be possible as soon I think of those plot holes I already mentioned. I think it's necessary to get that uncut 102 minute print to be published as soon as possible.Last but not least Do not forget to check out the perfect BronsonThompson collaboration Murphy's Law 1986 which is the most underrated Bmovie of the decade.".

Yes he did films in Europe like Love and Bullits and there is a brief sequence in Naples of the superior 'The Mechanic.' But due to casting it has a feel of a European movie the most since Someone Behind the Door'. Of course the film does take place in Peru and was filmed in Mexicao but certainly the participation of the film with Dominique Sanda Fernando Rey and Camilla Spav certainly gives the film that feel. Also it is only the other time that Bronson worked with Jason Robards Once Upon a Time in The West this time as a villain.It is also perhaps the most romantic film that Bronson has done and all though he was 58 when he did the film he looks the younger than he had ever looked since his role as Jeff in 'Violent City'.It is also a curious puzzle in Bronson's career as it did not get much theatrical play in the US if at all. Why this is has never been explained. On first viewing it is an entertaining film at least I was when I first saw it in 86 on video. Perhaps one of the problems also was that it was short at 87 minutes and Bronson's popularity was on decline though sadly the Cannon films with Death Wish II and 10 to Midnight with its incredible violence would shoot Bronson back up to big box office status.It would be I believe the last time we would see Bronson without a shirt on. Perhaps he might have been having trouble keeping that athletic looking body that he had less than 20 years later he would need a hip replacement.' In fact in the film he is seen that way from the back as he walks away from camera it is almost as if he is saying through this scene you won't see me with my shirt off again.This is a fun movie to watch also if you are a person who likes to see a lot of naked women you won't be disappointed. Though I don't recommend it for that.The film does have its flaws though The song 'The Very Thought Of You gets played to many times that it becomes a clich. Also the climax and some of the scenes before that are so contrived and silly. I would also suggest that it is condescending to some of the supposedly native Peruvians though this might harkin back to the days of the 40 American movies which have some scenes which begin in black and white. However if you think about it the ending shot is ironic and can make one think. The narration does add a veneer of sophistication to the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Cabo Blanco 1980  out of 4 Peru 1948 is the setting for this adventure film about a group of criminals living in Cabo Blanco. A bar owner Charles Bronson finds himself caught up in a mystery dealing with missing gold which includes a beautiful woman Dominique Sanda searching for her husband a Nazi war criminal Jason Robards and a crooked police chief Fernando Rey.CABO BLANCO is often laughed at because it's considered a ripoff of CASABLANCA. While this film does borrow heavily from that classic picture the overall movie isn't nearly as bad as its reputation. At the same time I really have to scratch my head as to why the producers would call the film CABO BLANCO because with that title you just know people were going to compare it to a much better film. It didn't really matter how this movie turned out the odds of it being better than that Humphrey Bogart classic was very slim so why put your film in a bad position from the word go? As for the film itself it's slight entertainment although there's no question that there are plenty of flaws throughout. I think the biggest problem is the actual screenplay which has way too much story and at times it gets rather bogged down in dialogue. The story itself could have been more interesting had there simply not be so many characters talking about so many different things. I know the film had some production issues so perhaps this might explain some of this but at just 87 minutes it seems like there's way too much story here than is needed.The film has some terrific visuals and especially if you view the film in its original 2.351 ratio. The locations are certainly beautiful and adds a lot to the story. The performances really aren't that bad either. Robards is entertaining as always and I thought Rey was extremely good in the role of the police chief. I thought Sanda made for a good femme fetale as well. As for Bronson this isn't his typical tough guy role. This character is a lot more of a normal person so to speak and I thought the actor did a fine job with it.CABO BLANCO also suffers from some weird issues in regards to content. There's really no profanity and the violence is never too graphic or brutal. These elements are certain PG worthy yet there is all sorts of nudity that pushes it pass the family friendly rating. I'm not sure why they added on the nudity but nothing else but oh well. In the end CABO BLANCO is neither good nor bad but just pointless.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cabo Blanco 1980  out of 4 Peru 1948 is the setting for this adventure film about a group of criminals living in Cabo Blanco. A bar owner Charles Bronson finds himself caught up in a mystery dealing with missing gold which includes a beautiful woman Dominique Sanda searching for her husband a Nazi war criminal Jason Robards and a crooked police chief Fernando Rey.CABO BLANCO is often laughed at because it's considered a ripoff of CASABLANCA. While this film does borrow heavily from that classic picture the overall movie isn't nearly as bad as its reputation. At the same time I really have to scratch my head as to why the producers would call the film CABO BLANCO because with that title you just know people were going to compare it to a much better film. It didn't really matter how this movie turned out the odds of it being better than that Humphrey Bogart classic was very slim so why put your film in a bad position from the word go? As for the film itself it's slight entertainment although there's no question that there are plenty of flaws throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "The third collaboration between star Charles Bronson and veteran British director J Lee Thompson is like its predecessor The White Buffalo a strange beast but this time the collaboration doesn't quite manage produce something interesting. An allstar caper set in South America after the close of World War Two Capo Blanco shows a disparate group of International adventurers going after what turns out to be a hoard of treasure looted by the Nazis during the war. The image of Capo Blanco as a melting pot of various International chancers gives the place in image as well as name a nod to Casablanca. The expatriot American protagonist Giff Bronson runs a bar in town just like Rick in the classic and the supporting characters echo figures who once listened to the You must remember this refrain  an ultimately good but morally compromised police chief Fernando Rey doing Claude Rains a wicked Nazi Jason Robards for Conrad Veidt and a mysterious beautiful woman with Paris in her past Dominique Sanda standing for Ingrid Bergman. There is an awkwardness to the film as if Thompson is unsure as to whether this is an homage or a pastiche.Thompson in his later years especially was a filmmaker whose worldview was riddled with misanthropy. Here he tries to take what Wilde might have termed a bank holiday from cynicism as he confesses in a short Making of documentary filmed during the shoot where he identifies the postwar setting as an era of romanticism an age when things seemed to have a drive and excitement of their own when values were considered to be important and the feeling that the hero in the end should triumph and that you could root for good against bad. We've lost a lot of that as indeed we should do in the modern cinema. But that is occasionally something which should occasionally appear on the screens when we're making a film today. Cabo Blanco is an exercise in nostalgia but it is exercising muscles in Thompson which had longsince wasted away. For the most part Cabo Blanco a tired film. The story is told without any real effort at audience engagement. Most of the excellent cast are on autopilot. Yet this is the logical consequence of its nostalgic romanticism.The denouement a long and not very wellpaced scene in Giff's bar sees the moral of the film being played out yet it is as if the figures are animated waxworks reenacting scenes from a no longer living past. The police chief who has up until now assisted the Nazi in the search for the treasure learns that it is loot from Churches synagogues death camps and so jumps ship joining the good guys. He regains in Giff's words his soul. The film dramatises a moment when the postwar allies had the moral high ground and where their rectitude could persuade others that they were indeed the good guys. This is a legend now as the film selfconsciously admits in a series of mythologising voiceovers and Thompson can only repeat it parrot it. The plot selfconsciously involves a parrot's memory. It as if the myth were preserved in aspic no longer a living thing. The epilogue over which the voice over tells us that the legend  grew and grew and Cabo Blanco prospered shows Giff with a swanky house on a hill with the girl living the good life. A good life built of the legend that he is a good guy.Yet Giff as his backstory tells us is a murderer. And as a murderer he himself is on the run from gas chambers not in Nazi Germany but in the good old USA. Even when making a piece of supposedly romantic nostalgia Thompson cannot help but let his cynicism seep out.".

All the 5 of them have performed well and a special mention to the lead of the pack  Navin Pauly. I truly believe that Navin would have many fruitful years ahead. Direction  music by famous duo Vineeth Sreenivasan  Shan Rahman respectively is above average and I must say that both has a promising future ahead!. Performances by Nedumudi Venu  Janardhanan were strong and we even have our superstar Sreenivasan in a cameo appearance!. Overall I found the movie very touching and as a nice entertainer. Just go for it!".

Somehow audiences and critics are getting more demanding and expect brainier and tighter story lines but it's still plenty of fun to see a light crazy ride like this... One where the hero is besieged by unfortunate circumstances and must one way or another succeed or die. With the help of Haggis' strong direction and a very good performance by Crow we're treated to two hours of action where one doesn't have to do a lot of thinking just watching Crowe dodge bullet after bullet and cheer him along to the nailbiting end.The main reason the film works is Crowe gives it his best scene after scene his eyes tells us his character is committed to his family and he will stand by them no matter what. There is very little background given to us except for an opening scene which serves the purpose of planting the seed of doubt in our minds but this only helps fuel the sense of despair and sadness that threatens to destroy this family.Little by little we follow Crowe's teacher as he races against the clock to help his wife and soon enough he is dealing with the scum of society and an increasingly suspicious police force. Relationships with his family are tense at best and any new relationships are threatened his wife's past. It's the attention to this intimate and personal moments that makes us care for him even when he makes a couple of disturbing moves.One thing you won't be is bored as the circle tightens so that his quest might not get his desired results. Fine work is done by a cast that includes Brian Dennehy Liam Nelson and Jsson Beghe. This is what movies are made for.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Next Three Days The best films are those where you are introduced to characters who do the unpredictable believably or people you think will be key players die in the opening scene someone you least expect turns out to be the murderer these are the films that keep you guessing and keep you involved. In Paul Haggis' intense thriller he chooses a wise and well crafted angle to lure you in and hold your attention. The development of John Brennan and his gradual transformation over time before your very eyes.Meet John Brennan he's a normal average working man slightly nerdy even living a fairly dull routine life. When his wife is imprisoned for murder John as you would expect of a normal average slightly nerdy working man follows the rules of appeal in an attempt to win her freedom. Three years pass and the realisation that his wife will remain behind bars for life hits home. When normal people find themselves in hopeless situations desperation can drive them to do very abnormal things. What Haggis works brilliantly into both his screenplay and direction is the gradual metamorphosis of Brennan's persona as he becomes fixated on breaking his wife out of prison. Brennan doesn't suddenly become the all American action hero capable of great feats of courage. We have a knowledge of his character from the beginning of the film and Haggis does not treat the audience as idiots we know that Brennan cannot walk into a phonebox and there's a sudden change into superman. This would not work for John Brennan the nerdy schoolteacher what we see however is how little by little piece by piece he falls more and more out of control deeper and deeper out of his depth. We know this is not the normal behaviour of Brennan but the screenplay is so well crafted and Crowe delivers the character to us perfectly that both the scenarios and Brennan remain at all times believable. He makes tremendous mistakes and shows real human failings and frailties that as we ride along with him we're never far from the belief that it will all go very wrong very soon. Haggis treats us to a wonderfully woven story that rolls along with ease then suddenly the momentum builds into a Tsunami of real tension. Brennan is completely exposed and you fear for his outcome. If a director can pull you into the story make you care about a character and if during the course of that film allow you to watch that character change in a very real and gradual way then he has delivered a truly great film.Haggis' screenplay does not allow the audience to get ahead of the story. Developments are unexpected and plausible scenarios affect action and reaction. Some events have no bearing on the outcome but you cannot know which are red herrings and which are genuine avenues rather you find yourself wondering where this will all lead to making The Next Three Days a complex and intriguing thriller very much in the cerebral and classical sense such as North by Northwest or Vertigo. A tremendous faultless film.1010".

So strong is his performance that I this movie could easily be retitled The Pursuit without misleading the audience.

What I can say is that this movie was deftly directed with a perfect pacing that smoothly shifts through each gear from 1 to full throttle. It starts off with the necessary slow exposition transitioning to a heartfelt family crisis drama and crime thriller with the tension slowly cranking up to a breakneck speed when I was literally holding my breath in the compelling edge of the seat finale.What I admire most about this film is the smooth kinetic flow from scene to scene. There didn't seem to be any implausible leap in logic apart from maybe towards the end but everything just connects together so well. All of the actors were superb in their roles. As for Russel Crowe well I can't think of many actors who expresses wordless undying love better than he can. He is simply a master of it and you just cant help root for him even if he makes or contemplates morally wrong decisions. His character is beautifully played with all the invulnerability weaknesses and stubborn obsession he possesses.The supporting actors were all excellent in the little screen time that they each get. And there is even a brilliant cameo by a well known Irish actor shant spoil who it is for you that sparked up the screen briefly in an instrumental role to the plot. The great Brian Denhhey also has a few minutes on screen time as Crowes father hardly uttering a word but you just know exactly what is going on in his mind and it is absolutely touching. So in summary this is a top thriller with an exhilarating edge of the seat 3rd act enriched by beautifully touching moments and thick underlying subtext of undying love.".

Great acting from Russell Crowe and the story is very smart and gripping. Not as predictable as some films seem to be when using a similar storyline to this. Very entertaining all the way through from start to finish with no gaps which is always good for a film that exceeds 2 hours in duration. A very different performance from Crowe which we don't offer see but be played it very well and very powerful. Definitely a must watch. Don't wait around for this one I would strive to watch it straight away for those that haven't done so yet.".

Audiences are then treated to a taut and thrilling attempt by John to free his wife out of prison and reunite the family which includes their young son Luke Ty Simpkins.The Next Three Days is a better than average thrill ride filled with equal moments of edgeofyourseat action and true emotion that spurs the entire cast. Crowe quickly makes us forget that Robin Hood stole our box office money earlier this year and turns in a toprate performance as the husband who must become a criminal himself in an attempt to pull off the impossible. The supporting cast which includes a nonglamorous Banks and small but memorable turns by Daniel Stern and Brian Dennehy help bridge the quieter moments of the 2 hour film.As John maps out his intricate plan he is met with obstacles that force him to revise his original course of action to supplement for the unforeseen complications. His attempts at securing financing and proper papers Drivers License Passport take the majority of the film's running time and helps provide insight into the transformation of John's character that goes from college professor to cold blooded killer.When John does launch his intentions The Next Three Days soars as an exciting chase throughout the Pittsburgh streets and sidewalks as a group lead by Lt.

Surprisingly not complicating our support is the idea that Laura may indeed be guilty of the crime to which she was convicted.The ever twisting screenplay shows Haggis' knack for writing scripts that don't allow audiences to get too far ahead of the story developments as unexpected and plausible scenarios affect even the best laid out of plans. This may leave lesser minded cinephiles wondering why certain scenes were not left on the cutting room floor a DVD chapters worth of making a specific key for example but for those engrossed in the ongoing struggle of John's pursuit should appreciate the occasional red herring.The sum of the above leaves The Next Three Days as on par or better than Ben Affleck's wellreceived The Town earlier this fall.

The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' toogoodtobetrue wholesome sunny good looks are well used. The Next Three Days reminded me of Hitchcock and of 1993's The Fugitive but it doesn't rise to that level of classic. Rather it's a welloiled machine designed efficiently to crank out the audience's engagement tension and release.There are a couple of especially good moments. The opening scene could have been satisfactory if all it did was to set the stage for what is to follow but it does so much more. I'd love to watch that scene again and again. A women with a plunging neckline spars with Lara a more modestly dressed woman about whether or not women can ever get over their competition over men and bond with each other. The scene demonstrates its contents Ms. Dcolletage uses double entendres to make a pass at Lara's husband and Lara shows the audience she is quite capable of losing her temper an important plot point. The brilliant writing in this scene is a bonus. There is a scene involving a sewer drain that economically resolves a question the audience has had for some time. A scene with a car door is similarly powerful and informative. Brian Dennehy's performance as an intimacyimpaired working class dad is almost wordless and quite brilliant.

	schema:reviewBody "In The Next Three Days we get to see Russell Crowe in a film that actually takes place in today's world. It's a departure from his better known films that take place in the past such as Gladiator Master and Commander and Robin Hood. Even his other films have usually taken place over 50 years ago like Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind. So it's nice to finally see him play a person of modern times that we can relate to  and he excels at it.Similar to the film Conviction released last month which was about a woman who did whatever it took to get her brother released from prison Crowe plays a man named John Brennan who will stop at nothing to get his wife out of prison. But in this film he's not out to do it through the legal system. He has lost all faith in that he decides he's going to break her out of prison himself. Of course he believes his wife is innocent and doesn't even question her on the matter. He continues to raise their son on his own yet at the same time plots out every single detail it would take to pull off such an arduous task. He even seeks out a man who wrote a book detailing the multiple times he managed to escape from prison himself. The man is played by Liam Neeson in somewhat of a onescene cameo. But that scene lays the groundwork for how John devises his plan and becomes convinced that he is capable of succeeding. He learns that not one detail can be overlooked.John goes from being a schoolteacher to a guy who carries a gun and makes deals in shady neighborhoods to get the tools that he needs. Still he watches over his son and takes him to the local playground to be the good father that he is while not doing illegal activity. It just shows how good of a man he really is but that he is willing to resort to anything in order to free his wife. The movie becomes a real thriller one of the best I've seen in a while. It's the kind of film where you find yourself really rooting for the main character and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as well. Though it may seem a little unrealistic to pull off such a scheme in real life Russell Crowe plays John with enough determination and conscientiousness to make you believe that anything can be done if you try hard enough.".

Though it may seem a little unrealistic to pull off such a scheme in real life Russell Crowe plays John with enough determination and conscientiousness to make you believe that anything can be done if you try hard enough.";

Fundamentally the film's doing nothing wrong pacing the story appropriately and generating the right degree of tension and suspense in the right doses. The trouble is it plays out in exactly the same manner and style as the original and there's nothing you see in this that you couldn't see in the original. And why should you let the Hollywood cookie cutter machine dazzle you with it's glitzy lights when foreign independent cinema could offer you something much more original and inspired? ".

His depiction of John Brennan is very good. A man in the middle of a real mess of a life The movie moves fast so before you know it the nitty gritty reality of the situation is in effect very soon. It doesn't lag at all. Showing at a little over 2 hours The Next three Days doesn't rest in showing the full blown restlessness of the Two main character's development. Which shows the talent from Crowe and actually more so in Elizabeth Banks. Who really stole the movie. Her scenes are short and sweet. Yet the range of emotion you see from her generates real mystery and sincerity. Sitting front row center I never really miss much in a Picture. I sat patiently grinding my teeth with eyes bulging from the strong real magnetic draw I felt in this movie. Sipping the bitter sweet HIc Pink lemonade which was how the Movie felt as well.I never like to give anything away in any of my reviews. Just the reactions I had felt watching it. It's hard to concentrate when let's say someone won't stop coughing is on their cell phone or better yet has a digital watch going off every 15 minutes clockwork. In the end I don't feel I really missed anything watching this. It is hard for a short attention span to really waver from this one. If I had it my way the Surroud sound would be as loud as possible but Hey .. you can't win them all. Anyway I come to understand that Paul Haggis The writer and Director Sure knows how to Create a honest true to life motion picture. Getting older I can now sympathize more so with the plot and true to life situation. I don't know why the people who work for the LionsGate or whoever is responsible for the release date chose to put it out the same day as the new Harry Potter was released. Unless your Christopher Nolan Spielbeg or maybe James Cameron you just can't match up. Nonetheless it is a extremely tense and thrilling movie on it's own. Liam Neleson was fantastic as usual It would have been nice to give him a couple extra scenes since his part of this film is a real strong spark which get's the film on the ground and running. Olivia Wilde Made her mark as a good friend and model neighbor so she was quite important in this one. Lastly Ty Simpkins he did well too as the Son who naive to world was yet very favorable to what he wants and knows is right. Once again I extract these things from the film as I see them trying not to give anything away.All in all highly recommended. See it twice and call me in the morning. Good work all around I don't what it takes out of Russell Crowe to make a movie like this and be in a real honest form seemingly on the verge of a nervous break the entire time. I really felt for the man. And I think you will too. So go out and see this movie. I guess after Harry Potter but I had seen it before.".

	schema:reviewBody "Consider yourself an every day type of person? If you're married how well do you really know your spouse? Beyond every shadow of any doubt? And just far would you go to save herhim from a gross miscarriage of justice after every legal recourse has failed? Could you forsake all of your worldly possessions? Would you be willing to leave behind your one and only old child a six year old as part of the price of freedom? Willing to risk being shot on sight? What about always wondering if law enforcement is going to kick down your door in the middle of the night? Going on the run requires money and money always runs out when on the run.Can you live with all of that? If you can't...All of the above fueled the well received 2008 French crime thriller Anything for Her the directorial debut of screenwriter Fred Cavay. Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days is the American remake trading ParisEurope for PittsburghNorth America  and Cavay is very pleased by all of that.Three years. That's the time interval over which Russell Crowe's sheepish straight arrow community college English lit professor John Brennan has to reckon with his wife Lara's Elizabeth Banks sudden arrest and quick conviction for the brutal parking lot murder of her boss. In the absence of new evidence every viable avenue of appeal is now exhausted. The pace of the film in this section is deliberately slow like a wet fuse that threatens to quit with every sputter provoking the patience of some audience members in the same way that these three years have worn down John Lara and their six year old son Luke.Three weeks. Facing life in prison without possibility of parole Lara attempts suicide. Failing that she chides John for never once having asked her if she committed the crime strongly implying that his steadfast belief in her innocence is wrong. It's a startling hardboiled moment. John rocks Lara to the verge of tears with a fiercely gentle insistence that he knows her far better than that. Then he calmly promises her that the rest of her life won't be spent in prison. John means it and that ignites a second measured fuse of searching plotting tinkering and flailing to get her out by any means necessary.Three days. Seventytwo hours notice is given that Lara is to be moved out of county lockup to a remote state prison. All of John's sitespecific preparations to spring Lara are about to go up in smoke.

	onyx:emotionText "Consider yourself an every day type of person? If you're married how well do you really know your spouse? Beyond every shadow of any doubt? And just far would you go to save herhim from a gross miscarriage of justice after every legal recourse has failed? Could you forsake all of your worldly possessions? Would you be willing to leave behind your one and only old child a six year old as part of the price of freedom? Willing to risk being shot on sight? What about always wondering if law enforcement is going to kick down your door in the middle of the night? Going on the run requires money and money always runs out when on the run.Can you live with all of that? If you can't...All of the above fueled the well received 2008 French crime thriller Anything for Her the directorial debut of screenwriter Fred Cavay. Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days is the American remake trading ParisEurope for PittsburghNorth America  and Cavay is very pleased by all of that.Three years. That's the time interval over which Russell Crowe's sheepish straight arrow community college English lit professor John Brennan has to reckon with his wife Lara's Elizabeth Banks sudden arrest and quick conviction for the brutal parking lot murder of her boss. In the absence of new evidence every viable avenue of appeal is now exhausted. The pace of the film in this section is deliberately slow like a wet fuse that threatens to quit with every sputter provoking the patience of some audience members in the same way that these three years have worn down John Lara and their six year old son Luke.Three weeks. Facing life in prison without possibility of parole Lara attempts suicide. Failing that she chides John for never once having asked her if she committed the crime strongly implying that his steadfast belief in her innocence is wrong. It's a startling hardboiled moment. John rocks Lara to the verge of tears with a fiercely gentle insistence that he knows her far better than that. Then he calmly promises her that the rest of her life won't be spent in prison. John means it and that ignites a second measured fuse of searching plotting tinkering and flailing to get her out by any means necessary.Three days. Seventytwo hours notice is given that Lara is to be moved out of county lockup to a remote state prison. All of John's sitespecific preparations to spring Lara are about to go up in smoke.

They are not convincing as a couple and it's impossible to look at her and figure out why Crowe's character would do all that he does.

The premise sees a school teacher try and break his wife out of prison and reunite his family. Now this movie only works because of the fantastic performance from russel crowe. He is a truly damaged character who just wants to have his family and his old life back and he will do anything to get it. You root for him but at the same time realise that maybe he is going to far. Elizabeth banks was good as his wife and there was allot of intrigue about the character and their chemistry worked for me. The kid was also pretty good in this movie. There are quite a few characters in this movie that are pointless and unnecessary such as the cops crowes parents and Olivia Wilde's character that dragged down the film. I like the premise of the story it is really interesting and I also really like the character development that crowe has. But like I said before there are just too many pointless filler plot threads in this movie and also I think the ending could have been done in a better way. The script wasn't that interesting at all with the dialogue being the main weakness of the film and also some things that characters do comes across as illogical. The style was really cool I loved the suspense in the film and the action scenes that happened were really cool too. Overall this is a decent movie but I don't really care to see it again.".

	schema:headline " A delightful adaptation packed with excellent dialogue and even better performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the few movies I really wanted to see but missed at this year's past Toronto International Film Festival Barney's Version is the one that I regretted the most. It was one of the few shining examples of Canadian film on display at the festival and was anchored by the fact that it was based off the critically acclaimed final novel by Canadian literary icon Mordecai Richler but apparently I was not the only one aiming to see it. And after seeing the final film nearly five months later I can see why.Barney Paul Giamatti is an aging television producer divorced and comforted only by his cigars and rash drinking habits. As a new book is released detailing some sordid details of an event Barney would rather forget he starts to look back on his life and all the many mistakes he made. And after three failed marriages many may not be the apt word to describe them.I had read Barney's Version as a forced assignment in my final year of high school and never finished it cover to cover. It was dense lengthy rambled for pages on end and just did not feel satisfyingly cohesive. It was punctuated throughout with hilarity tragedy and sorrow but never wallowed in it. You could practically smell the detail of the characters wafting off each page. And as the title suggests it was the story of Barney's life as told by Barney. It was a somewhat enjoyable book but having almost failed the assignment my memories of it are rather tarnished.To my delight this is not how the movie feels at all.As opposed to a literal page to screen translation Michael Konyves has instead whittled and simplified the narrative down to the basics. He changes updates and moves a few things around and loses others completely. While this may outrage some fans of the book it makes the film all the easier to digest. It never gets lost in what it is trying to say and never falls into any of the densely boring traps the novel set out for itself. The odd and intimate details of each character are still here more so from the principal cast than the supporting players as is the snappy and hilarious dialogue. And for the entire running time the film stays in Richler's unique voice never straying into unknown or lesser territory in any instance. For someone who has previously worked mainly in television this is an excellent achievement and one that makes me look forward to Konyves future projects.As a Canadian myself it pains me to note that the majority of films I see are of foreign creation. So it was with great surprise that Barney's Version a Canadian film looked and felt just as good as any film coming out of the likes of the United States. The sweeping decadeslong set design costumes makeup and soundtrack are all handled excellently as well. The little quips about Montreal and Canadian life are great as are the small blinkandyou'llmissthem cameos by some of the country's most famous auteurs. And unlike so many Canadianmade films Barney's Version stays true to the nation of its birth but never force feeds Canadiana down the audience's throats. This of course is a small quip that may not be noticed in the slightest by most audiences. But it is one that should be duly noted for all future Canadian productions nonetheless.As Barney Giamatti is stunning and perfect as always. He is one of the most talented and underrated character actors of his generation and he continues to prove his worth and excellence here. Barney's life is an emotional rollercoaster and Giamatti gives his all to make the audience really feel for this pathetic misguided adolescent shell of a man. It reminded me a lot of his work in Sideways and is likely his strongest work to date. No matter what emotion or word he is trying to convey you will hang on every sound and look. He just keeps getting better with each new year each new role. This is not quite the inspired brilliance of Colin Firth in The King's Speech or the emotional powerhouse of James Franco in 127 Hours but it is yet another example of how criminally overlooked he is come award season.The rest of the cast is fairly solid no matter their screen time. Rachelle Lefevre Minnie Driver and especially Rosamund Pike are all excellent as Barney's wives as is Scott Speedman as his best friend Boogie. But they are all overshadowed by Dustin Hoffman in the role of Barney's father Izzy. He steals the show from just about everyone providing more gusto and depth than he has in years. And it does not hurt that he has the most hilariously devastating moment in the entire film.If I have to hold anything against the film at all it is in the fact that it loses its momentum much too soon. The entire first half of the film almost feels like whiplash from how fastpaced it moves along. But once the second half comes and the emotional weight of the movie kicks into gear it slows down a bit too hard. It never becomes boring and never drags its heels like the book does but it just lacks the power and finesse of everything that comes before it. The zest and drive of the film are always there but with how much has been altered and changed to make the film more accessible to audiences I think they could have done a bit more to keep the film going for its entire 132minute running time.Barney's Version is a revelation of a film packed with a great story excellent dialogue and even better performances. This is one of the unsung best films of the year and one that has and will continue to be criminally overlooked.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Ordinarily a film with Rosamund Pike and Bruce Greenwood in key roles would be sufficient for me to stay home and watch The Nature Channel. However Paul Giamatti and Dustin Hoffman as son and father in a story based on Mordecai Richler's novel was motivation enough for me to buck up and give this one a shot. And what a pleasant surprise this film is.Giamatti has mastered the role of cynical selfabsorbed frumpy schlub and his Barney is every bit that. The story is told through extended flashbacks after we learn a detective has written a book accusing Barney of killing his best friend Scott Speedman. No charges were brought and it's not until the end in an extremely creative reveal that we understand what really happened that day at the lake. Unfortunately we aren't sure if Barney ever understands but that's a whole different topic.Barney's first marriage comes about because his girlfriend gets pregnant. This one ends in tragedy and betrayal and allows Barney to spend much of his life on the path of cynicism alcoholism and cigarchainsmoking. He is no pretty sight  from inside or out. He stumbles into his second marriage this one to Minnie Driver. Ms. Driver is wonderful as the Jewish princess with a Master's Degree. How do we know? She continually reminds us of both facts. Ever known anyone that just constantly reminds you of how smart they are? How this marriage ends leads to the whole suspicion of murder and loss of best friend for Barney.The real key to the story occurs at the wedding. Instead of worshiping his new bride Barney watches hockey does shots with his Dad Dustin Hoffman and experiences love at first sight ... not with his bride but with a guest played by Rosamund Pike. This encounter puts Barney on a singular mission of winning over Ms. Pike despite his marriage to Driver. Can't really give anything away here other than the story is very clever in how it handles the pursuit failed marriage and subsequent true love story.Only thing is Barney never really gets what true love is. Pike has a wonderful scene where she explains that life and love are in the seconds the minutes the routines. Barney nods but is clearly in over his head in so many ways.What I really appreciate about this story is how there are so many relationships that seem to spring from reality ... people we know in situations we've been in. The title of course refers to Barney's version of reality. How he sees things. We could each replace his name with ours for a movie on our life. Do we see reality or is reality how we interpret these seconds minutes routines? The answer seems pretty clear.The film is directed by Richard J. Lewis not the comedian but is really a product of the amazing story and talented cast led by the extraordinary performance of Giamatti. Dustin Hoffman's scenes are all excellent and his real life son Jake plays his grandson in the film. Don't miss the quick scenes featuring standout directors Atom Egoyan David Cronenberg and Ted Kotcheff. It's also character actor extraordinare Maury Chaykin's final film. And I certainly can't omit mention of the fabulous soundtrack featuring TRex JJ Cale Donovan and others. Leonard Cohen's I'm Your Man plays over the closing credits so don't leave early!".

This one ends in tragedy and betrayal and allows Barney to spend much of his life on the path of cynicism alcoholism and cigarchainsmoking. He is no pretty sight  from inside or out. He stumbles into his second marriage this one to Minnie Driver. Ms. Driver is wonderful as the Jewish princess with a Master's Degree. How do we know? She continually reminds us of both facts. Ever known anyone that just constantly reminds you of how smart they are? How this marriage ends leads to the whole suspicion of murder and loss of best friend for Barney.The real key to the story occurs at the wedding. Instead of worshiping his new bride Barney watches hockey does shots with his Dad Dustin Hoffman and experiences love at first sight ... not with his bride but with a guest played by Rosamund Pike. This encounter puts Barney on a singular mission of winning over Ms. Pike despite his marriage to Driver. Can't really give anything away here other than the story is very clever in how it handles the pursuit failed marriage and subsequent true love story.Only thing is Barney never really gets what true love is. Pike has a wonderful scene where she explains that life and love are in the seconds the minutes the routines. Barney nods but is clearly in over his head in so many ways.What I really appreciate about this story is how there are so many relationships that seem to spring from reality ... people we know in situations we've been in. The title of course refers to Barney's version of reality. How he sees things. We could each replace his name with ours for a movie on our life. Do we see reality or is reality how we interpret these seconds minutes routines? The answer seems pretty clear.The film is directed by Richard J. Lewis not the comedian but is really a product of the amazing story and talented cast led by the extraordinary performance of Giamatti. Dustin Hoffman's scenes are all excellent and his real life son Jake plays his grandson in the film. Don't miss the quick scenes featuring standout directors Atom Egoyan David Cronenberg and Ted Kotcheff. It's also character actor extraordinare Maury Chaykin's final film. And I certainly can't omit mention of the fabulous soundtrack featuring TRex JJ Cale Donovan and others. Leonard Cohen's I'm Your Man plays over the closing credits so don't leave early!";

The best scene in the movie is a buff Scott Speedman stripping down to his underwear to go snorkeling. Dustin Hoffman is funny as heck. His son is also in the movie and is quite good.

We know these people...some of them are in our family some are friends or perhaps live next door. To be sure there is a Jewish aspect to the individuals and story it's pretty hard to divorce that aspect from anything Richler has written but all the issues are universal. If Woody Allen had done this movie there would have been endless navel gazing and the characters would have been more 2dimensional just a mind game I played since the characters and the themes are similar to those that The Woodman deals with.At any rate this is a brilliantly constructed examination of a life that is enjoyable and entertaining also a great movie to see and have dinner afterwards so all those who saw it with you could discussa lot of meat for that. But if it's not on a big screen within 30 miles of you it will play very well on the small screen in a few months but certainly go out of your way to see it.".

	schema:headline " Barney's Version";
	schema:reviewBody "Barney's Version is based upon the novel of the same name by Mordecai Richler. The film spans several decades showing us the life of a man named Barney Panofsky. The film does not hold back Barney's flaws as he is very foul mouthed speaks his mind whether you want him to or not drinks smokes cigars and a lot of the time is an ego centric jerk. However during the years we see Barney change in some ways as he meets different women in his life and deals with family and friends as well as humour and tragedy that everybody can say would happen in their life and has. The trailers for Barney's Version or at least the ones that I have seen being played on the television make the film look like a raucous comedy when really it couldn't be any farther from the truth or what is really at the heart of the film. There is a great deal of comedy in this film as we laugh together with Barney and his antics and sometimes laugh right at him for his unsophisticated and ignorant ways. However as I said above we do get to see many different sides of Barney as the film goes along and after awhile I stopped thinking that this character is full of himself and kind of a jerk. Instead I realized and I think the point of the writing and the film itself was to present him as a normal human being with some very good points and also some very obvious flaws or things they need to work on which in a sense I think describes just about anybody you can think of. By giving Barney a human side and allowing us the viewer to care for him in moments even when we don't want to I feel it really enhances the film and our relationship with him and the other characters while watching it. I love when films do not just present characters as one dimensional and having no real flaws or struggles and they just fit every perfect Hollywood hero out there. I find that when they do that it is so unbelievable and it is harder to like care or be interested in the characters because of this. I am so glad that Barney's Version took the opposite route. By not only caring for Barney in the film we get to care about his family and the circumstances that will either be the most joyous in his life or the most heartbreaking and we are there every minute of it and it will keep us fascinated concerned and move us sometimes into laughter and at other times close to tears. This film is a real powerfully emotional film. Yes there is the comedy aspect but it goes so beyond that by showing the inevitable difficulties we will all end up facing in life and I think because it is done so strongly here it makes us reflect on our own lives and the choices we have made so far no matter how old or young you are and whether those choices have been good or just the opposite. The writing of the characters and what makes them so human is one of the film's strongest points because they all have wonderfully different personalities and are all a joy to watch as we watch their lives unfold before us. The acting is also wonderful here especially by Paul Giamatti who plays Barney in what I would call one of the best male performances of 2010. He embodies the role so perfectly and we can see the emotion the hurt the humour and everything coming out of this brilliant performance. The supporting actors and actresses are all very good here as well. I was so pleased at what an involving film this was. It took me away from my own world and thoughts and put me instead into Barney's world and made me laugh cry and reflect with them and what a wonderful experience that was. Barney's Version is not only entertaining but also deeply human and full of humour and tragedy that will both touch our hearts and leave us with what I think is a wonderful and insightful night out at the movies. Barney's Version is one of the best films of 2010 and I hope both American and Canadian audiences will embrace it and go out to see this wonderful gem.".

	schema:headline " Sunk by an inconsistent script and some poor casting";
	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERSFirst off I love much of Mordecai Richler's work. Duddy Kravitz is an incredible book and one of my fav films. I have no problem with the unlovable effedup flawed heroes he favors. But Barney was to my mind a mess. First the good Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor. Here I think he did a good job but didn't quite sing in the role. He captures the title character's self loathing but the role really goes anywhere nor does he really capture a lot of the pain he inflicts on others in the way that Richard Dreyfuss did with Duddy. I think the character is meant to have a lustiness and earthiness which Giamatti doesn't quite connect with. Of everyone Dustin Hoffman comes off best as Barney's crass working class Jewish cop dad. Minnie Driver another actress I truly love is okay but gives a highly caricatured performance in this film. For a professional woman in the film she never really connects with her character's intelligence and instead plays her as a JAP stereotype. Nor is the pain at her being duped ever become terribly real. But to me the film really crashes with the Rosamund Pike casting and character. I thought she was not only flat in the role but the character's motivations and actions so implausible that it sunk the film. Here she is a highly educated woman acutely aware of how her father's cheating negatively impacted her mother's life. She meets a guy at his own wedding who starts coming on to her almost immediately. He courts her even though she knows he's married. She agrees to meet him days after he's divorced. He shows up drunk and vomits in the restaurant. How does she react to this? She gets involved with him almost immediately. It's absurd. Nor do I believe for one second that his continued boorish behavior wouldn't send her packing post haste given her own family situation. I thought Pike had several scenes where she's so flat I truly have no great interest seeing her again I didn't think she was especially good in Pride and Prejudice either. Scott Speedman as Boogie seems like another miscasting. The character is supposed to be a hometown Montreal Jew and Speedman has none of the crazy recklessness the character which supposedly drives the character. He just looks like a soap opera actor gone to seed.Then the movie piles on the pathos toward the end. My father had Alzheimer's so this is a highly personal issue to me. And even given that this rushed section of the film just seemed like audience manipulation instead of a real examination of a failing parent Another Canadian film 'Away From Her' did such an amazing job with that subject. In the book Richler evidently uses the Alzheimer's as a framing mechanism and how the disease comments on his life... Barney's VERSION of his life. The film does nothing with that and instead uses the condition as a way of getting sympathy for an altogether unlovable character. A mess. A mess with a few good performances and scenes which could have been much better.".

The film is part murder mystery love story and lastly a memoir of a Jewish Canandian television producer unlikable but never predictable. Paul Giametti gave an Oscar worthy performance as this complex character. He actually makes you care about Barney. Rosamind Pike as Barney's third wife is wonderful as is Minnie Driver as the overbearing Jewish 2nd wife. Dustin Hoffman is Barney's dad and he captures the qualities of an earthy retired cup from the touch neighbors of Montreal. Scott Speedman does a wonderful job as Barney's drug addict best friend. 'Barney's Version' is based on the novel by Mordecai Richler. a very famous Jewish novelist. To see our full review please go to Two Jews On Film. We give this film a high bagel rating".

The film tells us he wears his heart on his sleeve but I don't see it. And the Jewish stereotypes in the movie are just silly and repulsive. Minnie Driver who seems to disappear whenever she has to hide her native British accent does such a terrible carbon copy of a Jewish Princess that it was hard to watch. Meanwhile there's hardly anyone worth rooting for in the film and it's really a stretch to see why all these women are attracted to Barney. Barney's one redeeming quality would seem to have been his reliability for his writer friend but the film suddenly and somewhat inexplicably blows up that friendship and escalates the sudden conflict with some needless brutality. The film seems to be a lot about how drinking excessively can lead to one bad decision after another. It never seems like what Barney does comes from some need he can communicate to us it's just the alcohol talking. Finally it's true that Hoffman is good in the filmbut that's hardly enough to make it worth seeing.I was incredibly disappointed in this movie.".

Giamatti plays the central character an alleged babe magnet who manages to pull and marry 3 good looking women. Giamatti is so unappealing and this is one of the central flaws of the movie. ie no one believes the character Giamatti creates is in the slightest bit interesting or appealing and this character is the same character he plays in almost every movie he's done and I for one don't need to see him do it again. The saving grace of this movie is Rosamund Pike. She is fantastic and highly believable as the infatuation of love at first sight. Smart and sexy we can never believe she'd fall for Giamatti's salivating dog act. Most of the rest of the movie is OK. Good cinematography locations and supporting cast and performances but fatally flawed to average by a central miscasting. Giamatti's character is a TV producer and we get to see him as an object of desire to attractive women while being a cigar slobbering drunk a myth I'm sure badly aging slobbering drunk movie makers want to perpetuate too.".

The acting is excellent the dialog is sharp you have Minnie Driver and Rosamund Pike to look at but in the end you just don't care.So it is pretty obvious why Panofsky Paul Giamatti wants to be with the 2nd Mrs. P Minnie Driver and Miriam Grant Rosamund Pike they are beautiful lively women. It is not at all clear why they want to be with him and not just because Panofsky is nothing to look at. Panofsky has no redeeming qualities.Furthermore the movie blurb says Panofsky is impulsive irascible and fearlessly blunt. Put another way he is unfeeling moody and obtuse. As for the fearless part you never believe he is any real danger of anything. For example when it looks like he killed his friend you never get a sense of dread that he might be going to jail. Therefore the fearlessness is meaningless.Listen you could do worse than look at Rosamund Pike for an hour Minnie Driver has much too little screen time or you could go get a cup of coffee instead.".

Or perhaps the popularity of the original novel by Mordecai Richler or the need people have to reassure themselves that their lives is not as bad as they are thinking. Whatever the reasons this movie has been very successful. This viewer found it offputting.Barney Panofsky Paul Giamatti is a cynical selfabsorbed frumpy schlub of an aging television producer divorced and comforted only by his cigars and rash drinking habits. As a new book is released detailing some sordid details of an event Barney would rather forget he starts to look back on his life and all the many mistakes he made. And after three failed marriages many may not be the apt word to describe them.The story is told through a series of flashbacks after we learn a detective has written a book accusing Barney of killing his best friend Boogie Scott Speedman. Barney's life s a mess his first marriage happened because of his getting a tacky girlfriend pregnant a marriage that ends being drowned in alcohol and cynicism and self pity. His second marriage is to a Jewish princess Minnie Driver whose mouth never closes. At the marriage ceremony Barney drinks with his father Dustin Hoffman watches games on TV and finally spies the one true love of his life  Miriam Rosamund Pike  and this woman has a head on her shoulders. Barney is hopelessly in love immediately a fact that Miriam attempts to dissuade. But the tale goes on the truth about the 'murder' is unbound and Barney has the love of his life as his wife etc etc etc. If that kind of sad sack story with a predictable ending satisfies then this is a film that will manage to do just that.

That's what we come at when a bunch of guys that have a lot of money and happen to be born inside the industry's impregnable gates hold the right to film their silly stories. Really a very embarrassing waste of time. And the biggest let down from the great Giamatti by the way a real miscast here what? a Giamatti character marrying three beautiful women and despising them?? and having sex on the side with another bimbo?? You kidding me???... Paul next time choose more wisely your fans don't deserve such garbage. A complete disaster.Finally... you know what's worst of all??...

	schema:reviewBody "Barney is and old and lonely man. A new book is coming out that highlights certain details he wishes to keep secret. He reflects on his life and falling in love on his wedding day...with another woman. Barney's Version is a Canadian film that feels American. I can't really describe it any other way it feels like an American film mostly because it's not a documentary or directed by Paul Gross. That alone gets points in my book are we as a country finally getting things right in the movie making business? A little late if you ask me. Aside from the fact that it's Canadian it's a really well made film. Paul Giamatti gives yet another terrific performance. One to add to an already impressive list. It's a shame the guy has never earned an Oscar. This role could have easily been nominated and I rank it among his best work. He has a lot of help from the supporting cast though. Dustin Hoffman plays his father again a great role for such a character actor. Rosamund Pike and Minnie Driver are two ladies that Barney marries. Pike is given a bit more to do than Driver but both are memorable. Scott Speedman a guy more known for his looks than his acting plays Barney's best friend and has a key role in a bit of drama that circulates Barney's life. The film is loaded with small cameos from famous Canadians the aforementioned Paul Gross has a small bit Atom Egoyan Mark Camacho and David Cronenberg. Film fanatics or Canadians who know their movies will pick up on these things. They might also notice that while the film is Canadian it never tries to force that fact on us. With most Canadian productions you must have a certain amount of Canadian content. One glance at the film One Week can testify to this. While there are bits and pieces that are definitely Canadian it never feels forced. This is mostly why the film feels American at times. Barney's Version is a great film that details the life of one troubled man who has everything and loses it. It's depressing at times and it hit home with a few topics that most people can relate to Alzheimer's's. The film feels accomplished. It's well written and directed as I mentioned earlier the acting is superb. I can easily recommend this to anyone looking for a film with a great story and great performances.".

His character Barney seems to be some kind of sexaholic and we follow him as he flits uncontrollably from one woman to another to another. Luckily the women are fairly awful people as well so you don't have to feel sorry for them either. As other people have pointed out it's a hell of a stretch to imagine any of those women being interested in him in reality so that kind of makes the film ridiculous from the getgo. It's clear he's a selfish slave to his compulsions but without any exploration as to why or any struggle to control it it seems a pointless meandering around a stranger's love life. I didn't see the point. I felt no real connection with him so when bad things happened to him I simply didn't care  in fact it's one of the rare occasions where I was cheering for the other guys instead. It tries to go all loveydovey and sentimental in a couple of places but it doesn't work because we've already witnessed him or his lovers being unconscionable tarts in the rest of the film. There were some good actors good locations and good elements for a story here but the story didn't do it justice. I think they could've used the turn of events towards the end to much better effect to lift the film out of the doldrums but instead it was wasted. A thoroughly pointless film as far as I'm concerned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually KHorror will provide a lot of tension or many shocks in the movie but this movie has neither.The theme of the story is old but it is a horror movie so you can work on it. Apparently the writer were writing the story lying in bed or the director was constant drunk before the set. They try to be Blair witch project but they are far from it.There were no tension the actors were inexperienced and some of these kind of movie at least provide some eye candies. Well the eye candy were dead after 15 minutes 3 minutes that they were actually filming her.The killing does not make any sense. Every death should not happen in that way. In my opinion after they know how to deal with the threat everyone of them should be alive... There were minimal of actions but they prolong it too much. I actually beg them to kill each quicker because they kept talking to themselves during the action scene.I never regret about watching the movie it was a time killer anyway. I ended up playing Diablo 3 during the movie I fill my own actions for the movie. I would not recommend it to anyone else unless you have two TV and watch two different movies at the same time. Yeah I am crazy like that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story takes place in the woods where five friends go there to have some fun. It is nice it is sunny and the woods seem so bright and welcoming. In the woods they knock down some pile of rocks which are wish  prayers I think and there are hints that they might have something to do with the story but they are nowhere mentioned so I might be mistaken. Although the director seems to be pretty persistent about them but still there is no mention to why they seem to be important in the story because the camera persistently points at them but at the same time they don't seem to have anything to do with the story! Confused about that part really.The characters are indifferent. The story is weird it has potentials though. The problem is with the plot which is very very slow. VERY slow. But it was faster than some other movies that I have seen so I didn't mind that much. I didn't get the whole wood and blood part and why did blood which was spilled on the ground turned them to  something zombies???? I really don't know what they were sorry So the story had holes and the explanations during the movie helped a lot but there are some holes left. For example if those things ????zombies???? come after you why the fourth woman was hiding in the car and why they didn't see her from the beginning why didn't she chase that other guy who was their searching for her all this time. Because their main goal seems to be killing whoever is alive so?????And really what is going on with the rocks???? Does anybody know????".

The Council of Ministers wants to punish some Hungarian rebels but Emperor Franz Joseph gives all the rebels amnesty including their leader Count Andrassy. The Emperor is influenced by his wife who says that you cannot win a country with force only with love. The Hungarians are deeply affected by Sissi's love for their country and want to crown Franz Joseph and Sissi to King and Queen of Hungary. At a big ball for the Hungarians the Emperor's mother Archduchess Sophie insults Count Andrassy by refusing to greet him. Sissi rescues the situation by asking Count Andrassy to dance with her. Sissi gives birth to a daughter but her happiness is broken when Archduchess Sophie decides to nourish the baby herself and takes it away from its mother. Sissi runs away to her family in Bavaria.

	schema:headline " Second part of Sissi with a profound message!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I see this part it seems to me that Ernst Marischka wanted to show Sissi as a gentle woman who is exposed to the hardship of royal life. In spite of the fact that the film is full of sweet images like other parts which may seem to some people out of date it has a certain message conveyed.In fact this part's content is built upon two issues politics and the family life in imperial palace. Sissi as a young empress has to get used to the lifestyle in the palace. She finds it difficult especially due to the attitude of her mother in law archduchess Sophie. The problems grow when Sissi gives birth to her daughter and the baby is taken from her. Sophie thinks that Sissi is too young to be a good mother. She has to choose be an empress and forget about mother's feelings or escape from the golden cage...Another interesting fact about the movie is the political situation of Hungary. Sissi loves this nation and aims at uniting it with Austria. Obstacles however are huge. Nevertheless she does not give in and in the long run her goals are achieved.I loved the scene when she thinks of leaving Vienna due to family problems but the Hungarians are waiting for the meeting. She decides to take part in it. Here Marischka shows the price she had to pay. The duty of an empress is more important than the family the beloved baby and personal happiness. As her mother Ludovika says to her that she has a duty and has to be strong to fight her emotions.At the end I must admit that I cried when Sissi becomes the queen of Hungary swears to fulfill her duties and the Hungarian anthem is being sung so much forbidden in the time when this nation was persecuted Isten Aldd Meg A Magyart Jo Kedvvel Boeseggel... Sissi cries. This is the love for the nation. This is the right attitude of a queen. Sacrifice even her happiness for the sake of fulfilling her duties.I love this part of Sissi. It has much to say to our times in which the feeling of duty and a good motherhood have been distorted and lost. Especially young mothers should see it. Marischka shows the love of a mother to her child and the love of a queen or empress to her nation.WORTH WATCHING. CLASSIC!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Contemporary critics including ones on this site may describe as kitsch the Sissy series Princess of Bavaria Queen of Hungary and Empress Consort of the Hapsburgs. But this is unfair. Everything must be seen in its time frame and not retrospectively. The fact is this three part series was highly successful. So much so it has been available in subtitled video in at least three languages I speak Spanish French and English for years. Speak to any older movie goer who was a kid in the late 50's from Buenos Aires to Montreal to Paris and he or she will remember Sissy fondly. I have seen many tourists in Vienna using the Sissy series as their total source of references while touring this city. This movie and the others not only provided popular entertainment historical education and restored pride in German speakers in the postwar period. It made an international star of Romy Schneider while she was still in her teens! The trio of Sissy features prominently including the installment this IMDb page describes made between 1955 and 1957 were edited together in 1962 into a 140 minute feature. I had previously seen all three individual installments about the Elizabeth Sissy and Franz Josef of Austria dubbed in Spanish. They are beautiful films recreating the entire period of history of the romance between young Sissy Princess of Bavaria and the young Franz Josef from the very beginning to the period after the Ausgleich establishment of the dual monarchy of AustriaHungary. It ends on a high note while all involved was at its peak leaving out the all the subsequent tragic events that marred Sissy's life and that of Franz Josef indeed the entire Empire. While some historic details are simplified the bulk of the story is pretty well told despite the teenage puppy love and later melodramatic elements thrown in to please the audience and make the most of Schneider's incomparable charm youth and beauty. See the condensed video if you are an English speaker. In fact I believe that is your only option. The three separate films as described on this site are available in Spanish French Italian and German only to my knowledge. But the 140 minute Englishdubbed version is even available in NTSC now. It is sold in the USA. I hope American Amazon.com soon offers it hopefully once this comment appears. Enjoy it! It's a classic.".

Her face is on everything from candy wrappers to pins pocket watches necklaces  she's everywhere. She's been the subject of musicals countless books TV miniseries plays and films.As others have pointed out this is an idealized story of Sissi with lots of facts left out as well as the more negative aspects of Sissi's personality  her anorexia for one. Here she is still in the honeymoon phase with her husband the Emperor Franz Josef and she is also anxious to help to build a good relationship with Hungary.Sissi runs into problems when she becomes pregnant with her daughter Sophie and her motherinlaw convinced that Sissi is too young to be a good mother takes the child from her in order to raise her. Angry that Franz will not stand up to his mother and instead takes her side Sissi leaves him and returns home to her family. It's pointed out to her that she has duties as a royal that must be fulfilled.In actuality Sissi's motherinlaw was worse to her than shown in the film. Also by the time she becomes Queen of Hungary she has three children but the film only speaks of one Sophie who by then is deceased.These films are incredibly popular in Europe and I believe are shown at Christmas.

This said up to today I put on the Sissi movies to relax. I enjoy just about everything in it and like them as a fairy tale. A fairy tale with castles kings princesses and the wicked mother in law. I never visited Hungary and thoroughly get pleasure from the scenes showing this beautiful land. In many ways the movie is also realistic.My father grew up under a Kaiser so the lifestyle is not too far removed from what I experienced. Children of influential families were nearly always brought up by governesses and saw their parents only at audiences. Duty to the Fatherland was something which was taught to everybody and of course even more so to the royalties. Marriages in high circles were always arranged and a marriage out of love practically unheard of. So the film paints also a picture of the time these people were living in. I think the Sissi trilogy may be the only movies which stayed with me all my life.".

	schema:headline " It looks nice....";
	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago my wife and I toured Austria. Up until then I'd never heard of Empress Elisabeth 'Sissi'. However as we toured a couple of the royal palaces in Vienna we heard an interesting version of the life of Sissi. Tour guides said that the popular image of the empress was far from the real lady. On more than one occasion she was described as vain as well as 'not quite right' a nice way of saying crazy or at least emotionally unstable. And tour guides enjoyed regaling us with stories about her eccentricities. Some of these I know to be true such as her obsession with her weight and others I still haven't been able to prove or disprove they claimed she had teeth pulled in order to make her face look thinner. Regardless this new assessment of the woman flies in the face of the fanciful and highly fictionalized Sissi trilogy made back in the 1950s. Whether or not you'll like these films has a lot to do with whether you are looking for the real Elisabeth or the nearly Cinderellalike fictionalized Sissi. Since I am a retired history teacher you can probably guess which version I prefer.From what I have been able to learn Sissi The Young Princess is closer to the truth than the first film Sissi. That's because the first film is all happiness and joyand is hard to believe. But here in the second of three films you see the beginnings of a schism in the marriage between her and Emperor Franz Joseph. The film seems to blame all this on Franz's overbearing mother Archduchess Sophie. While she was clearly a dominant figure in her son's life blaming all the couple's problems on her is overstating things a bit. Much of the problem between the pair related more to very very different temperamentsFranz Joseph was a rather dull and hardworking man whereas Sissi was almost manic and never liked to sit still. And from what I have recently read Sissi seemed to have little interest in her husband.So apart from overstating the awfulness of Archduchess Sophie what's the rest of this film like? Well like the first one it's filmed in magnificent colorand sure looks great with its location shoots in the mountains as well as throughout Vienna such as in Schnbrunn Palace. And for the romantics out there who love everything royal there is a lot to like. Romy Schneider plays Sissi with an almost cloying niceness and you can't help but like hereven though she isn't too much like the real Sissi. She is who people WISH Sissi to have beenmuch like the world's fascination with Princess Diana. Not like the real Sissicomplete with coughing fits and depression! All in all an enjoyable film that's best taken for what it is instead of what it isn't. To me it's like a steady diet of meringuetasty but not especially filling.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film in the Sissi trilogy. Like the first movie Sissi this continuation is equally idealized but here the movie actually disregards historical fact so that a more fairytalelike storyline can be presented. It is historical fact that by the time Franz Josef and Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen of Hungary in 1867 Elizabeth already gave birth to 3 children and her oldest child daughter Sophie had died. These are huge events in the lives of both parents and monarchs. Yet in the movie only the oldest daughter had been born the second born daughter and third born son do not exist and by the end of the movie no child is ever mentioned. These are serious omissions which can be problematic if the viewer assumes the story as told in the movie is historically accurate. It's not. I have no doubt that some scenes were totally invented  such as the Tyrolean holiday sequence. I realize that film makers of historical drama need to take some liberties since there is no time to present all of the events truthfully and accurately. In this movie the film makers wanted to focus on the empress's influence on the resolution of the conflict with the Hungarians. Unfortunately it was done at the expense of leaving out the ongoing drama and suffering of the real Elizabeth  as opposed to the idealized Elizabeth presented here. Her motherinlaw's extreme cruelty toward her is minimized and though the emperor's love for his wife was never in doubt throughout their lives he completely failed to protect her from his mother  a situation that is not portrayed in the movie accurately. In spite of all this the movie is still enjoyable and hopefully viewers will realize they are watching a very idealized fairy tale and will not confuse the story presented here with historical fact. The opulent ceremonies of the era the pomp and splendor of the monarchy are all well portrayed and definitely enjoyable to watch. I missed some explanation even a very simplistic one of why a dual monarchy was formed and its importance. But politics do not fit well into fairy tales so this was likewise completely omitted.".

Director and writer is Oscar nominee Ernst Marischka again and it runs for 105 minutes just like the first. Many of the topics in this film are exactly like they were in the first. The love between the 2 main characters is still strong but so is Sissi's connection to back to her rural roots. She loves her parents especially her father. She is the ultimate dogood character and protects animals this time and the Hungarians as well. The main antagonist is once again Franz Josef's mother and there are occasionally successful attempts at humor even if this is probably even more a drama than the original movie mostly with the motherhood plot. And of course the mountain climbing scenes which for the first time bring the danger of death to the movies even if it was fairly cringeworthy.I personally did not like the original too much and same applies to this one here. It suffers from onedimensional writing especially in terms of the character developments which are almost nonexistent. The actors are mediocre for the most part and not good enough to elevate the weak script for the most part. I would not have needed this sequel and I also do not need a third film. I have almost no hope this one is better than these first two. Do not be fooled by the awards recognition this film got. Schneider lost the Bambi for the second year in a row to Maria Schell. The best thing about this film is just like with the first the visual side. Schneider looks absolute stunning and the costumes cinematography and set decorations are all fairly good. But these pros cannot make up for the lack of great story or acting. Admittedly it is not worse than the first in my opinion so if you enjoyed that one you will probably like this one as well. I just wouldn't know why. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " Fun with Judy and Co.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jane Powell and company hit a home run with this sweet and fun outing from MGM with music courtesy of Xavier Cugat and Carmen Miranda. Miranda fans will have to wait for the last 30 minutes for her two numbers but they're worth it.The movie centers on Judy's love life and steady boyfriend Ogden Oogie played by Scotty Beckett. Because he doesn't pick her up for a school dance and sends a mere child she gets miffed and drops him cold. The rest of the film has Oogie miserable and wanting back in the fold with Judy giving him a hard time. Meanwhile sodajerkforthesummer Robert Stack is on hand to escort her to the dance allowing her to make Oogie jealous. Elizabeth Taylor is great as Oogie's sister they both come from a rich family who is a spoiled brat and dominates everything getting her way all the time and who of course takes an instant liking to Robert Stack.Also Wallace Beery in a musicalcomedy of all places! is Jane Powell's pop who finally learns to rumba to please his wife of 20 years and wants to surprise her on their wedding anniversary. Of course he's taught by Miss Miranda and complications arise. Jane Powell has a little brother who spouts fresh comments and a sweet grandfather who misses his deceased wife.If I haven't made you nostalgic feeling describing this oldfashioned movie then you must be a Grinch. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this quick witty and feel good movie. Granted Miss Powell's songs aren't anything too memorable but the majority of them are upbeat and cute. I personally like the slow ones. She does a sing a sweet one for her grandpa which was her grandmother's favorite.Lastly I'll say that this movie has always seemed somewhat like the Archie comics to me brought to life in MGM style due mostly to the fact that Elizabeth's character is practically Veronica Lodge. Jane Powell could be Betty Cooper maybe but I doubt Betty could sing like her. But with the soda shoppharmacy as the hangout it does feel like Archie's hometown of Riverdale but without a true Archie here.If you're looking for the days of yore when life was simple and bright or just need a pickerupper then this is for you. A Date with Judy will make you feel better long after the date's over.".

According to her autobiography though that very spryness became a type of prison limiting her casting and when musicals declined in popularity made it impossible for her to transition to other types of pictures. Someone who certainly didn't suffer the same issue is Elizabeth Taylor very young and very beautiful this was one of her first roles that flirted with adulthood. The doomed Scotty Beckett a major child star throughout his youth plays Jane's gangly boyfriend the unfortunately named Oogie struggling with puberty in one of the roles attempting to ease him into adult roles. He couldn't make the leap and within the year started the long slide into trouble with the law and drug addiction that ended in his suicide two decades later at 38. In one of his last roles Wallace Beery is full of warm understanding as Jane's father in a departure from his usual bluster he and Selena Royale at well matched as a long married couple. Lastly Carmen Miranda is a delight as always her clothes and hats are outlandish take special note of her shoes and wonder how she could possibly walk in them! One quibble the Technicolor is unusually garish and at times the cast practically glows orange.".

Stack as Stephen Andrews however is just a little too mannered and poised to be believable behind the counter of a soda fountain. The job does afford him special privilege an unobstructed view of the town girls. Beautiful eyefulls like Elizabeth Taylor playing rich girl Carol Pringle frequent the counter ordering humongous chocolate whip cream sundaes as a matter of course. Wallace Beery a screen veteran and highly gifted actor is the paterfamilias of Judy's family. Beery reputedly was a terror of a man and not shy about his virulent dislike of children. This role where Beery plays Melvin Foster a husband and father of two in essence a devoted family man certainly stands as a testimonial to his acting skill it is a character diametrically opposed to what he himself was off screen. His Melvin Foster is the epitome of respectability a solid citizen and businessman who tampers with his reputation by daring to learn to dance the rumba.

However this backfires when Judy ends up with a much handsomer and older man Stephen Robert Stack. Now jealous Carol is determined to take Stephen for herself.

With his anniversary coming up he decides to secretly take dance lessons with Carmen Miranda but due to Carol's meddling people begin to think that he and Carmen are in love! SO Judy decides the best way to fight this is to make her father feel lovedand she and the family lay it on thick. Clearly this is Beery at his bestand he's easy to love despite his very nasty personality offscreen.This is the sort of light family musicalcomedy that MGM did best. Films like On Moonlight Bay and Meet Me in St. Louis are just a small sampling of the sort of genre that the studio made to perfection. They also made some nonmusicals with similar plots that just can't be beat such as Life With Father the Andy Hardy films and Cheaper By the Dozen the originalnot the new crappy version. These films aren't especially deep but are filled with pleasant plots a bit of minor melodrama some laughs and most importantly nice folks you'd like to meet. My only complaint is that although Powell has a good voice her hightoned style and high pitch is NOT to my liking. It's far less simple and pleasant than Judy Garland Meet Me in St. Louis or Doris Day By the Light of the Silvery Moon and On Moonlight Bay. I am also not a huge Carmen Miranda fan though when she wasn't singing she was just fine. Overall while not a great family musical comedy it's a good one and well worth your time.".

She has the right mode for this 1948 film as a shrewd girl trying to lure Robert Stack away from Jane Powell.The real hit here is Wallace Beery as Powell's father. His practicing the learning of the rumba with Carmen Miranda was absolutely wonderful.This is a story of the coming of maturity among young adults as well as Beery and Leon Ames who portrayed Taylor's father.Stack is rather stiff as the summer sodajerk smitten with both ladies.

	schema:reviewBody "A Date with Judy is one of those throwaway titles that seems like the producers and director spent a whole 30 seconds coming up with but the rest of the movie certainly isn't rushed. It's mainly about two 16yearold best friends Judy Jane Powell and Carol Elizabeth Taylor who navigate their love lives and argue with their parents all the while organizing and performing at school functions. Scotty Beckett plays Carol's brother Ogden or Oogie as he is awkwardly nicknamed who has been dating Judy for some time but has been feeling like Judy's doormat lately. Carol suggests to Oogie that he not always be at Judy's beck and call so he can get some respect back so he decides to stand Judy up at the next dance. Enter Robert Stack who plays Stephen the older man from out of state who comes to help out his uncle at the drug store soda counter for the summer. Because I guess in the forties it was perfectly natural for a man way out of high school to take a 16yearold girl to a dance the uncle asks Stephen to take Judy there to make her feel better. Stephen reluctantly agrees and of course meets Carol. Kinda funny but 16yearold Jane is just a child to him but 16yearold Carol is just a two year holdout to romance. Granted you have to check your remote when Elizabeth Taylor first hits the screen in this movie because you'll swear that it automatically went to pause before you realize it is just you. MGM was obviously using this movie as a warmup for her more mature roles to come but Taylor does play Carol as both worldly and naive. There is plenty of music and dancing throughout with Powell and Beckett and you really have to be a fan of 40's crooner music to enjoy it otherwise it can be tedious. Xavier Cugat and Carmen Miranda have smaller roles as performers at the main dance. Wallace Beery plays Judy's dad Melvin who is old enough to really be Judy's grandfather but is written into the script that he is an older Dad to hold down the eye rolling. There is a subplot where after being tired of not knowing how to dance Melvin hires Miranda to teach him the Rhumba without telling his family. Beery seems to be having a blast with this part and it is a shame that this is one of his last films. The rest of the plot is really the same as most teen movies. If you had it on the beach and filmed it in the sixties it would easily star Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Will Judy and Oogie make up? Is Stephen really interested in Judy and Carol or is he just humoring them? Watch and see!".

	schema:headline " kinda nice film";
	schema:reviewBody "I actually give this film a 7.5 but decided to round it off to an 8.This film is almost sorta sitcom like. The scenes in the family household has not too different of traits from those clean family 1980s sitcoms. But it still has some traits of a clean family film from the late 1940searly 1950s. This was one of Elizabeth Taylor's early films at 16 years old before she moved on to her well known more adult films such as Butterfield 8 and Cat on a hot tin roof. And she was good in Father of the bride 1950s version not Steve Martin's 1990s version. Jane Powell was OK here but she wasn't my favorite female character. It's not because she sings opera though. I actually really like opera and I don't understand why so many people today hate it and always feel the need to bash it. Opera is a type of singing that represented old fashioned beauty class and culture and it was in many Golden Age films. Soprano singers like Jane MacDonald and Katheryn Grayson were absolutely beautiful with wonderful voices and well loved with Golden Age film audiences. People's tastes have changed so much since those days. I like the role of Wallace Beery as dad and of Goerge Cleveland as Grandpa even though their ages looked too close together to be father and son. They both looked post retirement age Grandpa looking maybe just 5 years older than Beery but that was it. There was a nice little reminiscing moment with Jane playing piano and Grandpa singing Through the years. There were some nice family moments such as a scene at the breakfast table where Beery and his wife jokingly try to decide whether to keep Jane or her younger brother. Also the witty remarks from Beery after Jane saying to him for the third time about how he needs to learn to rhumba. Then Beery debating the idea again. Then Jane saying I just want us to be civilized then Beery responding if you mention the rhumba once more I'm gonna forget that I'm civilized but he had no menace or deep meaning behind the remark. He presented a good lovable father role. I also liked comments such as Jane saying after dumping Ogie I just gave him up forever for a little while. I also kinda like those soda fountain moments which were always big in films from that era Mickey and Judy Garland films were big with them too but I liked those films even better . I enjoyed Beery's character and his scenes learning to rhumba with Carmen Miranda and her hiding in the closet when Jane showed up because his learning to rhumba was supposed to be a surprise. Carmen telling Beery stomach in chest out head up while slapping each of those places on Beery reminded me of the ballet teacher that did the same thing to Red Skelton during a funny scene in Bathing beauty except the way she did it there to Red was harsher and more comical. Jane's character was kinda nice but she did act sort of over the top and dumb in some scenes. I did not care too much for I'm Strickly on the corny side and the way she made her voice high in that last verse. I really like opera but her high voice there was not opera sounding it sounded more like a poor imitation of cowboylike yodeling and it just didn't agree with me. I did like her other songs though especially It's a most unusual time. And I really enjoyed her and the whole rest of the family joining in on the song at her parents' anniversary dinner and I remember watching that scene also in 1974's That's entertainment. This was another film that ended with the big night out and the big night out here was the anniversary dinner. It was a good ending though to a good film.".

It is an utterly charming film with much to like and difficult to hate.It may feel overlong and twee by today's standards for some both feelings understandable. Personally thought that there was very little to dislike about 'A Date With Judy' and its flaws are just a couple actually and very minor. It does to me go on a little longer than necessary for a story that is relatively slight so a couple of parts lose momentum just a tad. Robert Stack while handsome is also a little too stiff for my liking.However 'A Date With Judy' is a lovelylooking film lovingly shot in glorious Technicolor that clearly loves Taylor and Powell not quite so kind to Wallace Beery often seen in black and white and towards the end of his life though and elegant and cosy production and costume design. While not unforgettable or timeless as such the music and songs are still very good. Love is Where You Find It is heartwarming and heartfelt and it is similarly easy to see why A Most Unusual Day was such a hit.The script warms and touches the heart and the storytelling while slight is warm touching and amusing losing very little if any of its appeal so long after the film was made and released. Richard Thorpe's direction never undermines the film's tone which is always clear and there is the sense that he knew what to do with the film and how to do it and that his heart was in it.Stack aside the cast are on point. Cute as a button and exuberantly youthful Powell effortlessly charms the viewer and her singing is divine. Taylor in one of her earliest roles is so beautiful here if not quite as much as in 'Ivanhoe' and 'Cat On a Hot Tin Roof' one can't take her eyes off her she had a character that could easily annoy but she makes the role endearing. Scotty Beckett is amusing while Leon Ames is movingly dignified and George Cleveland is a memorable grandfather figure.Carmen Miranda is quite the Brazilian bombshell and a definite scene stealer. A big surprise was a more restrained and sympathetic than usual Wallace Beery who tended to be in largerthanlife and largesliceofham roles this side to him was done remarkably by him and his learning of the rumba with Miranda stays with one forever very sweet and moving.Overall an utterly charming film. 810 Bethany Cox".

It feels like an extended sitcom. In fact it is much too extended for such fluff far outstaying its welcome with a running time of nearly two hours. Powell is the teen of the title and Stack is the hunk she pines for. In his penultimate film Beery is the teddy bear of a father. Miranda shakes the groove thing. It is interesting that Powell is the star here in only her fourth film while Taylor who had already appeared in eight films is given a secondary role.".

Okay I'm no fan of the dream factory but then this is a musical so most any kind of fantasy world is permitted.The trouble is that this musical has too little music too few chuckles and too much repetition. Powell and Taylor are good to look at and for that matter so is Stack. But whether the 30 year old Stack will end up with the 19year old Powell or the 16year old Taylor does get tiresome. It might have worked had director Thorpe gotten some bounce or sparkle into the proceedings. However things pretty much plod along that is until that Brazilian firecracker Carmen Miranda arrives to literally shake things up. I expect the slender material was stretched in order to show off the budding Powell and Taylor. Too bad it also had to show off Hollywood's biggest slice of slobbering ham Wallace Beery. However I'm still marveling over how Taylor at 16 can look and act like a gorgeous 35year old. Amazing.Anyway this rather flat 113minutes is a long way from MGM's tradition of lively colorbox musicals. In my book MGM did manage a couple of sparkling little song  dance features during this same period also with youthful starsI Love Melvin 1953 and The Affairs of Dobie Gillis 1953 both with a bubbly young Debbie Reynolds. Catch up with these little gems if you can. Meantime this one's for those wanting a peek at an idealized time when teenagers were named Oogie.".

The movie characters all play significant roles that tie into the theme Why would you want to Buy the Cow when you can get the milk for free? It's a hilarious adventure of a film about dating and the ultimate search for your soul mate or the one. It is the perfect date movie. I found it to be more than hilarious with actorcomedian Ryan Reynolds stealing the show.For all the Ryan Reynolds fans out there this is hands down the funniest performance of his career.

It also faces everyday problems with dating and finding the one. A must see for anyone between the ages of 20  40. Has some great characters kind of like Tomcats. The guy from Office Space and others. If you like comedies you will love this movie. THere are a lot of one liners too that are very funny. Ryan Renolds is great too. I like how they explain dating problems and finding the one. THe movie flows very well especially when Ryan thinks he is gay!lol and the flashbacks at the airport.".

David's voiceovers are so touching and genuine to real human emotion I just cannot believe it. Much of the reason I am in love with this movie now is because I am in love with a girl and she is in love with me but we have obstacles much like the characters in this film. Indiretly but underneath this film has a GREAT message about love and finding it and not just finding love but making it work. David says in this movie there is no one true love but just a LOT of potential true loves... and until I watched this filmfor the first time in about a year I never ever agreed with that I've always been old fashioned and thought that there is a one true love for everyone but it just isn't true and watching this movie made me realize that and I know the girl I am in love with right now isn't THE ONE but she is a potential THE ONE and I do think she will be my THE ONE especially after I watch this movie with her.This movie really has a great message and will make a GREAT absolutely AWESOME date movie for any two young lovers it gives you all the knowledge and feelings that you are going to feel when you falling love and it tells you what to do with them. Trust me I know I have recently fallen head over heels in love with a young lady and I know watching this film has just given me all I need to make us work. This movie is amazingly made for the things it was made for it was made to be romantic which it truly deeply sincerely is and it was made to be funny which it also REALLY is it's zany and over the top but who cares? It's the message that is there under all the silliness.Ryan Reynolds... can act... wow... Jerry o'Connell has never been better everyone else is great. Walt Beckerdirector has really made an amazing film especially for someone who is currently dating or talking about dating... think of this film as a guide to true love and lots of laughs.This is one of my new favorite films... it really will just make you feel good. It is a must see for anyone especially for couples. Awesome date movie and I'm gonna use it on a date and it's gonna find me true love and it'll find you true love too. If you think I'm exaggerating I'm not this is an amazing movie don't pay any attention to the IMDb.com user rating it's underanalyzed and underunderstood.Buy it watch itwith a date preferably enjoy it. 1010".

Also it's great to see the World Trade Center in the NYC skyline.I saw this on a local cable channel and am glad I didn't rent it. I wouldn't have felt that I'd gotten my money's worth. There are plenty of other good dating movies to see. This wouldn't be one of them.";

You may think you've seen it all but you haven't seen this... and you should consider yourself lucky. Like Walt Becker's previous directing attemptwhich was about as big of a trainwreck as this one this features Ryan Reynolds and has incredibly poor taste in humor and will disgust just about everyone who watches it at one point or another. Granted this isn't as sick or graphic as Van Wilder but it's every bit as poor. Becker decides that his talentless direction isn't enough to torture us poor viewers and tried to write the script for this mess. Luckily he cowrote it with Peter W. Nelson... who doesn't seem to have written another movie neither before nor since. I don't think I have to tell you just how poorly written the film is as the direct result of this. The love story is contrived sappy and unbelievably predictable. The acting is just bad. The characters are never credible their actions make no conceivable sense and all of them are paperthin stereotypes. The humor is so painfully obvious and stupid that I can't see anyone finding it funny. The jokes are poorly set up never funny and repeated to the point where we're sick of them. There's only one good thing about this movie and it's Alyssa Milano as a stripper. If you consider that reason enough to see the movie then be my guest. Lord knows that was the only reason I gave the movie any chance at all. I recommend this to fans of romantic teen comedies and Alyssa Milano. Anyone else shouldn't bother. In fact if you doubt you would like it then don't watch it. It's most likely not worth your time. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the 2008 Swedish film Let The Right One In I was originally very frustrated when I heard the news about the upcoming remake. How do you ameliorate something that is already perfect? I asked myself. I treated the remake with hostility and vowed to stay away from it. And then I decided to open my mind. I attended the world premiere of this film at the Toronto International Film Festival on Monday September 13. I am very lucky to live in the proximity. This was the first year that I've attended the festival. Before seeing Let Me In I saw 127 Hours. I liked the idea of seeing the remake of a film that I recently gave a second viewing. I thought it would be a fun challenge to sit there and compare both films while watching. Before the screening or it might have been after the director Matt Reeves who launched his career with Cloverfield was welcomed on stage to say a few words. It surprised me to find out that he too thought the original was fantastic and didn't understand why he was asked to remake it. However after reading the book as well he had the desire to work on his interpretation of it. After this speech I gained a significant amount of respect for this man. When the movie began I was only expecting something satisfactory. But as the story progressed I was breathless. It was a very captivating interesting take and I loved all the little modifications. I honestly believe that Let Me In is one of the greatest American remakes of all time. Nevertheless I still see the original Let The Right One In as a superior film. Although it may be a biased opinion I preferred the mood atmosphere and cinematography in the original. While the remake seemed to take a greater interest in the horrific violence the original had the perfect blend of genres thriller romance horror fantasy. Both films had many beautiful contrasts coldness vs warmth chaos vs peace guilt vs innocence darkness vs delicacy and despair vs hope. I must also mention that I preferred the sense of ambiguity presented in the original. Very few questions were answered and the whole film was more of a mystery left to interpretation. In contrast Matt Reeves was more clear and direct in his screenplay with the mystery surrounding his characters. It's all a matter of personal preference though. I believe that most people will prefer what Matt did since the original has a certain style that less people can appreciate. Despite the comparison I believe that they are both great movies that can be enjoyed by everyone. Fans of the original rather than being narrowminded and boycotting this version should give it a chance and appreciate it for what it is. Wouldn't you want more people in North America to discover this mesmerizing vampire tale anyway? I really enjoyed every aspect of Let Me In. The child actors Chloe Moretz KickAss and Kodi SmitMcPhee The Road were both excellent choices. They proved to us once again that they are among the only child actors who actually have talent. Now that I think of it the only thing that didn't impress me was the music. For an original score composed by Michael Giacchino Up I was quite disappointed. It was mediocre in my opinion. It didn't convey the same emotion as Johan Soderqvist's music in Let The Right One In. Aside from that Let Me In is a surprisingly great film for the fans of the original. And it would probably be a bloody masterpiece for those who haven't seen it. And yes that lame vampire pun was definitely intended. 7.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Given the background to this film I must start by saying I have neither read the book it is based on nor seen the 2008 Swedish original. After watching this masterpiece I intend to do both.This is a truly sensational film. When you can't really pin a film down to a specific genre you know you're onto something special. Calling this film a vampire movie doesn't really do it justice given the preconceived notions most film goers bring to the genre. It is part horror part dark family drama part love story with all 3 categories succeeding admirably.In my estimation the director has come on in leaps and bounds since Cloverfield a movie with a clever idea that was hampered by a poor cast and soso execution. Here the director sets a mood of oppression and isolation from the very earliest frames and never lets up. The locations are used superbly as are lighting and sound to create the gloomy world poor Owen is stranded in.The film undeniably belongs to Chloe Grace Moretz as the young vampire Abby. This girl is an absolute powerhouse of an actress turning in a dark subtle and convincing performance that belies her tender age of 12. If she does not make the shortlist for next year's Oscars the Academy needs its collective head examined. She embodies the potent mixture of lovable innocence and animalistic darkness within Abby with such ease you will be genuinely astounded.My fellow Aussie Kodi SmitMcPhee is also excellent making you really feel for the putupon Owen and share in his joy at finding a spark of happiness with the mysterious Abby. The entire film falls apart if this pair fail to convince so it is a testimony to their respective talents particularly Moretz' that you invest so heavily in their relationship.Don't let the press about this film being a remake put you off. I must say I'm very disappointed to see this hasn't done too well at the box office in the USA as it is a vastly superior film to the likes of Paranormal Activity 2.If anyone is in two minds about seeing this film take the gamble and shell out your hardearned. You'll be glad you did if for no other reason than witnessing one of the most impressive performances by a child actor in cinema history.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether you are a fan of Gothic horror or not Let Me In is well worth a viewing and by no means is it just a scary film it is so much more than that. Before I go into the film itself I have to comment that this is a remake of a Swedish film called Let The Right One In from 2008 and both films come from the novel of the same name by Swedish author Tomas Alfredson.The film itself is a masterpiece and hats off to director Matt Reeves for brilliant work on what was a difficult task remaking an already loved film for American audiences and all those who don't like subtitles. The film is shot in the eerie Los Alamos New Mexico snow mostly at night time and it is truly gorgeous and the dark cold land gives a real genuine vibe to the tale and you feel Owen's despair .The story itself centers on Owen Kodi SmitMcPhee who is a twelve year old child whose parents are going through a divorce and is a victim of bullying he lives with his mother and is dangerously isolated and becoming slightly weird. All his problems are answered when the amazing Abby Chlo Moretz moves into the apartment next door. She is a self assured twelve year old who helps Owen overcome his bullying problems gives him someone to love and their friendship blossoms.However all is not right with Abby who is played by the highly capable Chlo Moretz Hit Girl in Kickass her performance is remarkable and the chemistry with her and Kodi Smit is all the more special when you take into account they are only children. You feel every touch you love every second Abby and Owen are together their bond is beautiful yet you know all is not well. Abby is a vampire she needs blood to live and she will do anything to get it indeed even jump on an innocent persons back as they go for a nice jog and feast on their blood. Yes there are plenty of shock moments in this film it is scary but its more than that.Like Owen we the audience has to see past the fact Abby is a vampire and become immersed in this special and beautiful friendship and we do thanks to the performances of both Kodi and Chlo that are nothing short of brilliant and long may they succeed.".

One wonders just how far he can go on the basis of these two Oscar quality performances. Abby the vampire is played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely stunned in Kick Ass as Hit Girl.It's billed as a horror movie but it's actually a love story and a very moving one at that. The quietness and intensity of the young couple's illicit in so many ways relationship is at the core of the movie and their shared screen time are the real beating pulse of the movie. You will not see a better and more intimate love story this year.Matt Reeves as director is surely one of the most promising Hollywood talents out there. His previous film Cloverfield is one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. Why is it not considered amongst the best aliens movie ever made?

Not the 70sstyle Benny Hill horrors with cheesy sets and plenty of female flesh but a thoughtful intelligent and wellrealised update of the Swedish vampire movie Let The Right One In. I enjoyed the original while thinking it a bit overpraised and I was very pleased with this Hollywood remake which contains much of the same story but is certainly not a shot for shot clone. WriterDirector Matt Reeves has done a fine job of bringing the story to Englishspeaking audiences.The movie concerns a bullied 12 yearold  here called Owen Oskar in the original  and his friendship with new arrival on the block Abby. This vampire tale has been transplanted from the original Swedish location to Los Alamos but contains a similar bleakness. Owen's mother is wrapped up in religion his father has left and is undertaking divorce proceedings and on top of that Owen has to deal with 3 sadistic school bullies the leader of which looks uncannily like a young Brian Wilson! Owen soon realises that Abby is strange and different and is drawn to her the two quickly become fast friends. But there is a punchline...for Abby you see is a vampire.This is not a Twilightstyle story but a mature examination of childhood loneliness and horror and it packs a hell of a punch. The gore content is upped slightly from the original and although there are shocks they are wellpaced and not just thrown at the viewer. I actually thought the acting was better in this version than the Swedish film. There are some changes including the central revelation being removed from the film altogether  it's just hinted that Abby is not er all there physically.This is a great little movie. Hammer may never be the same as they were in the old Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee days but what a come back!".

Having seen the original Let The Right One In 18 months ago I was more impressed with the 2010 remake which doesn't happen often! The two main characters Owen and Abbey draw you into the story and into their lives. Owen a 12 year old boy who has no friends an alcoholic mother and is being bullied at school and Abbey a young vampire girl who relies on her keeper to feed her. Also a loner Abbey befriends Owen and later in the film we learn that he will replace her current keeper Richard Jenkins. Unlike usual horror films Let Me In shows the reasoning behind the villains motives and similarly to We Are What We Are the audience is intrigue by the killer and are let encouraging their behaviour. Unlike We Are What We Are Let Me In is much more than a horror film its a story of friendship teenage anxieties and family break ups and for this reason I give the film 1010. A highly recommendable enjoyable believable portrait of Vampire life if there were such thing which is acted and directed faultlessly.".

Personally how can I top the master writer himself with my own praise? This is the best horror film I have seen since The Shining. The relationship between Owen and Abby was beautiful and complex and was masterfully done by the two young actors. So masterful for their age I was immersed immediately! The story was superb and their chemistry was perfection. The acting by Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas was spot on and authentic as could be expected and cannot be overlooked. The cinematography and musical soundtrack were a perfect combination to create atmosphere and feeling. The orchestral music furthered the intensity and seriousness of Abby's need to feed and protect but the classic rock tunes from the era echoed the universal teenage experience of social rebellion and awkward sexual curiosity. I was personally further drawn in because of being bullied at that same age with no friends to rely on. The solitude and emotional pain are immense. I could only dream as mostof having an mature and loyal friend like Abbey to help me through that tough time..The strength that Abby provides and ultimately uses to rid this problem for Owen is enormous and addictive. much like this film! Thus it is easy to see why he would leave with her immediately and forgo the average life. I am addicted to this beautiful work. Very few things inspire or move me anymore. But this film captures a powerful moment in the human condition even with it's fictional elements. Though a realist I am currently in fantasia. Though cynical I am currently inspired by greatness. In a time when horror films pretty much suck It was a privilege to see this masterfully done work of art.".

It was refreshing to see how their chemistry blended and bloomed. The only fault I found was the CG attack scenes. That was unbelievable for me. I would have portrayed a vampire as having total control and with slow deliberate moves. Imagine a fiend that would regard his next meal with detached urgency. That would be much more scary.

This movie is not an exception it is a Swedish remake but it is nice to see something that isn't a remake of a film that is Japanese or from the 70's. This film is well made and well performed with a story line new to American audiences making it definitely worth the everinflating price of theater admission.".

This movie is not an exception it is a Swedish remake but it is nice to see something that isn't a remake of a film that is Japanese or from the 70's. This film is well made and well performed with a story line new to American audiences making it definitely worth the everinflating price of theater admission.";

	schema:headline " Let Me In Will Quietly Haunt You Long After the Lights Come On";
	schema:reviewBody "Let Me In is an adaptation of the Swedish Horror Classic Let The Right One In. Being an adaptation many fans of the original may have been against the idea of an adaptation on the basis of many adaptations of other films in the past which had failed to do the original justice those fans should be happy to know that Let Me In not only does the original's brilliance justice but builds upon it to give an even better experience and a new take of an excellent story to those who will see this film.Let Me In LMI will make you do what the title asks it will make you open your mind heart and subconscious where it will plant a seed that will grow and continue to haunt you long after you have left the theater. Unlike most Horror genre movies these days LMI is a movie that doesn't lean heavily on visual effects and gore to scare you. Instead LMI builds its foundation in an already excellent story complimented with great direction acting and cinematography. Normally the horror genre is one I choose to avoid due to the frequent use of cheap visual thrills rather then hard hitting emotional trauma and mental unrest. This is where LMI transcends the genre as it is a film with depth and emotion that will truly stay with you long after the lights come on.The acting in LMI is award worthy especially Chloe Moretz as Abby who's acting is amazing and makes the film's most complex character work. Give her the statue please! Worth mention for those who have seen the original is compared to Lina Leadersson who did an exceptional job as Eli Chloe was responsible for both the acting and the voice while Lina was dubbed. Also award worthy is Kodi SmitMcPhee as Owen without Kodi's Owen to compliment Chloe's Abby the film would have lacked a soul and fell flat despite a great story.The one area I thought the film lacked compared to the original was Musical Score whole LMI has an excellent musical score it is far more direct than the brilliant and creepy Score that supported the original just nitpicking here though.In my opinion LMI is a brilliant movie which perfectly compliments the original as well as one of the best this year.9.610Spoilers Below This PointI hope my review doesn't come off as disjointed since I have separated the spoilers from the rest of the review.LMI is driven only by the relationship between Owen and Abby two brilliantly conceived and acted characters. Abby is a very complex character many on the IMDb boards have taken Abby to be a pure evil calculative and manipulative 200 year old lady who has perfected the art of tricking others into helping her I do not agree with this. Abby's character is brilliant because despite these 200 years that she has lived she is still a 12 year old trapped inside of a monster. There are many hints throughout the movie that evidence this. For example when Abby's caretaker fails to bring back blood for her she is furious because she will now be forced to do the sinful deed herself. Abby's reluctance to get her own hands dirty is evidence that somewhere inside her the 12 year old girl still lives rather than an insatiable monster who would jump at the chance to enjoy adrenaline pumping moments of a kill. This makes Abby kind of an ironic character she is defined by her disease as a creature that lusts for human blood as well as one with the power to obtain it herself but instead she is reluctant to do so when it can be avoided because somewhere inside her the 12 year old human girl still lives.Owen is also a very complex character but in a way that almost is the inverse of Abby. Owen is a helpless school boy constantly tormented by bullies in his school. He is weak and has a poor family foundation with his parents going through a divorce. But when we look into his character and in certain scenes we see he has a desire to do harm to his tormentors. One example of this is the scene where he is stabbing the tree with the knife and pretending that it is the group of bullies that torment him on a daily basis. So his character can be described as a weak 12 year old human boy who wishes for the power to exact his revenge on his tormentors and imagines doing them as well yet he still lacks the power to do so.If one looks at this Owen and Abby work sort of like the puzzles Abby loves in that each of them compliment a void in the other hence when they are together they are complete and they are happy. This is what makes them a perfect match as when Abby is with Owen she can be her 12 year old self which the majority of her clearly prefers to be and on the opposite end of the spectrum Owen is no longer lonely and at the same time has someone who has the power to defend him.Neither of these characters would be even remotely believable without strong performances to back them up.LMI is also one of the greatest Romantic Tragedies ever made because despite the happy tone the film ends on one is assured there is nothing but trouble ahead. Either Owen will outgrow Abby and due to his love decide to keep himself useful and become her replacement caretaker or she will choose to share her curse with him where both will have to share in the curse of what a Vampire is a Victim.".

	schema:reviewBody "Owen and Abby both 12 are what some kids in a suburban school in Los Alamos New Mexico would call besties  close friends. Unknown to them is that the two have just started going steady. They're quite an odd couple those two. Owen Kodi SmitMcPhee undernourished and underweight for his age has a familiar face especially to a trio of bullies who hacks on him every chance they get taunting his girlie looks. But nobody has ever laid eyes on Abby Chloe Moretz who's just moved in next door to Owen. She's moody but is otherwise normal so who'd ever guess that she has been 12 for a very long time and that she's in fact a vampire?The pact between Owen and Abby is as simple as the games children play. Their exclusive club has only one rule If one of them wishes to enter the room of the other one must ask and wait for a clear answer. A nod a gesture or an approving look won't do one has got to say it. Never mind that Abby has special powers which she could use to have her way. She can easily leap from the ground straight up to his room or smash the window with her wolverine teeth. Indeed we see her later decapitating a victim in one crunch of the jaw. Can she be trusted?Let Me In is a virtual reproduction of the widely acclaimed Swedish 2008 horror drama Let the Right One In. The chosen style of the original film's director Thomas Alfredson and the remake's director Matt Reeves is minimalist a relentless dripbydrip account of what happened in a suburb Los Alamos that winter of 1983. Both movies peel the genre to its bare minimum resulting in an inspired depiction of pure horror and a redefinition of it.Reeves who also wrote the screenplay strips the main characters to their bare essentials to a fault resulting in a slowmoving first half that is stronger in mood than in plot movement. Owen's character is defined by the sadistic bullying in school while Abby's is framed by her constant thirst for blood as supply dwindles and the danger that the law would catch up with her and her guardian.The face of Owen's mother a devoted but alcoholic Catholic is studiously kept out of sight an unnecessary and puzzling tack that could be excused as an attempt to increase the sense of Owen's isolation shedding light on why he finds comfort in Abby.Let Me In discards many conventions of vampire films. There's none of the crucifixes garlic gunk holy water mirror phobia and happily none of the hightech dabbling of recent ones. The coffin concept lives on but in the form of a sinisterlooking room that Abby shares with his stepfather Richard Jenkins. Also kept is the idea of sun rays as a vampire slayer as well as the vampires' powers of flight and instant mutations.The second half of Let Me In operates on the level of horror classics. Carefully paced the suspense and the shockers pile on to each other and what was a simple storytelling in the first half becomes a fascinating interweaving of story threads. The killings become increasingly bloody including an attack inside a young man's car and another that takes place in a tunnel where the splitsecond decapitation occurs. A body bursting in flames instantaneously is quite a sight if only in a flash. While busy killing the vampire morphs into several beasts in a row now looking vaguely like a wolf and in a wink shifting into the contour of a demon or some monster rising from wisps and swirls of gray smoke.Two extraordinary scenes Of special interest to fans of horror and suspense are two scenes that define the creators of this film and the original as genuine film artists. The first occurs during a class excursion to a frozen lake where Owen accidentally gets hold of an ice hockey stick and when threatened follows Abby's advice to the letter you got to strike back hard punctuated by shrieks of terror from his classmates. The other scene comes later at the school swimming pool where the sadistic bullies exact a vendetta against Owen.Let Me In does not flinch away from graphic images of violence and mayhem  blood smeared on the lips or acid trickling down and searing the face  but it does so with a certain grace and never in excess. They serve one purpose to advance its theme of the presence and persistence of evil. The evil in Los Alamos as it was in Sweden's Blackeberg permeates the air ready to pounce anytime and is bent on perpetuating itself. It takes many forms from something as banal as school bullying as sad as a messy divorce to something tragic such as the murder of people we love.From the start of production this movie was going to float or sink depending on its two lead characters. As Owen and Abby SmitMcPhee and Moretz were lucky to have a director in Reeves who clearly has great rapport with preteens a very able cinematographer Greig Fraser who frames them in the most fitting angles and an editor who makes up through cuts and timing what the young actors lack in finesse. Their roles get a boost from the more talented Dylan Minnette who as Kenny is a natural villain high school bully and closet wimp.Precisely because of their complete lack of artifice SmitMcPhee's unsullied looks and air of vulnerability combined with Moretz's angeltodemon transformations convince us and prevail down to the movie's final twist. They leave a memorable and tragic portrait of a boy from the world of imperfect humans and a girl from the netherworld of the undead  he the fleshandblood Romeo and she the vampiric Juliet  trying to make sense of their doomed existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not one for scary movies but this movie was so much more than that. And in a time where I'm becoming more and more reluctant to watch vampire films I needed a movie like this to remind me just how good this type of subject matter can be. Kodi SmitMcPhee and Chloe Moretz were phenomenal. They brought a subtlety to there characters that was gently heartbreaking at times while exquisitely silent and perceptive at others. The dynamic of the characters was tangible and the viewer ends up with a sense  not of whether the actions of the characters are right or wrong or whether vampirism itself is okay when presented with the face of a 12yearold girl  but of whether they themselves believe in the rightness or wrongness of where the story takes this young boy. Unlike most scary movies this one leaves the viewer with something to think about when they leave the theater. And if that's not good storytelling I don't know what is.The soundtrack was beautifully mellow at times as well as keeping on point for the more thrilling parts of the film. The shots were lovely and simple at times and rather artistically impressive at others.".

You will walk out with a lot on your mind after this movie.Definitely NOT your mindless horrorvampire film and as a movie on its own not compared to the original it is capable of pulling lots of different emotions. It also definitely had some jumpinyourseats moments too.This movie for kids? Definite NO  this is not a sappy romance with pretty actors. It is a dark movie with heavy themes.

	schema:reviewBody "Let Me In stars two young but extremely talented actors Chloe Moritz as Abby and Kodi SmitMcFee The Road as Owen. Both give astonishing performances that transcend the usual vampire tale. There are no pale heart throbs here and yet there is more emotion and character investment than a typical slasher film. This positions Let Me in  a remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In  as a highly original and enjoyable vampire tale.This newer film is a haunting and oddly redemptive tale of two children both lonely both with secrets. Owen is being bullied and threatened at school and is neglected by both his parents who are going through a divorce. He steals money from his mother and buys candy and a pen knife which fuels his fantasy of defending himself at school. Abbey has a much older and gruesome secret one that should be more horrifying than it is but her well written and superbly acted character makes us care for her despite her supernatural urges and abilities. Okay she drinks blood nobody's perfect. The film owes much to its excellent direction by Matt Reeves Felicity as well as its soundtrack and also its sound editing. The classic creepy movie noises  screeching hinges slamming doors gasps of surprise and screams of pain  come across as pristine and new in this film whose overall mood is also enhanced by its locale the stark winter landscape of New Mexico and the courtyard of a sad low rent apartment building.Reeves also gives much homage in this film to both John Ford and Clint Eastwood as well as Hitchcock. Ford and Eastwood for the carefully constructed shots that border on iconic of figures in doorways or shadows highlighted against the winter snow. Hitchcock for the recurring scenes of sudden violence that while gruesome also became somewhat rote and thus more threatening See how easy it is to kill someone? The inherent suspense of this movie should have been diluted by the fact that the trailer and also the early available information on this film both reveal that the haunting and haunted young girl Abbey is a vampire. And yet even with that information in hand we are surprised by how much we like her and begin to understand the awkward deeply emotional relationship that develops gradually between the two children who find a bond in their mutual isolation and outcast status. Like Owen we are aware of the violence that Abbey represents but against our own good judgment and all that blood we will feel ourselves liking her and rooting for a good if not happy ending. This review won't spoil the ending for you other than to say it is both expected and unexpected. A strong supporting cast rounds out the film Dylan Minnette Saving Grace plays the despicable school yard bully who is ultimately revealed to be a victim in his own family Richard Jenkins The Visitor Burn After Reading adroitly plays the tortured older man who many believe to be Abbey's father.Best for viewers who enjoy thrillers. Unlike most slasher films Let Me In conveyed strong believable emotion pathos and inevitable empathy for a character who many would not want to meet on a moonless night. But be aware that it also had a lot of blood and gore. Good for older teens and above only. Leave grandma home but see this film.".

Lindqvist explored the social context of the tale in far greater detail then either movie  the degenerate society of broken lives and relationships alcoholism and drug abuse pedophilia crime schoolyard bullying and vampires. I had a strong feeling that killing people for blood was no worse than what was going down on a daily basis in that society.Alfredson chose to concentrate on the story. A beautiful movie somewhat detached viewpoint just watching the story unfold.Reeves in Let Me In was all about the relationship between Abby and Owen. The acting by SmitMcPhee and Moretz was outstanding conveying so much so authentically with body language expression and tone of voice. The adult actors did a great job too. Visually it was very different from the Swedish film. More moody I guess. As a visual artist I was fascinated by the different artistic decisions the two directors made. While watching the Swedish film I had to sometimes remind myself that it was the same story I had seen a few days earlier so different were they.I've been watching a lot of Japanase Yakuza movies lately and have no problem with different movies telling basically the same tale in different ways. For Let Me In the original source material is the experiences that the writer and both directors had of their own childhoods and all three artistic works are beautiful and powerful reflections on those experiences. I encourage anyone to see Let Me In because it is beautiful and powerful cinema. Period.".

It's actually first and foremost a romance.Chloe Moretz of HitGirl fame from KickAss plays a child vampire who moves in next door to a boy named Owen who is very much alone and bullied at school. Owen's mother is an alcoholic who won sole custody and Owen's father is not allowed to come around. Moretz once again steals the show as the tragic character of Abby.Let Me In is an adaptation written and directed by Matt Reeves of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. Barely anything has been changed from the original story but the cinematography some dialogue different actors and adjusted characters make for a new movie. Although many fans of the original boycotted this film for months Let Me In will allow for the original to be viewed.Matt Reeves does an excellent job and I've enjoyed his first two films I've seen. Let Me In and Cloverfield are his only two pieces of work I've seen and they are his most popular thus far.This is a romance because it plays very intimately between the two lead actors. The scenes between Owen and Abby are tender and very romantic for the age of the characters. It's surprising to see how well two child actors can be this mature and loving with such a great chemistry. It has some thrills and chills and there's room for drama but it's definitely meant to be a romance.Personally I've not seen the original film but I do think this is a great film in its own right. It certainly did a good job to get me interested in watching the original whenever I get a chance.It has a very short list of cast as the only other names I can recognize are Richard Jenkins and Elias Koteas. Their involvement is less than secondary characters and even then they are still overshadowed by the breathtaking Moretz. At 13 years of age Moretz amounts maturity and skill in her acting as much as an adult can. Her timing and delivery is wellestablished and crafted almost as if she's been doing this work for decades.I can't say anything bad about Let Me In because I haven't seen the original to compare and mostly because I really enjoyed the movie. Perhaps it's my favourtism of romance movies and I am fascinated by Moretz and child actor leads but whatever the reason I believe Let Me In is going to be a great success with audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "A classic woman's film in the best sense of the word Old Acquaintance was remade by George Cukor as Rich and Famous and echoed in the final scenes of Pedro Almodovar's La Flor de Mi Secreto. Such is the enduring appeal of this tale of a friendship between two women that continues throughout their lives despite rivalries temperament and love affairs. Of course with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as the women the film rises from melodramatic soap opera to a higher level. Davis plays Kit a serious sensitive writer whose interests lie principally in her work. Hopkins plays Millie a selfabsorbed woman who envies her friend's success but is determined to have everything a writing career a home and a family. While Kit writes critically lauded books and plays Millie produces a steady stream of best selling romantic novels. While Millie becomes wealthy beyond measure Kit remains appreciated if not rich. However Kit's warmth attracts the affections of not only Millie's increasingly estranged husband but also her neglected daughter.Thus the stage is set for emotional clashes between the two writers that provide Davis and Hopkins with some juicy material. Hopkins in particular chews the scenery wrings her hands and emotes outrageously. Davis on the other hand underplays her role more than usual although the Davis eyes and inflections remain. Perhaps she understood that the histrionics of more than one actress would be too much for the audience to bear. However during one classic outburst Davis unexpectedly does steal a scene from Hopkins and provoke a startled laugh from the audience. With two strong women at its center the men in Old Acquaintance understandably play support. John Loder is all bland good looks as Millie's husband and a handsome Gig Young does little besides look handsome and play the tooyoung romantic interest for Davis.With the exception of Deidre Hopkins' daughter the other major female roles also involve working women. Although Davis's maid may be a domestic she does work and earn her own living. The reporter who interviews Hopkins and Loder is a genderneutral role but perhaps to emphasize the centrality of women to the story another strong actress Anne Revere was cast. In fact besides Loder and Young most of the men in the film play waiters taxi drivers night clerks playboys and drunks. Newcomer Dolores Moran who plays Deidre was out of her league with Davis and Hopkins and comes across as shallow and unconvincing. Her erotic gyrations to seduce Gig Young in a listening booth and her defiant dalliance with an older playboy are at odds with the character and image of Kit who was supposedly Deidre's role model.Fast paced lush and romantic Old Acquaintance is one of those movies that they just don't make anymore. The dialog is delicious the performances occasionally border on camp and the direction is surehanded. With a box of chocolates a wad of Kleenex and a bottle of flat champagne Bette and Miriam are the perfect friends for a rainy afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long before Beaches and The Turning Point there was the film Old Acquaintance 1937?. Focusing on the familiar theme of longtime friendship that is tainted by jealousy and competition one of the most remarkable things about it is that Davis actually plays the nice one this time around. Old Acquaintance begins with Kit Davis a writer who turns out books that appeal to female intellectuals returns home to visit her old friend Millie Hopkins. Kit and Millie basically grew up together and despite Kit's seriousness and drive and Millie's concern for all things material the two have forged a friendship that is pretty tight. When we first meet the two Millie married and pregnant with her first and only child decides that she too can become an authoress only she is going to write what she thinks the public wants torrid potboilers ala Danielle Steel that are high on the sappy melodrama and low on the substance meter. When Millie finds eventual success and becomes extremely wealthy churning out book after book her husband Pres Loder and child Didi begin to feel neglected and eschewed thanks to Millie's highly materialistic and queen bee attitude. They both turn to Kit who has managed to stick around through all of this Pres falling in love with her and Didi looking to Kit as a surrogate mother. Despite Kit having reciprocal feelings for Pres she insists that they can never come to fruition since Millie is her best friend so he divorces Millie and leaves. Years later still a success Millie finds out that Kit and Pres were in love at one point and despite the fact that neither followed through with their feelings Millie blames Kit now an accomplished and respected playwright eventually turning Didi now in her late teens against her. The drama is further heightened when Kit finally agrees to marry Rudd Young her younger lover right when he meets and falls in love with Didi causing further conflict and heartache until Kit and Millie are left with the prospect of only being left with the other despite their serious issues over the years.I really enjoyed Old Acquaintance because it had all of the elements of a great melodrama backstabbing unrealized and tragic love Bette Davis. Whether she is playing the good soul or the evil one most likely the latter Davis does drama the best and Old Acquaintance is a fine example of her work. Hopkins who I previously have seen playing fairly harmless and airy characters in The Heiress as well as endangered and misunderstood the wrongfully accused school teacher in These Three really rolls up her sleeves and digs into this part with obvious relish. She is fantastic and while you spend most of the movie hating her you can't help but admire how well Hopkins performs the role. The supporting cast of Loder and Young are fairly solid and Loder in particular is great as the putupon romantic and downtrodden husband. Part of you wants to smirk and call him a wuss and part of you wishes you could date him.The story itself is full and solidly carries itself well from the beginning of the film until the end. Coupled with good acting and a couple of great slaps courtesy of La Davis Old Acquaintance was a good meaty film that I watched with great relish wondering where it had been for the last 20 years I have spent watching all things classic film and in particular Bette Davis. There was nothing stupendous about Old Acquaintance that made me speak in tongues or anything but it is a wonderful film that has fallen into relative obscurity over the years that deserves to be seen and enjoyed. 810 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "After having gone headtohead in The Old Maid a few years prior Davis and Hopkins teamed up for round two in this film. It's a credit to both actresses that despite their intense loathing for one another they were able to convey warm and deep friendship on screen when it was called for even embracing fondly when the touch of one probably repulsed the other. Davis plays a somewhat dowdy earthy authoress who comes back to her hometown amid much flurry to visit her old school chum Hopkins. Davis writes criticallyacclaimed but lacklusterselling books yet can't seem to find a man to share her life. Hopkins on the other hand has an affectionate husband Loder and is about to have a baby but has no outlet for her own creativity. When Hopkins writes a tacky novel and it's a runaway bestseller the dynamic between these old friends shifts and before long they are engaged in a rivalry and an unstated game of oneupmanship. The years flow by and though Davis is still a respected writer and playwright Hopkins has achieved extraordinary fame and success in her field. When Loder comes between the ladies and Hopkins' daughter Moran as well the sparks begin to fly though never without a certain touch of humor. Davis enjoyed portraying a fairly realistic character in this goround and came up with the notion that she would wear men's pajama tops to bed as a revealingly quirky trait. Though as the film wears on she is given a rather silly grey streak in her hair and becomes more mannered it's still a welldrawn interesting performance. Hopkins in at full tilt throughout and gives a zesty energetic portrayal. One hopes that she was in on the joke of her heavily neurotic and overthetop character. She provides a lot of the comic content with her exuberant bitchery. Loder gives a friendly solid if unspectacular performance. Young appears late in the game as Davis' younger suitor and is very handsome and effective. Moran is also mostly appealing and attractive though she would exit the business before too long after marrying a producer. Revere shows up in a small but amusing role as a reporter. The story is an intriguing one though there are a few headscratching elements such as how Moran has no recollection of what her father looks like when they meet after a lengthy separation. Also due to U.S. involvement in WWII coming about after the source play's debut a bit of patriotic sentiment was incorporated into Davis' role to help assuage the potential fluffiness of such a piece in a time of war. In fact the initial choice for director turned the project down because he didn't think audiences would care about two bitches bickering when there's a war on! Fortunately the film was made as it's a fascinating thing to see these enemies working their craft together with Davis underplaying and Hopkins overplaying and somehow providing a tasty piece of entertainment in the process. Davis would have other nasty rivalries and issues with female stars after this such as with Susan Hayward in Where Love Has Gone and infamously Joan Crawford in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?".

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis must have been relieved to know that once she was done filming THE OLD MAID chances were she didn't have to work with Miriam Hopkins again. I can only imagine her expression in having to deal with Hopkins for one more movie after suggestions to reteam with pal Mary Astor didn't fall through. She must have thought it was some kind of sick joke. Or karma. Who knows. To the end of her life she stated that while she respected Hopkins as an actress and even went to say that Hopkins didn't have to take on supporting parts so quickly she was a congenial person but working with her was another story.It's not hard to see why Hopkins tries insanely hard to steal every scene she's in from the moment the camera focuses on her back and she talks to Bette Davis' character over the phone in the opening scene. It's as if she were constantly aware of being under the camera lights and she needed to make sure that the viewer would see her as well. It only adds to her insecurity that her shrill performance while very good is not the focus of the movie  indeed she's off screen for a good chunk of the movie later on  as it is Davis' character's story.Still it makes for great watching at every turn there is a chance for one of them to try and outact the other. However you wouldn't know that they couldn't stand each other here just like in THE OLD MAID. The opening scenes are quite funny in establishing who Kit Marlowe and Millie Drake are as friends. Kit is the more understanding the more tolerant of the two she knows how to deal with her flighty friend and has come to see her quirks as basically that. Millie while a drama queen who wants to give her friend the biggest reception ever ever so slightly suggests an envy of Kit's career but really has no malice towards her. You could tell they're really friends that have since fallen into the rut of duty.It's an outsider that begins to see the real nature of this friendship. John Loder playing Preston Drake is clearly unhappy in his marriage to Millie but stays by her regardless until he meets the woman he should have married in Kit. He can't see how being so diametrically opposed women they could even be in the same room together  Millie is just too needy too overthetop to the more sensible Kit. However it's said that every person has his or her complement and the two women more sisters than friends seem to be just that.It's when Millie begins to succeed as a romance writer  a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts of her time  that the friendship starts to show signs of fraying at the seams. Millie shows her claws in hints and Kit moves on serving the war and doing more relevant things with her life. But for a movie that has two such stars it's only fitting that somehow they remain together because after all... they're friends and this is a soap opera about longtime friends after all.OLD ACQUAINTANCE is a good woman's picture. It has good pacing and despite covering over twentyodd years between the lives of these two women it doesn't feel slow or repetitive. Interesting is the relationship that develops between Kit and Deirdre Dolores Moran Millie's daughter who at times reacts to Kit as if she were her own mother and not Millie. Of note as well is how Davis looks in her role  one only has to see how she'd look ten years later to see how accurate the makeup department got it. Where the movie goes into its only dramatic moment is the confrontation scene  dragged out with takes upon takes since Hopkins was overacting trying to make Davis' character more vicious but only succeeding in making herself look more the vicious woman caught  and the reconciliation scene which is highly unlikely. But in ending the movie on this note it's a striking irony that for the second and last time both actresses who detested each other and had major demands on set gave their best performances. The result is the movie that became OLD ACQUAINTANCE.".

	schema:reviewBody "The context for this film makes it a lot more interesting to watch. Several years before this movie was made Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins also starred in Old Maid. During this filming the two volatile actresses fought like dogs. It got so bad that Davis even ended up sleeping with Hopkins' husbandand they truly hated each other. In fact the acrimony between them was far worse than the much publicized feud between Davis and Joan Crawford. How they got these two together for another film is curious but Davis must have enjoyed it immensely as she played a woman who was practically a saint and Hopkins was forces to play someone who is thoroughly despicable.The film begins in the 1920s. Davis is returning to her old home town after man years' absence. In the interim she's become a wellrespected author and the town is gearing up for her return. However of all the people anticipating the one who has put the most energy into it is Hopkins. It seems she and Davis grew up together and Hopkins has grand plans about their reunion. However it soon becomes obvious that Hopkins really wants to be the center of attention and when others intrude on her plans she becomes furious and behaves like a child. Davis and Hopkins are able to patch things upmostly because Davis like she did throughout the film made a lot of allowances for friend. In other words she bit her tongue and remembered how much she cared for her.During this tempestuous reunion the very shallow Hopkins announces that she thinks it must not be that difficult to become a famous author and she's decided to become one too! A normal friend would have been annoyed but Davis takes this in a goodnatured way. Amazingly after a few more years Hopkins IS a famous author. While not as wellrespected as Davis her books are smash successes. Unfortunately while she is now rich and famous her immaturity and selfishness have been allowed to blossom. Though in love with herself he daughter is more like a household object and her husband can't stand her. Eventually the husband divulges to Davis that he loves her and asks her to marry him but Davis is too good a person and sends him packing.Over time Davis and Hopkins remain friends. However as throughout the entire film you wonder why! After all Hopkins is thoughtless and selfcentered. But Davis is always her friendhelping her raise her daughter since the husband had long since left. Hopkins' horridly selfish life gets more and more difficult for those around her and the viewer is left to wonder how much longer this will go until Davis kills her. Well this does lead to one of the best showdowns in filmthe scene between them is a true classic. However by the end even after this big showdown the two are reunited as friendsa very dissatisfying ending for an otherwise perfect film.While there is a lot more to the film than this including a subplot involving Gig Young and the grown daughter of Hopkins but this is really not all that importantthe fireworks between Hopkins and Davis are. That is THE reason to watch this film. And despite the DVD having a short entitled Old Acquaintance A Classic Woman's Picture and having commentary by a gay man throughout the commentary track I hate when films are seen as a 'woman's film'Old Acquaintance is a wonderful film regardless who watches it! This is one straight man who had a thoroughly wonderful time watching!By the way I have read quite a bit about both actresses and can say that both had enormous egos and many around them hated them though there were many exceptions as well. But at least in the case of Davis despite being a rather nasty person she was a heck of a terrific actress. As for Hopkins her temperamental nature appears to have led to her oncepromising career to have fizzled soon after Old Acquaintance.".

Her subtlety in The Great Lie lead to Mary Astor winning an Oscar She graciously took second fiddle to the outrageous Monty Woolley in The Man Who Came to Dinner and allowed Paul Lukas front burner in Watch on the Rhine to lead him to his own Oscar as well. For her second pairing with Miriam Hopkins she simply reacted while Hopkins overacted and the result was Davis stealing away the film without really trying.Like her character in The Old Maid her first pairing with Hopkins sympathy ended up being on her side not Hopkins. At least in The Old Maid Hopkins allowed subtly fake charm to dominate her performance. But here she chews the scenery with so much venom the meat of her performance never reaches her digestive system. She makes the character of the selfish and silly housewife and mothertobe so resentful of Davis that it seems that she actually hates every aspect of the character that Davis plays fictional or not. Whether or not the truth of the rivalry between these two ladies off screen was true or not Davis acts like it is nonexistent while Hopkins seems determined to upstage her costar every chance she gets.Even when they are having meaningful hearttohearts Hopkins acts entirely too grand as if she was the diva in an opera and the sympathy that should be there for her character abandoned by her husband after she achieves success as a writer of trashy romantic novels simply vanishes. After one confrontation it is obvious that Davis's character and perhaps Bette herself has just had enough quietly shuts the door walks back to Hopkins after changing her mind about leaving and you can hear yourself shouting Knock her lights out!Hopkins so good in her early romantic dramas sinks to a new low here and thus after this was reduced to touring mostly in stock and supporting parts in films where she often bellowed her lines. The one film of her later career that somehow lacked this was a sympathetic role in The Heiress where she simply played the role as written. John Loder wins sympathy as Hopkins' husband who smartly walks out after simply having had enough leaving her with barely a word. Gig Young is handsome as the younger man who proposes to Davis all the while unknowingly in love with Hopkins and Loder's grownup daughter Donna Moran. If you want to see the difference between a braying performance and one with similar selfishness played with realistic acting watch Moran's initially spoiled brat have her tantrum then slowly return to reality with a glow as she begins to see things beyond her own ego. Esther Dale gets some good moments as Davis's housekeeper and Anne Revere has a memorable onescene cameo as a reporter interviewing Davis. Hopkins really does well in this one scene with her reaction to Revere's embarrassment after insulting typical romantic trash novels like herself.In spite of the film's shortcomings this soap opera is fascinating to watch and one longs to have been an extra or crew member to have witnessed what really went on. Davis makes her acting look so easy but at times you begin to feel sorry for everybody in the film and on the set even Hopkins because it seems that everybody including her must have had a terrible headache because of her constant ranting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Old Acquaintance started as a Broadway play by John Van Druten and ran 170 performances during the 194041 season. It is the quintessential star vehicle and two Broadway legends Jane Cowl and Peggy Wood played the rival women on stage. On screen the film version stars Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins and in this instance it really helped to have two women who positively loathed each other in real life. Helped enormously with their performances.The two are childhood friends and rival authors Bette is a writer of seriously acclaimed classics that just don't sell and Miriam is the Jacqueline Susann of the pair a writer of potboiler trash fiction that the public eats up. For reasons never explained by the film Miriam nurses a pent up jealousy over Bette which Davis patiently bears throughout most of the film which takes place over a twenty year period in their lives. Davis rightly can't figure it out Miriam is the one with the husband and child both of whom she smothers with her overbearing personality. The Broadway play which took place in only one setting the Davis character's apartment was considerably expanded for the screen and I will say that the play's stage origins are barely noticeable. The play and the film are strictly vehicles for the two stars the other players would dare not intrude even if their parts permitted. Old Acquaintance in the hands of players less capable of Davis and Hopkins would be a disaster. But with the two of them it is one camp treat.".

Millie and Kit Marlowe Bette Davis have been friends from girlhood and Kit becomes even in her 20's a renowned author a critical success but not a tremendously financial one. Millie on the other hand already married to a successful engineer and also pregnant decides to compete with Kit and write too. However she pounds out trashy romance novels that are a hit with the masses and therefore make her rich but not critically acclaimed. And that's really all that Millie has wanted since childhood  to be better at Kit at SOMETHING. And yet she keeps failing because Kit's strength is not in what she has but what she is.Now Hopkins plays Millie so over the top and childish that it is hard to dislike her. She takes her husband Preston for granted and loses him  he grows to love Kit but she says that is a line friends simply do not cross even if the break up of the marriage had nothing to do with their feelings. Millie spends so much time on her career that her daughter Deirdre comes to think of Kit as a mom just as much as Millie. How will this all work out? Watch and find out. I will tell you that the surprises are in the men not in the women. Millie takes everything the way you would expect her to  throwing temper tantrums dressed in the finest fashions while Kit is the lighthouse the rock of stability through everything. Now back to the men. For one thing Millie's exhusband doesn't bother to see his daughter for over ten years! He wouldn't have seen her even then had it not been for Kit bringing them together. Preston is no bum he's had a good career but no time or place for his daughter in his life? Then there is Kit's beau during the war years who is ten years younger than her and is constantly nagging her to marry him. Their age means nothing he promises she's all he's ever wanted ... BUT one walk with Deirdre who is practically Kit's daughter and he dumps his 42 year old fiance for a 19 year old girl? Men! How did we win a world war with these weasels in charge? I've given a great deal of the plot away but the joy is in the execution not the details. I will give this as a sign of how much it interested me. I was getting ready to exercise and this was on Turner Classic Movies. I usually like to listen to music when I exercise but this film so interested me  it was not your standard 40's soap opera  that I actually watched the film during my workout and then dragged out one of my Bette Davis collections to see the entire thing.Highly recommended. Just one thing. Do you think Miriam Hopkins did such a good job because maybe Millie actually WAS the real Miriam Hopkins? Just wondering.".

The woman vs. woman war so prominent in the films of the 1930s '40s and '50s gets some serious ammunition with this classic film. As excellent as it is it is unfortunately not available on VHSDVD nor does it get the recognition bestowed upon many of Davis' other and dare I say lesser movies.Davis plays writer Kit Marlowe a woman who is unable to find true happiness as she selflessly puts the needs of her childhood friend MillyMiriam Hopkins ahead of her own desires. Milly a selfabsorbed insecure  even childlike  housewife is constantly in competition with Kit. As the two woman have successes over the years their friendship endures strains but never totally collapses. The battle between them even extends to Milly's teenage daughterDolores Moranduring the later years of their lives.Davis nails the cattiness insecurity and selfeffacing humor that embodies Kit. Hopkins also succeeds as Milly. Even though Milly's selfdestructive jealousies border on tedious and Hopkins almost succumbs to overacting Hopkins manages to pull back the reigns just in time. As good as Old Acquaintance is however there are moments that just don't ring true. For example why wouldn't a teenage DeirdreMoranrecognize her own fatherJohn Loder even if she hadn't seen him in a decade? Surely she would have seen a photo or had a faint memory. Despite that though this is a great classic just waiting to be restored and released. Fine writing classic lines smooth direction and stellar performances are what drive this film. One of Davis' finest and a shining entry into the women's genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins reunite after being together in The Old Maid! It sets practical but lonely Bette against flighty but happy Miriam. Bette plays Kit Marlowe..a single successful author coming home to the small town she grew up in. She meets up again with childhood friend Millie Drake played by Miriam Hopkins. There's always been a bit of a rivalry between the two even though they've been friends. Millie has a daughter a husband and love. Kit has a successful career but no one really to love in her life. Kit's visit triggers jealously in Millie so she decides to become a successful author like Kit. She writes a steamy sexy book and Kit helps it along with her connections. Lo and behold the book becomes a best seller starting Millie on a career eclipsing her old friend's career but she loses her husband along the way when she lets success go to her head.The subplots swirl around these two women...Millie's envy of Kit and then Kit's help turns Millie into a success but she loses her husband who becomes infatuated with Kit. Preston professes his love for Kit but she in turn tells him no because of Millie and her daughter. Kit falls in love with a younger man but she finds herself unwilling to commit because of his age. He in turn falls in love with Millie's daughter. When Kit finally realizes what she has and wants to be with him he admits to her how he has fallen for another woman..the daughter Kit never had..the daughter of her best friend. The threads weave in and out of these two women keeping them bound together. When Millie finds out Preston was attracted to Kit long ago she sets this scene up which is one of the funniest I've seen from Bette Davis. Millie admits to Kit that she told her daughter Kit and Preston were having an affair. She goes off on a selfpitying tirade at Kit. Kit tries to reason with her to no avail. Finally Kit leaves the apartment only to come right back again. She walks over to Millie and then shakes the life out of her and throws her down on the couch.After reading interviews by Ms. Davis about some of her frustration at some roles she has endured it was a revealing look at how she wanted to shake the life out of some producers and directors. Ms. Hopkin's hair and shoulders were just shaking with it and you have to wonder how many takes it took for this one.The end finds them there in Kit's apartment drinking champagne and watching the fire. They've shared more than just a friendship now. They're shared the loss of love but have kept their friendship intact.This is a delightful movie and one worth watching. It reminds us how friends alway stick no matter what. No one is perfect and each have faults and good qualities. It is true old acquaintances can accept both good and bad and stick to the end!".

I won't repeat the plot as it has been covered in other reviews. Davis is looking good as the professional woman that she portrays and although she does her typical schtick with cigarettes and hand gestures she is a little more subdued than usual. You can almost believe her affair with the boyish Gig Young and her sorrow as it ends. You however can never believe that the elegant John Loder could have been married to Hopkins.......he belonged with Davis but it was not to be. My favorite scene has to be when Davis shakes the snot out of Hopkins and since it has been reported that they didn't like each other I'm sure it was Bette's favorite scene as well.If you like soap operas and sacrifice then this film is for you. It's not as bad as it appears initially.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film follows the friendship of two friends from 1924 to 1943. One is Kit Marlowe Bette Davis who writes serious books that never make money. The other is Mildred Drake Miriam Hopkins who writes pulp novels by the dozens...and makes tons of money. Also involved is Preston Dake John Loder Mildred's husband her high strung daughter Deirdre Dolores Moran and Rudd Kendall a ridiculously young Gig Young who wants to marry Kit.Next to Now Voyager this is my favorite Bette Davis film. It's beautifully done with a good script direction and acting. It's never dull and the passing of years is done great. Hopkins is WAY over the top here screeching most of her lines marching across a room arms flying eyes wide open...but it fits her character. Davis is much more lowkey and it works beautifully. The contrasts of the two characters is right on target. It's well known that the two actresses hated each other but it actually helps the movie. At one point Davis has to calmly reach out and grab Hopkons and shake her violently. It's a GREAT scene. The supporting cast is good too except for Loder. WAY too wooden in his role. Still this is a great movie well worth catching. Updated and remade in 1981 as Rich and Famous. That's also a good movie but not as good as this one.".

The overthetop part goes to Miriam Hopkins. She's just steady as she goes throughout the whole film...and that was a rarity in her career.The basic outline of this one is that Bette Davis has a lifelong friend and one year she goes and visits her back home. From there we start to see her friend become enviousjealous and this is a catalyst for her to become and author like Davis is...but with romance novels instead. This premise leads to fights marriage breakup and Davis basically raising her friends child. Her friends whole life is success and she equates that to money. Money makes things better. But Davis doesn't livesee life like that.The whole film you realize that Davis is just a really good person. She's very patient and just nice to everyone and genuinely cares for her friend and there family. She's what everyone should strive to be like. Basically she's the rock of the group. I think this film really hits the nail on the head with what real friendships are like in real life. One in the bunch who's the rock and one who's over ambitious and thinks money is the most important thing. Everyone knows though...in life...money comes and goes but your friends if you treat em right...last a lifetime.".

But it's not because of Bette Davis.One reason is that in my view the film sort of wanders. I got to thinking that if someone asked me what the film was about in ONE sentence I couldn't tell them. It would take a paragraph...or more.But importantly this film finally answered a question I have long had. Was Miriam Hopkins a really good actress? After watching this film a couple of times I have come to the conclusion that the answer is NO! NO! A thousand times NO! I think she is horrible and overthetop in this film and frankly I have grown tired of her frequent performances as a foolish ninny. Perhaps some others agreed since after this film she didn't make another movie for 6 long years. If you want to watch a horrid performance perhaps this is a good reason for you to watch this film. And the famous scene where Bette Davis violently shakes her which even Davis claims she enjoyed doing in a realistic manner...shaking her was not enough. She should have slapped her a few times as well.Davis' performance her is quite good. Isn't it always? This is the good Davis you'd probably enjoy knowing.Gig Young has a supporting role here and it's nice to see another of his early films where he showed a flair for drama rather than his later films where he seemed to always show up as the lead male actor's best pal. John Loder as Hopkin's husband is very pleasant here and he's in a role that is very sympathetic. And Esther Dale is wonderful as always playing the maid.In terms of plot in my view it wanders. You're unlikely to be able to get a grasp of where the story is going. At first this is refreshing when you assume Mariam Hopkins book is going to be awful and she will hate Bette Davis for telling her so. Instead Hopkins goes on to write pop books that sell while Davis writes deeper books that don't sell but impress the critics. And so the film takes off in a different direction than you expect and continues to do so throughout.I enjoyed Bette Davis here and most of the rest of the cast but Mariam Hopkins is so awful it's entertaining...but for all the wrong reasons. Still it's worth watching at least once.".

Home is not where the heart is.We have many flashbacks of the outofwhack dynamics of Chris's childhood. Most of which weren't need primarily because these are good actors so we only needed a scene or two to see that Chris never got the love and support that he should have.Chris as an adult is an emotionallydistant and cynical young man. His beautiful girlfriend Anne Lucy Liu beautiful on the inside and out thinks he can grow up accept his parents and then enter into a mature and committed relationship with her if he has a hearttoheart with his father in the hospital. You know the father who's in a coma and the one who has never said a meaningful word to his son in his entire life  oh how naive some supporting characters can be. The almost brilliantly funny scene of Chris attempting a conversation with his father in the hospital only landed him in jail. Maturity will have to come later.This is Jimmy Fallon playing a very sullen man in a dramacomedy that is mostly drama. Almost completely drama with a lot of slow scenes building up to emotionallyabusive results which we already knew from previous slow scenes building up to emotionallyabusive results. These struggles with maturity have been seen before either in other dysfunctional family dramedies or in the first few scenes or trailer of this film since they didn't have too much more to add but The Year of Getting to Know Us is a pretty good film well acted and with solid characters.".

During the QA in which the director and entire cast were present no one in the audience had anything worth saying because the film was so awful. It was a pretty awkward moment.Considering all of the 10s this film has received it seems to me that people connected with the film are clearly the ones giving it a rating without considering the quality of the final product. If you honestly think this is a good film you have no taste when it comes to filmmaking.Jimmy Fallon is painfully one dimensional. Lucy Liu is good but her role has no meat it's sad that these are the only parts she is given. Tom Arnold is not an actor and never has been. Sharon Stone is caricaturish. Illeana Douglas and Tony Hale give the best performances but in minor roles. What most people don't know about this film is that the director cuts back and forth between the present and the past at least twenty times an overused technique that not even the most mundane film students resort to these days. This forces Arnold and Stone who play Fallon's parents to carry a major portion of the film in the flashbacks.There is rarely a truthful moment in the film. The script is contrived. The clich ending can be seen in any belowaverage Hollywood romantic comedy. I hope this director grows in maturity before he writes or directs another film. He had the budget and resources at his fingertips but blew his opportunity because he wasn't properly equipped.Which Sundance programmer allowed this film to be shown? They should be ashamed of themselves. The work speaks for itself and it clearly falls short. I'd hate to think that the programmer was being wooed by the producer's rep or other people behind the film without considering the ramifications of screening something of this quality at Sundance. Is this what Redford's vision has come to?".

Bergman was the best at it so it's not a knock Dreams is another in one of his probing examinations however in a manner that almost suggests he wasn't putting as much time and effort into the script as usual in an interview he said he didn't consider it very highly in his oeuvre and had some bad memories of his time with Harriet Andersson with their personal relationship coincidentally her character has a rough breakup early in the picture. But saying that Bergman wasn't putting as much time and effort is suffice to say that he still makes it very intriguing very entertaining in that suffocatingdramatic Bergman sense where you can feel all humanity sucking out of the room and back in again with every beat in some scenes and with a take on the sexes that allows for some probing hard to see in other movies.We're given two women who work in the fashion photography profession one a model Andersson and the other a producerdirector type Eva Dahlbeck. At the start we get right into a claustrophobic sense of unease for these girls set right by the tone of a man in the room a fat man tapping his fingers while waiting for a shot to set up and then once again on another one. Tension spills out in the dressing room the engagement off between Andersson and her fiance. Meanwhile Dahlbeck calls her lover who can't come to the phone for long. After this Bergman starts to play a sort of trick on the viewer what happens to these women with their respective men is it dream or reality? Andersson's situation is that she's looking at dresses through the outside windows and an old man Gunnar Bjornstrand with a nice oldman beard that isn't too shabby offers to buy her the dress jewelry whatever she wants. To display the generational gap she asks for chocolate with whipped cream and as something I thought I'd never see in a Bergman film a rollicking trip to the amusement park to ride rollercoasters and shift through a haunted house.This all seems to be leading to a note that suddenly becomes all the more clear and I wondered what gives? if this was Bergman presenting dreams. Perhaps he means in the more fragmentary sense of well these women have dreams of some men but... these aren't them. This leads to Dahlbeck's scenes which are a good sharp contrast to Andersson's. With the latter there's some blocks where the two don't talk she puts on a record that spins some cool jazz as the two dance a little and have a silentmovie repore with champagne and for the former it's what some fans of the late Swedish filmmaker love more than anything characters in personal agony over not realizing a personal connection through lots and lots of dialog. What's impressive here isn't so much the performances persay which are a little cold but how much restraint Bergman has with the camera as this situation with Dahlbeck's cold professional she fires Andersson at one point for being late with the old man turns into a foolhearty tugofwar of emotions between an equally cold wife of Dahlbeck's lover. If there is any one juicy section in Dreams and not counting specific scenes like when Dahlbeck has her head out the window of the train which is very beautifully executed it's this one.Somehow Bergman pulls out a semihappy ending if not without a bit of a coda as to what may happen with these still emotionally entangled souls. If only the structure somehow was worked out a little better I'm not sure how I could criticize it more than that even a flaw from a genius is still a genius move if that make sense it would be a great film. As it stands there's a lot of greatness in the film only to feel very slightly like an excellent minor work. Still stay tuned for little winks to the audience like a rare Hitchcock type cameo strange considering Bergman's opinion of the director or a mention of the last time Bjornstrand's lonely rich old man saw a movie 1918 which is Bergman's year of birth. 8.510".

The two travel to a location shoot and the story splits in two as each has their own romantic misadventure. Andersson is admired by an older rich man Gunnar Bjornstrand who buys her all kinds of nice things. Eventually she follows him back to his home where she learns of his troubles. Dahlbeck contacts a married man with whom she was having an affair Ulf Palme and when the two meet Palme's wife shows up to disrupt the assignation. The Dahlbeck segment is pretty typical Bergman but of course it's beautifully done with some fantastic acting by Dahlbeck. I thought the AndressonBjornstrand segment was just wonderful. I think this might be Bjornstrand's best performance. Certainly very high up there. I also really loved Kerstin Hedeby who plays Bjornstrand's daughter. This may feel like a small film in Bergman's career but it's an excellent small one. The laidback style especially the long wordless sequences reminds me more of the Italian films of the period than of Bergman. This certainly would be better regarded if it were directed by Visconti or Antonioni. 910. YES.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dreams begins with a photography shoot. It is the land of Dreams. We meet Doris the model. Soon we are drawn into her world. She is engaged. Trouble is her beau is rather straight. She has big aspirations. She wants more out of life. But she is not the only one with dreams. The photographer Susanne is missing her ex lover. Trouble is he broke the relationship off because he is married. She's not about to let that stop her.To say more would be to ruin the plot but we soon meet other characters who also have Dreams. It seems we all do but more often than not we are not allowed to achieve them. And perhaps that's not always a bad thing. We seem to spend most of our lives with desires untapped and unreachable. Bergman knows this all too well and tortures his characters with their yearnings desires out of step with the mechanics of day to day living. It provides excellent drama. As always Bergman keeps the struggle between man and woman as tension filled lovers foremost in the frame. There is desire but it is fraught with problems.It's not Bergman's best film. The characters can sometimes seem selfish but this is the point. How do we exist in the world if we cannot have what we want? It's a heartbreaking realization.Some say Bergman is the greatest Director the world has ever seen. I'm not sure about that. Tarkovsky was a visual genius but Bergman is certainly more intimate his stories personal and instantly identifiable. He achieves success again with Dreams.".

It is superbly directed and beautifully made an oftcharacteristic with Bergman's films. The music is hauntingly understated while the dialogue is written in a meaningful and thoughtprovoking way and the story is austere romantic painful and ironic and observed in a masterful way. The characters are seen as selfish but compellingly real while the acting has nothing that would strike anybody as questionable. Harriet Anderssen ties with Liv Ullman as the best of the female performers in Bergman's films and her performance is utterly magnetic in every way possible quite charming and very photogenic. Eva Dahlbeck looking very classy and stunningly elegant and Gunnar Bjornstrand provide great support and Bergman himself even makes a cameo.

	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning there was only one Bergman and her name was Ingrid. The year 1957 finally brought to international fame the Swedish filmmaker of the same name.Undeniably with The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries Ingmar Bergman established himself as the most promising and influential filmmaker of his generation His importance as both a director and explorer of the human condition immediately went without saying and no film he made ever contradicted his reputation. Bergman is perhaps the director who comes the closest to every of his peers agreeing that he's the greatest. But greatness doesn't pop out of nowhere you just don't become a gifted filmmaker without learning about filmmaking first.Like Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford Bergman had to make 'his bones' to make his share of movies whose fate would be to be recognized by a fistful of experts but that's the price for technical talent exploiting before plotting experimenting before exploring testing before stating and reacting before creating. Dreams is one of Bergman's 'pre1957' movies and what's more it is the last one made before The Seventh Seal. To use a metaphor Dreams is like the last drop of water before some beautiful flower would finally bloom like the last contemplation of a quiet internal comfort before the big dive into the most fascinating depths of human complexities.There are some premises of a coming genius in the portrayals of these two women Suzanne Eva Dahlbeck the owner of a model agency and Doris Harriet Anderson her most popular model. Suzanne seems a bit older something between five or ten years enough for maturity and leadership. She holds her cigarette with a disillusioned look that reconciles between American filmnoir and French New Wave. In a way she's a femmefatale who'd be her own victim. Doris exudes a totally different beauty more lively and youthful as if Harriett Anderson hadn't lost the magnificent and sensual appeal of her role as Monika from Bergman's erotic romance.In the model agency ruled by a sleazy fat boss and a few effeminate photographers Doris breaks up with her boyfriend right before leaving town. The friend seems like a goodhearted but dimwitted fellow and between them it's a loveandhate relationship that flirts with comic relief. Yet Bergman's point is to highlight a paradoxical attitude in Doris she wants freedom but dares her friend to leave her she thinks her beauty allows her some liberty but is reluctant to take chances. This paradox also strikes Suzanne who during the crucial train scene is at the edge of committing suicide as If she came at a point of her life with no light after the tunnel.Before the photography session the two women split up and surprisingly the film starts focusing on Doris. She meets an elegant and distinguished man who describes himself as an Aging consul. His name is Otto and he's played by Gunnar Bjrnstrand Bergman's longtime partner. Although only 46 at the time of the film his hair is whiter to make him look 10 years older and accentuate the gap with Doris. He buys her a beautiful dress a pearl collier some food they go to carnival in some scenes that would have looked like a reminiscence of Nights of Cabiria if the film wasn't made before. Doris thinking she deserves it she accepts to have a sugardaddy smiling the kind of smile that suggests there's nothing harmful in such relationship.The idyll goes on until his daughter comes home and treats Doris like a whore and although reluctant to call her dad a 'dirty old man' she understands he's only exploiting Doris' resemblance with his wife to fulfill some illusions. Doris finally leaves the house but when she tries to be affectionate with Otto he dismisses her. That moment is particularly heartbreaking in its unfairness the viewer inevitably empathizes with Doris although not denying that she had it coming. It wasn't her fault but as a beauty model she knew the price to pay when you expose herself to the wrong kind of viewers. It's all about how people look at you and sometimes the streets isn't the right perspective.The same social weight disturbs Suzanne's romantic interlude with Henri. She wants him madly and deeply she's ready to share him for a few weeks with his wife even if it was possible she hardly tries to hide her neediness. The scene is also interrupted by an intruder supposedly representing the 'good side' she's the wife and brandishing the flag of her wealth she forces her husband to surrender and abandon his invitation to Oslo. Suzanne tries to cope with it with dignity but when Henri comes back she lowers her guard again. 'Society' and 'normal people' is perhaps the closest thing to antagonists in the way they portray men as weaklings when they choose to judge instead of act.I like to see in Dreams not just an immersion in the hearts of women of 'bad reputation' but a strong denunciation of the weight of social morals and the way they hypocritically condemn some actions that remain driven by harmless desires. At the end Doris accepts to be with Palle because she's in love with him the way he is and it will never be as ugly as that wife who 'loves' her husband only because she knows he can't leave her the same man tries to cancel off the first impression by inviting Suzanne again but she tears up the letter. She learned how to say no.As a man I can relate to that weakness where we postpone the right reaction for the most convenient reasons. Things haven't changed a bit we allow ourselves to judge women who exposes themselves in the paper or in the streets except that through our own lust they expose our own hypocrisy and inner weakness. Simple but genius and this is isn't even Bergman's best.".

Realism is of course the artistic style most commonly used to achieve an impression of reality and it is what Bergman utilises here and despite the occasional threat of the story descending into a banal soap opera he manages to create an engaging work of art.Within the imaginary world of the film is the artificial world of the fashion photographer and her model a world where appearance is more important than reality. Of course marketers use the dreams and illusions created by the fashion industry to stimulate desires so this perfectly reflects the theme of the film that of unfulfilled dreams and the more mundane reality behind the illusion.Indeed the photographer finds she cannot manipulate reality as easily as she can manipulate her artwork and the model finds that appearance without character and substance behind does not provide enough advantage for her to achieve her goals in her professional or private life.The cinematography and lighting throughout the film are textbook perfect but do not draw attention to themselves thus reinforcing the realist style.The jazz soundtrack is both gritty and dream also reflecting the duality of dreams and reality and providing the kind of cohesion between the two which the characters themselves seek.Ultimately the relationship issues surrounding these two female characters are not resolved but they do find support from each other and come to the understanding that dreams are worth pursuing providing they are dreams of substance and not reflections of personal selfish desire. Indeed one may also read the film in such a way that the older photographer personifies the real world while the model through her naivety reflects dreams so some viewers may consider the final reconciling embrace between the two to be a little too banal but it does seem to work well and provide a satisfying coda to this small film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman's 1955 film KVINNODRM Women's Dreams released in the Englishspeaking world as simply Dreams has two interwoven plots that each involve a woman coming face to face with her aspirations to love and romance and being disappointed. Susanne Eva Dahlbeck runs an agency for fashion models in Stockholm but she is distracted from work by an obsession with a married man played by Ulf Palme whose mistress she once was. Though the affair has been cut off Susanne continues to stalk him. Meanwhile one her models Doris Harriet Andersson is seduced by a rich old man Gunnar Bjrnstrand who identifies her love of expensive clothes and jewelry as her weak spot.The 1950s were anni mirabili for Ingmar Bergman when he was increasingly cementing a reputation as one of the finest filmmakers in the world. Though this 1955 effort came out right in the middle of such legendary achievements as Summer with Monika Sawdust and Tinsel and The Seventh Seal it has never been considered one of Bergman's better films and there hasn't even been much of a push to recognize it as a lost masterpiece like some other lesserknown works of this period. The plot revisits already wellworth themes. Plus I was very underwhelmed by the initial minutes of the film which sinks into pure melodrama at one point as Susanne agonizes on a train and considers suicide. The film is shot in a dry realistic style and lacks the dazzling effects that Bergman had already begun to employ.However the film is certainly worthwhile for established fans of Bergman through the performances he evokes from the actors. Dahlbeck who was considered quite a great talent and beauty in her day leaves me cold but Ulf Palme elicits simultaneous sympathy and disgust as the henpecked husband that Sussane has an affair with. Inga Landgr's small but climactic part as the man's wife thrills with her composed delivery of devastating lines. The real stars of the film however are Andersson and Bjrnstrand. Harriet Andersson was a sex bomb and often played roles that capitalized on that but here her ditzy Doris is a fullfledged character of her own different from Andersson's appearances in other Bergman films. She also knows how to drive so much of the interpersonal action with her deft facial expressions alone. Bjrnstrand is admirable for the charm and grace he shows as the old seducer and with poise he gradually shows the cracks in the faade as their fling might not have been a good idea after all.".

As she tries to get her bearings she window shops and is approached by a rich old man a widower who buys her an expensive dress jewels and shoes. They go to an amusement part where she has a great time while his strength begins to fizzle. They go back to his huge house and frolic like teenagers. They both have too much to drink and she is trying to seduce him when his daughter shows up and embarrasses both of them. She is stunned at how foolish she has been.

	schema:reviewBody "'Liegen lernen' which could be translated as learning to lie down is the story of Helmut played rather dryly by Fabian Busch during that period of life when one tries out relationships until one decides what one wants from life. Although the political developments leading up to and after the unification of Germany are kept audibly and visibly as a recurring feature they are only a backdrop to the tale and do not form or even affect the plot.Because of the dryness of Helmut's character the voiceovers throughout the film are necessary for the viewer to get an insight into his personality and development. Whilst there have been many more interesting lead characters the realistic handling of the feelings and conflicts of this crucial phase of personality building makes the unfolding of the plot somewhat fascinating.The same story with identical characters of both sexes could have been told in any city or larger town in any modern country but at least the changes in East Berlin add an extra deepness to the drama of economic progress which in the context of this film are kept even more moderate as I personally have experienced in West Germany.The film is directed by Hendrik Handloegten but as in many Rainer Werner Fassbinder films especially 'Berlin Alexanderplatz' whilst the male roles are convincing the female roles do not quite seem to fit into the background in which the events take place. They are fun to watch but simply not realistic enough to be convincing. Britta played by Susanne Bormann lights up the screen and enhances the entertainment value even more than Gisela played by Fritzi Haberlandt and the others.The pace is sometimes too slow and although the female characters are in some ways too extreme in other aspects they fail to generate as much contrast as those in 'L'Homme qui aimait les femmes' or even 'Dr T and the Women'. However this is understandable because this film is not attempting to portray the infinite variety of the female character in modern society merely following a particular man's life in an important period of his life.The film is entertaining but fails to make the most of the dramatic possibilities.".

Although it covers a lot of the same ground that's been covered in 17842 other films Liegen Lernen does it in a way that's a little less smarmy or girliemushy.Most chick films or romantic comedies center on the female lead or on both the female and male lead. It was refreshing to see the focus in this one be almost exclusively from the male perspective. But don't let that stop you if you're one of the fairer sex.Some might think it's a cheap shortcut but Helmut's narration voiceover gives you a chance to really get inside his head. The conflict in his head that pulls him between typical adolescent male behavior  even beyond adolescence  and enlightened adulthood is clearer and presented in a way that many guys can relate to.The characters and Helmut's relationships with them are realistic ones that people on both sides of the Atlantic can relate to small manageable circles of high school friends college and young adult years spent with an odd assortment of roommates old friends found even if briefly and of course a variety of loves that sometimes intersect but somehow all seem to be the driving force in one's life.It's funny without reverting to gross out gags  though there's nothing wrong with them as a rule. It's touching without feeling like an afterschool special. It's insightful without being overbearing. The soundtrack with a seemingly intentional absence of soaring violins and goofy pop love songs is appropriate as well.On the whole this is a wellbalanced movie that leaves you feeling like Why can't more films be like this one?Like most nonU.S. produced films this one is probably difficult if not impossible to find in the U.S. but if you can rentbuyborrow it.".

Henk Handloegten's second theatrical film as a director showcases him as a master actors' director working with a wonderful ensemble cast. Susanne Bormann shines as siren Britta with her very seductive yet somehow innocent play attitude towards love and the subsequent darker more experienced and somber shadow of her former self in later years. Fabian Busch Helmut makes the transition from schoolboy to 30something with a bit of makeup but mostly through changes in bearing and expressions. Fritzi Haberlandt is very convincing as the bourgeois girlfriend who is shattered by Helmut's careless unfaithfulness. A must see especially for people whose adolescent years fall into the tumultuous early Eighties and in general a very fine timeless pic painstakingly researched and effortlessly played. Kudos!".

I think the reason why this is such a great episode is due to the fact that this film is just so unbelievably bad you know? I mean these are the kind of movies that you just look at and question constantly how it got green lighted since it's just such an awful film. I'm not just saying bad I'm saying that there must have been about 5 million things wrong with this movie. There are tons and tons of continuity problems a woman who dies in one scene then the next scene she is a noticeable extra that's alive and well. The hero of the film has extremely horrible acting qualities not to mention that he screams like a girl. The sexy lady of the story looks like she's in her late fifties and again her acting is lousy. The villain won't stop with this ridiculous laughter. The story itself is just a bad one.The people in space on the Southern Sun are supposedly happy and looking for a new world to create something new and peaceful. But some apparently have grown impatient like Calgonyeah that's the villain's name sad isn't it? and his wise followers. But the leader of the Southern Sun who looks a lot like Santa Claus wishes peace so he assigns Dave Ryder to save the day. Along with Santa's daughter Lea she and Dave pretty much have to out maneuver Calgon just for God's sake who couldn't? I mean the man's body guard looks like a lobster.Space Mutiny is just in general a very bad film. I mean Mystery Science Theater 3000 sometimes gets some movies that are not so bad but Space Mutiny is one of those films that is all around just a bad mistake. I'm not sure if they people who made this movie really looked at it in the editing room and really thought that this was an excellent or decent movie. The acting the editing the continuity THE COSTUMES the sets the actors everything about this movie was just plain bad. The sounds and script was just so laughable. Space Mutiny is not even good enough to be a cult film the only thing that this film was good for was just the fact that it made one of the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes.

	schema:reviewBody "OK folks! Don't worry I won't be giving away anything important although I don't think I could spoil this movie if I tried. So off we go...As what sounds like Kintaro's arrangement of 'O Fortuna' wafts our way we are subjected to the film's opening credits. They look like they were produced by a Commodore 64 and they freeze up more than once because there are too darned many moving objects on the screen.Welcome to Battlestar Galactica I mean the Southern Sun! This ship is home to an entire civilization despite the fact that 90 of it appears to be a brewery. In charge of this magnificent flying basement is Captain Santa Claus assisted by his BillyIdolwannabe sidekick. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and still am not really sure what the plot is but it has something to do with a greasyhaired guy named Kalgan trying to disrupt the transportation of a bunch of magical  and of course extremely horny  women. Santa puts our seemingly braindamaged hero Ryder in charge of defeating Kalgan. Meanwhile Captain Santa's daughter Leah who somehow doesn't seem much younger than the Captain himself gets pretty chummy with Ryder. In the words of Crow T. Robot If you pretend you know what's going on it's actually kind of exciting.Watch and enjoy the following Vacuformed unitards ridiculously small weapons Santa's incredibly fake beard tinfoil muumuus Kalgan's giggling fits Ryder's bizarre reaction shots a woman who punches in at work despite the fact that she was just murdered Leah's sensual Dance of the Hoola Hoop the most '80s bar scene EVER women who reeeeeally like Van DeGraf Generators countless shots of computer screens graphics by Kenner Ryder's attempt to say 'auxiliary' and numerous molassesfast chase scenes involving golf carts... or floor waxers or something.This movie is not campy it's just that everything is wrong in all the right ways. Acting sets lighting costumes dialogue... they're all just plain goofy. These folks tried to make an exciting spacedrama  and maybe it would've been if they had dared to take ANYTHING up a notch  but every aspect of it just says space movie and nothing more.If this movie was just plain bad you might have to feel sad for the people that made it thinking it would work. However it makes such a leap into the ridiculous that you just have to laugh. A mustsee for fans of sobadit'sgood movies. And whether you love or hate scifi this is a very funny movie.I give it a 4  it may not affect you the way it's supposed to but it's great entertainment.".

So off we go...As what sounds like Kintaro's arrangement of 'O Fortuna' wafts our way we are subjected to the film's opening credits. They look like they were produced by a Commodore 64 and they freeze up more than once because there are too darned many moving objects on the screen.Welcome to Battlestar Galactica I mean the Southern Sun! This ship is home to an entire civilization despite the fact that 90 of it appears to be a brewery. In charge of this magnificent flying basement is Captain Santa Claus assisted by his BillyIdolwannabe sidekick. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and still am not really sure what the plot is but it has something to do with a greasyhaired guy named Kalgan trying to disrupt the transportation of a bunch of magical  and of course extremely horny  women. Santa puts our seemingly braindamaged hero Ryder in charge of defeating Kalgan. Meanwhile Captain Santa's daughter Leah who somehow doesn't seem much younger than the Captain himself gets pretty chummy with Ryder. In the words of Crow T. Robot If you pretend you know what's going on it's actually kind of exciting.Watch and enjoy the following Vacuformed unitards ridiculously small weapons Santa's incredibly fake beard tinfoil muumuus Kalgan's giggling fits Ryder's bizarre reaction shots a woman who punches in at work despite the fact that she was just murdered Leah's sensual Dance of the Hoola Hoop the most '80s bar scene EVER women who reeeeeally like Van DeGraf Generators countless shots of computer screens graphics by Kenner Ryder's attempt to say 'auxiliary' and numerous molassesfast chase scenes involving golf carts... or floor waxers or something.This movie is not campy it's just that everything is wrong in all the right ways. Acting sets lighting costumes dialogue... they're all just plain goofy. These folks tried to make an exciting spacedrama  and maybe it would've been if they had dared to take ANYTHING up a notch  but every aspect of it just says space movie and nothing more.If this movie was just plain bad you might have to feel sad for the people that made it thinking it would work. However it makes such a leap into the ridiculous that you just have to laugh. A mustsee for fans of sobadit'sgood movies. And whether you love or hate scifi this is a very funny movie.I give it a 4  it may not affect you the way it's supposed to but it's great entertainment.";

The film itself is just the worst kind of awful you can imagine.For a start the budget for any real effects was obviously nonexistent so they stole LOTS of shots from Battlestar Galactica. These scenes occur early on in the movie mostly and lead you to think that apart from the plagiarismit might not be too terrible. Wrong! After the initial ten minutes the Galactica stockfootage is rarely seen again but the inside of various industrial buildings is seen almost constantly. I was thinking Ah a late 70's early 80's era film where any old chemical or power plant interior would do as futuristic sets. Wrong again! This movie was made in 1988 not even twenty years ago! It's like the makers went through a time warp to the late 70's made the film then brought it back for our delight.But the plagiarism in another form continues right through the movie. The sound effects of the lasers are ripped straight from Battlestar Galactica again and also later on the sound of the lasers from Battle Beyond the Stars makes an appearance.Then there is the acting. Or rather the awful lack of it. Particularly bad is Chunk Benchpress aka Reb Brown who lumbers around the sets trying to look dashing and heroic then spoils the image by screaming like his 'nads have been caught in a food processor. The love interest for Chunk is old enough to be his mother or maybe even grandmother! and bares altogether too much flesh for someone of her advancing years and plastic surgery.The commander of the ship on which the mutiny takes place is Cameron Mitchell an actor of some note. What the Hell he was thinking in being in this is anybody's guess. But bad though his choice of movie is it's nothing compared to the ridiculous Father Christmas beard he's made to wear. It looks sooooo real nobody will be able to tell its a fake. Not!And finally the main cast is rounded off by John Phillip Law another actor who has some credit to his name At least prior to this turkey. Obviously he yearned for his wacky Barbarella days again and signed up for this abomination. I could never decide here whether he was actually trying to act or just hamming everything up. Suffice to say his maniacal cackling at even the slightest provocation ceases to be funny after the tenth or twentieth time.Other things to watch out for are the stupid golf carts done up to look like futuristic transportation. The cheap body shells wobble like they're only held on with tape and the chase scenes are just hysterical. It's like you've tuned into a rerun of The Banana Splits Show. Try humming Tralalah Lalalalah! as you watch and its even funnier.I won't mention the plot because there really isn't one to speak of. Just a flimsy premise that people who were actually born in space are more likely to yearn for a real planet to live on than those who came from a planet which sounds counterintuitive to me. Or in other words just plain dumb.Watch it as an MST3K episode and this one is great. Without their comments it might be rather too much to handle for any normal person. It thoroughly deserves its place in the bottom 100 of the IMDb. You have been warned!".

	schema:headline " Should of been titled Factory Mutiny!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that was riffed on by Mystery Science Theater 3000. There may be debate on whether a film deserves the riffing but this one most certainly deserves all the ridicule one can muster. A film that takes place on a spaceship but the only reason you would even know this are the occasional outside shots showing the ship flying or the dogfights however those outside shots are not even from this film but rather old clips from the television series Battlestar Galactica. The rest of the film looks like they shot in a high school for the bridge scenes the futuristic bar scene and the Ballerines' room and all the fight scenes take place in a factory. In some of the scenes you can clearly see the sunshine coming through the windows. Do not get me wrong there were a lot of bad science fiction films made during this time but this film makes Roger Corman's stuff look amazing! It was certainly done on the cheap side of things but I guess the hope is that you make it as incredibly cheap as possible and hopefully you can trick people into coming into the theater to see it with an awesome poster. Which could be done back in the day as there was no internet and suffice to say that trick did work on my parents a couple of times. Thankfully they did not have to sit through this horrible train wreck and neither did I that is until the gang from the Satellite of Love took no prisoners! The story is a mess. You start out getting a voice over explaining that what is left of the people of Earth live on this large spaceship and that they are content to live there however there is a faction that wishes to leave said ship. Granted I cannot say I blame them for wanting to leave if that futuristic bar is an example of the entertainment! Well there is a space battle that is completely random and is just a clip from Battlestar Galactica and then we meet Ryder who is beefy and the only one who can take out Kalgon and his evil army! Ryder falls in love with the commander of the ship's daughter. The daughter looks about the same age as her father as we get a woman trying to play the role of someone younger. Not going to say she looks bad but she does look too old to be playing the love interest. There are kidnappings betrayal and strange women who are called Ballerines that really serve no purpose...This film was rightfully riffed by MST3K as it is kind of a mess. They riff the fact there are a lot of people flung over railings and rightfully so as there are a lot of people who get killed and then get flung over a railing! The woman's age is also a running joke as is the beefy hero. The most ridiculous thing that occurs in this film is when they start chasing each other in little carts that go at an extremely slow speed making one wonder why they do not just run or something? So this is a bad film as the best parts are the clips from an old television show. Too much going on that makes no sense as you have random space pirate attacks that really go nowhere and people wrapped in plastic. Kalgon seems to be nothing but a mere human yet they act like he is a super powered foe and how exactly did he gain so much power? One also has to wonder why they cannot just leave the ship as Ryder the hero came on board and came from somewhere else. Just a mess as this one has virtually no redeeming qualities. Makes another Reb Brown film Yor the Hunter from the Future look great by comparison.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a film that was riffed on by Mystery Science Theater 3000. There may be debate on whether a film deserves the riffing but this one most certainly deserves all the ridicule one can muster. A film that takes place on a spaceship but the only reason you would even know this are the occasional outside shots showing the ship flying or the dogfights however those outside shots are not even from this film but rather old clips from the television series Battlestar Galactica. The rest of the film looks like they shot in a high school for the bridge scenes the futuristic bar scene and the Ballerines' room and all the fight scenes take place in a factory. In some of the scenes you can clearly see the sunshine coming through the windows. Do not get me wrong there were a lot of bad science fiction films made during this time but this film makes Roger Corman's stuff look amazing! It was certainly done on the cheap side of things but I guess the hope is that you make it as incredibly cheap as possible and hopefully you can trick people into coming into the theater to see it with an awesome poster. Which could be done back in the day as there was no internet and suffice to say that trick did work on my parents a couple of times. Thankfully they did not have to sit through this horrible train wreck and neither did I that is until the gang from the Satellite of Love took no prisoners! The story is a mess. You start out getting a voice over explaining that what is left of the people of Earth live on this large spaceship and that they are content to live there however there is a faction that wishes to leave said ship. Granted I cannot say I blame them for wanting to leave if that futuristic bar is an example of the entertainment! Well there is a space battle that is completely random and is just a clip from Battlestar Galactica and then we meet Ryder who is beefy and the only one who can take out Kalgon and his evil army! Ryder falls in love with the commander of the ship's daughter. The daughter looks about the same age as her father as we get a woman trying to play the role of someone younger. Not going to say she looks bad but she does look too old to be playing the love interest. There are kidnappings betrayal and strange women who are called Ballerines that really serve no purpose...This film was rightfully riffed by MST3K as it is kind of a mess. They riff the fact there are a lot of people flung over railings and rightfully so as there are a lot of people who get killed and then get flung over a railing! The woman's age is also a running joke as is the beefy hero. The most ridiculous thing that occurs in this film is when they start chasing each other in little carts that go at an extremely slow speed making one wonder why they do not just run or something? So this is a bad film as the best parts are the clips from an old television show. Too much going on that makes no sense as you have random space pirate attacks that really go nowhere and people wrapped in plastic. Kalgon seems to be nothing but a mere human yet they act like he is a super powered foe and how exactly did he gain so much power? One also has to wonder why they cannot just leave the ship as Ryder the hero came on board and came from somewhere else. Just a mess as this one has virtually no redeeming qualities. Makes another Reb Brown film Yor the Hunter from the Future look great by comparison.";

The space age motif with the clothing and 80's club scenes are great and more then once I felt like as though I were stuck in simultaneous painhilarity.One of the best parts about it was the pointless nature to the scenes with the alien women in which they dance around in leotards and veils with globes bought frequently in ever souvenir shop since 1986. A must see for any fans of bad cinema...I give this movie 10 stars and slap in the face to the writers.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the two or three worst movies ever made by anybody. How anyone could have thought this was a good idea and how so many actors with actual careersincluding the onceformidable Cameron Mitchell could have agreed to be in this abomination boggles my mind. Space Mutiny is so bad that it's funny all by itself I watch it all the timeat least the MST3K version and I'm nowhere near tired of it.What's wrong with it? Just about everything. It had no budget and its editing was so laughably inept that it had more continuity errors than any ten movies. Here are ten reasons why censorship is not necessarily a bad thing and why this movie ought to be banned from polite society 1 All of its outer space footage was stolen from Battlestar Galactica.2 Since they didn't have enough money to create a fighter with actual controls every shot of Our Hero Reb Brown in his Stingray Viper doohickey is a closeup. Apparently you can fly those things merely by flipping switches on and off.3 They also didn't have enough money to create sets of the big ship called the Southern Sun so most of the interior shots of the spaceship are filmed in a factoryprocessing plant. So you can seen actual windows here and there and some of the walls of this spaceship are made of brick and the floors are made of concrete. And it's not a particularly clean spaceship either. In one shot you can see Our Hero Big McLargehuge's footsteps raising dust as he runs.4 Whoever designed the costumes of this thing hasn't seen a scifi movie made after 1957. Most of the woman were basically in bathing suits or miniskirts and some of the men were in these ridiculous things with ridiculously wide shoulders. Our Hero Slab Bulkhead's spacesuit was standardissue 50's space movie and his helmet had lights that flashed for some reason. And some of the crew wore a patch with the Southern Sun insignia a black patch with two S's in silver. Wonder if anyone had any second thoughts about that? Then there was Cameron Mitchell's ludicrously fake beard which brought out lots of Santa references in the MST3K version 5 The villain a guy named Calgonboo! should have had a handlebar mustache given his tendency to cut loose with an evil laugh for no reason all through this thing.6 I still can't figure out how the chief engineer got the job at all considering that he sounded like a borderline psychotic for most of the movie.7 Apparently in that time and space sexy dancing consists of cavorting with hulahoops to bad techno and showing one's rear end a lot.8 Several times during this thing shots were reused. The same explosion the same take by Calgonboo! and the same party happened more than once.9 In the climactic chase scene between Calgonboo! and Our Hero Bob Johnson the two men banged golf carts repeatedly. Then Our Hero screams for some reasons and leaps out of his golf cart which slams into Calgon'sboo! golf cart resulting in a huge explosion.And the best one of all 10 A woman is killed in one scene and is back at her post a few moments later.Space Mutiny is so horrendous that it's positively impressive.".

Go out and grab yourself a copy of this flick right now..";

This movie looks as if someone actually spent some money on it  they secured a decent cinematographersome real stunt men and fight choreographers built acceptable sets except for the 'futuristic' computer banks with their wall mounted keyboards and Formica monitors and the laser equipped golf carts and used good film stock and decent lighting along with mostly OK costuming excepting the spandex leotards for the women crew and the female lead they even got two B grade actors who have been good in other features Cameron Mitchell and John Philip Law. In fact JPL is perfectly capable of carrying a film  see 'Diabolik'for instance which gives hope that the movie might be watchable in a SCIFI channel movie kind of way. But someone forgot to sit down and write a coherent story and script for all the actors sets swiped stock footage and fight choreography to be about. Instead we get a whole bunch of sequences that don't link together or go anywhere and a whole slew of story ideas and plot elements that trail off into nothingness. There are space witches in spandex there are mutineers there is jarring space battle footage from Battlestar Galactic juxtaposed with TRS80 Color Computer graphics there are inane golf cart battles there are railing kills by the dozen there is a kidnapping and rescue mission that affects nothing else in the course of the movie there are 'counter measures' that never materialize and villains that give up for no apparent reason when the good guys are in retreat there are 'space pirates' who are developed as a looming threat for the entire first half of the movie only to be defeated in 15 seconds when the Adama standin flips a switch and unleashes stock footage of two missile launches. That's a fair sampling of the way the movie fails to jell or come together in any way. And there are MANY lapses in judgment and taste along the way that take this movie to the next level of absurdity. The big one is the casting of the leads. As Mike Nelson once said about Miles O'Keefe Reb Brown isn't an actor he's a Body. He can move welland he can enunciate most of his lines without blowing them but he is so far in over his head with this mess that it isn't funny. Far worse is the choice of Sissy Cameron as the female lead. She's 35 years too old for the part far too brittle and self absorbed to be a Princess Leia standin and not all the Jazzercise face lifts and Metrecal in the world can disguise it. Worth seeing for the MST3K version which is hilarious or by itself as an object lesson in the importance of having an overarching vision for a movie before you start filming it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is common knowledge by now that the 80s were being plagued by a flood of all kinds of scifi movies in order to exploit the tremendous success of the 70s Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. We also don't have to discuss the fact that a majority of these movies was complete and utter rubbish to be perfectly frank. But with Space Mutiny we don't just have a movie that is just a cheap ripoff of Star Wars. Oh don't get me wrong it certainly is at heart but this movie actually accomplishes the herculean task of representing the absolute sad bottom of the barrel of the 80s scifi shlock. No Space Mutiny is not just Solarbabiesbad. We're talking about a movie that is Robot Holocaustbad and if that does not scare you away already then you are tougher than the casual moviegoer.With a movie this dreadful it is difficult to decide where to begin with mentioning the various glaring faults this cinematic abomination tortured us with but I think the no. 1 reason for this movie to suck so bad is the nonexistent budget. At least I was unable to realize that this movie even had a budget higher than 1000 during most of the scenes and that's the death twitch for this flick. The story is supposed to take place in the far future on a selfsustaining gigantic space ship called Southern Sun carrying hundreds of people on a mission to colonize new worlds. Unfortunately the sets and art design are unable to establish this premise at all. In fact the inside shots of the space ship sometimes even give away the fact that some scenes were being filmed inside a warehouse with the sun shining through the windows being visible in the background and no effort to hide this embarrassing goof at all. Or take the futuristic vehicles for example. Well there actually is only one kind of vehicle on board of the Southern Sun a golf cart. Yes that's right. A golf cart. As if that wasn't bad enough already it's getting worse when we are forced to watch an exciting chase sequence involving two golf carts...yuck yuck yuck. 90 of all the other action sequences revolve around shootouts between our bold heroes and the fiendish villains with fake and cheesy laser beams having been edited into the picture afterwards and needless to say it looks laughably bad. And I am still at a loss of words in view of the fact that the footage of the Southern Sun and the unnecessary space battles has been taken directly from Battlestar Galactica what does that tell you about the quality of the flick if the creators had to steal from Battlestar Galactica? Sad... with no mentioning of the original source and with no permission by the creators of BG. That kinda tells us how much money was being spent on the special effects alright and as a result we sometimes don't see certain events like a small shuttle landing in the hangar bay of the Southern Sun. Instead we just see ridiculously cheap vector graphics on a computer monitor straight from the beginning of the 80s with a voice over telling us what these animated lines and objects are supposed to represent. A similar sequence in the first Star Wars the briefing shortly before the attack on the Death Star was lightyears ahead of this crap and even an Atari 2600 would have been ashamed of these computer graphics. Yep this movie takes us into the far future and that alone makes me buy this fact completely...just like the 80s disco onboard...Okay the action and special effects I hate to mention these terms in the same line as this flick... are among the worst the 80s have to offer and unfortunately there is no story to save this movie from falling apart. I won't even bother to go deeper into the countless plot holes this flick has to offer for critics involving one unbelievably embarrassing continuity error within just 3 minutes... but at least the actors deserve an honorable mention. If Robot Holocaust was the epitome of lifeless acting then Space Mutiny is the perfect example for horrible overacting. Each and every single character overemphasizes his or her lines to an extent that it becomes unbearable to listen to them even though this certainly was an attempt to make the inane dialogue seem less stupid than it is. Especially the villain named Kalgon responsible for the mutiny mentioned in the title and the hero David Ryder are the lowlights in this regard with Kalgon's overacted and clichd villain lines and idiotic eeeeevvvvvviiiiilllll laughter being the icing on the cake. And don't get me even started on the chemistry between the characters since I sure as hell did not notice any chemistry whatsoever nothanks to some horrible casting decisions whoever chose Cisse Cameron as the female lead character and youthful cough lead should not be allowed to be in film business anymore.The only way to watch this joke of a scifi film without suffering severe pain is to choose the MST3K version. Mike and the bots even make this dung to a hilarious experience and their witty and true comments are a far better way to sum up the idiocy of this movie than any review possibly could. But since this is a review of the movie and not the MST3K version there's no way this movie deserves anything above 110. Right on par with the worst the 80s have to offer.".

It takes place on The Southern Sun which consists mainly of an enlargened version of my grandma's basement but without the spiders. It is ruled by Captain Santa Claus Sting Debbie Reynolds and Santa's daughterShari   Lewis who is in her sixties. There is a bad guy named Calgon Me take me away! who routinely pops out his skull or tries to anyway and laughs menacingly at the goofiest phrases. Actual quote That explosion took out the entire wenching system on the docking bay doors!! HAHAHAHA!!! He and MacPherson a disabled man start the space mutiny that the title speaks about. However Dave Ryder a pilototherwise known as Big McLargeHuge and Shari Lewis try to stop it. This consists of going to bars with scandalous dancing She's presenting like a mandrill! running around saying Move!!shrieking like a girl and riding around in floor polishersPut your helmet on we'll be reaching speeds of three!. Meanwhile Bellerians basically women in leotards dance around in Spencer's Gifts. You expect any minute to see an employee coming out to tell them to leave. The mutiny is stopped StumpChunkman becomes a heroWon't you miss your flight? Does that mean you won't marry me? is an actual line of dialogue. and as it turns out Calgon is still alive! Incidentally this film was made in South Africa but the only black person in it was one of the frozen people in the basement. Anyway this is one of my favorite MST3K episodes and it definitely deserves 1010 stars. The movie itself gets one though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Compare with average Thai filmsFaanWannAAiJoop is quite good. Each of the four directors present love in their own way. Each episode is different in mood and style but all of them captured my attention the whole way through.All the actors and actresses in this film did good job. They look very natural in their role especially the girl who play 'Wan' in the third episode and the boy and girl who play 'Tong' and 'Boy' in the fourth episode. Also the music is another outstanding thing about this film. After I watch it I want to go buy the soundtrack right away. These songs are beautiful and go in line with the film well.The first episodeJoop is funny and a bit sarcastic. It's about a teenage boy who has to fight to the last drop because someone else is about to steal a kiss from his girlfriend. THe story is a bit nonsense but the style is interesting. Second one Aai is romantic. A girl gets to spend a few nights on the island with her exboyfriend who left her without any other reason except 'he was too shy' to be her boyfriend. I feel that there is a little chemistry problem between the two but overall is OK. The story delivers a good message although it was a bit awkward at times and the ending is clich. The third one Waan is sad. It's about a workaholic man who have no time for his wife and she began to lose her mind. She lived her life backward let herself live in her sweet memory. The man realizes his mistake when it was too late. The acting was very good because Chakrit is a professional actor and the woman did very good job too. although the aging thing didn't look very believable.The story overall was OK. The acting make it watchable and the cinematography is beautiful. Finallythe last one Faan is funny romantic fun and very unique! This is the best episode of the four. The story is about a dream of a young girl who is crazy about a band and that dream leads her to discover the true love from a boy who is her best friend. I think it is very original be it the story or the way the director present it. The visual and CG is stunning and those who like action cartoon would enjoy the dream part very much. The boy band the young girl the young boy were all very charming and their acting is very spontaneous. I won't spoil your fun by giving anything more about the story but I just want to highly recommend this episode to anyone because it is very entertaining. You'll get the fun from the adventure in the story and the heartwarming feeling at the end. Thanks to great performance of the cast the fantastic CG and very very beautiful music as well. Bravo to the director!So go watch '4 Romances.' It's not an awardwinning film but it's not a waste of your time either.".

Yet when the boat is spotted by the coast guard Elias jumps off the side of the boat and is separated from his friend. He washes up on a resort in France and then has to sneak around the island impersonating workers. He eventually meets a magician who briefly offers him work in a stage show and also tells him to come and find him in Paris. What follows is a road trip as Elias has to rely on the kindness of strangers to help him arrive at the city of lights.The opening scenes to this film directed by Costa Gavras onboard an immigrant boat are easily the best of the entire film. The imagery of the immigrants literally ripping up their identities and tossing their papers into the ocean is powerful and symbolic. Yet the journey that follows after this is a rather uninteresting one. This is not a highly dramatic or emotive examination of migration but more the equivalent of a chase movie or a road trip. Much of the film revolves around Elias stealing people's clothes and then being chased by police. Once you realise that the film has very little to say beyond this in its narrative the monotony of these scenes becomes clear. Although the visualisation of poverty in the film is sometimes apparent it is treated shallowly.There are several bizarre moments in this film that do not seem to fit with the initial concept of immigration. The subplot involving a magician is by far the film's most tactless idea. Why Elias would volunteer to be in a stage show when he does not want to draw attention to himself is uncertain and the ending which involves the magician giving out a magic wand is also improbable and out of sorts with the gritty realism of the opening scenes. A moment too where French people gather in a community watch to hunt down illegal immigrants as Elias is cornered and sexually assaulted remains utterly bizarre.As a road movie the film fails because of the lack of character development. We never learn anything about Elias such as where he came from. Thus it is difficult to know what he has experienced before and what is new to him on this journey. With very little dialogue it is difficult for his character to reflect on these events. We needed care about his character more. It feels like a more hollow film when compared to more sophisticated examples of the genre such as The Motorcycle Diaries. A more conventional aspect of a road trip genre is engaging in a number of quirky characters that can affect ones journey. There are few relationships in this film. The most memorable one is Elias' intimate affair with a woman who says that she has a family somewhere. Yet this has very little impact on the remainder of the film once it fades.Eden is West is not a particularly memorable or interesting film just one that is occasionally brought to life by brief moments of action. As a road movie it suffers from its lack of development and memorable characters.

Here's my thing Riccardo Scamarcio is a terrible actor. No I mean some actors are bad in a way that makes you embarrassed to watch them. Others are bad in the way that makes you feel embarrassed for the other people in the theater. And then there's Scamarcio who belongs to that category of actors who make you feel embarrassed to be alive. Scamarcio launched his career if we want to use that word playing romantic leads in dimwitted teen comedies. Now and then for reasons known only to the directors whose children Scamarcio's agent evidently kidnapped and threatened to murder Scamarcio was then also chosen for roles in serious movies. Let me correct that he got roles in movies that weren't if you're IQ is above 40 you're too smart to enter this theater comedies or compared to this a Hallmark card is freakin' Wuthering Heights romances. Whether the movies were serious is up for discussion. But Scamarcio is sort of like beigehe goes with anything. It doesn't matter to him what kind of movie you put him in he's happy to trot out his repertory of three facial expressions ooh! and did you notice? He has green eyes! in any known genre. From a moviegoer's point of view the more Scamarcio has to act though the uglier things tend to get. In Verso L'EdenEden  l'Ouest he's supposed to be an illegal immigrant of indeterminate origin who arrives in Greece from an unnamed country hoping to travel to Paris and find work. So there are like layers you get me? And Scamarcio doesn't do layers. Guy chasing a girl who doesn't love him? Got it covered. Guy who betrays the girl he loves but is forgiven in the end? No problem. Guy who agrees to help his best galpal win the guy of her dreams but ends up sweeping her off her feet instead? In his sleep. But don't ask him to something complicated like pretend to be of a different nationality get washed up on a beach in Greece and spend the ensuing weeks outrunning illegalimmigrant posses police dogs and conmen in pursuit of some private never articulated dream. Director CostaGavras meanwhile either forgot whether he was making a comedy a sex farce or a dramaor else he simply decided he'd pushed Scamarcio about as far as he could. He certainly threw continuity to the wind one minute Scamarcio is in Greece the next minute he's in Italy then he's in Germanydon't blink or you'll miss all those borders. The result is a series of sidesplitting scenes in which Scamarcio gets caught in a nudist colony is mistaken for a bellboy beds a babe or three fends off the advances of gay truckers and engages in at least a couple of foot chases through the city streets with the Keystone Cops. This is absolutely the most superficial unserious insultingly naive film about immigration ever made and Scamarcio did I mention he has green eyes? lights it up with every single one of his 15 watts of charisma. CostaGavras ought to be writhing in shame. As for Scamarcio he's pretty much made it clear that he's beyond all that.".

Wishing to escape her existence if only for a short time she dreams of finding enough money to attend an upcoming Tom Jones concert. She realizes her dream by accepting her first date with a French baker. Her kids pool their money so she can buy a new dress. Of course eventually the family has to face the loan shark but this is a movie where obstacles are maybe too easily overcome.";

	schema:headline " Perfect Vehicle For Anjelica Huston";
	schema:reviewBody "In Dublin 1967 a woman with seven children is suddenly faced with the travails of widowhood in Agnes Browne' directed by and starring Anjelica Huston.  After the unexpected death of her husband life becomes something less than a picnic for Agnes Huston what with children ranging in age from two to fourteen and no assets to speak of.  She keeps her head above water and some food on the table by selling fruit at an outdoor market but makes barely enough to make ends meet while she awaits her widow's pension from her late husband's union.  But even when and if it comes she realizes it won't be enough on which to live.  It's a bleak state of affairs for Agnes who luckily has a dear friend Marion Marion O'Dwyer who is always there for her and with friendship a sense of humor and the dream of seeing Tom Jones in concert it's enough to keep her going as she manages to take it all one day at a time. There are poignant moments in this character driven heartwarming film as well as some funny ones Huston has done an outstanding job of creating a mood and an atmosphere that brings the Irish working class vividly to life and she populates her landscape with characters who are not only real but incredibly rich in their humanity.  She captures the heart of Agnes and the others with an emotional depth that draws in the viewer and allows the empathy through which an intimate bond with the characters is established. And they quickly become more than just characters in a story these are people you come to care about and when something bad or untoward happens to any of them you feel it just as deeply as they. Huston gives a terrific performance as Agnes imbuing her with both a strength and vulnerability that make her real.  She has a look of worldweariness about her but there's a glint of hope and humor in her eyes which are like a doorway to her soul you need only look there to know what she is feeling inside.  And Huston plays it all so perfectly.  In her motion picture debut O'Dwyer gives a memorable performance as well as Marion though nondescript in appearance there is nevertheless something charming about this woman and it has everything to do with character.' Through her unwavering loyalty to Agnes she personifies the meaning of friendship and exemplifies how invaluable a true friend can be especially in times of need.  It's a touching portrayal that is one of the strengths of the film. The supporting cast includes Niall O'Shea Mark Ciaran Owens Frankie Roxanna Williams Cathy Carl Power Simon Mark Power Dermot Ray Winstone Mr. Billy June Rodgers Fat Annie Jennifer Gibney Winnie the Mackerel and Tom Jones as himself.  No stranger to all things Irish Huston was the perfect choice to star in and direct this project.  With Agnes Browne' she succeeds splendidly with a film that is striking both visually and emotionally.  And lest it be taken for granted one need but consider Alan Parker's Angela's Ashes' which visited the same territory but came off flat and uninspired especially compared to Huston's film which so distinctly and fervently imparts the essence of the proud Irish poor. Largely ignored during it's theatrical release this film hopefully will find a second life on DVD and video and realize the acclaim it so richly deserves.  A real sleeper this is a gem of a film just waiting to be discovered.  I rate this one 810.".

This one's a winner.On my first viewing I thought it was a nice little film but nothing special. Mild thumbs up. I'm not sure why but about a year later I decided to watch it again. I enjoyed it more the second time. Six months later I watched it a 3rd time and it seemed better yet. Today I watched it for the fourth time and I enjoyed every moment of it tremendously. The opening scene is just delicious and hilarious. Even though I have a pretty good ear for the Irish idiom I turned on the English subtitles and caught some bits of dialog that were not clear before.If you are a film student this a good one to study. It is extremely well crafted. Yes my dears with no big stars and a small budget you can make a fine film. The camera work is first class. Lighting is perfect. The colors pop out at you. No doubt Ms. Houston sought to bring her Ireland to life with all of it's vivid vitality and she succeeded. She squeezed a lot into a small film. Humor music romance pathos and even a little suspense. Perfect editing. The film never lags. Perfect pacing. Perfect storytelling.

At the center of the story is its namesake Agnes Browne Anjelica Houston who has just lost her husband and is struggling to support her seven children.  The film presents a sliceoflife of families struggling to stay afloat but trivializes their plight by making its heroine's greatest ambition a trip to a Tom Jones concert.While the story has some charming and poignant moments it is mostly mundane and lacks the ability to keep all but the most sentimental viewer engaged. It skims the surface poverty but lacks the depth to draw us in.  Unlike Angela's Ashes' which gives a gripping account of poverty and its human cost this film just tries to bounce merrily along and make the best of things.  The humor was low brow and the Tom Jones ending was hokey in the extreme.  Two actors stand out namely Anjelica Houston and Marion O'Dywer.  Houston carries the entire cast with a standout performance that is spontaneous and heartwarming.  O'Dwyer has a radiant smile and affability that makes her seem like she could be anyone's best bud.  The chemistry between the two was excellent.Overall this was a humaninterest story that was very human but not very interesting.  I rated it a 610.".

She gets an earthy performance from her cast but Ray Winstone who puts on a good Irish accent is too much of a cartoonish villain and that is because the script is rather flat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this humorous account of life among Dublin's poor in the same way I enjoyed the humor of Love on the Dole and similar films of the working class combating grinding poverty with humor. Fortunately the film did not give in to standard clichs e.g. the date with Pierre did not lead to a man meets woman man loses woman man gets her back and they live happily ever after after he had given Mr. Billy the thrashing he deserved. It would be a very brave man willing to take on a widow with seven children.I could not help wondering why Agnes did not go to the Garda over Billy's loan sharking to young children but perhaps the poor of Dublin don't involve the police. Agnes who we saw many times defiantly marching through the streets aiming her pram like a weapon did not seem to be the type to be intimidated by Billy.There were some major flaws 1 when Agnes went to collect her widow's pension and was served by a very rude unhelpful clerk. In reality the clerk would have realized she was dealing with a woman who had just lost her husband and been helpful and solicitous.2 The relationship with her eldest son should have been more detailed and his meeting with the carpenter who was willing to take him on as an apprentice and teach him a a trade rather than leave him to dead end jobs interspersed with the employment dole was rushed through. One minute we saw the boy watching Mr. Aherne next minute they are at the door asking for money for apprentice tools. There was certainly enough time to expand this part of the story as the film was only 91 minutes long. We needed to see what Mr. Aherne saw in the boy that made him willing to take him on as an apprentice without a bond. Was Mr. Aherne an old friend of Agnes and her late husband? 3 The ending with the brash Tom Jones did not play well and would have been better with Agnes all dressed up and leaving for the concert or as a dreamfantasy sequence with her waking up and finding Pierre waiting for her having helped the children get their tea ready. Not to put down Tom Jones but his presence was jarring.Still these are minor gripes in what was a charming film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flipping channels the other night I came upon the opening frames of AGNES BROWNE on the Sundance channel. It looked charming and I was intrigued by Angelica Houston playing against type as a workingclass widow struggling to support her seven children in the hardscrabble word of 1960's Ireland. Ultimately however the movie proved disappointing. There were faint warning bells almost from the onset. As Agnes and her best fried Marion make their way through the halls of Irish bureaucracy just hours after the death of Agnes' husband the dialogue is just a little too clever the emotional tone just the slightest bit false. But these concerns are slight and we're willing to put them aside for the moment and see what's to come. A few scenes further on when the mourners at Mr. Browne's funeral realize they're at the wrong grave site and make a crazy rollicking dash through the cemetery to the correct one we realize we're in serious trouble. There's a cartoonish broadness to AGNES BROWNE. Something about the film just seems a little off.Angelica Houston for all her appeal is miscast as the lead. She simply doesn't do earthy convincingly. The emotional stakes throughout seem false. The crisises such as Marion's collapse from cancer seem forced. The script's machinations are hamfisted and obvious. But most disturbingly the depictions of the Irish and of Irish life are chockfull of clich and stereotype. Here are the Irish having a rollicking good time at the pub. Here are the Irish banning together to help one of their own. Here are the Irish being moved and touched. Here are the Irish dancing a jig. Here are the Irish bouncing back with wit and tough humor. And at all times they are very very IRISH! The film comes off more as someone's fantasy of what Irish people are like more than anything real. One of Agnes Browne's dreams is to attend a Tom Jones concert.Twothirds of the way through I was simply persevering to get a look at Mr. Jones He does show up eventually but even that seems a little odd that's not a spoiler he's in the credits you know he's coming one way or another. He remains a phenomenal performer but after the film's haphazard attempts at a gritty realism watching the 60ish Jones portray his 20something self is just bizarre. Thankfully the children make AGNES BROWNE bearable. Each a quirky individual in his or her own right they provide the film with some of its truest moments and best performances. AGNES BROWNE is not without its charms but in other hands  and most importantly with better writing  it could have been a much better movie.".

The emotional stakes throughout seem false. The crisises such as Marion's collapse from cancer seem forced. The script's machinations are hamfisted and obvious. But most disturbingly the depictions of the Irish and of Irish life are chockfull of clich and stereotype. Here are the Irish having a rollicking good time at the pub. Here are the Irish banning together to help one of their own. Here are the Irish being moved and touched. Here are the Irish dancing a jig. Here are the Irish bouncing back with wit and tough humor. And at all times they are very very IRISH! The film comes off more as someone's fantasy of what Irish people are like more than anything real. One of Agnes Browne's dreams is to attend a Tom Jones concert.Twothirds of the way through I was simply persevering to get a look at Mr. Jones He does show up eventually but even that seems a little odd that's not a spoiler he's in the credits you know he's coming one way or another. He remains a phenomenal performer but after the film's haphazard attempts at a gritty realism watching the 60ish Jones portray his 20something self is just bizarre. Thankfully the children make AGNES BROWNE bearable. Each a quirky individual in his or her own right they provide the film with some of its truest moments and best performances. AGNES BROWNE is not without its charms but in other hands  and most importantly with better writing  it could have been a much better movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Agnes Browne is a recently bereaved stall owner and mother of seven children. With her best friend and fellow stall owner Marion Monks she works hard every day to feed house and clothe herself and her children. This has all to be done while still trying to pay off a ruthless loan shark called Mister Billy. She enjoys a pint and a singsong in the pub but when she has a rare moment to herself she likes to dance to her Tom Jones records.Agnes Browne is another directorial effort from the wonderful Anjelica Huston and with her in the main role I would expect a lot better than what I received for my moneys worth. The problem with this film is that John Goldsmith's adaptation of Brendan O'Carroll's hit  The Mammy  is terrible and it plays to the worst kind of paddy whackery since Darby O'Gill and the little people. Goldsmith totally misses the point of the book and it is very obvious by surname alone that Goldsmith is not Irish and his comprehension of Irish humor is zero considering it has been more successfully demonstrated in different films by different writers. He totally leaves out the essential components that made O'Carroll's book so successful.  The Mammy  is certainly about a woman in 1960's Dublin fighting to bring up her kids but the books more endearing feature is the respect that the children have for their mother. One example I can give is the relationship that builds between Agnes Browne and her eldest son Mark. In the book it demonstrates greatly that Mark's desire to get a job is not just to get out of the boredom of school but it is in necessity to provide for his family. The book also richly illustrates how Mark through careful observation of his mother gains her financial resourcefulness and how he thoughtfully gives back to his family. In return he receives the respect an adult would receive from his mother and siblings because of his willingness to accept adult responsibility at the tender age of 14. This kindness is also encouraged by his new boss and mentor Henry Wise a Jewish man whose fireside chats with Mark on his Sabbath encourage Mark to look to a brighter horizon and realizes the values of his mothers words. Great substantial stuff is replaced by mediocre trash by renaming Mr. Henry Wise to Mr Ahern and cutting his influence right out and creating the rubbish loan shark Mister Billy. This is of course is to create tension and entertainment for the fickle international audiences. John Goldsmith should never have been hired to adapt this script.Because of the script it is very hard to know what the supporting actors are like individually but I they gain my respect as they give heart and soul to characters despite the storyline. It is will great difficultly I will say that it is the first time I have had to badmouth Ray Winstone who I am a great fan of. His Irish accent is as bad as the script he may have played a relocated English loan shark. Anjelica Huston is good not great I think the dual duties of acting and directing may have got the better of her. Her role was a very hard one and I think she would have been casting a prominent English actress like Julia Walters or Emma Thompson in the role. Anjelica may have lived in Ireland in her youth but her compression of Irish Humour is as bad as John Goldsmiths. She misses a lot of great moments in both her direction and acting. Some of which might have saved the film from this reviewer's disdain.To cut a long story short. I love the book on which this was based. On it's initial release I went to the cinema eagerly to watch it but hopes and anticipation were replaced by scorn and loathing for all American productions based in Ireland. Granted families will love this but what I am saying is instead of becoming another family hour movie on some television station it could have been ten times better and more beneficial for us all. 4 out of 10".

One is Anjelica Huston the director of the movie but also one of the main actresses. The other one is Tom Jones who got a cameo in this movie. So why did I give it a try? Well mainly because I saw a trailer that looked very promising. I hoped it would be a very funny movie and most of the time it was...Agnes Browne is a recently widowed mother of 7 young children who has a very hard time making a living out of selling some fruit and vegetables on the daily market which she does together with her best friend who supports her in these difficult times. But the financial problems are never far away and she even has to borrow money from a loan shark who will not hesitate to do anything to get his money including a huge interest rate back. She wishes to escape her hard life for a few moments and dreams of finding enough money so she can go to a Tom Jones concert. She starts realizing her dreams when she goes on a date with the French baker who has been in love with her since the first time he saw her. But when everything seems to get better new problems arise. But nothing will stop Agnes Browne and her family from finding happiness...This movie certainly has some very good moments to offer that will definitely make you laugh out loud. But it just isn't enough to conceal that the story sometimes is a bit too easy and thin. It's as if nothing can stop her from being happy and being without worries. Problems never seem to be very hard to conquer and they always find an easy solution. However that doesn't mean this movie isn't any good. It's still a nice portrait of Dublin in the 1960's and the way how people always try to help each other out even when they don't have anything to spare. I reward the movie with a 710. It's certainly worth a watch despite its flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "Agnes Browne' is a genuine charmer a simple but heartwarming comedydrama directed by and starring the magnificent Anjelica Huston.  Set in a lower class Dublin neighborhood in 1967 the story centers around Agnes an attractive woman whose husband has just died leaving her sole provider for her seven children ranging in age from early adolescence to diaperwetting toddler.  With the love of her best friend Marion to support her this almost seems to be more of a love story between them than between Agnes and Pierre the local Frenchman who falls for her Agnes learns to cope with financial set backs the neighborhood extortionist the growing pains of her children and most tragically the terminal illness of someone very dear to her heart.Agnes Browne' could have emerged as a heavyhanded wallow in tragedy and bathos but those involved both in front of and behind the cameras have managed to maintain an air of breezy likeability even in the film's darkest moments.  If there is a criticism to be leveled against the movie it would probably be that the film is actually  at a mere 92minute running time  a bit too short.  We occasionally feel we are being rushed from one event to another without time for proper reflection.  Moreover a number of the characters  prime among them Pierre and several of the children  tend to get lost in the shuffle.  As the silent sensitive and understanding merchant who woos and wins Agnes Pierre simply seems too much like the ideal man' stereotype who always seems to be just waiting in the wings the moment one of these attractive but harried movie widowsdivorcees is starting life anew out on her own.  A much more well rounded and threedimensional character is that of Agnes' best friend Marion beautifully portrayed by Marion O'Dwyer a warmhearted funloving woman who provides the kind of confidant and companion that all of us would love to have in our lives.  But the real selling point of Agnes Browne' is undoubtedly the luminous performance delivered by Anjelica Huston herself.  This fine actress manages to flow seamlessly in and out of a wide variety of emotionally demanding moods and moments.  Stern and demanding one moment she can be forgiving and loving the next.  Whether alternately strong or vulnerable idealistic or pragmatic heartbroken or joyful Agnes is a character who demands and earns the complete attention and respect from the audience who can't help but be riveted by her every move.  With her glowing portrayal Huston literally lights up the center of this movie.Yes the fairy tale ending may seem a bit out of place perhaps.  Yet in a way for all its moments of death heartbreak and sorrow Agnes Browne' never really aspires to be anything BUT a charming fairy tale.  Given the quality of so much of what we see up on the screen we really couldn't ask for more.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of watching movies without knowing anything about what is going to happen it is my belief this comment contains spoilers.I have never seen a movie quite like this one.  Some of the scenes and situations were brilliantly crafted and others were complete junk.  The end result are brilliant scenes speckled with garbage and the garbage scenes are very very confused and confusing.  I will explain in my plot summary that follows.  All the plot summaries I had read about this movie say something completely different read the one on imdb.com than what I feel this movie is actually about.This movie is the story of Agnes Browne and her budding friendship with a neighboring woman Marion.  I suppose they knew each other before Agnes' husband's death movie starts with the funeral but apparently they didn't become best friends until after the funeral.  Unbeknownst to Agnes but knownst to us her friend has cancer.Here follows several touching scenes brilliantly crafted with perfect dialogue etc...Agnes runs into Marion's husband who sort of tells Agnes what is going on. Agnes tells him it's not the end of the world and he replies It is for me.Later  Marion says her one wish is to learn to drive a car and they both are sitting in a car waiting for the instructor.  He comes around to the driver's window and gesticulates in what could either be interpereted as an obscene gesture or sign language for Marion to roll the window down.  The women assume the former is the case Agnes says he wants a wk and they laugh.  He then asks Marion to turn the knob and they again laugh.  The guess his name is Dick and are dissapointed to find out his name is Tom. They fall into absolute hysterics when he announces his full name Tom O'Toole.At the beginning Agnes has no money because she hadn't yet started getting her husband's death benefits.  She is forced to borrow from a loan shark briefly.  Soon after she gets her retroactive death benefits and there is a bizarre scene where she pays him back in a lump sum and they are both ungrateful to each other.  At this point I felt it was very clear Agnes had a good amount of money as she even bragged a little about it.  Further proof of this occurs when we see Agnes and Marion go out bar hopping. Then suddenly the next day she cries when her 7 kids complain and she is upset she doesn't have the money to feed them all.  Then in stark contrast again Agnes and Marion take a day off from their fruit and flower stands and go to the coast they go shopping for expensive clothes for Agnes' daughter they take expensive driving lessons... not exactly money problems here.  All of these scenes do exist however to show us the bond of friendship that is building between these two women and again we see specs of brilliance.  I thought the money problems were long since over.  When one of Agnes' kids borrows 6 pounds from the earlier loan shark the money problems mysteriously reappear when payment time comes.  6 pounds!  Agnes tries to scrape up the 10 pounds owed interest and seemingly can't come up with that despite the money being offered to her by a Frenchman named Pierre who is in love with her and despite her doing several things including selling her wedding ring!  She bravely tells Pierre she refuses to be reliant on a man.  Then she gets money out of nowhere from her late husband's work union and also Tom Jones bizarrely helps save the day making her reliant on Tom Jones who I believe is a man.I really like Anjelica Huston.  But in this movie you really notice her terrible attempt at an Irish accent which faded in and out was never really right and was extremely distracting.  Her acting at points was also very bad as in the funeral scene at the beginning where she realizes she is at the wrong grave.  There were many points where it seemed as though she was concentrating too hard on just trying to get the accent right.  In other scenes she had a look on her face that seemed she was just pleased she got the accent right for a change.  She produced this movie and should have known better than to put herself in it.  She should have known it needed a severe rewrite before production.  It makes me think she doesn't quite have the minerals to do this many jobs on one production.".

He comes around to the driver's window and gesticulates in what could either be interpereted as an obscene gesture or sign language for Marion to roll the window down.  The women assume the former is the case Agnes says he wants a wk and they laugh.  He then asks Marion to turn the knob and they again laugh.  The guess his name is Dick and are dissapointed to find out his name is Tom. They fall into absolute hysterics when he announces his full name Tom O'Toole.At the beginning Agnes has no money because she hadn't yet started getting her husband's death benefits.  She is forced to borrow from a loan shark briefly.  Soon after she gets her retroactive death benefits and there is a bizarre scene where she pays him back in a lump sum and they are both ungrateful to each other.  At this point I felt it was very clear Agnes had a good amount of money as she even bragged a little about it.  Further proof of this occurs when we see Agnes and Marion go out bar hopping. Then suddenly the next day she cries when her 7 kids complain and she is upset she doesn't have the money to feed them all.  Then in stark contrast again Agnes and Marion take a day off from their fruit and flower stands and go to the coast they go shopping for expensive clothes for Agnes' daughter they take expensive driving lessons... not exactly money problems here.  All of these scenes do exist however to show us the bond of friendship that is building between these two women and again we see specs of brilliance.  I thought the money problems were long since over.  When one of Agnes' kids borrows 6 pounds from the earlier loan shark the money problems mysteriously reappear when payment time comes.  6 pounds!  Agnes tries to scrape up the 10 pounds owed interest and seemingly can't come up with that despite the money being offered to her by a Frenchman named Pierre who is in love with her and despite her doing several things including selling her wedding ring!  She bravely tells Pierre she refuses to be reliant on a man.  Then she gets money out of nowhere from her late husband's work union and also Tom Jones bizarrely helps save the day making her reliant on Tom Jones who I believe is a man.I really like Anjelica Huston.  But in this movie you really notice her terrible attempt at an Irish accent which faded in and out was never really right and was extremely distracting.  Her acting at points was also very bad as in the funeral scene at the beginning where she realizes she is at the wrong grave.  There were many points where it seemed as though she was concentrating too hard on just trying to get the accent right.  In other scenes she had a look on her face that seemed she was just pleased she got the accent right for a change.  She produced this movie and should have known better than to put herself in it.  She should have known it needed a severe rewrite before production.  It makes me think she doesn't quite have the minerals to do this many jobs on one production.";

Like his previous efforts which include Airplane! Top Secret! and Naked Gun the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take Mafia! please this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for South Park its creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes sports announcers and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries. By the way stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all Zucker has achieved in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports a home dunk.".

If not sit back and laugh until you want to cry. There are so many things that actually made me laugh out loud which very few movies do. I loved the part when Coop is driving in the car and that funny song comes on the radio. Robert Stack and the entire cast was hilarious in this also. I really liked the fact that they have a character named Kenny in the movie.  Don't forget to watch the outtakes on this as well! Please watch this movie if there is any Sophmoric humor inside of you at all!!".

When the game becomes a huge success they along with a billionaire's help form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop  Remer's team the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons Vaughn wants to institute.The Acting is pretty good since there arn't many big stars in this movie. Although I am not a big fan of 'Southpark' Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. There are so many funny moments in this movie I can't come close to naming them all. It never really lets up and they don't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. And my favorite aspect of this movie The Soundtrack. It's GREAT. I especially like Take me on and Beer by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated.Overall a crude but extremely funny movie. 1010James Black Wolf Johnston".

Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to psycheout other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking Wow this this over already? Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak who is a hypedup little guy. BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines and it is very fun to watch!".

Many players no longer play for the love of the game but for themselves for obscene amounts of money.As with his other movies such as Airplane or Naked Gun David Zucker makes sure there's at least one gag every thirty seconds. Many fail but most work so the film stays on our good side if you only want laughs and couldn't care less about satire.Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a great comic pair and have absolutely no shame or delusions. But an even funnier comedy duo are the real life sports commentators Bob Costas and Al Michaels who have the funniest lines and most perfect delivery.It's become a little dated now a fault of movies that have too many popculture references but there's still plenty to laugh at and enjoy with BASEketball.".

This doesn't necessarily bother me I've seen plenty of bad movies really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didn't write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by prepubescent boys snickering at penis jokes. Airplane was a revolutionary and very funny comedy watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today. Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny. Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them. It's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity. I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons. It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class. Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.Parker and Stone have never been great actors. They've been serviceable in their films. I can't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film. Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way. It's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way. I am reminded of the South Park episode How to Eat with your Butt where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture. Really it's sad.And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isn't any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Don't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around".

Airplane! is one of my all time favourites and I've seen every episode of South Park despite not having a TV so it isn't an issue of style.  It just wasn't funny.  There are a couple of guffaws and Trey Parker appears to have some latent talent but it tries too hard and usually misses the mark.

	schema:reviewBody "David Zucker really never came close to what he accomplished with Airplane! and I would hope that by the 90's he realized he never would. BASEketball makes me think that he did have this revelation because this movie is just pure amounts of dumb. It stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone the creators of South Park. They play two jobless bums named Coop and Remer who invent a game that combines baseball and basketball. Their game is picked up by Ted Denslow and major league BASEketball becomes a sensation that returns sports to their original and more respectable roots. But when Denslow dies others want to cash in on the opportunity to make BASEketball a profitable industry. The film is fairly funny and it satirizes professional sports very wittily in some instances but it eventually boils down to another cookie cutter storyline that lacks that thing called originality.BASEketball has a great opening. It chronicles a fictional history of professional sports that has some great satire worked in. Then it goes on to introduce the two main characters and I will say that Parker and Stone are pretty funny in this film. Their characters are very uncreative and fall perfectly into the quirky lose stereotype but Parker and Stone definitely pull the stereotype off well. The story goes on to introduce a love interest Jenna Reed that the two leads fight over. This is where things really start to go downhill. As if I haven't seen this scenario in every movie ever. It can be a funny scenario in some instances but in BASEketball I wanted that subplot to be gone as soon as it arrived. But of course it carried all the way to the end of the film. No surprise there.The amazing thing is that this film isn't good and it is really dumb but strangely enough I don't hate this film like I do other lame comedies. I guess it is because this movie honestly is funny. It banks on some really easy laughs and some cheap jokes but it at least amused me. I won't deny that I laughed out loud during this film and its crudeness really brings a smile to your face. This movie is unapologetically vulgar and obscene and it doesn't hold back. As silly and stupid as it is I can't knock it from a purely comic standpoint.I would never watch this film again as it isn't a good film. But I don't regret watching it because I did laugh and it did entertain me for what it's worth. Parker and Stone are very funny and I definitely think they need to star in more films together. This is just another comedy where the story isn't whats important it's the jokes and luckily the jokes are actually pretty funny. I can't call BASEketball a good film but I can't call it a piece of crap either.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball 1998 This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbotron screen in a sports bar during the day  when everyone is quite drunk. Unfortunately I was sober when I saw this movie.So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lamebrained supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior There's Something About Mary in a oneupmanship game during July of 1998. Mary was a grossout fest but in addition to the many gags it had a lot of heart which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.BASEketball tried to outdo Mary but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine wasting his precious time in his distinguished career dying on a hotdog and singing I'm Too Sexy as he videotapes his will Jenny McCarthy who has little screen time as Borgnine's nottooweeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival and pointless cameos by Airplane! alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate Airplane! humor and mixing it up with the crudity of South Park but failing in every way.To make this long 100minute movie short BASEketball a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee is about two lazy losers Parker and Stone and their pintsized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball hence the title together on the driveway of one's house. After Borgnine dies he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough the game goes national and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men particularly Parker and one poor sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes gaga over them. Those are the characters not strongly developed.Now witless gags ensue. Blood electroshock hair eggthrowing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy who seemed to get over Borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of Riverdance and Titanic. Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ post Airplane! and The Naked Gun series.And like Siskel I was sober as well but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarsemannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers but will they remain alert and awake or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!".

It's an episode movie but not Boccacciostyle tale by tale the tales are developing from each other and some characters keep reappearing. There are at least three reasons to love this movie The performance of the director himself as the psychopathic ticket collector the short segment showing musical indifferencies between dutch construction workers and Indian immigrants and the timeless sequence that just hints at a very weird sexual orientation of a designer. This scene reminded me a lot of Bunuel's anarchism see i didn't just include his name above to be pretentious. The movie manages to be very funny at times but some scenes do leave a bad taste in your mouth without being sentimental or pathetic at any time. I've seen this movie three times now and not just because i had some pretty bad experiences with ticket collectors and bus drivers too. If you get the chance to see it Don't miss it.".

De Jurk is a tale about the journey of one interesting dress from the day it was envisioned and created through the lives of many owners and until the end when the dress has finally fulfilled its strange purpose.There are actually several tales but they are developing from each other and some characters keep reappearing. The stories are weird and funny but also quite disturbing and obscene. There is a lot of violence unexpected situations comedy and drama. You just don't know if you should laugh and where all of that is going to end! Is this the story about the people or about the dress? I guess both. We are attracted by certain objects. We all have our favorite pair of shoes for example. Some people believe that certain shirts or pair of socks can bring them luck and so on. Well why not? But it seems like this dress keeps bringing bad luck to its owners. I swear the dress in question is cursed! LOL Some people said Yes the movie is interesting but what's the message? Indeed it might look like there is none. However for myself behind all crazy happenings there is a quest for love and there is the message. Absolutely all characters in this movie desperately search for love in one way or another. We all define love differently just like the dream of one person can be a nightmare for another person. Same is with happiness. Sometimes we need so little just one kiss or hug. Sometimes our search became obsession.The entire cast of De Jurk was excellent and all characters are well developed and equally interesting. The story is simply great and director Alex van Warmerdam has done an excellent job. As usual he played in his movie and this time he is a train conductor. Don't miss it!".

He occupies the body of teacher going to work on that train and is confused as to what he is doing or why he is there as his last memory is of flying his helicopter on a combat mission in Afghanistan. Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train and that he must locate it. More importantly he must identify the bomber as another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only gather information. As he develops a liking for his traveling companion Christina he sets out to test that theory.";

And then you watch it.Like INCEPTION this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller scifi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors who deliver the lines well who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.".

The movie have many intriguing subplots that is not easy to figure out. The movie wanted to be as smart as possible.The performances were great. Jake Gyllenhaal made the whole game exciting. Michelle Monaghan shows her role's innocence. Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here. Jeffery Wright is the best among the four.

It is a film that keeps you looking you actually feel like you are 'in the source code' which is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels short it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good thing? Shows how good this film was!GO CHECK IT OUT!";

	schema:reviewBody "When i saw this at a preview screening i was not surprised to find another great film from one of the best scifi directors of our time Duncan Jones who brought us the instant classic Moon. Source Code is in part an original movie but bears brief resemblance to Tony Scott's ActionThriller Deja Vu. Source Code centers itself around Colter Stevens an AFO soldier who wakes upon a train not knowing how he got there or why and how people are addressing him as someone else and soon enough the train explodes supposedly killing everyone. But Stevens awakes to find himself in a kind of machine called the Source Code.The whole story is fantastic with a man Stevens having to go back in time and trying to find out who is behind the bombing. With even more praise is the directing script and the choice of actors for the roles. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect in the role of Stevens as Jeffery Wright was for his role as Dr. Rutledge who believes everything has to go his way or the mission will be ruined. Overall this is a thriller that is not to be missed. But for those who have seen this as well i agree that if the ending was different and more powerful the movie would be an INSTANT science fiction classic but it falls just short of that. Still one that will be remembered for all time in my opinion.910 Stars".

	schema:headline " Absolutely Unnecessary Coda  Contains Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I happen to see this picture yesterday with a friend of mine and liked it quite a bit. But it illustrates an increasing problem with big budgeted movies. Spoilers follow.The movie opens with the hero an Army helicopter pilot coming to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He's being addressed by a pretty girl as her boyfriend. He has various interactions with other passengers. He has no idea of what's going on. As he's trying to figure out who and where he is a bomb detonates killing everyone.He finds himself back in a cell something like a space capsule. He's informed that he's just been a part of a computer simulation that the train was blown up that morning that he's been cybernetically linked with the remnants of one of the victims let it go this is science fiction and that his mission is to ID the bomber and prevent him or her from doing more damage. The simulation repeats and he's off again a bit wiser and wiser with every iteration.Now you don't have to be an experienced science fiction reader which I am to figure out that the Army pilot is dead that these computer people are hooking up his brain to the simulation. Live people don't end up inside computer programs. But this does come as a big surprise to the captain and to the more naive members of the audience. And it does set up what should have been a really original ending.The hero finally completes the mission having fallen for the girl along the way. He knows he's dead and so is she and all this is virtual reality. He pleads with the sympathetic operator to let him redo the simulation one last time then let him die  completely. Touched she agrees even though the ogre chief of the project wants to 'wipe his memory' and use him again. And what happens in the last iteration is what should have made the movie memorable. Knowing this is his last remnant of consciousness what he does the last time is make everyone in the train car happy. He's learned a great deal about them the other times through. He bets a comedian whom he has recognized from television all the money he has that he can't make everyone on the car laugh. The man takes the bet and proceeds to do just that. As the seconds tick down to the inevitable end when they'll all be incinerated he takes the girl in his arms tells her he loves her and wants to be with her forever. The frame freezes and pans the whole length of the car revealing every passenger laughing or in various states of bliss. This is the instant that will see the hero into eternity.Not bad completely unexpected and like the best twists revealing that the theme of the drama was something completely different than the detective story it seemed to be. It's always nice to be surprised like that. I will confess to having to deal with moist eyes constantly at movies and this was another occasion. A perfect ending. I reached for my hat expecting the credits to roll up and . . . . .. . . it wasn't over. It went on for another 15 minutes into the most Godawful coda you ever saw completely obliterating the premises of the story so bad I am not going to describe it.What goes on? My guess is that when they previewed the movie they found that the some members of the audience were dismayed that people as cute and likable as Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Monaghan have to suffer the fate they do. A happy ending required. I think that's what happens given production costs and promotion costs in the tens of millions. Trusting the better sense of the audience is a thing of the past. Too much sunk cost.".

	schema:reviewBody "Source Code is the 2nd feature film from English Director Duncan Jones son of David Bowie. Duncan has showed audiences twice now that his narrative can be told boldly without excessive explosions and unnecessary cgi by exploring an idea and the implications it entails which is what should be the basis of any story.Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens an Army helicopter pilot Or at least he's convinced he is. After waking on a Chicago train unaware of his surroundings or Christina Michelle Monaghan a woman so eagerly talking to him Colter discovers that everything is not as it seems. Following being referred to as Sean and a deep look into the bathroom mirror Colter learns that his appearance and character on the outside is not the one he knows.Waking as himself his real self this is Colter finds himself talking to Colleen Goodwin Vera Farmiga a scientist for an unknown organisation. Post a series of memory regaining techniques he is informed that the commuter train he was previously on has been destroyed by a terrorist attack which is only the beginning of disastrous attacks to follow. Colter learns that the brain of one of the victims contains memories of the last 8 minutes prior to the explosion and by rerunning those minutes they can discover their terrorist and prevent a major attack on Chicago.An advanced computer program run by the mysterious organisation allows Colter to live the final 8 minutes and discover the terrorist before it's too late. Experiencing Dj vu on every reentry aboard the train Colter can remember all of the memories of his previous visits even though for Christina and the other passengers aboard it's happening for the first time.Our hero begins to care for Christina as much as any male would for any number of characters portrayed by Michelle Monaghan in recent times. Colter's ability to act upon free will within the 8 minutes produces the idea that he could positively change the outcome for himself the passengers the scientists and most importantly the love interest.The mastermind behind the operation Dr. Rutledge Jeffrey Wright is desperate for it's success regardless of the lives it may cost along the way which could compromise Colter's outcome. In a race to save Chicago from certain destruction Colter is destined for selfless courage. The well casted characters are certainly above satisfaction particularly Vera Farmiga who although is not the love interest will win the heart of the viewer. Don Burgess' photography is great steady camerawork makes all the scenes believable despite the science of the story being absurd but that's what makes Scifi so enjoyable. Perhaps it was the sound quality of the cinema I was in but I wasn't taken by Chris Bacon's Music Score it doesn't even put a notch on Clint Mansell's work collaborating with Jones on his previous film.Whether it be a Trademark from the director or a homage to his previous film Moon Jones includes a subtle reference that fans will easily notice if not the first time around there's a 2nd hint. Scifi in recent times continually proves that it's not a dying genre take Christopher Nolan's Inception acclaimed modern masterpiece or Independent sensations District 9 and Moon for e.g. Whether the viewer identifies Source Code as a Scifi or a thriller they will be taken on a visually pleasing experience nonetheless. Rating 45".

Which is by definition something fixed that can't be changed or interacted with. The whole idea just profoundly doesn't make sense on a fundamental level.In fact how do you create an alternate reality AT ALL? Regardless of whether it's somehow based on a dead guy's memory or not. They just toss that ability off casually like it's no big deal Oh yeah we can create alternate realities now. Neat huh? We're not going to explain it or even remotely get into the logic behind itCreating alternate realities and being able to recover the last 8 minutes of a corpse's memory are two concepts that have absolutely NOTHING inherently in common. It's just a sloppy juxtaposition of random junk scifi ideas.2  Why do both Stevens and his commanders think the person detonating the bomb is ON THE TRAIN WHEN IT BLOWS UP?!Stevens spends almost all his time looking for the culprit on the train primarily during the longer period after the last stop is made before the explosion hits which makes absolutely no sense. Obviously the person responsible can't have blown himself up if they're so sure he's about to strike again later in the day.If he had even basic deductive reasoning skills Stevens would have always gotten off the train when it stopped and suspected only the people who got off with him. And on a bigger level no solid reason is ever given for why his commanders are so incredibly sure the suspect was even on the train ANYWHERE CLOSE to that 8 minute window he keeps visiting to begin withSo in short Not only does this movie make no sense it doesn't even seem like it's TRYING to make sense. It just feels like the filmmakers are giving you the finger and yelling eat it you morons! for the entire running time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh how we all love us some good old fashioned Contained Action Thrillers! Last year we got the dreadful but noteworthy Unstoppable  in which our two heroes stationed themselves inside a moving train in an attempt to stop an unmanned freight train heading toward a city. Let it be noted that film is nothing like Source Code. No sir not one bit. What is Source Code you ask? Think something along the lines of Die HardGroundhog DayClueThe board game in a nutshell. So what makes this film different? It's smart focused and suspenseful. Whereas in Unstoppable we pretty much knew where the whole deal was heading. But we're not talking about that film. This is Source Code and i'm going to tell you straight up this flick is the best film this year SO FAR. Source Code begins with our lead character Colter Stevens Jake Gyllenhall waking up on a Chicago commuter train opposite Christina Michelle Monaghan a woman whom we sense he's never met talking to him as if they've known each other some time. Immediately after we learn that he's a Helicopter pilot for the US Army and that he in fact has never met this woman before. He has no clue how he's gotten to where he is or why. All he knows is that this woman apparently knows him well and thinks his name is 'Sean'. Confused by all of this he goes to the bathroom only to find that the person in the mirror isn't him it's someone else. As us the audience try to process all of this information in our mind the train abruptly explodes into flames killing everyone on board. The opening immediately attaches you to the story with the great score unsettling tone and disorienting editing. It also leaves us with tons of questions What the hell just happened? Who is Christina? Who is this 'Sean' Character? Why is Colter in this situation?Then Colter wakes up again but now in a dimly lit cement capsule alone talking to fellow soldier Goodwin. We discover that the commuter train he was just on was destroyed by a terrorist bomb earlier that day and that there may be an even larger attack that could destroy Chicago. We also learn that he's a participant in an experimental Army intelligence program that allows him to continually relive the last eight minutes of one of the train's passengers life Sean in order to find the bomb and the terrorist who has threatened the larger attack in the heart of Chicago. And like Groundhog Day he experiences the same events over and over again remembering each and every one. Giving him the chance to inspect every suspicious passenger as well as getting to know Christina a bit more a long the way and eventually beginning to care for her safety. But unfortunately all of the these people are already dead they only exist in the parallel universe of the 'Source Code'. Every eight minutes he's warped back to the capsule where he is debriefed by Jeffery Wright and Vera Farmiga's characters then sent back into the Source Code. The science behind the film is very farfetched so it's up to you the viewer to let go and let Duncan Jones and his crew take over your mind for an hour and a half. And he promises a very intense thrill ride that will definitely be memorable in the future as a very intelligent and unique take on the contained thriller. Nevertheless there definitely are plotholes in the film and the ending is maybe too subtle for the everyday scifi fanatic. But i believe it's safe to say that this film succeeds in almost every category with the constant suspense and mystery great action sequences and the amazing score. Source Code keeps you guessing throughout anticipating who the bomber could be. The very definition of High Concept.Source Code is well deserved full price worthy movie that hopefully will become a box office success as well. God knows Hollywood doesn't put out enough original material like this anymore.J.G.".

	onyx:emotionText "Oh how we all love us some good old fashioned Contained Action Thrillers! Last year we got the dreadful but noteworthy Unstoppable  in which our two heroes stationed themselves inside a moving train in an attempt to stop an unmanned freight train heading toward a city. Let it be noted that film is nothing like Source Code. No sir not one bit. What is Source Code you ask? Think something along the lines of Die HardGroundhog DayClueThe board game in a nutshell. So what makes this film different? It's smart focused and suspenseful. Whereas in Unstoppable we pretty much knew where the whole deal was heading. But we're not talking about that film. This is Source Code and i'm going to tell you straight up this flick is the best film this year SO FAR. Source Code begins with our lead character Colter Stevens Jake Gyllenhall waking up on a Chicago commuter train opposite Christina Michelle Monaghan a woman whom we sense he's never met talking to him as if they've known each other some time. Immediately after we learn that he's a Helicopter pilot for the US Army and that he in fact has never met this woman before. He has no clue how he's gotten to where he is or why. All he knows is that this woman apparently knows him well and thinks his name is 'Sean'. Confused by all of this he goes to the bathroom only to find that the person in the mirror isn't him it's someone else. As us the audience try to process all of this information in our mind the train abruptly explodes into flames killing everyone on board. The opening immediately attaches you to the story with the great score unsettling tone and disorienting editing. It also leaves us with tons of questions What the hell just happened?

	schema:headline " Much better than expected";
	schema:reviewBody "At first I was expecting the source code to be a mediocre mystery that was all about reviving a dead girl. However this was not the case at all in this movie which was a welcome change. The Source code was a thriller that was constantly moving constantly generating questions and keeping the movie interesting. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the variety of traits the main character Gylenhall shows in the movie who has a strong sense of justice duty honor and love. Unlike some movies the main character is not an idiot pilot and has considerable knowledge of a variety of topics one being quantum theory. Another positive quality of this movie is how each visit in the source code continues to build up to the climax of the movie. The constant search for new pieces of evidence is also intertwined with constant character development of the protagonist allowing you to get a better attachment to the character. Another thing I found fun was each time he came out of the code the character and story development continue to take place again driving the action. Now let's talk about some weaknesses of the movie One big thing is the protagonist seems to be too perfect his collective traits of knowing advanced quantum theory make him a little unbelievable. A second thing is the explanation and ending may be too complicated or too unreal for some audience members though I did enjoy the ending that took place. The third flaw has been present ever since the trailer came out in which the person who bombed the train is also planning to make another attack. As a result this automatically narrows the suspects on the train. If you keep thinking during the movie then you can figure out who it is within probably two or three visits to the code. Regardless of the weaknesses the thought development and constant pace are more than enough to keep you entertained and happy. At the same time it also has some good morals built in about finding true happiness and working through the negatives of the world. Thus overall I would give this movie an 8.59 on my scale. I hope you enjoy as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Source Code has a powerful trailer setting up some intriguing questions to be answered and hinting at three plots inside the virtual reality outside it and an interplay between these two that should solve some crucial points. Unfortunately the film itself contains absolutely nothing that isn't already in the trailer. I saw the film with my wife. She fell asleep in the middle woke up half an hour later and asked me was he on the train again? to which I answered several times. What did I miss? Absolutely nothing. The whole movie is an exercise in wasting time by a screenwriter whose ideas ran out shortly after he thought up a great trailer read sales pitch. I can almost hear it Inception meets Groundhog Day and all happening entirely inside the Inner Space capsule!. Unfortunately other than recycling from the exceedingly overdone virtual reality movie genre this film has nothing. There is only one plot whodunit? and that plot progresses nowhere and is finished when the question is answered by the first candidate the audience suspects but the last the protagonist bothers checking. The ending of the movie on the other hand is so bad I dare not even blame the poor screenwriter. It must have been the work of a focus group. Whatever its source it is lame and unconvincing. Do not expect any of the questions posed by the trailer to be answered. They are not.I see this movie as an homage to Quantum Leap. The classic stranger in the mirror scene is featured and even Scott Bakula is called in to deliver his famous Oh boy. The scene where this happens is itself a testament to the emotional inconsistency of the film the last thing the hero does is the one thing he keeps telling everybody he wants to do.My verdict Quantum Leap deserves so much better than this.".

Lets examine the two possibilities for the world that they are operating in.In the first they have developed code that allows them to put a person's consciousness into the body of someone else in a mockup of the world as it was at that time an infinite number of times. Fine  Where did this mockup come from? They implied that it was from the the guy who Gyllenhal is inhabiting but the train exploded... his brain would be peanut butter along with everyone else on that train. OK so lets say magically his head got tossed away from the train and they retrieved it how exactly does this guy manage to have complete knowledge of everything that exists in that world? He didn't go into the bathroom and open the ceiling and find the bomb there so there would be nothing there in his version of the world. He either got off the train or stayed on it so there's no way he could know what happened after the point that the train moved on. He might continue to believe that the Middle Eastern stereotype guy was the terrorist  there's no way he could have any knowledge of what happened after those two events diverged. So of course the virtual world example is ridiculous and makes no sense.Alright so what about the idea that it is an alternate reality? This is even harder to believe. If its an alternate reality then of course there is no way to believe that the events would have unfolded in the same way as in the reality the movie takes place in. Every alternate would be different and none would reliably provide information about the reality of the movie. The guy that Gyllenhal inhabits maybe doesn't even exist in the alternate reality. Maybe he died of cancer. Maybe he works in Japan. Maybe he called in sick today. Who knows???If its a virtual construct then all the information is already there just parse the data. If its an alternate reality then by the definition of the word ALTERNATE you can't rely on it being even marginally similar to your reality. And if its time travel you could literally send him back an infinite number of times in succession. Just by the odds you would eventually get the data you needed by reading his brain which is silly by itself don't get me started...And then there is the annoying obfuscation that moves the plot along but is entirely unnecessary for the movie. There's no need to hide facts from Gyllenhal's character  Just tell him what he's doing! There's no need to get his permission  Just send him back! Why the writers play these stupid games with their audience I haven't a clue.Stop being stupid moviegoing zombies! Be critical! Ask questions!If you keep consuming this kind of crap and saying its a filet mignon the studios will continue to feed you CRAP.".

For the kind of arrogant bullshit this movie presents which is NOT science fiction it's the new genre bullshit fiction it should be banned for reasons of subculture and attacking the sanctity of computer science the most advanced and helpfull science we've got the pinacle of civilization.The dialog is complete bs not just because of the misused jargon but mainly because it tries hard to be militaristic and sf trust me it's actually bullshit fiction.The special effects are not there. Even if the train crash is played repeatedly it's just some fire covering the train and lots of noise. That's about it. Nothing more to see. No train wrecks no real accident. NOTHING.The final scene tries to be something like the Matrix Effect with the camera moving around while everything is still. Unfortunately it is just a collage of people's pictures and the camera just zooms out train background people's pictures. It is so obvious it shouldn't have been done. It's not 2011 worthy.The plot is made of holes  How can a human mind have enough information about every single corner on that train including contents of books or what's concealed in the ceiling note that the attacked did not die in the train wreck?  Even if we supposed that maybe they reconstructed the information from all the dead people there still wouldn't be enough to mimic people's reactions the information was reconstructed from a single person  If the big bad quantic theory bullshit computer already had the information about the train and it's contents then it already knew where the bomb was. Why was it necessary for the wimpiest soldier ever in cinema to play with to find out where it was? How in hell did the main character sent a SMS message from one parallel world to another also there's a moral issue about taking that teacher's lifeplace  so he can be with that girl. The nuclear bomb is so small smaller than a little TV. Wtf nuclear bombs are huge. They don't fit into a little box and don't have Christmas lights on them.There is a lot of propaganda about terrorism and it actually contains brain washing patriotic stuff like reasons for a soldier to die for his country for example it is told to the soldier that he must stay alive and keep fighting searching so he can serve his country by finding out where bomb which will kill the entire city of Chicago.The soundtrack the acting the camera moves and general pace of the movie try to create a state of suspense. It did work for idiots didn't work for the rest of the audience you don't want to know the kind of people like the movie I interrogated a lot and really only complete idiots.Please stop making movies like these. At least invent your own words for the kind of bs you present. When I heard charge the drivers I was gonna leave the cinema too bad I was with someone else.".

It's not really a whodunit it's not really a scifi flick and it's not really a love story either.The whodunit part was merely filler  the mystery is solved after the very first steps. Where is the bomb? Is it here? Oh.. it was. Well who's the villain then? Is it perhaps this guy? It was? Uh okay.The love story is equally unconvincing. Remember we're talking about a romance that develops a total of eight minutes. There's no real reason for them to fall in love either. Colter apparently started liking her just because they sat opposite to each other. The love story is thus also a sideshow.The scifi parts are unconvincing and worse illogical. If Colter is viewing another man's experiences wouldn't he only know what the man also knew? How can he step outside the train? The Source Code itself is explained shruggingly through quantum mechanics. You know sciency stuff. Also computers. Cue scifi fans rolling their eyes.If you can suspend disbelief enough and somehow look past the glaring plot holes Source Code could have been an average 710star scifi thriller.. if not for the bizarre ending. In the last 10 minutes all of the logic and rules that the movie has been building up so far get completely thrown out the window for no good reason whatsoever.Instead of letting Colter have his last moments of peace before an inevitable death effectively making a point that we all must die someday so you might as well make your last moments beautiful and worth dying for the movie takes an absurd leap into nonsense. Apparently this ending  though beautiful and powerful  would've been too dark so instead Colter somehow jumps to an alternate universe where he takes over the body of another man effectively killing him in the process but the movie ignores this moral dilemma and somehow nothing bad actually happened.Somehow Colter was right all along and you can alter the laws and timelines of the universe with the love of an imagined 8minute romance and to top it all off he sends an email from his dream to a real cell phone in an alternate universe.What point is the movie trying to make here exactly?Nothing makes any sense. I'm betting this movie was prescreened to a test audience who thought the ending was too dark so they quickly pieced together a happy ending at any cost. One that completely destroys any point andor sense the movie was trying to make.Without the last 10 minutes this film would've been an average 710. As it is now I give it a 410 due to internal inconsistencies usually seen in cheap daytime TVproductions.".

Based on a screenplay by Ben Ripley who previously authored two directtoDVD Species flicks this lazy follow up to director Duncan Jones' understated 2009 character study Moon is a major disappointment.Steeped in pseudoscience Source Code's biggest fault is its failure to adequately explain the parameters of the titular alternate reality experiment. Through vague governmental computer wizardry Army Capt. Colter Stevens Jake Gyllenhaal is uploaded into the body of a civilian aboard an illfated Chicagobound commuter train and tasked with locating a rigged explosive and its owner. To complicate matters he only has eight minutes until impact and it's back to start.So begins a trial and error rescue missionnot to save the train itself but to identify the culprit and avert a looming second attack. If you're already confused don't sweat itStevens is too. After every botched attempt he finds himself back in a dank isolation room harnessed into an enormous machine with a video link to his commanding officers. As he probes them for more information on his mission he also pries out the requisite exposition about the tech.Long story short Source Code isn't time travel. It merely relocates Stevens' consciousness into the lingering memory trail of the recently deceased. Cool right? The problem is that such a heady concept immediately opens itself to a thousand potential plot holes. For instance if Stevens is reliving the terminal eight minutes of someone's life why can he exit the train at random when the body and mind he's sharing has no frame of reference for it? How does he even know what the passengers two cars over look like?Even if you buy into the flawed logic of Source Code the filmmaking just isn't up to snuff. Jones throws subtlety to the wind for this antithetical take on the genre he seemed so passionate for two years ago. He imbues the proceedings with a nondescript glossy veneer and achieves unanimously stilted performances from his cast. Character actor Jeffrey Wright comes away looking especially bad but Gyllenhaal is also mismanaged in the lead.It isn't their fault Jones lacks vision and Ripley lacks talent. The latter in particular seems incapable of executing on even his better ideas interestingly. By his hand Stevens' lame bombsniffing stratagem boils down to blindly badgering suspiciouslooking commuters and eventually lucky guesswork. Maybe some will respond to his common sense approach but I much prefer watching characters more clever than myself weasel their way out of trouble. For all his military training Captain Stevens might as well have been Joe Average Passenger.A far cry from the careful construction of Duncan Jones' offbeat debut Source Code is a discouragingly impersonal film shellacked with Hollywood disinfectant. Worse it's plain bad science fiction. It's a halfhearted amalgam of films like The Matrix and Inception hold the fresh perspective. Still I'm not ready to count Jones out. The young director had a hand in fleshing out Moon and will hopefully creatively contribute more to future projects. However as it stands his first two features couldn't be more at odds. Taken alone Source Code is a misfire given that it's the sophomore effort of so promising a talent it's a major missed opportunity.".

One is the story that you give the viewers to get them from where they are to where the film is. Usually the filmmaker either calls up a genre shorthand or invokes an allpowerful military or corporate force.A second story involves the mechanics of that world as they develop through the film. Here the mechanics are simple you have the real world of the movie and an eight minute entry into quantum parallel worlds sharing a common event. As the story progresses a human mind powered by love is able to shift the layers of that quantum reality. Okay.The third story is what we allow ourselves to register be it a romance or redemption story  or one of the very few other options in the sellable storybag. The goal of a talented storyteller at least in this market is to enhance the engagement in that third story by folding the second and possibly the first by some shared structure. Think of 50 First Dates which successfully merged all three and teased us into investing in the romance beyond the barriers we normally would erect.Now this. These three story threads coexist in the same ninety minutes but otherwise they are distinct. The first is a cheat military technology don't ya know.The second is also a cheat of sorts because the parallel quantum folds aren't used narratively. We have the faint impress of a detective searching plus some explosions. Chicago is made safe in one of the parallel realities but not the one we started in.The third story is perhaps the biggest cheat of all the romance boy falls in love and gets the girl. But how? Why?

It wasn't for me because I was able to ignore Hans Zimmer's hospital machine drone and surf the resonances among the three stories and their surprises. Groundhog Day was a success because of its uncomplicated harmony among the three the first alluding to camera magic.This is a disaster.

	schema:reviewBody "A young man is caught in limbo  in religions the state between death and rebirth and used for the war against terrorism. Now the prospect of somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in dark star by John Carpenter and that film showed what could be done with such a concept. This film however is a totally different matter. Even beyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish war on terror bs. Nowhere it is pronounced that only the most powerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror. Of course not because this is by no means a leftist film and instead a film for idiots.

Now the prospect of somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in dark star by John Carpenter and that film showed what could be done with such a concept. This film however is a totally different matter. Even beyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish war on terror bs. Nowhere it is pronounced that only the most powerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror. Of course not because this is by no means a leftist film and instead a film for idiots.

If you have seen KILL BILL Vol. 1 you will find out that even Quentin Tarantino was inspired by this film once you see the opening scenes. The special effects are usually not realistic but are quite imaginative. The whole film could be seen as something of a morality fable.There is definitely a message to the film although most people write this one off because of it's exploitative sounding title. There are several very creepy and effective scenes in the film and this film left a lasting impression on me. I think someday this film will be recognized for the horror classic that it is. Even if you have to watch a pan  scan dubbed copy it is well worth catching.By the way the Englishlanguage version is called GOKE BODY SNATCHER FROM HELL. It certainly got my attention. Pacemaker was the American distributor. I first saw it on a lousy VHS rental copy. Rumors about a letterboxed American NTSC release to DVD have yet to be fulfilled but I remain optimistic.".

Yay! Okay this is a bgrade movie and the effects are pretty lousy especially the plane crash sequence but to say it's a bad movie is far from the truth. For me it's the perfect example of a low budget horror movie transcending its limitations  coming up with something surprisingly creepy and surreal See also William Castle's 'The Tingler' Herk Harvey's 'Carnival Of Souls' Coffin Joe's 'At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul'etc. The opening is terrific  a plane flies through an eerie red sky and birds throw themselves at the windows in sheer terror. There's a suspected bomb on board and the plane crashes after sighting a UFO. On the ground the survivors are initially worried about the basics like water and rescue plus the presence of a suspected assassin but pretty soon they also have to contend with a bizarre alien invasion! Like I said many of the special effects are cheesy but they're still effective. The acting is generally quite good the alien will freak you out and there's several interesting references to the Vietnam war which was unexpected and gave the movie quite a unique background can you remember any American SF movies of the 1960s even MENTIONING Vietnam?. I highly recommend 'Goke Body Snatcher From Hell' to all horror fans who treasure the offbeat and the unusual. Hopefully this overlooked movie will now reach a larger audience. QT I salute you!".

They used to have them and in widescreen more or less but apparently cannot make any more. Mine was one I found for sale that was already viewed but was lucky to find.The widescreen is not the complete picture but it's close there's not too much cropped off at the sides and it's about 1.66 to 1 ratio. Pretty good image and color too. The story concerns an airplane crash landing on some sort of island or rural area where a spaceship has landed. The alien is a life form which takes control of a person by entering the body and then turns that person into a vampire who drains its victims of all blood. It seems this alien is the vanguard of an advancing conquest. The whole thing is pretty eerie but has plenty of goofy moments that will make for laughs. There's the whole idea of mankind racing to destroy itself along with pretty vapid references to Vietnam and how terrible the world is. The idea is that the earth will get what it deserves since we can't live in peace. Good old 1970s peacenik handwringing at the terrible state of humanity with a good dash of cardboard character clichs thrown in. You'll want to see it for the really weird execution of a pretty spooky premise and fast paced too. One of those type of films that cries out for a remake by someone who knows how to handle scifi horror.".

It had a reputation among the hard core film fans as something out of left field but not very good. Many years later I had forgotten about the film but had chanced across director Sato's deliriously silly kid's film Golden Bat. I was rather surprised that this film was by the same man.The film is very artificial from the first shot of a model jet in front of a red sky to the rock quarry most of film takes place in. Most Japanese film fans will recognize this quarry. It's in samurai films gangster films and every other episode of Power Rangers. The cheapness is offset by the care of the direction and photography. The special effects are super color saturated and very bizarre at times. While definitely not a children's film Sato utilizes a number of techniques from Golden Bat including the generic action music and the kabuki inspired movements for the possessed. The energy that's put into this film makes up for the logic gaps bad acting and cheapness. The ending is very unexpected nightmarish and disturbing. Finishing this film is like waking from a very bad night of sleep. As Sato has no further films in his listing here yet lived for quite a while after I wonder what was his state of mind while making this film.Recommended.".

As if this were not enough a globular glowinthedark UFO causes the plane to crash in an unoccupied and desolate area which looks suspiciously like the quarry where Fred Flinstone once worked. The survivors are soon faced with an alien invasion in the form of moldy cosmic silly putty. The slime takes over human hosts by oozing its way up over the face and into a gash opened in the hypnotized victims forehead...a gash which even when closed up rather resembles a vagina and gave me the uncontrollable giggles. Anyway the possessed human hosts go on vampiric killing sprees draining their victims of blood and turning them a pleasant shade of blue. In the end the dwindling survivors show their bravery and do battle with the nasty aliens or become cowardly lumps of Jello and run away screaming. There's a lot of anti Vietnam War protesting throughout complete with stock footage of wartime atrocities. It's a nice touch considering the time in which this film was made and the unpopularity of antiwar protesting period. There's also a surprising twist ending which for some reason reminded me of Fulci's film The Beyond combined with 28 Days Later. All in all this is a goofy badly dubbed and totally entertaining film to watch. If you're a fan of Japanese cinema vampire films and scifi flying saucer invasions you won't want to miss this one.".

The biggest problem is that all of the characters are very annoying and rather mean so it's impossible to want them to live through this event. Another problem is the screenplay which has the characters doing nothing except fighting bitching and moaning. This grows very tiresome after the first half hour and we get an hour more of it.

	schema:reviewBody "Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro or Goke Bodysnatcher From Hell as it's more commonly known amongst Western audiences starts with Air Japan flight JA307 from Haneda to Osaka flying through a bizarre orange tinted sky  clouds. Something is very wrong first birds commit suicide by flying into the plane  then the pilot Hiroyuki Nishimoto receiving a radio message saying that there may be a bomb on board. It's up to copilot Sugisaka Teruo Yoshida  the stewardess Kuzumi Asakura Tomomi Sato to check all the passengers luggage. Besides a mad bomber an assassin Hideo Ko is also on board who pulls a gun out  hijacks the plane. He demands that the pilot change course soon after a blinding light is seen heading straight for the plane  only just misses it. All the gauges go crazy  the pilot is forced to make a crash landing in a remote part of the Japanese country. During the landing the pilot is killed but both Sugisaka  Asakura survive along with eight passengers Mano Eizo Kitamura a top brass politician an American lady named Mrs. Neal Kathy Horan Mr. Tokuyasu who owns a company that makes weapons  his wife Noriko Tokuyasu Yuko Kusunoki by the way I took these spellings directly off my subtitled DVD  they are correct the IMDb is wrong the original bomber Dr. Momotake Kazuo Kato a psychiatrist Saga Masaya Takahashi who claims he is a researcher in space biology  the assassin. Since they were off course Sugisaka has no idea where they are or indeed do the rescue teams. If they are to survive  make it back to civilisation then they must all work together unfortunately the darker side of human nature begins to rear it's ugly head as petty squabbling  selfishness sets in. If being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food or water  surrounded by a bunch of aholes wasn't bad enough they learn of an alien invasion that intends to wipe out the entire planet...This Japanese production was directed by Hajime Sato  I really liked it it's eerie creepy  atmospheric. The script by Kyuzo Kobayashi  Susumu Takahisa has a great central idea body jumping blob like aliens a plane crash to isolate our human victims birds committing suicide  a strong recurring moral message that war is bad. Unfortunately Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro's biggest problem is it's cast of highly unlikable characters who squabble bicker argue act like spoilt brats  generally behave in a selfish  unrealistic way. Everyone except the hero Sugisaka  Asakura get involved in some heated argument that obviously wouldn't help anyone especially themselves. Whether it's letting people fall off cliffs locking people up trying to ruin other's careers shooting people or trying to let the aliens kill others so they might live it becomes very annoying  all the characters become irritating quite quickly. It moves along at a nice pace  never becomes dull or boring I loved the downbeat ending too. The one area where Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro does stand out is it's filmmaking techniques  visual style. While the special effects look a little dated they are very effective from the striking orange tinted sky to the brightly glowing flying saucers from the rich primary colours used throughout to the aliens appearance where they ooze into wounds in peoples foreheads from the images of dead people who were controlled by the aliens falling down turning to dust  literary blowing away in the wind to the final terrific vision of dozens of flying saucers headed towards Earth to complete the invasion. Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro is packed with memorable imagery much more so than any American 60's SciFi that I can think of. Tecnically the film is OK the scope cinematography is a joy to watch after years of cropped VHS tapes  just about every part of the frame is used. The music is great as well. There is no blood or gore a few split open foreheads  a couple of corpses is about as graphic as it gets. I can't really comment on the acting as I don't understand Japenese it seemed OK. Oddly the American woman Neal speaks in English throughout. I also have this on VHS which is dubbed into English  panned and scanned but it's been years since I've seen that so I'm basing this review on the widescreen subtitled DVD that I own. Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro is a highly memorable piece of Japanese Sci Fi horror from the late 60's which still seems relevant particularly with the recent events with suicide bombers  terrorists. I just wish some of the characters were more likable overall I think this is definitely worth tracking down to see. Recommended for SciFi enthusiasts  weird cinema fans in general.".

All the gauges go crazy  the pilot is forced to make a crash landing in a remote part of the Japanese country. During the landing the pilot is killed but both Sugisaka  Asakura survive along with eight passengers Mano Eizo Kitamura a top brass politician an American lady named Mrs. Neal Kathy Horan Mr. Tokuyasu who owns a company that makes weapons  his wife Noriko Tokuyasu Yuko Kusunoki by the way I took these spellings directly off my subtitled DVD  they are correct the IMDb is wrong the original bomber Dr. Momotake Kazuo Kato a psychiatrist Saga Masaya Takahashi who claims he is a researcher in space biology  the assassin. Since they were off course Sugisaka has no idea where they are or indeed do the rescue teams. If they are to survive  make it back to civilisation then they must all work together unfortunately the darker side of human nature begins to rear it's ugly head as petty squabbling  selfishness sets in. If being stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food or water  surrounded by a bunch of aholes wasn't bad enough they learn of an alien invasion that intends to wipe out the entire planet...This Japanese production was directed by Hajime Sato  I really liked it it's eerie creepy  atmospheric. The script by Kyuzo Kobayashi  Susumu Takahisa has a great central idea body jumping blob like aliens a plane crash to isolate our human victims birds committing suicide  a strong recurring moral message that war is bad. Unfortunately Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro's biggest problem is it's cast of highly unlikable characters who squabble bicker argue act like spoilt brats  generally behave in a selfish  unrealistic way. Everyone except the hero Sugisaka  Asakura get involved in some heated argument that obviously wouldn't help anyone especially themselves. Whether it's letting people fall off cliffs locking people up trying to ruin other's careers shooting people or trying to let the aliens kill others so they might live it becomes very annoying  all the characters become irritating quite quickly. It moves along at a nice pace  never becomes dull or boring I loved the downbeat ending too. The one area where Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro does stand out is it's filmmaking techniques  visual style. While the special effects look a little dated they are very effective from the striking orange tinted sky to the brightly glowing flying saucers from the rich primary colours used throughout to the aliens appearance where they ooze into wounds in peoples foreheads from the images of dead people who were controlled by the aliens falling down turning to dust  literary blowing away in the wind to the final terrific vision of dozens of flying saucers headed towards Earth to complete the invasion. Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro is packed with memorable imagery much more so than any American 60's SciFi that I can think of. Tecnically the film is OK the scope cinematography is a joy to watch after years of cropped VHS tapes  just about every part of the frame is used. The music is great as well. There is no blood or gore a few split open foreheads  a couple of corpses is about as graphic as it gets. I can't really comment on the acting as I don't understand Japenese it seemed OK. Oddly the American woman Neal speaks in English throughout. I also have this on VHS which is dubbed into English  panned and scanned but it's been years since I've seen that so I'm basing this review on the widescreen subtitled DVD that I own. Kyuketsuki Gokemidoro is a highly memorable piece of Japanese Sci Fi horror from the late 60's which still seems relevant particularly with the recent events with suicide bombers  terrorists. I just wish some of the characters were more likable overall I think this is definitely worth tracking down to see. Recommended for SciFi enthusiasts  weird cinema fans in general.";

	schema:reviewBody "The big screen very rarely ever treats its audiences to a romance where the 'asshole' of the story gets more than the simple role of causing friction and delay between the inevitable cathartic moments of bliss between the matchmadeinheaven. So what then does happen when the genre's example of the antiChrist falls in love? What happens when his or her character actually rises above the clichs that so often dominates their two dimensional motives? The result is inevitably the antiromcom. My Best Friend's girl is for all intents and purposes not the kind of atypical romantic comedy affair that we are so often forced upon to see month after month of the year. Instead it presents immediately disagreeable but in turn real people to occupy its tale of romance. The result is one that will have audiences undeniably split there will be those who will simply not be able to get by the ugly sides of this story's characters particularly the lead male and those who actually revel in a solid love story that doesn't try to be your charming friend all the way through. Essentially the dominate colours here are not pastel pinks and blues but blacks and greys. In real life romance doesn't usually play out like it does in the movies but with My Best Friend's Girl there's cause for dispute over this common belief.When looking through traditional romcom eyeglass lead character Tank Dane Cook isn't the most likable or even compelling leading man. A Rude callous chauvinistic and manipulative womaniser Tank is certainly more fit to be the story's antagonist male than its protagonist. For a living Tank works at a call centre for a company that sells air purifiers and yet this isn't where the majority of his income comes from and that's just as well because he's terrible at that one. As a way to make some money on the side lots of it Tank works as a 'nightmarerebounder' when a guy gets chucked to the curb his partner Tank chats her up treats her to a lousy date and in turn the woman realises how nave she was presumably being. Of course this premise has problems it's contrived and yet clever in a masochistic sort of way. Most enjoyable of all however is that it at least provides as a refreshing change of scenery in this current climate of lacklustre romantic comedies. After wave upon wave of gaginducing melodrama without any hint of real depth purging themselves upon us this year it is strangely uplifting to be treated to a story that runs on low standards morals and characters. Love isn't perfect in fact it can be down right ugly at times and while My Best Friend's Girl isn't out to dramatise that theme it does well at poking fun of it.Of course all of this simply wouldn't work if Tank himself was a lazy caricature of the worstmanever but he isn't. Dane Cook does a great job here and I am usually a detractor of his work of giving Tank an under riding sense of goodheartedness that lies beneath all the callous games that he so eloquently plays with his one night stands. For all intents and purposes we shouldn't like Tank and although many will not be able to see past that faade I was definitely won over by Cook's charming and grounded portrayal. What works even more to the movie's ability to win the audiences over however is its ability to crack a chuckle or two. Sure it goes without saying that much of the humour here is crass and gauche to the point where it may turn people even further away but director Howard Deutch does a fine job of balancing his two core elements in ways that so many romantic comedies just don't ever get close to. That is not to say that the director gets everything right because he doesn't. There are numerous problems arising throughout the feature most notable of which exists between the lacking chemistry between Cook and his costar Kate Hudson but given the way in which Deutch presents Jordan Cahan's antiromantic story it's not something worth crying about.To close things off I will say that My Best Friend's Girl certainly isn't hilarious nor is it tearjerkingly sentimental instead it exists as a lighthearted by nevertheless emotive tale of untraditional love blossoming from untraditional circumstances. In this vein the movie distances itself from the immediate residents within the somewhat bloated genre presenting a refreshing polar opposite view of romance on the big screen in all its imperfections. The movie itself as a whole certainly reflects this central point as it is nowhere near perfection thanks to a superfluous and unnecessarily neat ending but for the most part Deutch succeeds in delivering something quite unique and satisfying at the same time. What is most refreshing of all however is that the movie very rarely succumbs to holding your hand and trying to get you to like it. So often movies of this nature will pile desperate devices upon tired clichs to get you to feel something and yet Deutch doesn't seem to care. To put it simply then I guess if you are a sucker for the average romcom where characters are prestine witty awkward and immediately lovable then My Best Friend's Girl probably isn't for you. Instead I recommend this to those who prefer edgier romance and even edgier comedy this isn't your average fare by any means no it's better than that like its lead character it's actually good nobrainer careless fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "The big screen very rarely ever treats its audiences to a romance where the 'asshole' of the story gets more than the simple role of causing friction and delay between the inevitable cathartic moments of bliss between the matchmadeinheaven. So what then does happen when the genre's example of the antiChrist falls in love? What happens when his or her character actually rises above the clichs that so often dominates their two dimensional motives? The result is inevitably the antiromcom. My Best Friend's girl is for all intents and purposes not the kind of atypical romantic comedy affair that we are so often forced upon to see month after month of the year. Instead it presents immediately disagreeable but in turn real people to occupy its tale of romance. The result is one that will have audiences undeniably split there will be those who will simply not be able to get by the ugly sides of this story's characters particularly the lead male and those who actually revel in a solid love story that doesn't try to be your charming friend all the way through. Essentially the dominate colours here are not pastel pinks and blues but blacks and greys. In real life romance doesn't usually play out like it does in the movies but with My Best Friend's Girl there's cause for dispute over this common belief.When looking through traditional romcom eyeglass lead character Tank Dane Cook isn't the most likable or even compelling leading man. A Rude callous chauvinistic and manipulative womaniser Tank is certainly more fit to be the story's antagonist male than its protagonist. For a living Tank works at a call centre for a company that sells air purifiers and yet this isn't where the majority of his income comes from and that's just as well because he's terrible at that one. As a way to make some money on the side lots of it Tank works as a 'nightmarerebounder' when a guy gets chucked to the curb his partner Tank chats her up treats her to a lousy date and in turn the woman realises how nave she was presumably being. Of course this premise has problems it's contrived and yet clever in a masochistic sort of way. Most enjoyable of all however is that it at least provides as a refreshing change of scenery in this current climate of lacklustre romantic comedies. After wave upon wave of gaginducing melodrama without any hint of real depth purging themselves upon us this year it is strangely uplifting to be treated to a story that runs on low standards morals and characters. Love isn't perfect in fact it can be down right ugly at times and while My Best Friend's Girl isn't out to dramatise that theme it does well at poking fun of it.Of course all of this simply wouldn't work if Tank himself was a lazy caricature of the worstmanever but he isn't. Dane Cook does a great job here and I am usually a detractor of his work of giving Tank an under riding sense of goodheartedness that lies beneath all the callous games that he so eloquently plays with his one night stands. For all intents and purposes we shouldn't like Tank and although many will not be able to see past that faade I was definitely won over by Cook's charming and grounded portrayal. What works even more to the movie's ability to win the audiences over however is its ability to crack a chuckle or two.

Okay concept if executed well. Then we get Jason Biggs trying to clean up his act to impress Kate Hudson who likes him but is not wowed by him. Since Jason is Dane's roommate he hires Dane to do his specialty. By this point we're 20 minutes into the movie and it made me laugh twice and is otherwise pretty lame. I looked at my watch. Then Kate's roommate preps her for the date to sow some wild oats and the real fun begins.The humor in My Best Friend's Girl is rude crude inappropriate socially irredeemable  and made me laugh out loud  a lot! Cook's chemistry with Hudson was electric. The twist is she can give as good as she gets and vice versa. She gets under his skin but he stays in denial leading to his next assignment which to me was the high point of the movie. The girl is religious and he takes her to a restaurant in an old church called Jesus Crust  where pizza is a religious experience. i don't want to spoil the inspired gags in this sequence but I was nearly rolling in the aisles. This victim actually winds up setting the stage for a few plot twists I didn't expect. The movie is raucous fun from then on until the end.I thought Alec Baldwin was absurdly funny as the Women's Studies professor who is Cook's father. His chemistry with Cook is also terrific. Cook's former client who is about to marry Kate's sister is also hilarious as is she and the woman playing Kate's mother. Then the movie goes a bit softconventional and derivative  but is still witty at the end and the last two scenes play out nicely.This is not a piece of art but if you ever went to frat parties and can remember having fun at them and want to spend some time laughing out loud give My Best Friend's Girl a look. I work in Manhattan so I have to be careful to whom I say I liked this movie  that's why I call it a guilty pleasure!".

	schema:reviewBody "Was this the best comedy of 2008? Was this the best comedy Dane Cook has starred in? Or even Jason Biggs Kate Hudson possibly? No. No. No... and no. The likes of American Pie How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and Waiting... OK I guess I couldn't say Waiting being more of a Reynold's flick but even Employee Of The Month truly were far more superior flicks then this movie. Was it awful? No. Predictable? Yes. As most comedies are today predictable that is... this movie in my opinion falls short of funny.Does it have funny moments? Sure of course why wouldn't it!? But a few laughs isn't enough to be considered a Great Comedy just a good one. I would say my favorite part of this movie was Cook's character walking down the alter playing Johnny Cash as he flicks his cigarette to the side. I also liked how they used the 10count system for all his Rude tactics. But I'm sorry as much as I like Cook's standup comedy even acting I don't think he or anyone for that matter could have done this movie any justice. It was just another comedy and really I'm sick of Just another comedy. Thank god for Knocked up Superbad Zack And Miri 40 Yr Old Virgin and Pineapple Express! Those standout those are the new age of comedy. You want a laugh watch those then rewatch those then watch em again. You'll produce more laughs from those movies in repeat viewings as you would this one.Sadly not even the Farrelly brothers can produce quality not since There's Something About Mary and it's really pathetic. I don't know if it has to do with the fact that the companies are lowering the ratings to PG13 for sales ruining these directorswriters or just the directoswriters themselves? Bottom line if you want a good comedy to watch and get a few laughs with your girlfriend go rent this flick but I wouldn't recommend buying it.Z.CAPTON".

	onyx:emotionText "Was this the best comedy of 2008? Was this the best comedy Dane Cook has starred in? Or even Jason Biggs Kate Hudson possibly? No. No. No... and no. The likes of American Pie How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and Waiting... OK I guess I couldn't say Waiting being more of a Reynold's flick but even Employee Of The Month truly were far more superior flicks then this movie. Was it awful? No. Predictable? Yes. As most comedies are today predictable that is... this movie in my opinion falls short of funny.Does it have funny moments? Sure of course why wouldn't it!? But a few laughs isn't enough to be considered a Great Comedy just a good one. I would say my favorite part of this movie was Cook's character walking down the alter playing Johnny Cash as he flicks his cigarette to the side. I also liked how they used the 10count system for all his Rude tactics. But I'm sorry as much as I like Cook's standup comedy even acting I don't think he or anyone for that matter could have done this movie any justice.

Well this movie is going to flop big time mark my words. When a movie is this bad it will not do well. Word of mouth is more important than I think studios realize and this movie will not get much of that if any at all. Advance reviews are atrocious and they should be. This abortion of a movie is one of the biggest wastes of an hour and a half I've ever experienced. Special mention to Dane Cook's completely hammy and painfully unfunny performance. He's trying so hard that it's sad not delivering even one laugh and the preview screening I saw was PACKED. It was noticeably silent throughout save for a few embarrassed gigglesimmature teenagers laughing loudly at some of the pointless vulgar parts. Isn't Dane Cook's fifteen minutes up yet? He is one of the least funny comedians I've ever seen in a movie. Employee of the month was also a travesty.".

There are several problems wrong with this movie the title is misleading Jason Biggs really never had Kate Hudson as an official girlfriend in the movie so why is the title My Best Friend's Girl? The song My Best Friend's Girl is played almost over and over again in every scene it gets pretty annoying. Kate Hudson says she wants to get out there and date but she dates one guy and falls for him. Then Dane Cook is supposed to play this complete and total jerk who just messes around with women's heads and I'm supposed to believe he can just do a 180 on his personality when he finds the right girl? Oh this story gave me a headache.Dustin is crazy about a girl he has been dating Alexis so much that he moves quickly to say that he loves her and that they should move faster. Alexis freaks out and dumps Dusty leading him to ask his friend Tank for a favor Tank gets paid by other men to take their ex's out and to be a complete and total disgusting jerk making them realize that the guy they had before was an angel and should be given a second chance. Tank does this for Dusty one problem Tank actually really likes Alexis the plan backfires when Alexis tells Dusty she would like to continue to see other people. Dusty thinks Tank is still trying to help him while secretly he continues dating Alexis and finding out that he even falls for her just as hard as Dusty does.This movie is hypocritical sick and honestly doesn't have any redeemable qualities. I'm supposed to feel bad for Dane Cook's character after he realizes that Alexis is special and because he does one cute thing for her all that he's put other women through all he just did to his best friend all he is putting Alexis through I'm supposed to like him at the end? Not to mention Alexis sees him finally moving on after she dumps him he's with another woman and rudely breaks up their date making a fool out of herself. Dusty moves onto a slutty girl and... God this movie just made me so angry. It has 2 funny giggles that's about it I wouldn't really recommend it though. I love movies if they're aimed for a certain purpose I cut it a lot of slack but this movie was just very messy when it came to the story and it just got predictable and stupid.210".

It'a little hard to believe every women falling or going out with Cook or you ever see why Hudson falls for Cook at all but who cares. the movie makes you laugh. This movie is a formulaic romantic comedy but with the raunchy sense of Humor of 40 year old virgin knocked up and superbad. Best Friend will be hated by audiences as it doesn't have the underlining sweetness of 40 year old or knocked up.

But i didn't see a bad guy i saw his surface character a masochistic asshole who manipulates women for money and sex. but i thought they were also pretty obvious about his inner romantic. scenes like the one where hes watching Ghost and crying then blows it off as you cancelled the spice channel when Dusty walks in. When Dusty asks him to do his thing the way he trys to freak him out and get him not to ask without blowing his cover as the tough guy.The character i found myself hating in this movie was Dusty and the other guys who would actually employ tank. they claimed to love their girlfriends and yet they pay someone to terrorise their girlfriends back into a relationship they were obviously unhappy in. Dusty especially he acts like hes the nice guy but hes not hes just an asshole. a pathetic whiny loser who trys to trick a girl into loving him.and Tanks interactions with his father you can see years of mental conditioning. He sees himself as a younger version of his dad and his dad reaffirms this belief. He sees a life of being alone without love being incapable of committing himself to a relationship. I know how that feels i get being afraid that your half a person.everyone seems to regard Tank as the bad guy starring in the movie for a change but its not like that. He's a tool used by insecure stupid men to cripple their girlfriends into never leaving them.I kinda felt like women in this movie were unrepresented though the main female lead didn't really have all that much charisma she was just the love interest and not a lot more. the female characters i identified with were the best friend and the religious victim.And the cheesus crust scene made me laugh".

Dane Cook has gotten a bad rap and everyone that doesn't like him only feels that way because everyone else in the nation cant stop laughing at him.

	schema:reviewBody "My Best Friend's Girl is total brain candy for those who enjoy cheap good 'ole fashion raunchy humor. Though there is nothing truly great about this movie well perhaps with the exception of Kate Hudson it is a fun romp. Cook is extremely funny in this film as he adds his natural stand up like rhythm to the character. Alec Baldwin's performance is also excellent as the slick and sleazy father who taught Tank how to manipulate women. His character is also way over the top. My Best Friend's Girl is basically the antithesis of Hitch where Tank Cook is the man for hire he takes women out on the worst date of their lives with the intention to trick them into appreciating and reconnecting with their exboyfriend. Tank however meets his match when he's 'working' on Alexis Hudson and she is unmoved by his tactics and he subsequently falls for her. There is excellent tension between the two main characters as well as between Cook's and Biggs' relationship as Cook tries to hide his feelings from everyone including himself. The film reaches it's climax in a hysterical montage of Tank utilizing his tactics at a wedding where he goes way over the top with unacceptable and raunchy behavior.This is not the movie for you if you hate raunchy bawdy humor or if you are very religious and can't take a bit of humor against the church. If you can somewhat appreciate or at least tolerate it once you make it through the first 10 minutes it is pretty easy to continue. The climax ending is also as raunchy and over the top as the beginning and may take some tolerance too. But the majority of the film is not completely offensive.Highly recommended for fans of Superbad the 40 Year Old Virgin or the American Pie trilogy.".

	schema:headline " Dane Cook fails again as terrible writers give him a terrible script resulting in terrible material for 90 terrible minutes";
	schema:reviewBody "Dane Cook tries his comedy chops yet again by headlining this romantic comedy after the disaster known as Good Luck Chuck. Suffering the fate of many comedians like Norm MacDonald Dave Chappelle Richard Pryor John Leguizamo and more he just doesn't have success in translating his success on the microphone to the big screen in a leading role. Usually comedians fare better as supportingcameo roles with George Carlin Sarah Silverman Leguizamo Chappelle as examples. Even with his overrated comedy one has to admit Cook is at his prime whenever he busts out the cruel factor. Dane Cook has the look of a man that can verbally tear you apart and watch you moan for emotional mercy.This time in My Best Friend's Girl we can see the cruel side of Cook a side we hadn't seen yet. Unfortunately this movie fails again because Cook yet again tries the actual acting chops instead of pertaining to his humor. My Best Friend's Girl could have been a raunchy edgy comedy that takes no prisoners. Instead it treads on vulgar then at the same time attempts to add heart. It's almost impossible to mix raunch with heartThere's Something About Mary Dumb and Dumber and the 40YearOld Virgin are extremely rare examples. My Best Friend's Girl is not a rarity it's the average runofthemill mediocre romance flick that doesn't entertain often.In this movie we follow Tank Dane Cook as he tries to help out his friend Jason Biggs by delivering a bad time to his friend's ex Kate Hudsononly to wind up falling for her. Things get complicated when Tank starts developing a heart and begins to question the morals of his highpaying side job. The story isn't original but with original material could have come off as a smart romantic comedy. Unfortunately we receive moment after moment of expected crudeness with unexplainable unimportant unoriginal and unfunny material. They say a lot of improvisation was in this movie but besides Dane Cook's few quirky oneliners there's not much hilarity there. The writing cast failed to bring anything to the table and expected the frontman comedian to carry the load of garbage to quality.The main selling point for me was Kate Hudson and Jason Biggs two underrated pawns in the cruel world of Hollywood. Yet again they are underused as most of the focus is on Dane Cook. Kate Hudson has very few moments to herself that doesn't involve the lead which is a shame because if we give her room she can deliver. Jason Biggs has almost no material to work with as his character is about as predictable and pathetic as can be. It was so bad that Biggs representing kindness and the typical nice guy winds up looking like the unlikable buffoon in all this. Dane Cook is at his best when cruel comedy is attachedany other moment he fails like a blind tennis player competing against Pete Sampras. His antics while working were used up in the previews and he didn't have many moments in the sinister spotlight. While this isn't as low or shady as Good Luck Chuck he still has a long ways to go.There's so much more wrong with this movie. Whether it's the repetitive shots of Boston awful musical selections with the exception of Johnny Cash too many slow moments terrible usage of a potentially good cameo and refusal to end My Best Friend's Girl has too much going against it to ever be deemed a mediocre movie. Within the muddle of patheticness lies potential for some social commentary concerning dating relationships nice guys and jerks but none of this is ever explored because we needed more footage of Dane Cook messing with naked women. Also the workplace scenes of Cook working for an air conditioner company could have resulted in Office Spacelike quality humor but is also underused and quickly forgotten.Bottom Line This movie is a mess when it could have been something grand something different and finally something that Dane Cook can successfully sink his teeth into. Unfortunately none of this happens and we have Cook leading the way towards a brick wall of fail along with Kate Hudson Jason Biggs and even the master Alec Baldwin. Many good ideas are quickly tossed around like a messy tossed salad and only the bad parts remained in the bowl. Highly recommend to skip as this may even disappoint the biggest of Dane Cook fanssince unlike his humor on the mic relies on only one brand vulgarity. He needs a better supporting writing staff or figure out how to be in a film with people that can master improvisation and directing it most notably the Judd Apatow group. Someone stop Cook he's just embarrassing himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie got bad reviews? Whatever. Some truly great films didn't make it more than a couple weeks in the theater Mary Reilly and Matrix come to mind. It's a shame though because there are a LOT of bad comedies and this isn't one of them. In fact it's really really funny with moments of genius and only a few moments of weakness. I went to see it twice in the theater and will buy it as soon as it's out on DVD.I haven't laughed out loud that much at a movie since There's Something About Mary. There were many many great scenes but I'll only mention one. It wasn't a funny one it was inspired and deep and beautiful like the shot of Eric Stoltz on the train tracks at the beginning of Some Kind of Wonderful you earned eternal respect for that film Mr. Deutch. It's the what? 30 seconds? 1 minute? when Tank decides to martyr himself out of love and selfloathing in slow motion to When the Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash. That minute is worth the cost of the ticket by itself so if you add in the 10 or more bellylaughs this movie's a deal! AND it's the best movie I've ever seen about sex addicts and their co's which accounts for nearly every character. Excellent script although too bad about the end  either something got cut out or no one noticed the hole in explaining Alexis's reversal. Looking forward to more from writer Jordan Cahan.I didn't know anything about the film in advance  I saw it for two reasons Howard Deutch and Dane Cook although when I saw this I didn't know Dane Cook did standup I just thought he was great in Mr. Brooks and Dan in Real Life. Now that I've seen his comedy his imagination his well zest cheesy word but the right one I understand why I left My Best Friend's Girl feeling like I'd seen a great film even though I knew intellectually that though it was good it was no When Harry Met Sally. I felt like I'd seen a great film because it was wellwritten and welldirected ... and because Dane Cook has clearly been to a crossroads at midnight and made some kind of deal with the devil. He performs at a genius level. Kate Hudson Jason Biggs Lizzy Caplan great cast! great performances! They looked like rag dolls next to Cook. If this was a horse race Alec Baldwin was the only horse within a hundred yards of Cook's lead. Not that I feel strongly about Dane Cook's talent.Followup on Jan. 13 First time I've ever bought a movie new on the release date. It's that funny. Getting to watch it on DVD I could finally read what Tank's shirt said Sold my soul for rock 'n roll the devil made me do it. Details like that are one of the reasons I love this movie. They carried the angeldevil theme all the way through in just the right amount and in various ways like the sunlight behind Alexis's head. That's good storytelling. This film is structured at a much higher level than most comedies. But oh if only they'd left in that minute between Alexis and Ami at the end! It really matters. Okay so they blew the ending and it COULD have been brilliant. They had the right idea  they just didn't pull it off. Bummer. But nobody's perfect. The music was great. Very important. Though exaggerated for humor it all felt real to me  I know these people. I could relate. Example of great characterization it's Saturday night. Alexis calls her roommate Ami and Ami claims she's at a club. Alexis tells her to put down Guitar Hero and Ami comes out of the living room wearing the guitar with a pack of cigs like a holster in her waistline. Hilarious character.And how can you not savor a film that makes a comedic nod to The Third Man? Tank in doorway below Dusty in window during excellent song choice Separate Ways. Was that intentional or instinctual? I wonder because I see lovely layering and symbolism throughout the film that are sadly undermined by the commentaries  I think the commentators needed some space from the production and the reviews before they spoke about the film. They don't give it the credit it deserves in the parts I listened to. Afterall how many comedies can you analyze at this level? Come on cast crew producers directors etc forget the critics admit at least to yourselves that you made a really good film!".

Now that I've seen his comedy his imagination his well zest cheesy word but the right one I understand why I left My Best Friend's Girl feeling like I'd seen a great film even though I knew intellectually that though it was good it was no When Harry Met Sally. I felt like I'd seen a great film because it was wellwritten and welldirected ... and because Dane Cook has clearly been to a crossroads at midnight and made some kind of deal with the devil. He performs at a genius level. Kate Hudson Jason Biggs Lizzy Caplan great cast! great performances! They looked like rag dolls next to Cook. If this was a horse race Alec Baldwin was the only horse within a hundred yards of Cook's lead. Not that I feel strongly about Dane Cook's talent.Followup on Jan. 13 First time I've ever bought a movie new on the release date. It's that funny. Getting to watch it on DVD I could finally read what Tank's shirt said Sold my soul for rock 'n roll the devil made me do it. Details like that are one of the reasons I love this movie. They carried the angeldevil theme all the way through in just the right amount and in various ways like the sunlight behind Alexis's head. That's good storytelling. This film is structured at a much higher level than most comedies. But oh if only they'd left in that minute between Alexis and Ami at the end! It really matters. Okay so they blew the ending and it COULD have been brilliant. They had the right idea  they just didn't pull it off. Bummer. But nobody's perfect. The music was great. Very important. Though exaggerated for humor it all felt real to me  I know these people. I could relate. Example of great characterization it's Saturday night. Alexis calls her roommate Ami and Ami claims she's at a club. Alexis tells her to put down Guitar Hero and Ami comes out of the living room wearing the guitar with a pack of cigs like a holster in her waistline. Hilarious character.And how can you not savor a film that makes a comedic nod to The Third Man? Tank in doorway below Dusty in window during excellent song choice Separate Ways. Was that intentional or instinctual? I wonder because I see lovely layering and symbolism throughout the film that are sadly undermined by the commentaries  I think the commentators needed some space from the production and the reviews before they spoke about the film. They don't give it the credit it deserves in the parts I listened to. Afterall how many comedies can you analyze at this level? Come on cast crew producers directors etc forget the critics admit at least to yourselves that you made a really good film!";

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 2005 Will Smith starred as Hitch the romance doctor who volunteers his service through close referrals to help luckless and clueless guys woo the woman of their dreams. His consultancy reaps big rewards and audiences lapped it all up with the provision of perhaps some pointers that could be put to good use. Now in My Best Friend's Girl it takes a twist to this Hitch character and Dane Cook becomes the AntiHitch. The objective is slightly different  you should already be hooked up with your lady love but when the relationship seems to come to a cool off or a standstill you engage Tank Cook to be the arsehole who will make your loved one appreciate you a lot more and get back into your arms.He prides himself with achieving results in 10 steps and most of the comedy stemmed from his being a total datedick from hell and if you're to employ his techniques then you're likely to earn a reputation for being the biggest arse out there though sometimes the brashness directness will also be likely be attractive to those who like to hang out with bad boys. So while Tank does what he does best his best friend Dustin Jason Biggs decided to engage his services in order to help get Alexis Kate Hudson toward him by providing some push factors making her realize that nice guys like him don't come too easy. In the spirit of Murphy where things will go wrong the rule of thumb will ensure that the helper will fall in love with hisher mark.It sort of reversed some roles here where the women now subscribe to the philosophy of also sowing their wild oats before they decide to settle down. For Alexis she seemed to be missing out on a lot of fun since she rarely goes out on dates so once convinced it is at Dustin's expense. Which again puts Jason Biggs into a stereotypical role of a loser who doesn't get any stemmed from his popularity that went all the way back to American Pie. Kate Hudson continues her role as the ditzy blonde to perfection and while not exactly a role to showcase her acting chops she does make a fine on screen couple with Dane Cook and this show looked tailor made for him.Dane Cook doesn't get a lot of lead roles but I feel that all that might change real soon given his revelation here. From flicks like Employee of the Month Dan in Real Life to Good Luck Chuck opposite Jessica Alba he seems on track to become a romantic leading man even though it's on the romantic comedy track. He continues his ladies man role and extends it to here and with permission by the filmmakers to adlib and improvise his lines needless to say he steals the spotlight from everyone here and has room to stretch his acting chops as well. Watch out for some truly hilarious moments in scenes from his character's workplace where his career as a customer service teleoperator also from hell just cracked me up.And Alec Baldwin couldn't not be mentioned. Once a leading man of sorts his career on the big screen gets relegated to support roles from Elizabethtown to this role here as Tank's dad Professor Turner who's still an active Casanova made easy when being around young and nubile students though a character that isn't something not done before such as Ben Stiller's dad in The Heartbreak Kid.What worked for My Best Friend's Girl is the tussle between the good guy and the bad guy as they pull no punches in wooing the opposite sex. We don't see much of this tussle personified and go up against each other in the same film very often and here we perhaps get to examine what probably works and what doesn't and that whichever school you subscribe to it's again not about how much you're giving to try and make someone happy but whether you're giving the right thing that the other party needs.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S. Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague. As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest. That's not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease.As was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesn't work.But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city's underworld. The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections. A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms. Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice.Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel. This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies. He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film The Enforcer. Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark Douglas and half the New Orleans Police. Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I'm kind of in Zero's league now in the heft department.Kazan kept the action going at a good clip there's very little down time in this film. If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film. Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year.Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter. Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront. In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest. Very similar again to On the Waterfront.Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it. Now why couldn't Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans sounding people in the small roles.".

	onyx:emotionText "In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S. Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague. As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest. That's not the issue here the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease.As was pointed out by any number of people for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from Louisiana. Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there but for those that are natives it doesn't work.But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city's underworld. The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections. A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms. Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice.Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel. This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies. He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film The Enforcer. Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark Douglas and half the New Orleans Police.

	schema:reviewBody "Panic In The Streets opens in high noir style a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window behind which is playing out a sleazy card game  an opening flourish which along with some of the location shooting anticipates some of the atmosphere Welles brought a decade later in Touch Of Evil. One of the players throws open the window it's an appropriate action serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld.Shot in high contrast black and white Panic In The Streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in New Orleans. Scenes set in such places as the mortuary the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'Frank's Place' offer a unique and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere impossible to recreate in the studio. With these elements Kazan's film shows the influence of Dassin's groundbreaking Naked City of two years earlier which established the gritty almost documentary style within the noir cycle. In fact Widmark's previous role had been in Dassin's even finer Night And The City a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent. Joe MacDonald a favourite with the director photographed Panic In The Streets' detailed environment. MacDonald also worked on Kazan's Pinky and Viva Zapata! and went on to shoot Widmark again three years later in Fuller's masterpiece Pick Up On South Street.As others have noticed in a manner typical of some noir films Kazan's work offers a contrast between the confusion sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest calm home life of the Reeds. But whereas for instance in Lang's The Big Heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character  ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance  Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day'. Despite all the danger ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied. The implication being that social balance has been restored at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills.That imbalance of course has been created by crime and disease. The two are closely associated in this film. It reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder Cobra 1986  where Crime is the disease. Meet the cure a neat analogy in context if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism. At its climax as Blackie attempts to flee aboard ship the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals both posing a menace to society's health. As the presumably infected Blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies in search of something he suspects everyone is after if without knowing exactly what it is 'plague' and 'Blackie' resonate together in the audiences mind adding further to connected associations. Ironically Blackie's hunch about Poldi's unfortunate cousin that he brought something in of note is correct  even if finally its nothing he can sell or steal. Blackie's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it and his so confusion is understandable.Dr Reed although homeloving and on the side of society is a true noir hero. Familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone forced to travel beyond the limits of the law. In his way Reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large  a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite given director Kazan's controversial personal history. The director testified before the infamous HUAC naming suspected communists and fellow travellers. His film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning and the manhandling of the press on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means. These actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time presumably accepting the McCarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry. In these times of terrorist threats and state response such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern.Standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where Blackie interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like Blackie stalks his victim across the room eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands  a striking evil cradling. It's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption whether moral or physical. Apparently the actors did many or all of their own stunts which leads to some other very dramatic scenes at the end as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs. Half crawling half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for Palance but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all.Occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer. Apparently Dr Reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup. Perhaps just as astonishingly he never inoculates himself  inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises. At the end of the film too the potential epidemic has been halted all contactees located a little too neatly. But these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today.".

Unfortunately the stiff got that way by being murdered and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague leading to an epidemic. Enter Police Captain Tom Warren Paul Douglas who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster.While Panic in the Streets is a quality film it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling my reason for bringing the score down to an eight. It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster police procedural thriller and even romance.This is not director Elia Kazan's best work but saying that is a bit disingenuous. Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire 1951 On The Waterfront 1954 and East of Eden 1955 after all. This film predates those but Kazan has said that he was already untethered by the studio. Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl. The film is set in New Orleans a city where Kazan used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well. He wanted to exploit the environment. It's so terrific and colorful. I wanted boats steam engines warehouses jazz jointsall of New Orleans.Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well but they could be connected better. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods. The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt Quarantine and Some Like 'Em Cold.The gangster material which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly Kazan has said that he believes the villains are more colorfulI never had much affection for the good guys anyway. I don't like puritans. A close second is the only material that approaches the panic of the titlethe discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed inoculate them and contain the disease. While there is plenty of suspense during these two moods much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with pacing more typical of that genre.The dialogue throughout is excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character. Conflict isn't created by dumb decisions but smart moves events and characters' actions are more like a chess game. When unusual stances are taken such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions which other characters argue over.In light of this it's interesting that Kazan believed that propriety religion ethics and the middle class are all murdering us. That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm or allowances away from it made by the protagonists. For example head gangster Blackie Jack Palance in his first film role is offered a Get Out of Jail Free card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague.The technical aspects of the film are fine if nothing exceptional but the real reasons to watch are the performances the intriguing scenario and the wellwritten dialogue.".

From Widmark's Public Health doctor with hypodermic needle in hand running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior.It's an imaginative and intelligently written story one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements such as paranoia blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential filmnoir and maybe not even essential Kazan but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly. I can almost see where they are coming from. But I prefer to take a more toneddown approach to a longforgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasidocumentary fashion. Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans and it is up to a military doctor Widmark and a city detective Douglas to apprehend the main carrier Palance. The film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very shortlived post WWII through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. For those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end. It is something else and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it. I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.".

One of the best scenes is a quiet thoughtful conversation between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes.Shot on location in New Orleans the cinematography is excellent Jack Palance makes a great psychopath the pace never flags and the final chase has a wonderfully chaotic feel to it and I love the way Palance skids around on the gravel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not every black and white melodrama from the Fifties needs to be considered a noir film that designation doesn't work for me here. Nor does the title actually because there's really never any panic to speak of except in the feverish race by authorities to find the source of pneumonic plague brought into the country by a stowaway on a cargo ship. For what it is though there are some intermittent thrills as Dr. Clint Reed Richard Widmark and Police Captain Tom Warren Paul Douglas combine forces to methodically pinpoint the the cause of the infection and bring those responsible to light.The one to keep your eyes on here is gangster Blackie 'Walter' Jack Palance in his big screen debut. Almost gangly in comparison to his later film roles Palance brings a hostile malice to his character that seethes in every scene he's in. Which made it almost comical to me why he seemed so determined to pin down subordinate Poldi Guy Thomajan for some undetermined loot that he thought cousin Kochak smuggled into the country it turned out to be perfume!. You knew Blackie could play rough but I never expected to see him throw Poldi over the stairwell with his mother watching  yikes!Richard Widmark's character takes charge right from the start after he's called in from his day off as a naval medical officer. The picture juxtaposes his high pressure job requirements with a serene home life but he always exhibits an intensity throughout even as his wife tries to keep him grounded in family responsibilities. Funny but every time I saw Barbara Bel Geddes I couldn't help thinking of June Cleaver waiting for Wally and the Beaver to come walking through the door any minute.The finale was a pretty realistic nail biter considering how Palance Mostel and Widmark had to maneuver their way around those slick pilings under the warehouse dock. I was expecting one of them to lose their balance and go completely in the drink and had to wonder whether they did that all in one take. I never doubted Palance's athleticism though after watching him maneuver his way up the tow line of the docked ship in port. The film makers really put him through the wringer for his very first picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Panic In The Streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation. As a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high level.Following a dispute between the participants in a card game a man called Kochak Lewis Charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed Richard Widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague. Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action anyone infected could be expected to die within days.As the identity of the dead man is unknown the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing. They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community a group of seamen the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found.Kochak an illegal immigrant had been in a gang with Blackie Jack Palance Raymond Fitch Zero Mostel and Vince Poldi Tommy Cook and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country. As Kochak and Poldi were related Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more. Poldi however is very ill and unable to provide any information. Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man. In an unusual type of role for him he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly. Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation. His distinctive looks also help to make his onscreen presence even more compelling.In typical docunoir style expressionist cinematography and neorealist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place. Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining film Jack Palance is great";
	schema:reviewBody "A very good movie directed by the talented Elia Kazan. There were a few nonprofessional actors and a bit of the script and scenes seem a little corny even amateurish but overall the directing film editing sound camera work and production were great. The overall story itself was also very good maybe just a tiny bit over the top for film noir. But the acting performances by Richard Widmark Jack Palance Paul Douglas Barbara Bel Geddes Tommy Cook Zero Mostel and the other professional actors were all great.Now for the real attraction. I thought Jack Palance was outstanding in this film which was his feature film debut. Although the character he played Blackie was a very bad but smart criminal and he didn't have a lot of scenes Palance's acting performance was fantastic. There are several scenes in this movie that are now on my alltime favorites list because of Palance's presence. I liked Palance in the City Slickers films especially the sequel but I never realized that he was such a talented actor in his early years. This film made me a Jack Palance fan and I began buying early films that he was in.".

There were a few nonprofessional actors and a bit of the script and scenes seem a little corny even amateurish but overall the directing film editing sound camera work and production were great. The overall story itself was also very good maybe just a tiny bit over the top for film noir. But the acting performances by Richard Widmark Jack Palance Paul Douglas Barbara Bel Geddes Tommy Cook Zero Mostel and the other professional actors were all great.Now for the real attraction.

This is also good tense storytelling. Panic in the Streets was made shortly before it's director would testify to the House Unamerican Activities Committee ruining careers and lives. One can take this particular film's politics one of two ways. We are asked to identify with an agent of the state who is trying to get a city to respond to a very real heath crisis with reason and discipline. Is this a leftist tale calling for a strong government safetynet and adherence to scientific reason? Or are we witnessing a prelude to Kazan's On the Waterfront tell the authorities everything you know only this way will you escape the plague?".

	schema:headline " Rat race against a ravaging plague epidemic";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie garnered an Oscar for Edna and Edward Anhalt's writing of the original story for a motion picture. And WHAT a great idea for a story this iseven today. It was shot completely on location in what used to be a truly great and important gulf port city New Orleans Louisiana. This movie ingeniously teams up a crotchety skeptical policeman Paul Douglas with a totally devoted doctor Richard Widmark from the US Public Health Service a regular branch of the service that doesn't get enough attention for ITS service to our country. Here we get to see Widmark as the good guy for a change. He is workaholic family man struggling to make ends meetwho doesn't have enough time for wife Barbara Bel Geddes and his young son.As the movie opens we see a group of gangsters playing cards in some cheap hotel room. Blackie Jack Palance is the boss of the gang Fitch Zero Mosel is his gofor guy and Poldi Guy Thomajan is another gang member. When Poldi's cousin wants to drop out of the card game because he is sick Blackie doesn't want him to leave since he is too far ahead in the game. When he does leave the gang chases him though the city and down to the train tracks where he is shot and left. The police discover his body the next day and have it taken to the Coroner's office for an autopsy.... We first get to know Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed Richard Widmark and his family in the next scene. 'Clint' and his wife Nancy Barbara Bel Geddes have money problems and bill collectors which worry them. But right now Clint is trying to take some time off from work to spend it his young son who he hardly ever sees because of his job...When the coroner's autopsy reveals that the man's body is loaded with pneumonic plaguea disease related to bubonic plague but more serious since it can be so easily contracted from sneezing sputum or simple contactthe Coroner's office calls in Clint to handle the possible effects of a ravaging plague epidemic. Clint immediately calls for help from the NOPD. He needs them to help quickly find and contain the source of the plague before it spreads.Clint is teamed with a cynical Police Captain Tom Warren Paul Douglas who doesn't care much for doctors or Navy men. In fact though Clint's uniform may look like that of a Navy officer the US Public Health Service and the Navy have nothing whatsoever to do with each other. Tom and Clint soon learn to work together as they realize each other's roles in the almost impossible mission of finding where the dead man came from while keeping their search 'under wraps' to prevent any possible panic. Added to the difficulty of finding where the dead man came from is the fact that his body and therefore the dead man's ID was immediately incinerated to prevent contagion. Also they have to work fast since the incubation period is only 48 hours.As Clint and Tom chase down clues they are eventually led to a restaurant in a Greek neighborhood. They find out that the restaurant owner's wife had suddenly died of a high fever. This brings them closer to the plague's source than they had ever been it brings them close to where Poldi in now lying sick in his mother's apartment. Poldi's mother had ordered a nurse who had reported his symptoms to a local hospital and ordered an ambulance.On the other hand when Blackie and Fitch find Poldi they believe that he and his cousin had been into something with a VERY big payoff. After allin their mindswhy else wold the whole police department be looking SO hard to find Poldi and his cousin? Blackie assumes that Poldi's cousin must have been in on a huge drug haul and Poldi must know about it. They try to pump Poldi for information before he dies. But he is too sick to tell them anything. As Blackie and Fitch try to carry Poldi out of his mother's upstairs apartment they meet Clint and Tom on the steps throw Poldi down the steps and are chased by the police.The final running footchase sequence with the police in hot pursuit of Blackie and Fitch is one of the best of it kind in film noir! The footchase takes us to the docks and in the warehouses and back streets of New Orleans. The two gangsters are seen on the levees structures and substructures of the oncefamous gulf port city.The noir shots of Blackie and Fitch Palance and Mosel running across structures popping up and dropping down from one level of a coffee and banana warehouse to another is almost visually poetic. In fact they remind us of rats crawling along beams bridges and other structures occasionally falling in the swampy water only to get up and run some more. The rat analogy reminds us of the plague that ships sometime bring into ports and refocuses us on WHY the two are being chased in the first place to stop and control an possible plague epidemic. After Fitch has been shot dead the final ratplague analogy is brought home as we see Blackie climbing a fruit freighter's line. He falls to his death not by a bullet from the police but by the line's rat catcher.".

Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do some effective TracyHepburnstyle thrustingandparrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable Howard Zieff he did Private Benjamin about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive reentry into the dating game. It all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein Casablanca along with Alan Mandel Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer.Dr. Charley Nichols has just come back from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chiefofstaff Amos Willoughby whom Charley has to pacify to keep his residency. Enter Ann Atkinson a transplanted Englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course Charley is on the show's discussion panel and sparks as they say fly. This leads to the standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become about Ann. At the same time the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby's careless supervision.It's just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpelwielding skill of surgeons. Matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. Away from her heavy awardwinning Elizabethan roles Jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty Ann who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster while Richard Benjamin provides amiable support as Charley's colleague Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.".

Matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit however other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up even though he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from Richard Benjamin Candice Azzara Dick O'Neill and especially Art Carney as the inept and senile Chief of Staff at the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a brief scene with his reallife son Charlie who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years.

That's where the similarities end though. House Calls is just sheer fun watching 2 pros like Matthau and Jackson hit it off and seem completely natural while they're at it. I saw this film in the theater in 1978 at the ripe old age of 18 and it took me another 20 years to get all of the jokes. Any film that can make punch lines out of 1920's tennis great Bill Tilden and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain wouldn't play too well at the megaplex these days. One other thought the original theatrical release featured a 'walk on the beach  fall in love' montage set to The BeatlesGeorge Harrison tune Something. It seemed a bit forced at the time but that song has since been swapped out for a rather generic Henry Mancini music cue for subsequent home video and cable release.

This was Glenda Jackson the English double Oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view.Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life  his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby Art Carney. Carney is apparently senile there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off  see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin's car. Amos is up for reelection Charlie is his closest competitor for the post  if he wants it. However Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of selfesteem.One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital.

He gets her out of the device and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to cater to Amos and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital.Amos' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital Lloyd Gough who owned a baseball team his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers. Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the eulogy at the burial service the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy. However she is still determined to sue her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen. So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau it led to a television series as well.".

	schema:headline " Great little comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "There is not much of a plot to this movie.  There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience. Not much more than that but .... IT DOES NOT MATTER!It does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not cracking up laughing  you have a smile on your face. Matthau plays Charley whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital.  He is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him.  Then he meets Anne Atkinson Glenda Jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed. Charley begins to like Anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life her husband was a cheater and they decide to give it a shot  two weeks of faithfulness. I will not give away anything else but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on screen.  She is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middleaged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable.  She is matched every step of the way by Matthau who is more charming than ever.  He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl he just has to be himself. Art Carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor.  The scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at home plate is priceless.  He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin.  Richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to Carney and Matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy. Very much recommended...810PS.  FYI  Matthau presented Jackson with her first Best Actress Oscar and Jackson presented Best Actor to Art Carney for his role in 'Harry  Tonto'..".

It's a subject that Matthau and Jackson have very diametrically opposed views.Jackson thinks that all doctor ought to be Albert Schweitzer and that just doesn't happen in the real world.No budding Schweitzers at Kensington General. Art Carney is absolutelybrilliant as the over aged Chief of Surgery who is having touches of senility butwon't retire. Funny but a bit frightening as well. I suspect there are more Carneys out there than one would like to admit.Some of the other staff includes as doctors Richard Benjamin Gordon Jumpand Dick O'Neill. Candice Azzara has a juicy role as a widow wanting to sue formalpractice on the death of her husband.

I think that may be due to a very weak screenplay. For a comedy this one is quite lame with little humor other than an occasional smile. The romance is the best part as Charley settles down and gets very comfortable with Ann. One can see and sense that happening in a middleaged couple that hit it off. I think Matthau is supposed to be playing an MD a few years younger than his true 58 years here. Jackson is about on target as a 42year old divorce. The humor in the hospital was soso. A good screenplay could have made much more out of this. Again with the march of time movies about ineptitude and incompetence of hospital staff doctors especially aren't likely to set too well with most audiences of today.".

It is on record as the highest rentals film hire between 1932 and 1939 with 2.6m returned to the distributor. This means it must have sold over 6m in tickets...in the most economically bad time of the decade and at a time when ticket prices were in cents. Imagine today if seventy million Americans went to one film in its first release! We're talking TITANIC level ticket sales. Well THE KID FROM SPAIN did exactly that. The two dance sequences are truly spectacular and very funny...the finale WHAT A PEFECT COMBINATION is about risqu as it gets in reverse rude lyrics given he is singing about I'm the lock and you're the key. Warners Bros clearly handed Busby their studio key after this UA success and booked a box office berth ready to shuffle off to their 42nd Street box office honeymoon.

	schema:reviewBody "THE KID FROM SPAIN Samuel GoldwynUnited Artists 1932 directed by Leo McCarey with choreography by Busby Berkeley stars Eddie Cantor in his third annual musicalcomedy for Samuel Goldwyn. Borrowing the formula from his initial Goldwyn musical WHOOPEE 1930 switching from wild west to Mexico so not to give the impression of a remake Cantor once again plays a nervous wreck who goes berserk this time at the sound of a whistle and carries on the same surname of Williams. Could these two characters in question be twins? Maybe but there's only one Eddie Cantor and for the record this is not a sequel just an original premise with recycled ideas.The story begins in a college where Eddie Williams Eddie Cantor is found hiding under the sheets on the bed in a girls' dormitory by the stern Martha Oliver Theresa Maxwell Conover. Although Eddie assumes the blame it's his Mexican roommate Ricardo Robert Young responsible for the practical joke. Because of this both classmates so close to graduation are expelled. Ricardo returning to his native Mexico invites Eddie to accompany him. On their way to their destination Ricardo stops at the First National Bank where Eddie waits outside. Parked on the very spot where the getaway car was supposed to be Eddie encounters new passengers in the back seat that of the bank robbers who mistake Eddie as their getaway driver. Because Eddie is an eye witness the bank robbers kidnap Eddie and take him to the Mexican borderline. While in Mexico Eddie meets again with Ricardo who by now is having romantic problems with Anita Gomez Ruth Hall whose father Alonzo Noah Beery prefers she marry Pancho John Miljan the greatest bullfighter of all Mexico. Eddie pursued by Crawford Robert Emmett O'Connor an American police inspector masquerades as Don Sebastian II matador from Spain visiting Mexico for the upcoming bullfight. Complications ensue when Eddie not only has to fight the bull in the ring to avoid arrest but to avoid the manchasing Rosalie Lyda Roberti also hot on his trail.The highlight bullfighting sequence is something of an inspiration for future movie comedians of Bob Hope Danny Kaye Red Skelton or even Jerry Lewis had they handled such a routine. However future famed TV comedienne Lucille Ball eventually performed such tactics in an equally funny bullfighting sequence in one of the episodes of The LucyDesi Comedy Hour 1958 costarring Desi Arnaz as her husband Ricky Ricardo a similar name to Robert Young's character in THE KID FROM SPAIN by which he's called both Ricky and Ricardo with special guest star Maurice Chevalier. A similar situation here and to the LUCY program is that both Eddie and Lucy mistake the actual bull for a tamed one for the bullfight. And let's overlook the bullfighting climax featuring Lou Costello the other half of the Abbott and Costello comedy team in Mexican HAYRIDE Universal 1948 with an added bonus with Costello riding the bull bareback.Besides good comedy whether physical or verbal with some gags and oneliners right out of from the vaudeville days there's time out for songs by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby including The College Song with lyrical lines recited by numerous college coeds including a very young Betty Grable In the Moonlight sung by Eddie Cantor Look What You've Done sung by Lyda Roberti and Eddie Cantor Untitled dance number performed by Grace Poggi What a Perfect Combination sung by Eddie Cantor and Goldwyn Girls and What a Perfect Combination reprisefinale sung by Cantor and Roberti.Also in the supporting cast are J. Carroll Naish as Pedro Stanley Fields as Jose Sidney Franklin as himself an American matador who performs a straightlaced bullfighting scene before Cantor takes over and turns it into a burlesque spoof Walter Walker The college dean Paul Porcasi The border guard and Edgar Connor as Blueboy the Negro bull handler. Connor's film credits are few but much well noted for his sizable role as Al Jolson's sidekick in HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM United Artists 1933.THE KID FROM SPAIN has all the ingredients for a successful Cantor comedy although some of his humor and one production number in which he performs in blackface may not impress contemporary audiences. Other than finding Robert Young playing a Mexican sporting mustache and passable spoken accent there's one scene where Cantor tells the love starved Roberti to shut her mouth in a manner that's too real to be funny particularly after watching the sad expression on her face. Film buffs can sit back and try to spot some future film stars amongst the chorus girls including Betty Grable recognizable in the opening number the blonde haired Paulette Goddard in the background as Cantor as he looks directly into the camera while vocalizing In the Moonlight before strolling with the girls and singing directly to them and Toby Wing the Young and Healthy girl from 42nd STREET Warner Brothers 1933 visible in the first two song numbers. One cannot help but notice the girls seen in the college opening to be the same ones in the Nexican sequence this time in Mexican attire sporting shoe polish in their black hair.THE KID FROM SPAIN which formerly aired on commercial television in the 1960s and 1970s was later transported to cable networks in the 1980s as CBN now The Family Channel The Nostalgia Channel Turner Network Television 1991 American Movie Classics 199394 and finally Turner Classic Movies where it premiered September 2 2007.

All of these Goldwyn films have firstrate production values melodic songs and great costars Eddie can play off of. Lyda Roberti who died far too young is adorable and funny as the female costar here. I was somewhat surprised to see a very young Robert Young playing a Latintype here. Every Cantor film has a comic setpiece and the bullfight scene here had me in convulsions of laughter.

But I'm still trying to figure out why in the world Sam Goldwyn borrowed Robert Young from MGM and cast him as a Mexican. Why didn't he use someone like Gilbert Roland?Still it's Cantor's show and it begins with Eddie the schnook getting expelled from college after his pal Young puts him in the girl's dormitory where he's discovered by the Dean of Women. To his credit Young owns up to the prank and gets expelled along with Cantor. The two of them decide to go south of the border but on the way Eddie is forced to drive a gang of bankrobbers across the border.When American cop Robert Emmett O'Connor goes south after the robbers the fast thinking Young introduces Cantor as a great bullfighter fresh over from Spain. Now Cantor's got to go through with it or else.It's pretty thin stuff but it's enjoyable and the climax with Cantor in the Corrida fighting a bull is something else. See how he overcomes the bovine challenge. Some of that business was used by Lou Costello in Mexican Hayride.Cantor and Young pair off with Lyda Roberti and Ruth Hall and Ms. Roberti joins Eddie in singing Look What You've Done. The other song Cantor does is unfortunately in blackface and it's What A Perfect Combination. Both songs were recorded by him and sold reasonably well to Depression audiences. The score was written Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby songwriters best known for their Marx Brothers material.I do say though Robert Young was not a convincing Latino. He was painful to watch and I'm sure he felt more ridiculous than anyone else in the film. It's The Kid From Spain's great weakness.Other than that The Kid From Spain is an enjoyable film and those who want to know about the comedic art of Eddie Cantor can't do better than this film to learn.".

Poor innocent Eddie Cantor kneedeep in trouble as usual escapes from a girl's dormitory he is found hiding in and gets caught up with bank robbers. Running with his friend to cross the border to Mexico Cantor tells the border's cops that he too is Mexican. Cantor outwits the bad guys by pretending to be a bullfighter.

Cantor is always known for his quick thinking and fast talking so some of his best lines are thrown around in this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "1931 and 1932 were lean years for the movie musical and other than a few Jeanette MacDonaldMaurice Chevalier romantic operettas some behind the scenes looks at radio and two Eddie Cantor musicals with some fantastic Busby Berkley choreography the genre was considered box office poison. Berkley would fix that in 1933 by moving over to Warner Brothers and create some of the most magical memorable movie musicals in movie history which leaves the Cantor films forgotten by most everybody but his most ardent fans. If you look at Whoopee! Palmy Days and The Kid From Spain you will see the Busby Berkley magic at work and even visualize his Warner Brothers smash hits in your mind. He wasn't working on perfecting his visual style It already was perfect.Take into consideration Inside a Dormitory the Goldwyn Girl chorus number which opens The Kid From Spain Similar themes were later utilized in 42nd Street Gold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade from the scantily clad chorus girls the overhead shots and like By a Waterfall in Footlight Parade the most delightfully audacious swimming pool you've ever seen on film. Even Esther Williams would drool over this! The Kid From Spain isn't a great film by any means but Cantor's charm and the Berkley touch make it memorable. A totally miscast Robert Young is ridiculously given the role of a Latin lover Cantor's college roommate who invites Eddie to go south with him after they are both expelled for the girl's dormitory occurrence. By mistake Cantor is involved in a bank robbery which leads to a hysterical scene of him trying to get across the border and his encounter with the frazzled guard Paul Porcasi. In Mexico he claims to be the famous matador Don Sebastian II which leads to rivalry with another matador and an encounter with a very determined bull. Meanwhile Young and his girlfriend Ruth Hall another Caucasian cast as a Mexican try to be together in spite of her father's promise of her to another man while Cantor finds himself involved with blonde Mexican Lyda Roberti part Russianpart Polish who is also coveted by a hotblooded native. The silliness of the miscastings is easily overlooked considering the lavishness of the production.Not utilized in the opening dormitory number Cantor gets two songs of his own the best of which is a blackface number where in disguise he entertains a prebullfight crowd with the memorable What a Perfect Combination!. His entrance with two actual black dancers has him being pushed back to sing and all of a sudden Goldwyn girls start popping out of all the tables. I tried to spot Betty Grable and Paulette Goddard among the chorus girls in the two big production numbers but didn't have any luck but considering how young they were at the time both not yet 18 it would be somewhat difficult to recognize them although Lucille Ball the following year in Roman Scandals was very easy to spot. A perfectly entertaining precode musical this survives its now dated concepts simply by being just totally enjoyable if just a tad overlong. They don't make em' like this anymore!".

	schema:reviewBody "I have liked Eddie Cantor films for some time even though now in the twentyfirst century he's practically forgotten. That's because even in the bad ones his character and personality is very likable and sweet. Plus when he is given excellent material his films are tough to be beatparticularly FORTY LITTLE MOTHERS and Hollywood CANTEEN.Cantor was a huge name on stage and was famous for his comedic song and dance numbers. Like Al Jolson Cantor also often performed in blackfacesomething that would definitely shock many people today but which was widely accepted and not criticized in the old days. This film like a few of his others does feature such a minstrel segment so if you can't watch it without suffering a fatal heart attack then this is one to skip. However if you do you may be missing out on a rather entertaining little comedy.Oddly though despite Cantor being a nice comic the parts of the film that made me laugh the most were unintended by the producers. This is because Busby Berkeley designed and directed several huge production numbers that are so overthetop that they are in this day and age funny to watch. The best of these is the opening number. It supposedly is set in a girl's dorm in college but school was never like this!! Seeing all the Goldwyn Girls running about in various states of undress as they performed the most complex and expensive dance number is something you won't soon forget! As for the plot Eddie and his friend Robert Young who plays of all things a Mexican are on their way to Mexico. However on the way Eddie accidentally gets mixed up in a bank robbery and the police think he's part of the gang. So once in Mexico he pretends to be the son of a famous bullfighter to avoid being captured. In the end of course is the obligatory bull fight and Cantor manages to survive AND get the girl.The whole film is full of surprisingly engaging songs from Cantor and as I said above his character is so likable you will probably find yourself having a good timeeven with its various shortcomings including a rather poorly filmed bull fight.".

U.K. general release 14 October 1933. Although the running time in most reference books is quoted at 118 minutes this seems incorrect. The 1998 video copy runs 91 minutes.SYNOPSIS The admirably daffy script has Cantor an innocent fugitive wanted for his part in a bank robbery forced to take refuge in Mexico where the first person he runs across is none other than his old college chum from south of the border Robert Young of all people! Young successfully passes Cantor off to his prospective fatherinlaw Noah Beery who doesn't want Young to marry his daughter anyway as the son of a famous bullfighter. NOTES With a rentals gross of 2.6 million number one at U.S.Canadian ticket windows for 1932. The picture wasn't quite so popular in England or Australia in both countries rating fourth for 1933. In the U.K. Cavalcade was first followed by The Good Companions. I think Tell Me Tonight was third. Negative cost 1400000. Film debut of Jane Wyman. COMMENT Such superlative entertainment it's difficult to review the film without lapsing into endless encomiums. From its very opening shot of young Betty Grable to its delightful fadeout on a CantorRoberti reprise of What a Perfect Combination The Kid from Spain is fun fun fun all the way without so much as a moment's respite. Superbly photographed set and costumed with spectacular dance numbers catchy songs brilliantly acted by a standout cast directed by a master of stylish comic timing... I could go on in this vein for pages. Maybe I'll just jot down in purely random order some of the high spots 1 Cantor's runin with the bull. This comic routine has been used so often over the years since 1932 it would have been no surprise to find that Cantor's material had been stolen many times over. But this isn't the case at all. So spectacular are Cantor's brushes here that no other producer could afford to duplicate them. There's some back projection of course but so tightly edited are some of the shots you have to run the sequence four or five times to work out how many of the wonderfully comic daredevil effects were achieved. We love the word used to stop the bull in his tracks. What a classic! 2 Cantor's runin with Paul Porcasi. This has to be one of the funniest border encounters on record. I thought it even more droll than the four Marx Brothers famous encounter with a whole tribe of customs officials in A Night at the Opera. 3 Cantor's runins with Lyda Roberti that most talented and beautiful comedienne who starred in eleven films before her career was cut short by a fatal heart attack at the age of only 28. 4 Cantor's runout on Miljan and Naish to sing his blackface routine What a Perfect Combination. 5 Cantor's runout on wouldbe bandit assassin Stanley Fields. 6 Cantor singing In the Moonlight and flittering through a characteristic dance with Toby Wing and the Goldwyn Girls. 7 Grace Poggi dancing up a storm the like of which has rarely been equalled in the cinema. Maybe Anita Ekberg's Climb Up the Wall in Zarak runs close. 8 Busby Berkeley throwing girls into spinning choreography. 9 Robert Emmett O'Connor quixotically deadpan as he looks forward to Sunday. 10 Cantor walking this way to the firing squad.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING a blackface musical number is included. If sensitive to such best not to view this film or close your eyes during that portion.Eddie Cantor leads another hilarious musicomedy. For those who couldn't find Betty Grable among the Goldwyn Girls I'm sure the first girl featured was Betty. Looked and sounded just like her! After featuring closeups of most of the girls they change into bathing suits and peel off on by one into a swimming pool and form a rotating wheel with a complex spoke structure as seen from an overhead shot. All of these features are signature Busby Berkeley choreography. The next morning the house mother arrives to wake up the coeds including a reluctant Eddie hiding under his sheet. The mother scolds one of the girls making her repeat I'm a naughty girl. Eddie parrots her when revealed. Seems his Mexican friend Ricardo put him up to this prank. However the Dean doesn't think it's funny and expels them both.Eddie soon finds himself the accidental wheelman for a trio of bank robbers who mistake his car for theirs. They decide to take him to Mexico despite his lack of a passport. He has quite a time of it with the immigration officer. This includes a segment where the officer is trying to talk to him and to his wife on the phone at the same time getting everything mixed up. A private investigator shows up and wants to know Eddie's identity. Friend Ricardo tells him Eddie's the great bullfighter Sebastian II newly arrived from Spain. They arrive at the hacienda of Ricardo's girlfriend Anita. Eddie sings In the Moonlight with various of the Goldwyn Girls lounging around. Anita's father AlonzoNoah Beery says Eddie's father was his best friend until he was killed. Eddie and Ricardo are put in jail for fighting with Pancho and friend Pedro over the girlsAnita and her blond friend Rosalie. Eddie is nearly executed by a firing squad by mistake and later escapes. Eddie returns to the Hacienda and thinks he has rescued Anita in an auto escape. Later he discovers he has Anita's friend Rosalie who wants some romance in the pale moonlight. Eddie is reluctant at first but finally gives her a massive kiss and hug. Eddie then sings Look What You've DoneThe bank investigator says he will be at the bull fight to see if Eddie is really Sabastian II. Ricardo has arranged for Eddie to fight a bull trained to sit down when hears a magic word. But Pedro and Pancho switch bulls giving Eddie the mean killer Diablo. During a break in the action Eddie sings What a Perfect Combination while in blackface. The Goldwyn Girls in Mexican dress dance to this tune. Sometimes an overhead projection is used as the girls form fancy geometric circles.Now for the bull fight It starts out badly as the spectators notice he forgot to put on his pants under his cape. Then the bull sits on him and he bites the bull's tail to restart the action. Diablo chases Eddie inside and outside of the arena. But in the end it's concluded Eddie is the winner. The bank investigator now reveals that Eddie was never a suspect in the robbery. He just wanted to see Eddie fight a bull!The musical numbers were composed by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar who would be honored in the musical Three Little Words starring Fred Astaire and Red Skelton.I strongly suspect that Eddie's films are almost never shown on TV because of the small portion done in blackface except for one film. He was an avid practitioner of blackface failing to anticipate the eventual political incorrectness of the art.At first I couldn't decide if Lyda Robertias Rosalie was a poor actress or if that was simply her style of comedy. Eventually I concluded the latter. In a prior show she had played a sexy dizzy blonde with a passion for chasing men which is what she is here. Her father had been a circus clown and she had performed in circuses since a child.J. Carrol Naish was an Irishman who was usually cast as an ethnic supporting actor villainous or not in more than 200 films. For example he played Sitting Bull in the 1950 musicomedy Annie Get Your Gun as well as in the film Sitting Bull.Several reviewers comment on the strange casting of Robert Young as a Mexican. Well neither his girlfriend  Anita nor Rosalie looked typical Mexican either. I think the casters wanted someone tall with an aristocratic bearing to match Anita's aristocratic status. Goofy Rosalie then seemed an appropriate match for goofy Eddie.This film may be purchased as a DVD in a set of 4 Eddie Cantor films.".

Sometimes an overhead projection is used as the girls form fancy geometric circles.Now for the bull fight It starts out badly as the spectators notice he forgot to put on his pants under his cape. Then the bull sits on him and he bites the bull's tail to restart the action. Diablo chases Eddie inside and outside of the arena. But in the end it's concluded Eddie is the winner. The bank investigator now reveals that Eddie was never a suspect in the robbery. He just wanted to see Eddie fight a bull!The musical numbers were composed by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar who would be honored in the musical Three Little Words starring Fred Astaire and Red Skelton.I strongly suspect that Eddie's films are almost never shown on TV because of the small portion done in blackface except for one film. He was an avid practitioner of blackface failing to anticipate the eventual political incorrectness of the art.At first I couldn't decide if Lyda Robertias Rosalie was a poor actress or if that was simply her style of comedy. Eventually I concluded the latter. In a prior show she had played a sexy dizzy blonde with a passion for chasing men which is what she is here. Her father had been a circus clown and she had performed in circuses since a child.J. Carrol Naish was an Irishman who was usually cast as an ethnic supporting actor villainous or not in more than 200 films. For example he played Sitting Bull in the 1950 musicomedy Annie Get Your Gun as well as in the film Sitting Bull.Several reviewers comment on the strange casting of Robert Young as a Mexican. Well neither his girlfriend  Anita nor Rosalie looked typical Mexican either. I think the casters wanted someone tall with an aristocratic bearing to match Anita's aristocratic status. Goofy Rosalie then seemed an appropriate match for goofy Eddie.This film may be purchased as a DVD in a set of 4 Eddie Cantor films.";

Eddie Cantor and Robert Young toot down to Mexico and get into trouble after getting bounced from college. Supporting cast of Noah Beery a 16 year old Betty Grable Paulette Goddard and a 15 year old Jane Wyman in the chorus if we can believe the dates on IMDb. Feels like a collection of vaudeville acts stapled together....Cantor sings a couple songs. Noah Beery's Mexican accent comes and goes. Leo McCarey had been directing films for 10 years by this time most of them silents. The acting in this one is a little over the top kind of like a Three's Company episode. It's okay.".

An iron disciplinestudents in uniformthe necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of oppressors and their punching bag.Two students choose one of their mates as a victim to make up for their frustrated sexualitybecause of a latent homosexuality?Ascene in which they're looking at erotic photographs is tellingAnd not the first to come!Someone different.Only difference can lead to inferiority.

Torless a horny teenager in an all boys school eventually has a torrid sexual affair with one of the students. The movie chooses to ignore this and maybe for good reason as it was released in I believe in 1966. Filmed in black and white the lack of color contributes to the atmosphere of German austerity that director uses to his advantage. The final speech by Torless is a brilliant defense for the lack of opposition by the middle class to the rise of Hitler. Most of the teenagers in the movie were not aspiring actors but were chosen almost at random for their roles. But considering the time in which it was produced this is a land mark film especially for German cinema. The movie is much more entertaining than the book and the directorVolker Schlondorff did a fabulous job and deserves the awards it was given.".

'Trless' is often interpreted as an indicator of upcoming intolerance and Nazidom. Again the novel was released at a much too early time to allow for such an interpretation the novel's author Robert Musil certainly envisioned the inevitable fall of an empire stuck to tradition and incapable of accommodating personal liberties. Schlndorff pushes some of the juvenile delinquents into similarities with the Nazis  albeit being carefully ambiguous about it  but it would be wrong to consider this interpretation as a part of the original narrative.3. 'Trless' is a highly psychological tale and film  again Schlndorff proves faithful to the novel in this respect. But this comes with the weakness of constructing characters around a certain social concept. It would be misleading to consider Trless and his rebellious friends as typical representatives of their era or real figures upon which the author based his characters. As may be more obvious in Musil's masterpiece 'The Man without Qualities' his characters are crafted to evoke rather a situation than a person that makes his books almost impossible to adapt correctly.Schlndorff's film is somewhat middlebrow it does not intend to be a substitute for reading the novel but at the same time it carefully avoids to give the impression that it is anything but a rendition of it. That's not quite true the interpretation is in the framing the omissions of the subtext and that the ideas upon watching the film differ considerably from those you get when you read the novel.

The film is lecturing without any subtleties Schlndorf never provokes the viewer to think for himself he has already done it for him. Nor is there any nuance in the psychology of the different characters.And what about the cast? In 1966 and still praised for their effort as inexperienced actors. Well I think that most of the acting is downright poor or never goes further than reciting lines. In the meantime we have come to know Mathieu Carriere better during his career Carriere is in this his first film as boring as he still is. Of course the actors were not helped much by the literary dialogue another feature that was and is praised so much most of it I find simply laughable.

When I finally decided to give it a go I read the back of the DVD box and thought this looks dry and pedantic. My initial estimate was supported. Toerless is about dreary people who make dreary choices. Three students make it their job to judge a fourth whom they find to be a thief. The intellectualizing and discussions among the three are just rationalization for bullying. And the movie is really not much more ponderous or enlightening than this. None of the characters is one I'd have any respect for Toerless included they are all creatures of the author and director who wish to teach us something. Even a professor who at first is interested in Toerless' fascination with imaginary numbers is made to be whimpy and unsympathetic. Toerless is a humorless film that forces us to view this world through a lens of a single issue. I'd say it was tedious rather than edifying.".

My initial estimate was supported. Toerless is about dreary people who make dreary choices. Three students make it their job to judge a fourth whom they find to be a thief. The intellectualizing and discussions among the three are just rationalization for bullying. And the movie is really not much more ponderous or enlightening than this. None of the characters is one I'd have any respect for Toerless included they are all creatures of the author and director who wish to teach us something. Even a professor who at first is interested in Toerless' fascination with imaginary numbers is made to be whimpy and unsympathetic. Toerless is a humorless film that forces us to view this world through a lens of a single issue. I'd say it was tedious rather than edifying.";

	schema:reviewBody "Der junge Trless is a German blackandwhite film from 1966 so this one has its 50th anniversary this year. The writer i.e. the one who adapted the base material and director here is Volker Schlndorff still in his 20s at this point and it was the big breakthrough for him as this movie here won Best Picture at the German Film Awards. Schlndorff managed to build a prolific and successful Oscar winner Tin Drum career in the film industry on his success here. For lead actor Mathieu Carrire it was also the big breakthrough but while he also has been in films for the last 50 years he didn't make it big really so that this film here is still his most known role I guess.The film is about life at a boysonly school. We see how one student steals something from another but instead of reporting him the boys decide to make him their slave threaten to report him if he doesn't do exactly what the tell him to and there is certainly considerable sexual tone in here too. Carrire however plays a student who is more like a quiet observer. he does not really take part in the bullying like the others do but he also will not help the boy that so desperately needs somebody to stand up for him. He knew very well that this would make him the next target. Then again his passiveness does so too to some extent even if it is all not in the open.I had a couple problem with the action in this film. For example near the end at the gym it was hard for me to believe that everybody else would suddenly join in and they would act like a mob shouting to kill Basini and if we are honest not a whole lot was missing. Or that the teachers of the school really turn Basini into the scapegoat for everything that happened. Yes he did steal some money not much though but that goes beyond all logical behavior. Then again maybe Musil the author of the novel is more to blame for this unless it makes more sense in the book and Schlndorff's adaptation was just flawed. The ending of the film makes clear that the title character is also the main character as the film basically ends when he decides to leave school. Who knows what equally gruesome events will happen there in the future. Maybe we are lucky not to find out. All in all I personally felt the movie was just intended to be as controversial and shocking as possible without telling us a genuinely realistic and interesting story. That's why I believe it is not among the best Germany has to offer in terms of 1960s' movies. I do not recommend the watch and the Academy got it right in not nominating this one.".

The direction of Andrzei Wajda is perfect as usual. The change of period along the development of the story is very interesting since many scenes happen at the same location and we just note the changing of time because of the costumes. The romance is beautiful and shows common German people from a small town oppressed by the economical situation of a country in war repressed by their own laws and behavior of their society with feelings of love envy greed friendship trying to live and survive in a hard period of their history.

	schema:headline " Brilliant and desperately shocking love tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This may perhaps be the greatest cinematic triumph of the celebrated career of director Andrzej Wajda. It was shot in German with a few sections in Polish and its original title is EINE LIEBE IN DEUTSCHLAND from a novel of the same title by Rolf Hochhuth. But the film appears never to have been released on DVD and is only to be found on rare video tapes dating from 1984 of which I have one. Although IMDb records the film as being 2 hours 12 minutes long the video I have is only 107 minutes so that 25 minutes has been cut from it. The film's story alternates back and forth between 1943 and 1983 not always smoothly suggesting that scenes are missing which would have made the transitions of time smoother and less abrupt. I wonder if we shall ever see the director's cut of this unnerving masterpiece. I see from German Amazon that the old German video is for sale at a substantial price but the duration of that version is 102 minutes hence 5 minutes less than the one with English subtitles. The film's most astonishing aspect is the staggeringly brilliant performance by Hanna Schygulla as the female lead. Suitably for this PolishGerman amalgam Schygulla herself is a PolishGerman amalgam as she was born in 1943 the same year in which this film's earlier story is set in what was then Germany but is now Poland. To say that the performance by Schygulla takes one's breath away and leaves one in a state of shock is an understatement. This is one of the greatest feats of screen acting of the 1980s anywhere in the world. All of the performances are excellent and Wajda's invisible hand guides all before it without any 'style' or mannerisms or intrusions of the director's presence. We really do truly believe that we are watching real events take place before us so riveting is it all but also so intimate and upsetting. A cowriter of the screenplay was Agnieszka Holland later herself so famous as a director her greatest film was WASHINGTON SQUARE 1997 see my review. The film begins with a man in his forties travelling by train with his son to revisit a small town where he says he has formerly lived much earlier in his life. Throughout the story we do not know who he really is though he goes around questioning people and trying to find individuals one of whom is on the verge of death in a hospital. He goes for instance into a shop and asks what has happened to the woman who used to run it. We get continual flashbacks to 1943 and see a powerful and tragic love story unfolding between a married German woman whose husband is away in the army and a young Polish prisoner of war who has been sent to work in the town as 'slave labour'. I don't think I have ever seen a woman convey passion so intensely on screen as Schygulla does in portraying her mad love for the boy played by Piotr Lysak who left the film industry in 1988 and never appeared in anything after that. Their love scenes are just about as emotionally convincing as it is possible to get in a film. He is excellent. And the scariest portrayal in the film is not of one of the many Nazis but of Maria Wyler by the French actress MarieChristine Barrault niece of JeanLouis Barrault and widow of Roger Vadim. Rarely has a jealous grasping ruthless woman been interpreted with such total horror and viciousness as we see here. All of these performances are of the most extreme subtlety bordering on the miraculous. But the true horror of the film is the raw depiction of what the German population was like in 1943 with Nazi fanaticism in torrential flow throughout the whole of daily life. Ordinary people say Heil Hitler! to each other in shops and on the street as routinely as Catholics say the Rosary. If you don't reply in kind you are denounced. The vicious contempt and hatred for the Poles shown by all the Germans except Schygulla is mindboggling. And the things even the nicest people say about how important it is to be members of the Master Race makes clear that the entire German people at that time seem to have been infected with the most virulent mental virus imaginable and have been effectively reduced to the status of mad dogs. It is against the law for a German woman to have intimate relations with a Pole and the sentence for that is death. The reason for this is that the Poles are vermin and 'Untermenschen' and contact with them is an insult to the Master Race and a form of deadly contagion. Sweet thoughtful and kind people say these things readily without even thinking and clearly without the slightest comprehension that they are all mad. There may never have been so devastating a depiction of German intolerance and insanity during the Nazi period as in this film. No wonder it is not available on DVD the European Union must have issued a fatwah against it and said anyone possessing a copy must be terminated with extreme prejudice. There is perhaps no single film more calculated to show the reasons for the deep hatred of the Germans by the Poles which we see played out in today's politics by the way. The devastating emotional impact of this incredible film means that it is one of the most shocking films ever made. And by that I do not mean that it shows blood and gore battles ghosts spaceships sci fi monsters or any of the usual things which are meant to shock. What this shows is what takes place between people and what is done to people by other people. And what can be more horrifying and ultimately unsettling than that?".

	onyx:emotionText "This may perhaps be the greatest cinematic triumph of the celebrated career of director Andrzej Wajda. It was shot in German with a few sections in Polish and its original title is EINE LIEBE IN DEUTSCHLAND from a novel of the same title by Rolf Hochhuth. But the film appears never to have been released on DVD and is only to be found on rare video tapes dating from 1984 of which I have one. Although IMDb records the film as being 2 hours 12 minutes long the video I have is only 107 minutes so that 25 minutes has been cut from it. The film's story alternates back and forth between 1943 and 1983 not always smoothly suggesting that scenes are missing which would have made the transitions of time smoother and less abrupt. I wonder if we shall ever see the director's cut of this unnerving masterpiece. I see from German Amazon that the old German video is for sale at a substantial price but the duration of that version is 102 minutes hence 5 minutes less than the one with English subtitles. The film's most astonishing aspect is the staggeringly brilliant performance by Hanna Schygulla as the female lead. Suitably for this PolishGerman amalgam Schygulla herself is a PolishGerman amalgam as she was born in 1943 the same year in which this film's earlier story is set in what was then Germany but is now Poland. To say that the performance by Schygulla takes one's breath away and leaves one in a state of shock is an understatement. This is one of the greatest feats of screen acting of the 1980s anywhere in the world.

	schema:reviewBody "Eine Liebe in Deutschland or A Love in Germany is a French  West German coproduction from 1983 so this one will have its 35th anniversary next year. The film is mostly in the German language but because of one main character being a young Pole and also because of the origins of iconic Polish filmmakers Wajda and Holland there are also parts in the Polish language. Here on IMDb it says that the film runs way over two hours but all the versions I found including the one I watched ended before the 100minute mark so it's either a misinformation or there are several versions out there and some received heavy cutting. Anyway this is the story of a woman running a business in Germany during the days of World War II and her life is changed a lot by the times she lived in. Her man is fighting for his country and a young Polish war prisoner makes an impact on her that may change everything. But it is also about the people around her as we get an insight into how Nazi officers and townsfolk deal with the complicated situation. And the former also refers to an actorcharacter almost saving the film from its permanent mediocrity. Armin MuellerStahl was really by far the film's MVP. Sadly lead actress Hanna Schygully shortly after her mentor Fassbinder's death was extremely forgettable which was surprising as basically the entire film circled around her character. Young Polish actor Piotr Lysak also didn't have too much to work with in both quantity and quality. If you take a look at the cast list you will find more familiar names. Two would be Otto Sander and a very young Ben Becker in his first movie performance and they are also playing father and son here and they have their very own storyline exploring the past decades after WWII. So their story is basically the framework for Schygulla's story. Overall the bleakness wasn't the problem here the film had an atmospheric take to it that felt accurate for the time when it was set. However in my opinion the filmmakers never really managed to get audiences to care for Schygulla's and the other core characters sadly which may have had to do with the performances too that were more miss than hit most of the time. Anyway Wajda and Holland have done better on several occasions. This one here I have to give a thumbsdown and I am actually glad it wasn't running for over 2 hours. Not recommended.".

The war is portrayed as completely inhumane and unheroic waste of life the photographs and scenes depicting unspeakable mistreatment of civilians stay in the viewer's mind for a long time.

It is before Israel invaded Lebanon to get rid of PLO Terrorists. It shows the situation after Lebanese Civil War that started 1975. Beirut is divided into many Rival Quarters. The Palestinians Controlling part of Beirut. A Hellish situation where everybody is Against everybody. Similar to Yugoslavia some years later. Another Book I recommend is Thomas Friedman's From Beirut to Jerusalem which describes Beirut a few years later. This movie I only saw once in 1982 and is unforgettable. I also recommend other films by this Director. The Tin Drum and Others.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Flschung is a West German movie from 1981 so this one had its 35th anniversary last year. This was made by director Volker Schlndorff briefly after his Die Blechtrommel won an Oscar. He is also one of the people who adapted the Nicolas Born novel for the screen here and he got help by illustrious names like Margarethe von Trotta and JeanClaude Carrire. The cast of this film that runs for slightly under 110 minutes isn't too shabby either. Bruno Ganz plays the male lead Hanna Schygulla the female lead and they both were nominated for a German Film Award for their performances. Jerzy Skolimowski actually a successful filmmaker himself won a German Film Award even for his supporting performance and there are more known names in here especially Gila von Weitershausen. This is the story of a journalist who divides to travel to Beirut Lebanon in order to report right at the center of it all about the conflict between the Christians and Palestinians a conflict that is still oh so present today several decades later.Unfortunately the film never really to make an impact on me neither in terms of the war footage nor in terms of the relationship struggles with several women of the protagonist. In the end it was somewhat nicely done the way they showed how this aforementioned almost drove him to insanity but it's just not worth sitting through everything before that. I like Bruno Ganz quite a bit which is why I was a bit disappointed here how not even he managed to make this worth watching for me. Schygulla however I have never been big on and this isn't changing through this film either. She always comes off as fairly tryhard to me and lacks in subtlety in a way the character really would have needed. Then again I have never been a big Schlndorff fan also not of Tin Drum which I mentioned earlier so I am not surprised actually this one appealed to me so little. There is something to his style that I maybe just can't appreciate. I like factbased films that are bleak by other filmmakers but Schlndorff just does very very little for me. But maybe it is also von Trotta's impact as I find her even worse judging some of the stuff I have seen. I have to give this one a thumbsdown and it's quite a shame it did not work out better as the subject sure is an interesting one. Watch something else instead.".

The movie never takes sides in the war instead focusing on the journalist's realization that it's hard to be neutral in a situation where all sides are shooting at each other.

And that's probably why Deconstructing Harry is underrated by filmAllen fans. Still it ranks among the Top 5 Allen films. Woody plays a Philip Rothlike fiction writer who is lecherous unlikable and disloyal in dropping his cute loser shtick the performance rings with more honesty than he's had in years. In a nod to Bergman's Wild Strawberries Allen's character has a chance to reflect on his life as he travels to a university for an honor. Memories mix with scenes this writer's fiction providing opportunities for the large and excellent ensemble cast. Many of Allen's later films seem tired but the neurotic jumpiness he brings to Deconstructing Harry reinjects energy into his work. If you loved Husbands and Wives try this. I rate it 9.".

	schema:headline " One of his better movies where you can see the possibilities of true cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure some people wouldn't agree with me but this movie is a great piece of art on film. Like Hitchcock Coppola and others Woody Allen is a real cinema artist. He makes great use of the possibilities of cinema without losing himself in expensive special effects.Of course cinema is a medium to create a nearperfect realism on a fictional story. But it can also be an artistic medium. Playing with the possibilities. An example in this film is Robin Williams. A men who is 'out of focus'. The story is like most films not very original. A character that struggles with his personality and social life. But unlike most movies you can see an artist made this film. It's a Woody Allen creation. His own style his own characters his own humor. Not a collection of an expensive scriptwriter with an expensive director an expensive special effects team  an expensive director of photography etc. to make a total nonpersonal creation for the big public. Of course the whole crew did a perfect job but it is surely a Woody Allen film!A great movie with a nice plot. Some nice switching in timeline and fiction  reality for the story that is makes it more interesting then the story really is. Also the jumpcuts the camera movement the cast and the humor are making this film a must see! Even if you are not a Woody Allen fan you will like this movie. If you are a fan of big blockbuster movies standard Hollywood confention movies this movie is a must see as well! Not only to see the real art of cinema something different then perfect special effects but also just for a nice evening and some good humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deconstructing Harry is Woody Allen's masterpiece. The editing is unlike anything else Allen has done full of little cuts which give the movie a level of abstraction that raises you above the narrative thread. It was instantly my favorite Allen film and has remained so ever since. Praised when it came out for its unflinching honesty it eschews the selfglorifying cuteness of his other quasiautobiographical movies such as Stardust Memories and Annie Hall and even Manhattan.The main conceit of this movie is that Allen's character writer Harry Block get it? meets his alter egos and other characters from his writing as though in real life. Block's characters have been modeled with almost no attempt to disguise them on his relatives and exrelationships which infuriates and sometimes devastates them. You have to follow very carefully to distinguish the real life relatives from the alter egos who spring to life from the pages of his books.Block has many very seamy weaknesses and peccadilloes which he readily admits and indulges without remorse. His real life relatives and exes submit him to scathing criticism and resentment while their fictional counterparts contribute a more dispassionate and omniscient commentary on Block's misdeeds and poor judgment. The cast is among Allen's most starstudded and uniformly brilliant. It's always fun to watch actors appearing in their only Allen film and there are many here. My favorite is Billy Crystal who plays a friend of Block's who stole his loverand also appears as the devil giving Block the cook's tour of the tenth circle of Hell.To maintain this complexity of voices requires brilliant writing and Allen does not disappoint. My favorite quote isDoris Your whole life it's nihilism it's cynicism it's sarcasm and orgasm. Block You know in France I could run on that slogan and win.If I were one for condescendingly dogmatic assertions and I'm not but if I were I would tell you that if you do not love this movie you are watching Woody Allen movies for the wrong reasons.For the record rounding out my top five Allen movies are Mighty Aphrodite Bullets Over Broadway Small Time Crooks and Stardust Memories with honorable mention to Shadows and Fog.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame that so much negative criticism focuses on Deconstructing Harry's bad language because this is one of Allen's funniest smartest and most perceptive films. In fact it may actually be his best film full stop  only Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanours can challenge Harry. But although the bad language and crudity may affect some people's enjoyment of the film for me as someone who loves bad taste it's a major benefit especially as it's a side of Allen we rarely see. I mean we're used to the romantic Allen and the neurotic Allen and we've even had serious Allen but here you have Allen almost becoming Philip Roth. It's very enjoyable to watch.In this film Allen's alter ego is Harry Block a writer in the mould of Philip Roth who in the words of one his exes turns everyone else's suffering into literary gold. And this assertion is corroborated by the opening scene a section from one his books where a man and a woman who are having an affair during a barbecue decide to have sex in a bathroom while their spouses are eating in the garden. It's a very funny scene especially as an attempted blowjob is interrupted by a false alarm the woman grinds her teeth when the man spots his wife and as some doggystyle sex is interrupted by the woman's blind grandmother coming into the room when asked what's happening the woman tells her grandmother that she's making Martinis while they continue banging away. But while the scene is absolutely hilarious it does also have a point. This is a scene from Harry's life. He's using it in his work. Therefore his ex isn't too happy to find this episode in his book. Of course Harry tries to explain that it was 'loosely based' the grandmother was an embellishment but that doesn't cut much ice with his ex who's having all of the sordid details of her affair revealed to friends and family. So the film touches on ideas of a writer's responsibility. What's exploitation and what's inspiration?One of the most revealing sections of the film is when Harry talks to his therapist. He discusses his attitude to women. I'm always thinking of f every woman I meet I see a woman on a bus. I think what she looks like naked. Is it possible I might f her? Essentially Harry is a man who has never grown up. He can't commit and he can't sustain a relationship with a woman a fact backed up by his string of exes and his affection for prostitutes. Indeed for him whores are perfect. You don't have to woo them they don't nag you and they do whatever you want all you've got to do is pay them. And in the film Harry takes Cookie a black prostitute Do you know what a black hole is? Harry asks her. Yeah that's how I make my living. with him to an honouring ceremony at his old school.Harry also takes a friend along with him and his young son  well he actually 'kidnaps' his son. And the whole journey the whole act of going back to remember the past brings back memories of stories he wrote stories that are thinly veiled versions of actual events. One of the funniest is a story of a man who married his therapist. At first everything is great the woman understands the man like no other woman in the world. But once they have a child she becomes Jewish with a vengeance. No longer is she smart and funny and sexy all of a sudden she's a dowdy nag who's rediscovered her religion. And in one hilarious moment she even prays before administering a blowjob. Again it's highly amusing but again it has a point Harry wants everything to remain perfect. He can't understand why people have to change. I mean even having a child doesn't change him. He talks to his son about naming his penis. He may be getting on but he's still really just a kid.Harry's whole life philosophy is neatly summed up by his halfsister You have no values. With you it's all nihilism cynicism sarcasm and orgasm. To which Harry quips Hey in France I could run for office with that slogan and win! But although Harry may be deemed to be juvenile he's entirely correct about religion. He tells his devout sister that they're clubs and that their function is to exclude people. And then he asks her whether it bothers her more when a Jew gets killed or a gentile. She says a Jew death bothers her more  They're my people. They're all our people he replies. I'm with Harry. Religions are nothing but divisive. Plus they encourage people to prove how devout they are  as if you can be more Jewish than someone else or more Catholic etc. It all becomes a competition.But amongst all this the only thing that Harry can do to remain sane is to write. Somehow life doesn't make any sense but fiction does. I guess it's a problem most writers have. To able to write you have to observe but the more you observe the less you understand why people behave the way they do. Plus the more you observe the more you actually remove yourself from life. However selfexamination does allow Harry to become more perceptive as regards himself. In fact his characters help him out a lot as they offer insights that he couldn't possibly come up with alone. So although the film's coarse it ends up being quite optimistic. Salvation lies within.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry is a great movie. It is a Classic. The script is inspired and the Camera is assured. The performances and Direction are faultless. If we are all intelligent people then the swearing should count for nought.There is nothing to compare to a Woody Allen film. He is unique and should be regarded as one of America's great living film Directors but he is not. I find it incredible yet unsurprising that right now he is having to make films in Europe because the American Studio's won't produce him. It is not that his films are expensive long drawn out superproductions like those of the late David Lean or Ridley Scott. His productions are tight small affairs with a minimal crew and a cast that usually work for a lot less than their normal fee. I honestly feel that the American film going public is sourly losing out. Because of Allen's prodigious output the Dollar obsessed studios have tapped at their calculators and realised that his films do not make enough money. Art they might be but who wants art? The American general public just don't go and see his films. In England Allen's last Movie Scoop was not even given Cinematic release! That is because all the English language distribution companies are American. What we watch in Europe is dictated by the American Studios and that accounts for the poor quality and lack of diversity that is offered in our charmless multiplex factories.It seems that American Movies are becoming less and less intelligent. They even seem to peddle a political agenda. Live Free or Die Hard for example. The title says it all. Films with unrelenting action minimal script pounding percussive scores and appalling Camera work such as The Bourne Ultimatum are what the public want. The Bourne Ultimatum is currently at 81 according to the Internet Movie Data Base Top 250 films. The Jewish lobby in America has never really liked Allen's films and it is easy to see why. He is the only American Director that seriously questions faith and the purpose of religion in his films. What is worse is that his jibes are funny.I don't see what is wrong with films that allow the audience to think freely. They can still be exciting and violent as Films by Takashi Miike or Zhang Yimou have proved. Woody Allen's Films always leave you with something to ponder. His films might not all be Classics but he has made his fair share of those and that is the mark of a great Director.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! Who would have thought Woody Allen would have ever produced this kind of movie? Extending the returning winning streak of great films he began with in 1993 after spending the late 80's and early 90's mired in morose drama Deconstructing Harry is both a swipe at his detractors as well as himself. This is NOT your average Woody Allen film. It is profane obscene and vulgar in its content and dialogue. As the main character Woody is unlikable selfish and morally bankrupt. However it boasts an allstar cast put to great use. There is a unique editing and narrative method employed great oneliners and it is executed with Woody's usual comfortable confidence. Overall it is an absolutely hilarious journey.Woody portrays Harry Block an alcoholic pillpopping whorefrequenting writer whose thinlyveiled books that account the lives of his family  friends provide for successful stories but leave him at great odds with nearly everybody in his life. Harry soon learns that the college that once expelled him for giving the Dean's wife an enema it seems is now honoring him for his literary contributions to the world. Harry brings along a sympathetic hooker an ailing friend and his son whom he has halfheartedly kidnapped from school. Upon driving to the university Harry begins to evaluate his life. Communicated in flashback Harry reflects on the numerous relationships he's wrecked with his gluttonous ways and how he shamelessly incorporated those experiences into his novels at the expense of others the film showcases how these events happened in his own life or how they appeared in the book  with different actors playing the fictional equivalents of his friends  relatives. It is a fantastic device and Allen utilizes it to frenetic effect.Only the truest of Woody Allen fans will recognize this as one of his best films. Supposed fanatics clamoring for the sophisticated insights of Manhattan and Hannah  Her Sisters may be disappointed here. This is Woody Allen in a raw unpolished form which may account for the jerky quickcut editing. This is a battleweary Woody emerging from the wreck that was his personal life in the early 1990's to give a big middle finger to his interrogators. The stellar cast does wonders especially Woody regulars Caroline Aaron and the alwayshysterical Judy Davis. Billy Crystal serves up his usual dry humor in a dual role as Harry's best friend as well as his fictional vision of the devil You ever fked a blind girl? Ah they're so grateful. Allen does a great job of examining a man who is a failure at life but a success in his art. We'll never truly know how much of this is autobiographical but it is a rare fierce achievement for Woody Allen. Proceed with caution!".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen neve ceases to amaze me. I have seen pretty much all of his films now and I must say that not one of them has disappointed me Deconstructing Harry is no exception. In fact this just may be his best since The Purple Rose of Cairo a film that is thematically quite similar. Both films work with the theme of illusion vs. reality. There is the recurring amusement park with the ferris wheel.Anyway despite the obvious Woody Allen elements Deconstructing Harry marks a bit of a departure from his usual style. This film is much more vulgar and bleak than many of his earlier achievements. However this is not to say that it is not a funny film. Quite to the contrary this film is hilarious but I think you have to have the Woody Allen sense of humor to appreciate it.Deconstructing Harry is about a writer Harry Block who feels alienated and isolated in the real world. The only place that he can function is in the world of fiction where he would prefer to spend most of his time. His real world is a mess. He has been to six psychiatrists he's been married three times he has an addiction to prostitutes he's a pill popper and an alcoholic. In fact Harry represents the way a great number of creative artists and achievers feel in the real world. They are so consumed by their creativity that the only way they know how to function is in their world of fiction or art.At the end of the film Harry realizes that he is a character who can't function in life but only in art. This is so true and we realize it throughout the entire film. This is emphasized by the chaotic nature of his real life experiences that I will not give away. One of the greatest aspects of the film is the editing style. Allen adopts the use of a recurring jump cut in all of the reality scenes to illustrate Harry's confusion and inability to cope with life. In a scene where he is speaking with a therapist jump cuts are used to show his interrupted thought processes. Even when his life is going fairly normal which isn't too often a jump cut is inserted to constantly remind us of his distorted alienated life a life where illusion seems to be his reality or at least his preferred reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Block is a writer who tends to thinly veil his won life in his art. His tendency to mock his friends and family through similar characters in his work has left him with three exwives and a huge number of people who hate him.  He lives a lonely life and has a penchant for pills and whore prostitution being pure and totally free of BS.  When his college plans to honour him he finds he has noone who wants to go with him so he kidnaps' his son a black whore and an old friend with him.  As the characters from his work come and go around him he finds that he struggles to make amends with those around him and decides than he can only be happy in his work.This is a fantastic Woody Allen film and his only film to be rated 18 in the UK.  The story seems to be a very clear very personal attack on himself.  It's like Allen is using a fictional story going to be honoured by his college to lay himself bare.  Certainly Block's habit for using his own life in his work seems to echo accusations towards Allen in real life. At times this makes the film really hard to watch some scenes are so full of apparent selfloathing and bile that it's hard to laugh.  Happily the film is hilarious all the way through  this is not one of Allen's arty serious films.  It should be said that Allen denies that this is as personal as it appears but it is easy to see why it is seen as a personal attack on himself.The film's main story is littered with scenes from Block's work that demonstrate how he has used his characters to mock others and to portray himself  Robin Williams is the best as the artist that literally lacks focus and Crystal is hellishly good.  The story's moral about art and life is not as clear or as clever as it thinks it is but it's very very funny and the level of bile Allen appears to be spitting at himself is very interesting to observe.Allen is great in the central role but you do occasionally feel like you should look away at times because he appears to be giving himself a real kicking.  The rest of the cast is really good and is full of famous faces ranging from big stars Moore Crystal Alley Williams to familiar faces Maguire Bogosian LouisDreyfus Shue Tucci.  As a director Allen does some new tricks to make this feel even more different from his other films but the jump cuts etc are a little tiresome.  The most important character to me is Cookie.  She is significant because Allen has not really ever created a good black character even if she is a prostitute.Overall this is a really funny film.  The degree of vitriol that Allen appears to aim towards himself makes this a little less enjoyable but overall it is a great film.".

This is in essence STARDUST MEMORIES redux and since that is by far my least favorite Allen film I was hesitant towards this film.  In addition to the whiny tone of that film Oh I'm so successful I have women throwing themselves at me my life is so empty! we get the selfflagellation of this film not only is my life so empty I'm such a bastard!.  What makes it watchable are three things firstly Allen at least seems to recognize the hypocrisy of whining secondly the film seamlessly weaves between fantasy and reality between real life and fiction and finally it's often very funny.  It also contains the best work either Billy Crystal or Demi Moore have done in a while.  Not vintage Allen but it'll make you laugh.  Just don't fall into the trap of thinking it has something important to say.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen comedy is often cited to be an acquired taste  and it is. Albeit one that I've almost acquired. Though I still find Woody Allen's comedy to be rather hit and miss I've somewhat come round to his way of thinking. Annie Hall is an out and out masterpiece and judging by the eighteen Allen films I've seen this one is the best since then. Deconstructing Harry is basically a cross between Annie Hall and Ingmar Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries' although Allen seems to have had his tongue firmly in cheek regarding that last influence. The story follows Harry Allen a writer that is suffering with writers block. Harry has seen fit therefore to base his short stories on friends and relatives much to their dismay. Harry has been honoured by the college that expelled him Wild Strawberries and he now also has to deal with all the people he has upset by his writing leading us into a lifeaffirming piece of cinema for Woody Allen.Like most of Allen's oeuvre this one is very personal. Allen made this film at a time when he was in the papers every day for various allegations and at times it almost feels like Woody has been backed into a corner and he's trying desperately to get out of it. In this movie Allen builds up a three dimensional portrait of his character though various events in the movie which are intertwined with short stories that he has made up. The short stories themselves are generally imaginative and many would make a great movie in themselves the one with Tobey Maguire being a particular highlight. The way that Allen combines these two elements of story telling is really skillful and despite the huge area for cocking up Allen doesn't fall into it and the story flows smoothly throughout. The film features much of Allen's trademark witty dialogue with some of the exchanges being truly memorable and absurdly funny. Deconstructing Harry is Allen at his neurotic selfstyled best and I rate it as his best since Annie Hall.".

As I started it I regretted it immediately I was bored and annoyed. Towards the end it began to grow on me but a lot just didn't do it for me.What I liked I absolutely love the concept and the story. I have not seen any like it. What I like most is that while there is an actual plot and external events it's more of a character study. They take an unlikable character and give him plenty of depth and sympathy to make up for his brash decisions and opinions. I love Woody Allen as a writer. I also liked the short stories how they were narrated the actual relevance they had to Harry's problems and friends and how they were somewhat diverse. It wasn't just about the message. I both liked and disliked the scenes where they would cut to the same shot. It is very reminiscent of Jean Loc Goddard's Breathless which at times gave it a very relaxed more realistic feel considering that you could interpret that there were probably moments of silence between conversation like something that happens in real conversation. However when you cut in midsentence or make too many quick cuts it's distracting and annoying to try and listen.What I hated While I love that film is about Harry Block I hated him. His guts his obsession with sex and the fact that he is so damn awkward. I hate Woody Allen as an actor. I appreciate when people stutter pause mix up words or ramble in movies because that's what people do in real life. However Woody Allen takes it and makes it absolutely obnoxious. His arms flail around he never makes eye contact or keeps his eyes on the road while driving.Overall the word I would use to describe this movie is 'inconsistent' with some scene being very funny and entertaining while others made me want to scratch my DVD apart.".

This is certainly the worst most abrasive and selfish Allen has ever let himself look on screen but there was still a feeling of pulling his selfaimed punches just a bit. Sort of an All That Jazz lite. The film has a good number of very funny lines and creative ideas Robin Williams as an out offocus actor is a brilliant concept and its fun to see a filmmaker Allen's age pushing his style limits with jump cuts and multilayered construction. Still it starts to repeat its own ideas after a while both literally and thematically and the ending feels a bit wimpy.

It's a dark and unknown world in here and noone living in it likes it at all. The characters are all slightly off colour subnormal. Our hero is no exception. The unknown Stephen Lack does a goodenough job what with all the grimacing and psychoplaying. The supporting cast is over all sufficient. A treat is as usual Michael Ironside who gives his pretty simple character a nice edge and a personality.As for the story it's sometimes hard to follow and sometimes it lacks something.

Nowadays I've learnt to view the film through more enlightened eyes and appreciate it for the masterpiece that is most rightfully is.Apart from the muchlauded 'exploding head' scene which could have used a little more blood spattering everywhere one of the film's most chilling scenes is at the very beginning when the lead character Cameron Vale Stephen Lack causes a woman to have a fit in a shopping mall before being captured by a pair of heavies. The scene was so convincingly played out that it really shock me up.The more interesting aspect is the fact that most of these 'scanners'or telepathic curiosities as the CEO of Consec calls them are usually forced to live on the fringes of society as their telekinetic powers are feared and misunderstood by many. It would seem that the director David Cronenberg was using this plot device as a metaphor to comment on society's prejudicial attitudes towards the mentally ill. Like many of his lowbudget horror films right up to 'The Fly' 1986 'Scanners' has a very subversive flyonthewall take on society's ills. The modern society portrayed in 'Scanners' is a world viewed through the eyes of the outcast.Throughout the film there is a general feeling of starkness from the synthesisertinged score by Howard Shore to the general sparse look of the film. This gives the viewer a rather apt feeling of coldness and isolation.Michael Ironside steals the show as the unhinged renegade scanner Darryl Revok who has a vast army of scanner converts at his disposal ready and willing to annihilate anyone unfortunate enough to stand in their way.The only down side however is the casting of Stephen Lack as Cameron Vale. Although he makes a fairly decent effort of playing his part Lack just doesn't seem to have that muchneeded 'spark' to bring his character to life.All in all 'Scanners' comes highly recommended as a 'mustsee' feature.".

Nothing is spoon feed to you. The splatter effects have given this movie it's much deserved place in one of the best horror set pieces ever made. Two scenes stand out the most. After watching this film you'll understand why gore hounds love this movie.The only part of this movie that I would have changed would have been the lead. Mr. Lack was okay but I felt that Cronenberg could have found an actor with more experience. Michael Ironside was chilling ice ran through his veins. This movie made his career as a movie heavy. Jennifer O'Neill was nice to look at and fit in well. A strong storyline and good directing made this one a must see.I was very impressed with this movie. The soundtrack was apt for the movie.I haven't watch this film in awhile. But after seeing it on D.V.D. recently I'm still a big fan of Scanners. Sadly I'm not too fond of the sequels.

Meanwhile other scanners are picked off one by one and the hunter is left with great moral and existential questions  where did he come from what is his purpose and is there a right or wrong side in this humanmutant battle? Director David Cronenberg can seemingly do no wrong. As I watch one film after another of his I wait to find one that is the pock mark on the perfect career. Some of his films such as Rabid or perhaps Stereo may be of less quality than others but I have yet to find one that is outright bad. Scanners for the record ranks among his best and has become a cultural staple.You know you are a culturally important film when you are referenced by Wayne's World. But seriously this film is a science fiction story that  like many science fiction stories  holds some greater cultural and moral issues worth investigating.The issue of racism is here. Like the recent XMen movies and many other films the idea of someone who is different in a superficial way scanners look like ordinary humans and is rejected raises the point that we as a society need to accept those who are not like us. Racism stinks whether it appear in its purest form skin color or through religion or other means. And that is what makes this film so clever the main character is a hero but yet he is the outcast  in some ways we see him as being more human than those who would have him killed.This also happens to be a film that focuses on one of Cronenberg's strong points his love of science. Or perhaps science gone wrong if you will. Does any other director really tackle this as effectively as Cronenberg? I don't think so. Imagine what would happen if he started making a series of Philip K. Dick novels into films. I suppose I did not really get into the film itself so much but the beauty of the film is that what you take away from it if you view it critically is so much more than the plot or effects or lighting. Yes you have a great cast isn't Michael Ironside creepy? and a head explodes. Yes you have gun fights and mind control. Even a little bit of romance but only just a pinch nothing like a GoldblumDavis connection in this one.If you cannot tell I want you to see this movie. If you're the type of person I am you'll find this movie so smooth and refreshing on your mental palette that the film ends before you've even realized it began  the sign of a really great film or a really short one which this isn't.

With Scanners he make use of bigger sets more expansive special effects all while presenting a frightening aspect of ever developing computer technology in an interesting story. The kicker is that most of what the film presents is relevant in more ways than one to today's world.

He is rescued by Dr Paul Ruth an unusual scientist who seems to understand his condition perfectly. Vale is sent out to locate others like himself but is Dr Ruth telling him the whole story David Cronenberg has always been one of my favourite directors but I particularly like his middle period. His films up to The Brood have some amateurish elements and from Dead Ringers on he starts to get a bit too critically respected but the movies in between starting with Scanners are all top quality horror. What I especially like is his ability to take avantgarde offthewall ideas  the telepathy  psychokinesis notion here  and explore it in the most outlandish and experimental ways yet still be grounded in an entertaining story. Thus on one level this movie is an exciting thriller with car chases explosions corporate intrigue traitors and family secrets. But on the other it's an art film the hero scans a computer a foetus in the womb is a scanner there is a group scanner mindsex scene one scanner drills a hole in his head to let out the voices whilst another builds a twentyfoot model of his own head and sits in it to escape them. Cronenberg is cerebral and can't resist exploring these ideas but he also knows the value of good story shocks and vigorous pacing. The whole movie can be taken as an industrial thriller a medical conspiracy plot with echoes of the infamous Thalidomide scandal or one man's search for existential meaning  take your pick. For me it does have one big liability and that's the lead duo of Lack and O'Neill both of whom are stiff and uninteresting. This may be somewhat deliberate because the story is so crazy but also because McGoohan and Ironside contrast with such dynamic extreme performances  they're both fantastic. Everything else however is first rate  Carol Spier's cold clinical production design of dank warehouses and ugly sinister office blocks Mark Irwin's sharp photography the noisy headfilling sound effects and Howard Shore's unsettling protoelectronic music all combine to create an atmosphere of uneasy tension. Special mention however must go to makeup maestros Dick Smith and Chris Walas for creating the unforgettably gory final showdown and the sequence with Del Grande which gets my vote for best exploding head ever bar none. I'm an old school effects fan and this scene for me shows the value of not using CG  Walas built a plaster cast filled it with butcher's leftovers and then blew it apart with a shotgun. It may be a basic approach but it looks sensational. If it doesn't shock you you're already dead. One of the quintessential horror films of the late seventies  eighties renaissance period this is great disturbing fun for both undiscerning fright fans and cult cinema students. I also think it represents the great Canadian director at his most imaginative potent and entertaining  don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1980 our understanding of our own world as we continued to look to the stars was beginning to look rather incomplete. Nowhere is this more apparent today as in the field of neuroscience and mental health where socalled charities are hard at work trying to convince people they are diseased when they really have more in common with the likes of Einstein or Spielberg. I say this because it has suddenly become trendy to make films that proclaim to explore the daily life difficulties of people who share this divergence yet they are all flawed in one manner. By trying so hard to dramatise and commercialise something the makers have no understanding of they create caricatures that are ridiculous and insulting. Much of my own video work concerns the fact that when films do get it right they do so entirely by accident. Blade Runner was one such film. Scanners David Cronenberg's first film to gain an international release and at the time when home video was becoming a reality is another.Scanners is set in a contemporary time not wishing to make any odd predictions about our future. The only clues to the time in which the story takes place are historical references to the development of a synthetic hormone given to women during the gestational period. This drug is overtly designed to calm or sedate the women in question but it has the effect of altering the neurology of their children. Said children grow up with the thoughts of every individual around them echoing in their heads until a point is reached where they break down. One such individual we see as an adult named Cameron Vale. After hearing the thoughts of a woman repulsed by his appearance and causing her to have a seizure with his reaction he is pulled from the street by shady government agents. When he awakens a doctor Paul Ruth sits with him and explains at least partly why he has been in such an acute state of distress for so long. What he neglects to tell his latest subject is that there are plenty of other scanners out there and not all of them are nice.As if we needed any demonstration of that last fact we cut to the inside of the government facility the good doctor works for. There a scanner who has been tamed is giving a demonstration of his powers. Asking for a volunteer he is met with reluctance until a seemingly ordinary man from what appears to be the scientific community puts up a hand. Asked to think of an unclassified secret that does not relate to his own organisation the volunteer sits and calmly participates. But the man giving the demonstration shows increasing distress convulsing and shaking as if being tortured. If you have already seen the film you know what is coming. If you have not seen Scanners no amount of description can prepare you. Literally our lecturer is scanned to death as in his head explodes. While this was not Michael Ironside's first role starlets being groomed to be the next Nicole Kidman could not hope for a better introduction. And thus we have the first of many performances from Ironside as a mean ruthless sod.This is why Scanners is a deeply flawed wouldbe masterpiece. While a protagonist is only as strong as your antagonist allows him to be Stephen Lack is best summed up in the primary role by his surname. He lacks charisma he lacks emotion he even looks like he lacks a pulse. This would explain why Jennifer O'Neill passive and inactive as she is received top billing. This is why actors who can draw an audience can command millions of dollars in fees. Put simply one does not notice when a film has halfway decent actors because they are doing their job. That job at least in part is to shore up the reality of the film they are in. For all the complaints I have heard people throw around regarding the abilities of actors like Hayden Christensen or others of his generation they might as well be Ian McKellen or Christopher Lee when compared to Lack or O'Neill. They are totally the wrong people to build a film around and were I remaking the film with similar actors I would shift focus to make Ironside's character the hero.The plot also becomes a problem in the final act. Cronenberg unwisely attempts to explain the origins of the scanner phenomenon where our hero fits into it what makes Daryl Revok the way he is and why the good doctor is not so good almost all in the one half hour. The end result is disjointed although not quite pointless. Cronenberg does manage to spin the final scene into something of a climax but the loss of the thread is really only highlighted by the fact that audiences remember the head explosion a sequence that occurs in the first two reels of the film better than the final scanning battle. Not that I am too surprised as that shot was a tough act to follow. Nonetheless the film's highlights are many and they more than make up for most of the problems. The only problem that remains is that the scale of the story is simply too big for the budget the technical expertise available and the running time. Fortunately Cronenberg was able to rectify this in his subsequent projects.When I add it all up I consider Scanners an eight out of ten film. It is almost a masterpiece and a musthave for fans of gore or outsider stories.".

Scanners look completely human which in itself makes the task of finding them difficult for agents in the fields. But those burdened with this phenomenon are unsettled by a cacophony of peoples' thoughts joined in a chorus of unpleasant noises which cause major problems in living a normal existence.

A rogue Scanner Darryl RevokMichael Ironsideis being pursued by a scientific organization named Consec which devote research in the study of Scanners and have Ruth under their employ. Revok is supposedly operating an underground Scanners movement to control those without their special abilities and through a traitor in Consec Braedon KellerLawrence Dane have been running a company created by Ruthwho sold the company to Consec joining their organization devoted to Scanners and their uncharted potential for the future Biocarbon Amalgamate issuing a drug to doctors for their pregnant patients which can create a new breed of Scanners. Ruth hopes to infiltrate Revok's group using an unknown Scanner living as a bum on the streets Cameron ValeStephen Lackin the hopes of stopping him. On his journey and with the help of ephemeral which calms the storm that's been tormenting him Vale will meet Kim ObristJennifer O'Neillwho leads a Scanner movement in the attempts to harmonize themselves fitting into society instead of following Revok's goal of terror. Obrist and her group's lives are in danger because any Scanner who doesn't follow Revok suffer the consequences. But there's a special link between Vale and Revok and Ruth is much more than what he appears.Watching Cronenberg's Scanners for the first time since I was a teenager I must still say I'm in awe of the final effects sequence depicting a gruesome mental telepathic showdown between Revok and Vale. The modern computer graphic techniques of today just don't impress me like these homemade makeup effects where you see nerves bulge through the skin eyeballs pop out a face peeling and of course a head exploding. Obviously the head explosion gained Scanners the cred and momentum needed for filmgoers to check it out but I think Cronenberg really puts a great deal of thought into what indeed makes that effects sequence take shape. Revok agrees to scan a host of a meeting showing the slow effects of such an ability with the end result being a head blowing apart. But that final scene where Revok tires of Vale's heroics in following Obrist's peaceful ideals planning to suck his brain dry you have quite a yucky turn of events that still floored me..impressive considering this film is nearly 30 years old. Maybe you have to look past the logistics of a Scanner using his mental powers to remove data from a computer's data bank..the script explains that a Scanner links with another's nervous system not brain and a computer also has a nervous system with an override destruct sequence causing a lab's technical equipment to explode blasting personnel across the room burning power lines and even a melting phone but I felt the overall film has a fascinating underlying theme of how those with unique abilities are considered inhuman freaks and if they are to be treated as lab animals a revolt through the creation of a Scanner army will achieve the goals of the castaways. Ironside is riveting as the formidable Revok feared by Consec and the innocent Scanners who just wish to coexist with the rest of the human race. O'Neill is still quite lovely as the doeeyed Obrist who watches in horror as Revok slaughters her people joining forces with the wooden Lack. My favorite part of the film besides the final effects sequence is the art museum sequence where Vale meets a rather unstable Scanner named Pierce whose surreal pieces really leave a lasting impression..Pierce uses his art to keep him centered with Cronenberg perhaps saying that through art a troubled soul can find a type of tranquility. I think watching Scanners you see a birth of the artistry of special effects which would evolve to great depths such as The Thing and Cronenberg's own Videodrome.".

They are small in number but their powers makes them very dangerous  but also very powerful in the hands of the right people. Dr Paul Ruth runs a secretive programme trying to develop the power into a weapon but he only has one recruit  Cameron Vale. When Ruth's programme is violently attacked by scanner Darryl Revok they realise that the battle is being lost and they prepare Vale to go undercover in filtrate Revok's group and lead them to him.As everyone and their dog knows this film is always talked about for the infamous scene near the start where we are first shown the power of the scanners however there are many scenes across the whole film that are just as strong as that one. The opening scene is powerful as it shows the ability Vale has and the lack of control he has over it while the scene where Revok escapes capture is even more sinister and gripping. This pretty much carries across the whole film although there are some slows spots and parts of the story that don't hang together as well as they should. Cronenberg is famous for his body horror but he does do tension well and here he is solid when called upon. The low budget does show through at times but mostly it is good.The acting is a little bit ropey though which is maybe where the limitations do show through. Lack is OK but he isn't anything special  he can say his lines well enough and not fall over while walking but he can't bring out much more below the surface than that. He reminded me of the old bmovie matine stars who have good jaws but not much else. McGoohan is better and his presence is welcome in his scenes. Ironside is hammy but enjoyable perhaps not having as much screen time as I would have liked but effective when he is. The support is mostly pretty average O'Neill is OK but the rest are soso and are sometime amusing as they get scanned.Overall though this is a classic cult film. The plot moves forward well enough although I would have liked more real life commentary from Cronenberg above the general mental illness metaphor that it acts as but his direction otherwise is good. The cast are mostly only OK but they do enough to keep the story moving while moments of horror and tension are well served up.

The film reverses Cronenberg's Shivers Rabid and Fly  in which technologically mutated bodies produce knockon psychological mutations  and joins films like The Brood and Videodrome in which altered states in the brain produce new bizarre and grotesque somantic states.Technocults and weird quasireligious sects are common in Cronenberg's filmography but dualism itself seems to be a sort of rationalisation of Christianity's core myths. That is the belief that man was expelled from paradise and cast into a fleshy world of sin mortality and diseased matter the latter in which our souls are supposedly encased. As science gradually replaced Christianity however such thinking was rationalised into Cartesian dualism the spirit becomes the mind the body the object of sin before the concept was dropped altogether in favour for a kind of materialist reductionism.

He Vale is sent out into the world to find convert  send over to ConSec. However there is another Scanner by the name of Daryl Revok...played wonderfully by Michael Ironside who is on the same trail of other scanners but there's a twist. Revok is trying to convert other scanners to his cause.....but the ones who don't well......take it from there. Written  Directed by David Cronenberg Scanners has made a name for itself ....especially in this one scene where a man who works for ConSec asks for volunteers to demonstrate the scanning techniques. BE WARNED! This particular scene is NOT for the squeamish. Aside from that Scanners is a movie that is sure to shock as well as scare you. I still have a 1st. edition VHS copy of this movie released on Embassy Home Video. It has since been released on DVD courtesy of MGM Home Video...and it's in Letterbox. This is a movie that definitely belongs in any collection. ....oh by the way Jennifer O'neill is as pretty as ever in this movie. Enjoy!!".

Sure Stephen Lack's acting is very weak but the other actors like McGoohan and Ironside are just great aside from wooden Lack i also love the realistic and gruesome makeup and gore effects by Dick Smith and Chris Wallace that still hold up today very realistically without CGI such as the famed exploding head scene everyone remembers. I also like Howard Shore's chilling music score long before his scores to Silence of the Lambs or Lord of the Rings the film is a metaphor on birth defects and how a drug can mutate a child into something different that they will grow up into even something dangerous. It also does offer a statement on humanity and how another race of being can be accepted or discriminated against sort of like how the XMen movies worked out.It's definitely not for the squeamish but for those looking for a good thrilling and intelligent Scifi horror thriller then this is it.Also recommended Videodrome Akira Firestarter The Dead Zone 1983 Carrie Making Contact a.k.a.

	schema:headline " A bit more fun than two hours in a doctor's waiting room";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is famous for its headexploding scene but that fact may hurt it more than help at least in retrospect. The scene occurs early in the film and for all its conceptual beauty the execution is technically sloppysurprising particularly since this is a David Cronenberg film. I'm a fan of most of Cronenberg's work but in my eyes Scanners is one of his big mistakes albeit one that is oddly overrated by genre fans. But the primary reason the infamous scene hurts the film is that little else happens like it again at least not until the very end about an hour and a half later. For most of its running time Scanners is very dated oddly nonatmospheric convoluted and ultimately boring lowbudget science fiction dreck.It takes place in an alternate universe where an experimental drug has turned a number of people into telepaths who also can tap into psychokinesis when it comes to other humans' bodies and minds. There are a number of problems with this. The primary one is that Cronenberg who also wrote the story and script just plops us into the middle of a jargony world with ominous government organizations but with little backstory or explanation.Another problem with the premise is that a lot of the conflict involves people thinking dangerous thingsdoing ill will via thinking. It's a problem because thinking is something that we cannot observe or experience in others except for scanners none of whom will be watching the film. So what we're left with is watching scanners and their victims grimace in various ways which end up looking like a combination of constipation sexual ecstasy and someone in the midst of a heart attack. Sans contextand we're not usually given enough context that's not exactly fodder for dramatic tension it more often has the effect of unintentional humor.There are also problems with the casting. Stephen Lack who ends up being the protagonist is oddly aloof and disengaging. He has all the charisma of the bare clinically lit sets. Michael Ironside as the chief antagonist is better but he's absent from the film for long periods of time and he occasionally launches into bits of ridiculous overactingmaybe in an attempt to balance Lack's Mister Rogerslike drone. The rest of the cast is okay but they're given mostly empty but ridiculous things to say.Unintentional humor will also creep up at this point in time with the science aspects of the film's science fiction. The computer subplot and the machinationsphysics surrounding it are absurd as they were in 1980 but most people were far less familiar with computers then and the mention that the computer has a nervous system made me lament that Cronenberg didn't instead develop something like the game console from his superior film eXistenZ 1999.Cronenberg tries to spice things up with a few gun violence scenes and car chasesstunts sometimes with thriller accoutrements. These scenes probably work better than any of the other material but they're also very pedestrian and feel like what they arean attempt to wake the audience up from encroaching slumber.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is famous for its headexploding scene but that fact may hurt it more than help at least in retrospect. The scene occurs early in the film and for all its conceptual beauty the execution is technically sloppysurprising particularly since this is a David Cronenberg film. I'm a fan of most of Cronenberg's work but in my eyes Scanners is one of his big mistakes albeit one that is oddly overrated by genre fans. But the primary reason the infamous scene hurts the film is that little else happens like it again at least not until the very end about an hour and a half later. For most of its running time Scanners is very dated oddly nonatmospheric convoluted and ultimately boring lowbudget science fiction dreck.It takes place in an alternate universe where an experimental drug has turned a number of people into telepaths who also can tap into psychokinesis when it comes to other humans' bodies and minds. There are a number of problems with this. The primary one is that Cronenberg who also wrote the story and script just plops us into the middle of a jargony world with ominous government organizations but with little backstory or explanation.Another problem with the premise is that a lot of the conflict involves people thinking dangerous thingsdoing ill will via thinking. It's a problem because thinking is something that we cannot observe or experience in others except for scanners none of whom will be watching the film. So what we're left with is watching scanners and their victims grimace in various ways which end up looking like a combination of constipation sexual ecstasy and someone in the midst of a heart attack. Sans contextand we're not usually given enough context that's not exactly fodder for dramatic tension it more often has the effect of unintentional humor.There are also problems with the casting. Stephen Lack who ends up being the protagonist is oddly aloof and disengaging. He has all the charisma of the bare clinically lit sets. Michael Ironside as the chief antagonist is better but he's absent from the film for long periods of time and he occasionally launches into bits of ridiculous overactingmaybe in an attempt to balance Lack's Mister Rogerslike drone. The rest of the cast is okay but they're given mostly empty but ridiculous things to say.Unintentional humor will also creep up at this point in time with the science aspects of the film's science fiction.

	schema:reviewBody "Cameron Vale played by artist Stephen Lack is a derelict who after a bizarre incident in a shopping mall is rounded up by two goons who bring him to eminent doctor Paul Ruth Patrick McGoohan. Paul reveals to Cameron the reality of his situation Cameron is in fact a Scanner or a person with extraordinary telepathic abilities. Scanners can not only look into the minds of others and manipulate them but can also do very unpleasant things to human bodies. Paul recruits Cameron to help him track down Darryl Revok Michael Ironside in his breakthrough role a rogue Scanner with plans for world domination.The late great Dick Smith was the special consultant to the makeup effects crew Stephan Dupuis Chris Walas Tom Schwartz and it's these effects that take center stage in this interesting and bleak thriller from Canadian legend David Cronenberg. The exploding head that everybody remembers so vividly actually occurs only about 13 and a half minutes into the show so viewers don't have long to wait. Of course as has been pointed out how does one top something like that? Well Cronenberg waits until the end to come up with a pretty good showdown between good Scanner and bad Scanner.The pace is admittedly deliberate but the ideas unfortunately don't feel completely fleshed out. Quite a bit of exposition is packed into the last act. The filming of this classic wasn't particularly enjoyable for Cronenberg as he did have to begin filming before his script was even finished so he was unfortunately rushed. Still his story is a damn entertaining and intense one.Howard Shores' music score is wonderfully over the top and scary and sets and locations do have a very sparse look. The acting is variable McGoohan looks bored as if he doesn't really want to be there and Jennifer O'Neill while beautiful doesn't really add anything to the film. Lack gets a lot of flak for his performance which I'll agree isn't a particularly dynamic one but it does suit the character a man who was a lonely fringe dweller for a long time until being awakened into a larger reality. Cronenberg does make an effective parallel here to the way that real life people with mental issues get treated. Former Cronenberg repertory player Robert A. Silverman is fun in another of his offbeat parts and Lawrence Dane is excellent as security chief Braedon Keller but it's Ironside who completely steals the show as the nasty villain.While not without flaws Scanners remains one of its directors' most memorable efforts to date.Seven out of 10.".

I never thought I say this but a remake of this movie would be welcome.

	schema:reviewBody "Scanners will definitely be one of those films I'll check out on a moments notice if it's on late at night on the scifi channel that is. It's a work that sometimes tries for the lowkey and other times goes for the ultragory and darkly comic but it's all pulled off nicely by director David Cronenberg with help from horror makeup legend Dick Smith. It's a story that seems to be just a pure good vs evil thriller with Cameron Vale Stephen Lack and Darryl Revok Michael Ironside where one doesn't even quite know what he is and how he can hear so many voices at once thinking in unison and the other kills people by controlling their minds sometimes to make their heads explode. Yet there's another element thrown in which has to do with industry and corporations or rather one corporation invests interest in making sure a drug called Ephemerol real drug ? to put a control on pregnant women but it doesn't quite work. This is expanded upon the more one thinks about it into the idea of mindcontrol and how clarity of the mind works for a scanner i.e. the scene where the scanners are 'communing' before a shootout occurs psychically linked a bit.Other ideas start to flow from there and it's fascinating to see how they fly out in little spurts if not as strongly as in Naked Lunch or History of Violence while the carnage goes on. Some of it is just downright delirious I loved the scene where Keller by gunpoint makes programmers try to 'turn off' Vale by tapping into the frequency that he's already been trying to jam on the other side through a phone line. Chaos ensues as we see computer chips freak out Vale's mind goes into a freeze then he snaps out and comes back with a big wallop that sends the power line crashing down not too oddly enough right next to a gas station where the pump's become unhinged and huge explosions start coming out on both ends. Cronenberg has as a sidebar the true perils of technology in dealing with such a concept like telekinesis and taking it a step further into the realm of morality and freewill as Kim says she did before coming to ComSec with Vale. Meanwhile Cronenberg keeps on with about as many shootouts and explosions and mania as a Bmovie touched slightly by dementia and it's usually a sweet ride technically even if one is certain after a while which of the scanners will love or not particularly when a van drives alongside the one holding the scanners and bullets ring out.The big draw of course for most viewers are the head explosions. Actually there's only one but in a way it's not a bad thing really. I liked that Cronenberg uses gore not just in the case of Scanners but in the bulk of his work to illustrate a point when one hears him in interviews it's clear he takes ultra gory and horrifically bloody and organy violence seriously unlike many of todays wouldbe horror directors. And when the headexplosion comes it's both horrific and in a perfect way hilarious. We know something terrible will happen by the near spaghettiwestern length drawing out of the scanner match between Redek and the other guy and when it comes it's akin to when in RoboCop the executive gets killed by the big battle robot you know it's coming but it's still the thought and buildup that counts. And bear in mind as it is Dick Smith the climax will not disappoint even for the most weathered genre aficionado. While the biggest flaws would be in a few scenes dragging the dialog from Ruth before his demise chiefly and Lack's dearth of talent it's very worthwhile to see even if you're not terribly familiar with the director. It's lowbudget and inventive within the bounds of the plot.".

Look at eXistenZ which came out a year after Dark City which actually somewhat resembles Scanners I really like that film for different reasons though and just a month or so after the huge hit The Matrix which I found terrible since it never went anywhere with its ideas. eXistenZ was a couple of steps above most other theworldisn'ttherealworld films.Scanners does have some huge problems though. It moves quickly and intelligently in its first hour but the last 49 minutes are sort of silly. The whole computer hacking thing can be forgiven. This movie is pretty early. People knew little about computers in 1981. But why should have the destruction of the computer destroyed the main character's mind? He was attached to several humans when they died and that never did a thing to him. Heck Michael Ironside exploded a  guy's head through his scanning abilities. I like the whole the next generation will all be scanners plot point that turns up near the end I assume that's where the sequels take up but the very ending seems to happen too quickly no matter how cool it looked.

The Monk Sith Sekae gives a final training to Alex and he returns home. Will Alex succeed to control Helena?Scanners III The Takeover is not a bad movie as indicated in the IMDb Users Rating actually it is a good sequel of Scanners. The plot is well constructed through a tight screenplay the story has a great villain the acting is reasonable for a movie directly released on video. The transformation of a sweet woman into a powerful villain is a great idea and there is also humor like when the gang is thrown into the garbage truck or her boss dancing in the restaurant or Alex waking up and walking in the morgue.

If you enjoy seeing people struggle from the overpowering supernatural abilities of an immoral female protagonist disguised as an antagonist then this movie is definitely for you.

	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with a scrolling caption informing us of what scanners are. The film begins proper at some Christmas party. Alex Monet Steve Parrish and his best friend are talking to some girls. The conversation turns to scanners. The girls don't believe they exist. Alex is a scanner and his friend convinces him to prove the girls wrong. So using his psychic power he makes his friend slide backwards on his own. Someone then grabs Alex and pats him on the back Alex is surprised and loses control of his powers his friend is jerked back violently and out of the balcony doors over the guard rail and to his death 40 odd floor to the concrete pavement below. Oops. Alex is upset even though officially it was ruled an accident. We learn that he has traveled all over the world and finally decided to settle at a monastery in Thailand so he can learn to control his powers. Meanwhile back home his sister Helana Monet the sexy Liliana Komorowska is trying to lead a normal life. However see experiences severe pain and headaches. Her and Alex's father who adopted them Dr Elton Monet Colin Fox is the owner of a large medical research company and is trying to invent a drug in the form of a patch which releases the drug into the bloodstream through the skin eventually Dr Monet thinks it will help all scanners. He tells Helana about this drug and that at this stage it's highly experimental and hasn't been tested properly. One night when the pain becomes unbearable Helana tries the drug immediately the pain disappears. The next morning at breakfast outside a Pigeon craps on her hand she stares at it and using her powers makes it explode. The drug has changed her from a nice sweet girl into a wild powercrazed murderer in mere hours! Later that night she visits Dr Baumann Harry Hill who is performing experiments on scanners. She frees all the scanners in his care and gives them patches so she can control their psychic powers too. From then on she sets her evil plan for world domination in action! The family lawyer Micheal Daniel Pilon becomes suspicious and tracks Alex down. He convinces Alex to go back home. Once back Helana realizes that Alex can stop her so she uses other scanners to try and kill him. Alex survives and enlists the help of research scientist and Helana's best friend Joyce Stone Valerie Valois.Together they discover Helana is going to transmit her mind controlling signals using video and into tens of millions of American homes through their T.V.s! Competently but sometimes flatly directed by Christian Duguay and called scanner force here in the UK this was better than I expected thanks to a script by B.J. Nelson Julie Richard and David Preston it took three people to write this?! that at least keeps things moving at a fair pace and is fairly entertaining if a little silly at times. But the films main ace up it's sleeve is Liliana Komorowska as Helana the films over the top villainness. As far as I'm aware I've never heard of her before or seen her in any other film but I really liked her in this. Probably better than the film deserves to be honest. She's a sexy dominant evil and devious murdering scanner by the end of the film I really wanted her to die in the most painful gory way possible unfortunately I didn't get my wish which seemed a bit of an anti climax. Easily the films best sequence involves her she walks into Dr Baumanns office dressed in a long coat a sexy mini skirt knee high leather boots and a white scarf she looks classy dominant and sexy. She teases and plays with Baumann making his finger explode and then finally making his head explode as well. She slowly walks around the facility killing the remaining guards using her powers before eventually making an over the top speech to her fellow scanner to try and convince them to join her and help her carry out her evil plans. At one point she says we shouldn't be at the bottom of the dung heap we should be at the top! she's class all the way through and makes the film watchable all on her own and she gets naked in a hot tub as well! Alex makes a likable hero. We get some nudity and sex at some points it looks like a cheap porno especially with the busty blond nurse hitting on Alex! She is half undressed on top of Alex on a pool table four men burst in and one says what do we have here a rapist? the nurse replies oh no he was willing!. The gore was sort of disappointing there is only one exploding head and it's only on screen for about a second blink and you'll miss it. Although I did like the sequence where Alex kills another scanner by spinning him around in a revolving door! There is an action sequence where Alex on his motorbike is chased by four scanners dressed like 1930's gangsters in a bus but because of the low budget there are no other cars on the road at all it looks a bit sad actually! The ending is a bit of a let down also nothing more than Helana's patch falling off turning back into the sweet innocent girl she was at the start of the film. Probably worth a watch at least if not for Liliana Komorowska's delightful villainness. Watchable if nothing spectacular.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Scanners 3 The Takeover' is actually a bit of a miniepic. It doesn't have half the budget of the previous film and there are some offthewall kooky performances from almost all of the characters but this is definitely the better  and by better I mean camp fun  of the 2 films. The film begins with an introduction to Alex Monet a brash Scanner that has reduced his abilities to a literal party trick. When he absentmindedly kills his best friend at one such party he decides in an effort of contrition to find a way to better hone his powers. This leads him to the Buddhist monasteries of Tibet. Meanwhile his sister Helena Monet who is the heir to the pharmaceutical company that is working on a 'cure' for the previouslydescribed side effects of the scanning mutation is experimenting with said drug turning her into a powerhungry megalomaniac. Much as the original 'Scanners' introduced the ability to control computers Helena attempts to control people by passing a 'scanner signal' through prerecorded video. When Alex returns it is a cat and mouse game pitting brother against sister.There is no doubt in my mind that the spark that inspired these followups was the singularly iconic exploding head from the original and these sequels do not let down. There is a surplus of gooey gore and a sense that each death is an attempt to outdo the last. If you're after the headier no pun intended aspirations of Cronenberg you are bound to be disappointed with these. If you are hoping to see fountains of blood spewing from the skulls of random characters this is the place.".

When I rented this movie initially I thought that it was going to be one of those low budget action films with awful special effects terrible dialogue terrible plot and gratuitous nudity like the highlander movies.  I was dead wrong. Scanners III is a wonderfully cerebral film chock full of allusions and references to American folklore popular science fiction novels of the past century i.e. 1984 and just about everything by Michael Chricton Huey Lewis and The News song lyrics I've got a brand new drug and the religion and philosophy of the Algonquin Indians.  What an analytical treat!!As the iconography in this film suggests American culture is dominated by the media the pharmecutical companies and cheap dares we do to impress girls on Saturday nights.  We are soulless zombies only acting on impulses that have been passed down to us by our parents.  If we only used our heads as Alex Monet does in this film monet is an obvious reference to the french impressionistic artist...there are many more delicious referencegoodies in this gem! we could overcome the social and mental chains that are hindering us from developing as a society. The film is beckoning us to cast away homburg hats and black suits of the nineteen forties for more casual clothing eschew hot concentual sex with busty mentalhospital nurses for passionate lovemaking with loved ones to send christianity and all of western society to the junkyard and take up Tibetan Buddhism the only religion that has the capability to give one enough strength to overcome one's weaknesses.  In no way is this film just another sequel to David Cronenberg's far inferior film Scanners.  This is a treatise on how to live life successfully.  I urge you to watch it immediately.".

She eventually goes megalomaniacally insane and wants to take revenge on the doctors that experimented on her as a child and ultimately rule the world with the rest of the Scanners. First she sets out to free the scanners currently being tested at Dr. Baumner's office then proceeds to kill him resulting in one of the most graphic deaths in the Scanners history. She blows up his finger then scans him until his eyeballs boil and his brain hemorrhages you've got to see it then finally his head explodes of course. There's all sorts of gory deaths. There's a syringe through the tongue a man who dives head first into an empty pool a drowning an inflating again has to be seen and exploding head and a man who gets spun around in a revolving door so forcefully his face is deformed. But then it explodes anyway. This one actually probably has the highest exploding head count. The whole time her brother the hero is trying to track her down and help her but she evades him and eventually he is captured by her gang of scanner thugs and is pitted against her in a oneonone battle on live TV. I don't recall him killing her she just sort of goes back to normal. Kind of a dull ending but its made up for by the abundance of action and special effects. I enjoyed this one better than the second which I thought was better than the first.".

However the actual execution of the story does have some unsatisfying aspects to it. Even though the movie runs only 95 or so minutes you can really feel the padding it didn't have to run as long as it did. The expansion of the powers of the scanners gets downright silly and unbelievable at times even though this is a B movie.

	schema:headline " Oh those darn college applications!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an amusing story that highlights that blasted college admissions process. The story follows several soontobe high school graduate's plans for the future. For Marlo Parker it's going to whatever school his dream girl Jessica Flynn Boyle is going to. For Oliver it's giving into the white line fever and experiencing life Jack Kerouac style with the possibility of meeting renegade game show hostesses on the side. But for most of the students in the movie it is all about getting into college. We see the whole bit of it taking the SATs college recruitment day college prep programs and the dreaded admissions interview. It's quite an amusing exageration of the whole process and probably more likely so for kids actually going through the college application process. Although the movie at least for me is sometimes funny and sometime not so funny on the multiple occassions that I have seen it. I like the idea of the living SAT's with the fate of word problem person A and B resting on Marlo's selection of answers. I like the running gag about admitting a pig among the admissions officers. Despite the fact that the actors are too old to play teenagers except Oliver and Wanda it is a nice little movie about kids stuck in a nerve wracking situation hoping to just make it through things.".

For Marlo Parker it's going to whatever school his dream girl Jessica Flynn Boyle is going to. For Oliver it's giving into the white line fever and experiencing life Jack Kerouac style with the possibility of meeting renegade game show hostesses on the side. But for most of the students in the movie it is all about getting into college. We see the whole bit of it taking the SATs college recruitment day college prep programs and the dreaded admissions interview.

But it does send a positive message loud and clear. It says that if you want something bad enough you can make it happen with some hard work and a bit of luck. It does so in a basic way but nonetheless it makes the point.The movie itself is not filled with huge memorable laughs. There are some common and lame gags helped along by some big talents like Anthony Edwards and the late great Charles Rocket. But what the movie lacks in classic moments it makes up for in interesting and sometimes twisted moments that leave you smirking. It is not a laugh fest but it is a smile maker that will make you chuckle at times.The movie also has a lot of visual gags that often escape attention the first time around. You can see the subtle Better Off Dead ties all over the place in style and of course the several actors that were on both movies. The two movies do not really compare beyond that.Lara Flynn Boyle is as lovable as she ever has been in this role. Her portrayal of the AllAmerican loved by all High School girl is well done. She and Corey Parker pull off a believable chemistry as this is probably his defining role. Parker is a good underdog without being an underdog. Its never hard to believe that his character could pull off the things he does by winning over the Prom Queen or getting into the college of his dreams.All in all this movie is a lot of fun and deserves some props. If you like goofy and fun movies you will like this one. If you are looking for Oscar caliber entertainment you will not get past the first scene anyway so you won't care.".

It's quite as good as if not a cut above a lot of the teenhigh schoolcollege movies going around theaters in the 1980s. I hoped it might be a wacky satire on the struggle to get into college  a kind of Johnny Be Good with laughs and biting satire which JBG lacked.Instead the movie is a comparatively straightforward effort from Holland perhaps because he was not the original director but inherited a mess from someone else.Corey Parker makes an engaging lead. He lacks the aplomb of John Cusack Holland's previous star but he does a good job as a guy who is unlikely to get into either the college or the girl.The girl is played by Lara Flynn Boyle Twin Peaks in a surprisingly funny role. The girls in movies of this ilk usually are the ones who have it together. In How I Got into College Boyle's character starts off having it together but it starts coming apart early and only gets worse.Anthony Edwards Revenge of the Nerdsis a disappointment . It's not really his fault. He's stuck with a blah role that comes off blah. There isn't much he can do but play it straight. The cast surrounding Edwards including Charlie Rocket playing one of his patented jerks does not often interact with the rest of the characters in the film. A subplot involving Tichina Arnold is rewarding but too serious for anyone expecting an inkind followup to Holland's previous movies.The biggest disappointment is that the snooty exclusive college comprising the hub of the picture is treated with reverence. A place like that might have been ripe for Holland's brand of satire. The movie might have been even better if it revealed the small college as a cliquish club and represented the struggle to make it as ultimately futile. Instead entry into the club is treated as a prize worth winning.Still the movie has lots of humorous touches whether from the writers or from Holland. A marathoner puffing on a cigarette while he runs. Curtis Armstrong a Holland regular as a Biblecollege spokesman warning targeted to be offensive to religious sensibilities. And the whole preppygirl story arc. Oh and Phil Hartman in a tiny role. And the biggest laugh I got came from the payoff about the girl with the orthodontic headset.If you've seen Mr. Holland's opuses Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer and hope for more of the same you're mostly out of luck. This is a relatively intelligent seriocomedic treatment of the struggle of teens to find an institution of higher learning which occasionally deviates into unexplored Savage Steve territory.".

In contrast to the picture that many American movies e.g. Hannibal paint of a serialkiller as an evil being who kills for pleasure these German movies show men who are helpless victims of their urge to kill to which they succumb not when they want to but when they 'have' to. Mario Adorf plays Bruno as such a man and his performance is of the same rank as Peter Lorre's in M or Gtz George's in Totmacher IMO. Even better is Hannes Messemer as an SSOfficer who for 'political' reasons wants another man executed against better judgement. The main forte of the film however is the depiction of everydaylife in the last years of the third Reich. In the scene where the ugly harvest helpers get their reward from a sweating hangeron Robert Siodmak perfectly captured the moral corruption thinly veiled by empty propaganda phrases within NaziGermany.

	schema:headline " A Different Kind of Nazi Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Siodmak is a director I admire who isn't very famous today. However I enjoyed The Killers so much I didn't hesitate to watch The Devil Strikes At Night. This 1958 thriller which Siodmak made after returning to Germany from Hollywood is a fascinating exploration of the political manipulation of justice and the corruption of values in Nazi Germany.Bruno Luedke an ordinary handyman doing odd jobs for food cigarettes and booze is a serial killer operating for the past eleven years the movie opens in 1944 which means he began his murder career in 1933 the same year the Nazis rose to power. At the beginning of the movie he kills a woman during an allied bombing and steals her purse. The victim's lover is charged with the murder.But Commisair Axel Kersten freshly arrived fro the front begins investigating the murder and decides that the suspect is innocent not only that but he quickly traces the murder back to Bruno and connects him with several other cases. It should be noted that this movie isn't CSI there aren't intense scenes of investigation. Bruno is not a bright person and places himself under the police's attention by his own mistakes. He's captured halfway through the movie.What makes this stand out is what happens after Bruno is captured. At first the case gets the attention from the SS officer Rossdorf who hopes that the killer by being branded as a madman will allow them to pass a law to enforce eugenics. However the triumph of the capture soon becomes an embarrassment for how could a murder have been operating for eleven years in the Third Reich without being captured? That's intolerable since it makes the Nazis seem ineffective and weak.The only solution is to find a scapegoat for the murders an innocent man to be charged with the recent murder while the previous ones and Bruno Luedke are forgotten erased from official history.Reflecting about this movie I'm reminded of CostaGavras' Z. Both follow a decent man trying to ferret out the truth amidst political interference. Even the structure of the story is identical a crime an investigation the illusory triumph of the truth and then a punch in the viewer's stomach as the truth is torn apart.Besides dealing with fascinating themes in a sensible way this movie also deserves credit for the portrayal of Nazis. These are still the '50s and Hollywood continues to portray them as onedimensional soldiers in the war theater. This movie is perhaps revolutionary for removing the Nazis from the field of battle and showing them at work in urban settings something mainstream wouldn't do until the '70s exploring the socialpolitical implications of Nazism.Axel Kersten for instance is a very likable man concerned with truth and justice and always in conflict with the SS. Rossdorf although he's the mastermind behind the hush up is never portrayed as a onedimensional sadist or moron just as a corrupt politician who's concerned with public order. Although not much of their backstory is explored one feels there's more to them that they have lives outside the screen.Claus Holm and Hannes Massemer give good performances and make their characters human and rounded. But the best performance in the movie surely belongs to Mario Adorf playing the serial killer. Seldom have we seen such an unglamorous portrayal of a serial killer in cinema he's not the erudite charming Hannibal Lecter we love but an ordinary simpleminded man who acts on horrible impulses and yet retains a childlike innocent that makes his behavior all the more disturbing.Robert Siodmak may not be considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all times but for me he's a very good director who deserves to be rediscovered and enjoyed by viewers from all the world.".

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Siodmak is a director I admire who isn't very famous today. However I enjoyed The Killers so much I didn't hesitate to watch The Devil Strikes At Night. This 1958 thriller which Siodmak made after returning to Germany from Hollywood is a fascinating exploration of the political manipulation of justice and the corruption of values in Nazi Germany.Bruno Luedke an ordinary handyman doing odd jobs for food cigarettes and booze is a serial killer operating for the past eleven years the movie opens in 1944 which means he began his murder career in 1933 the same year the Nazis rose to power. At the beginning of the movie he kills a woman during an allied bombing and steals her purse. The victim's lover is charged with the murder.But Commisair Axel Kersten freshly arrived fro the front begins investigating the murder and decides that the suspect is innocent not only that but he quickly traces the murder back to Bruno and connects him with several other cases. It should be noted that this movie isn't CSI there aren't intense scenes of investigation. Bruno is not a bright person and places himself under the police's attention by his own mistakes. He's captured halfway through the movie.What makes this stand out is what happens after Bruno is captured. At first the case gets the attention from the SS officer Rossdorf who hopes that the killer by being branded as a madman will allow them to pass a law to enforce eugenics. However the triumph of the capture soon becomes an embarrassment for how could a murder have been operating for eleven years in the Third Reich without being captured? That's intolerable since it makes the Nazis seem ineffective and weak.The only solution is to find a scapegoat for the murders an innocent man to be charged with the recent murder while the previous ones and Bruno Luedke are forgotten erased from official history.Reflecting about this movie I'm reminded of CostaGavras' Z. Both follow a decent man trying to ferret out the truth amidst political interference. Even the structure of the story is identical a crime an investigation the illusory triumph of the truth and then a punch in the viewer's stomach as the truth is torn apart.Besides dealing with fascinating themes in a sensible way this movie also deserves credit for the portrayal of Nazis. These are still the '50s and Hollywood continues to portray them as onedimensional soldiers in the war theater. This movie is perhaps revolutionary for removing the Nazis from the field of battle and showing them at work in urban settings something mainstream wouldn't do until the '70s exploring the socialpolitical implications of Nazism.Axel Kersten for instance is a very likable man concerned with truth and justice and always in conflict with the SS. Rossdorf although he's the mastermind behind the hush up is never portrayed as a onedimensional sadist or moron just as a corrupt politician who's concerned with public order. Although not much of their backstory is explored one feels there's more to them that they have lives outside the screen.Claus Holm and Hannes Massemer give good performances and make their characters human and rounded. But the best performance in the movie surely belongs to Mario Adorf playing the serial killer. Seldom have we seen such an unglamorous portrayal of a serial killer in cinema he's not the erudite charming Hannibal Lecter we love but an ordinary simpleminded man who acts on horrible impulses and yet retains a childlike innocent that makes his behavior all the more disturbing.Robert Siodmak may not be considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all times but for me he's a very good director who deserves to be rediscovered and enjoyed by viewers from all the world.";

Siodmak's apprenticeship at the tailend of the German Expressionist movement serves him in good stead with respect to the film's shadowy visuals that said a social commentary was clearly intended a' la Fritz Lang's M 1931 this greatest of all serial killer films also emanating from Germany is the obvious model here  but apart from its occasional jabs at the Third Reich the impact is curiously muted. As with Lang's masterpiece the murderer's identity is immediately revealed to us he is well played by future EuroCult regular Mario Adorf  his activities being also similarly counterpointed by the authorities' attempts to capture him.The film in fact falters where Lang's found its greatest inspiration there is no diatribe here by the culprit as to his helplessness in committing these heinous acts against others who did wrong out of choice. Rather Adorf plays up his character's mental deficiency in his defense and  disappointingly  no relation is really made between an individual i.e. minor crime spree and the genocide being perpetrated in the name of racial superiority by the German people!

It was a huge success and apart from dominating the German Film Awards it also managed an Academy award nomination but came short against the Fellini entry. Robert Siodmak was already an Oscar nominee for Best Director himself and he is probably the star here. However the cast includes many established and successful German actors as well even if all of them are not known anymore to movie audiences today. With one exception. This film was maybe the breakthrough performance for young Mario Adolf considerably over 80 today. He plays a serial killer in this movie who is hunted by the protagonist a police officer.The film takes place during the years of World War II so justice may not be exactly what you'd expect but what Nazis thought it would be in compliance with their Weltanschauung and ideology. Eliminating the weak was not a problem back then actually it was necessary. But even with all the political context that was obviously loved by the allied forces at this point as it showed them Germany was coming to terms with their guilt and elaborating what went wrong exactly I must say the best part for me was when the film was an apolitical crime thriller when we have a cop try to catch a dangerous killer when only he sees that thy caught an innocent man. To me personally this is an example of a quality blackandwhite film from Germany way past the silent film era. The acting was good by everybody involved even if I did not really see Dringer as lead or awardsworthy. I recommend watching this film here especially if you love the genre or films about this specific political era. Tense from start to finish. Go check it out.".

When a brilliant detective puzzles together evidence from outstanding murder cases leading to Bruno he instantly gains the respect and confidence of the man who turns out to be responsible for some 80 murders. To see the naive Bruno freely confess and cheerfully reenact one of the killings shows how an insane or mentally deficient mind is incapable of grasping the gravity of taking a human life. Now are we to compare Bruno to the countless Nazis who convinced themselves that they were just following orders when they participated in genocide? This film is one of many powerful cinematic indictments against the Nazi Regime and an appeal to the human conscience not ever to idly look on as fellow human beings are wrongly accused convicted and even murdered by a corrupt and unfair justice system.Nominee for Best Foreign Film Oscar which went to Fellini's Nights of Cabiria that year. The latter will always be my favorite foreign film however Nachts wenn der Teufel kam is a formidable contender for the Oscar! Highly recommended!".

Gal Ray Winstone is a retired English gangster living a life of leisure at his Spanish villa. Then one day his idyll is shattered by a visit from Don Logan an old protg and man to be feared. Logan's intent is to lure Gal out of retirement for 'one last job'. Gal wants nothing to do with it and the first half of the movie is a battle of wits between the two men. The second half of the film deals with the heist and its aftermath.  The crime is downplayed in the movie which is primarily a psychological exploration of these gangsters their personal demons and the relationships amongst themselves. They are indeed scary people no sympathetic characters here.This is one of the best movies of 2000 and is highly recommended. I don't understand how IMDb reviewers can rate this movie so low. In my book it definitely rates an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Sexy Beast' Ben Kingsley delivers a bonechilling performance as the man everyone loves to hate a role for which he earned not only universal critical acclaim but a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination as well.  Don Logan is so evil that even his fellow mobster buddies fear and hate him. From our very first glimpse of him highstrutting his way through an airport terminal Kingsley hits just the right note for his character.  Cleverly writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto have paved the way for this entrance by introducing Logan ahead of time in a series of conversations in which just the mere mention of his name sets off portentous reverberations amongst the people discussing him.Chief among those people is the film's protagonist Gal Logan's retired' expartner in crime who wants nothing more than to be allowed to enjoy life undisturbed in his seaside Spanish villa with his swimming pool and the wife he loves so dearly.  But Gal soon discovers that a person cannot escape his past forever when Logan suddenly shows up at his doorstep demanding that Gal join his own personally handpicked gang of seasoned criminals whom Logan has brought together to pull off a major heist back in Merry Olde England.  Gal would like nothing better than to send Logan home packing empty handed but he also knows that defying Logan can be the fastest route to an early demise.  It is this atmosphere of fear and dread that director Jonathon Glazer uses to make Sexy Beast' such an engrossing and off beat little crime drama.  In fact it is the THREAT of violence far more than the violence itself which distinguishes this tale.  Without the use of weapons of any kind Logan is able to cow and terrorize a roomful of reasonably fearless adults simply by his steelyeyed demeanor and the unpredictable nature of his temperament.  Seemingly controlled and rational one moment he can suddenly erupt into a volcano of exploding anger the next.  One of the most chilling moments in the film occurs aboard a departing airplane in which Logan refuses to douse his cigarette thereby precipitating a confrontation with the flight crew.  Logan has that quality that distinguishes all great villains  he throws us back on our heels by his refusal to conform to the social amenities that the rest of us simply take for granted and which put us at a decided disadvantage when faced with the evil characters of the world who know no rules and flagrantly disregard the ones we follow.  He reminds us of how weak and vulnerable the rest of us really are.Logan for all the intensity generated by his character is not however the focal point of the film.  Gal brilliantly played by Ray Winstone who provides a fascinating counterpoint to Logan's noholdsbarred villainy occupies that position.  Despite his criminal background Gal wins us over by his openhearted frankness his sincere devotion to his wife friends and neighbors and his obvious desire to lead a straight life from hereon out. Winstone underplays his scenes superbly yet he never allows himself to be acted off the screen by the fiery Kingsley.  One should mention that the heavy cockney accents of the characters make what they are saying a bit incomprehensible at times. As is not uncommon in gangster movies these days Glazer manages to inject an element of black humor into the proceedings.  The comedy often takes the form of twisted surrealism such as when a giant boulder rolls down a nearby hillside and lands plop in Gal's beloved pool barely missing taking Gal to the bottom with it.  The filmmakers also have an effective way of heightening the tension through indirection particularly in the early scenes which prime us to dread Logan's entrance as much as the characters who don't want to see him  and we haven't even met him yet.  This technique of telegraphing information ahead of time contributes immensely to heightening the suspenseful quality of the film.Sexy Beast' provides superb performances a nasty sense of humor and a fascinating glimpse into the dark side of human nature.".

And at less than an hourandahalf it's even more watchable. It also is a good idea to play this with the English subtitles on unless you can understand the strong British accents and can interpret the slang words.Ben Kingsley as sociopath Don Logan is unbelievably intense and almost has my jaw dropping when watching him in here. Intense doesn't even begin describing this guy. Ian McShane is another creepy guy in here as Teddy. These two guys make the lead characters two couples look normal. Those four are retired crooks and their wives now living the easy life in Spain. Easy that is until Logan arrives and wants one of them for another job. The retiree wants to stay that way but Logan is not a man who takes no for an answer.This is one movie you will not forget. Warning it's rough crude and strange. Expect a lot of f words and c words.

	schema:headline " Ben Kingsley is worth the rental price alone!";
	schema:reviewBody "To put it simply  I love this movie!  I've really been looking forward to this movie mostly because of Kingsley's acclaimed performance.  And he is indeed brilliant in the role of the brash uninhibited shamelessly ruthless Don Logana role that should go down in history.  I haven't seen Jim Broadbent's performance in Iris so I can't technically say if Kingsley deserved the Oscar over him but I'm glad he got nominated because it would be an abomination if he didn't.  Kingsley is absolutely terrifying not showing a bit of remorse.  And it's a real joy to see the man who's famous for playing the wellknown pacifist Gandhi take on a role which requires him to spout the f word 500 times in one whole minute.  OK I may have been exaggerating there but believe me...there are scenes in this movie that make Pulp Fiction look like a Grated Disney feature.  Let's just say I've never heard the f word used so many times at such a lightningfast pace. Kingsley has some memorable moments including one where he gets in trouble for smoking on a plane and cops an alibi involving the male flight attendants sexually abusing him.  As cruel as he is I found myself laughing hysterically at Don.  As Kingsley said himself Don is the type of character who says the kind of things that are on most people's minds but they're too afraid to let it out.    Though Kinglsey steals the film Ray Winstone is the star and he's also great.  I haven't seen a great many English films so I don't remember seeing him before but now I hope to see him in more films.  And I was impressed to find out the movie was made by a firsttime director.  Jonathan Glazer did a terrific job creating a gloriously frenetic pace.  The running time is a succinct 85 minutes and the film never takes a breath.  It always captures you with inyourface images.  Glazer's sense of style is amazing. Not to mention the soundtrack is excellent.  It's a nice irony  how this dark comedy ends to the tune of Dean Martin's Sway. On my first viewing it took time for me to get accustomed to the cockney accents but after approximately 30 minutes I was able to decipher most of the dialogueand the film has some great memorable dialogue!  It's not like with Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels where I can watch it 100 times and still need subtitles.  Not to mention Sexy Beast is a much more entertaining film.  All I can say is don't expect an intricate plot with many twists and turns. The plot is all pretty simple  Retired gangster lounges around his beautiful house in Spain then gets persuaded into doing one last heist. I'm sure that sounds very familiar.  But the beauty is in its simplicity. And the film isn't in any way pretentious.  It is what it isand what it is is a smart energetic entertaining hilarious extremely wellacted dark comedy.  My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one fascinating dark little film. Supported by fierce cinematography black humour chilling characters and strong language 'Sexy Beast' works on many levels. It can be viewed as a conversational film a study of characters and a psychological thriller. The writing is brilliant as some of the dialogues induce both humour and chill. The screenplay is pretty tight leaving no place for loose ends or irrelevant subplots. Glazer's direction is wonderful as he keeps the viewer engaged throughout the entire 90 minutes and effectively infuses wicked humour and suspense. The characters are so interesting while we hate Logan we sympathize with his counterfeit Gal who is a retired gangster trying to live a straight life with his family and loyal friends. Logan desperately wants him to do a job but Gal bravely yet hesitantly turns it down. Logan won't give up and even he notices that everybody hates him which is beginning to make him feel powerless. The cast deliver solid performances. Ray Winstone is amazing. He easily conveys Gal's complexity and dilemma with pathos. Ben Kingsley as the hatefully irritating and intimidating Logan is superb. Ian McShane is scary. Amanda Redman is electrifying in a smaller role. 'Sexy Beast' is one slick wicked little film. Not a movie for everyone but worth watching for those who enjoy black humour and dark cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first I was a bit disappointed after watching the film due to the misleading trailer and the expectations I had. Sexy Beast is at it's core a romance not a comedy and definitely not an action flick. It's all about Gal trying to protect his life and his marriage. After finishing a nine years stretch courtesy of Her Majesty's prison Gal has had enough of a life of Crime and Punishment and settles down at the Spanish Riviera with his beloved expornstar wife and another couple. Together with a local Spanish boy who helps Gal around the house they seems like a family living a peaceful and happy life far from dreary England and their equally dreary past. Enter psychotic Don Logan who tries to persuade Gal to do one last job. I think the plot can be interpreted symbolically the boulder crashing into Gal's pool missing him just by a few inches yet shattering the two hearts pattern on the pool's basin symbolizes the arrival of Logan. Logan is just as menacing deadly and uncontrollable as nature endangering the love between Gal and his wife DeeDee. He's a part of Gal's criminal past coming to haunt him the violent and antisocial part of himself he's been suppressing so long notice how meek Gal is? Gal's Id. Logan taunts Gal what a wuss he has become how fat and lazy he's become how low he has sunk by marrying an expornstar that he deserted Logan some of Gal's own thoughts deep down?. He's trying to snatch Gal away from DeeDee he doesn't want him to be happy Gal I'm happy now. Logan shouting I won't let you be happy why should I!. Interestingly enough as soon as Logan arrives at Gal's villa the Spanish boy leaves so the boy could be interpreted as Gal's innocent and peaceful side. SPOILER AHEAD! So when Logan beats down the kid i.e. Gal's evil side is gaining upperhand over his good side it's DeeDee that makes the final decision and saves their marriage by killing her rival for Gal's soul in between Logan's vitriolic rants he tells Gal he loves him. Everyone partakes in Logan's murder except for Gal and the boy meaning that all of Gal's friends want to get rid of that part of him? In essence it's all about Gal's psychomachia i.e. having to take sides either going back to a life of crime and violence or saving his marriage and his happiness. On that level it was quite enjoyable. Ben Kingsley portrays Logan disturbingly menacing the mirror scene! Ian McShane as kingpin Teddy Bass is just as believable no Love nor Joy... and Ray Winstone reminded me of an Englishversion of James Gandolfini.".

Continuing where 'Performance' left off it even features James Fox this movie has standout performances from all of it's cast with Ben Kingsley as Don Logan producing the scariest badguy in cinema since Dennis Hopper's 'Frank'. Ray Winstone  Amanda Redmond are perfectly cast with Winstone flinching superbly from the terrifying aggression exuded by Kingsley and to a lesser extent McShane. Ian McShane does a lot to bury his lightweight 'Lovejoy' persona with an excellent menacing performance that contrasts well against Winstone's thin bravado but the honours here have to go to Kingsley who is simply stunning turning in a masterclass performance and proving once again that he is a topdrawer actor with every aspect of his character posture accent attitude finally honed and utterly appallingly convincing.Kingsley's scenes set the movie alight like the stunning airport sequence and of course the return to the villa and it would be interesting to know just how much of the dialogue comes from the excellent script and how much if any was improvised. These more aggressive sections are beautifully contrasted by the 'slower' character building sections which allow Winstone to display his charm to full affect.

One is the similarity they share in that you're not sure it's OK to be laughing at the content and secondly each film is in two halves changing pace slightly after the main characters die. Glazer has managed to add a touch of class though that Kubrick didn't. The second half of Sexy Beast is still charging and the flashbacks of Don dying keep the viewers pulse pumping. Ben Kingsley was born to play this role. He was robbed of the Oscar. Try watching Ghandi and this back to back then you'll see what a great actor is. One of the best of all time. Ray Winstone is also perfect and the two of them together compliment each other nicely like a kind of steroid and sun induced Odd Couple. Don Logan is absolutely frightening which I'd be able to notice more if I wasn't huddled over laughing so much every time I watch it. The scene in the kitchen with Gal in his dressing gown and Don firing into him looks like a very upset football coach voicing his disappointment in his star player. It's so impressive the actors don't look like they're acting and the fear on everyone but Don's face says this. Glazer's direction is stunning as is the soundtrack and production. This film is a masterpiece. Anybody who doesn't see that can go back to watching My Three Sons and listening to Neil Diamond ya ponce.".

All the performances are incredible most notably Ray Winstone Amanda Redman and Lovejoy himself Ian McShane but as everyone points out Kingsley just steals the show even when he is not onscreen.

	schema:reviewBody "Action black comedy and violence all figure prominently in this tense crime drama that illustrates brilliantly how a combination of stylish presentation good pacing and interesting characters can elevate a hackneyed plot into something special. Its story about an excriminal getting involved in one last job is told with great economy quirkiness and realism and the dialogue although heavily laden with profanities is sharp punchy and witty throughout.After a criminal career that ended with a prison sentence exsafecracker Gal Dove Ray Winstone has retired to a comfortable lifestyle in Spain's Costa del Sol where he enjoys living with his exporn star wife Deedee Amanda Redman and sunning himself by his villa's swimming pool. One day his tranquillity is interrupted when a boulder unexpectedly tumbles down the steep hill just behind where he'd been sun bathing and after missing him by the narrowest of margins comes to rest at the bottom of his pool. This scary incident turns out to be something of an omen as shortly after one of his old criminal associates arrives from London to try to persuade him to take part in a planned bank heist.The idyllic existence that Gal Deedee and their best friends Aitch Cavan Kendall and Jackie Julianne White had shared up until that point ends abruptly with the arrival of Don Logan Ben Kingsley. They're all terrified of this unhinged sociopath who they know from previous experience has an explosive temper and is capable of extreme violence. Gal doesn't want to get involved in any form of criminal activity again especially as he'd promised Deedee that he wouldn't. She's the love of his life and he's desperate not to break his promise to her but also fully realises the threat that he's under if he doesn't do what Logan wants. The exchanges that take place when they all meet are characterised by extreme fear on the parts of the four local residents and a whole welter of diabolical threats made by the foulmouthed Logan.A little while after the meeting at the villa Gal arrives in London where he meets crime boss Teddy Bass Ian McShane. He's the mastermind behind the plan to break into a safedeposit vault from the Turkish bath establishment next door and as Logan works for him he questions Gal about his recruiter's whereabouts. Gal tells him that the two men travelled back to London separately and claims that they'd spoken to each other by phone after Logan's arrival at Heathrow. Bass looks more than a little sceptical about this information but nevertheless the heist goes ahead as planned and after it's completed successfully Gal's anxiety remains at an almost unbearably high level until he gets back home with the intention of making a quick return to the life of leisure that he loves so much.Sexy Beast provides a very authenticlooking picture of the London gangster fraternity and conveys just how threatening people like Logan and Bass are. Ben Kingsley makes a huge impact as Logan whose raging and determination not to take no for an answer is incredibly unrelenting and makes any attempt at negotiation or reasoning totally impossible. Teddy Bass is more cultivated softspoken and suave but also carries an enormous threat as is clearly shown in some of the action that follows the heist. Ian McShane makes his character's viciousness absolutely convincing and Ray Winstone in a wonderfully sensitive performance does a great job of making his flabby gonetoseed excon into a really sympathetic character who's impossible to dislike. The quality of the supporting performances is also consistently top class.Amusingly the boulder incident that came so close to killing Gal at the beginning of the story also provides him with an important solution to his lifethreatening problem by the end of the story.".

Kingsley's performance was definitely oscar worthy. Logan is the scowling criminal who effortlessly tries to recruit a retired exthief in executing another score. Ray Winstone stars as the ex bank robber. However it was Kingsley who stole this show! The film does get a bit uneasy at times and its beast representation definitely was not one of beauty. But for what it's worth Sexy Beast' is Big Bad Ben's finest hour!  Average".

	schema:reviewBody "Gal is a safecracker now living in retirement in the Costa del Crime in Spain.  Safe from the law and living off the money he managed to put to one side when working.  When London gangster Don Logan calls a friend to offer Gal a job Gal intends to refuse it but is faced with telling him face to face when Logan arrives from London offering Gal the job in two days time. As the unpredictably brutal Logan pressures Gal more and more he is faced with the possibility of having to return to England for a job.I watched this several years after it came out in the cinema so I was sheltered from much of the hype.  I'm not a huge fan of all these new British gangster movies that are about of late as many seem to be in awe of Lock Stock' and just are happy to copy rather than innovate.  Sexy Beast really gripped me for the most part because it doesn't try to copy like so many others.  Instead it is very stagey rather than slick and energetic. The plot weakness is that it has nowhere to really go.  The job' itself is pretty pointless and the key moment that is meant to have us on the edge of our seats doesn't really work.However what does work is the majority of the film where Gal and Logan standoff to each other.  This is very dialogue driven but really works mostly because of Kingsley who rightly got an Oscar nod for this.  He drives the film with his brutal and unpredictable character.  Winstone is good but is almost a support character when viewed beside Kingsley.  The support cast are OK with Fox and McShane being interesting but underused castings.The fantasy scenes are imaginative and the film is very stylishly done without copying off anyone else.  It falls a little flat towards the end and the job' is not as exciting as one would have hoped  basically once Logan convinces' Gal to take the job the pressure cooker excitement is gone never to be replaced.  Up to that point this is quite a wonderful little find.".

From Don Logan.Enter Ben Kingsley complaining about a sweaty shirt and immediately you feel the first trickles of sweat on your own brow. Kingsley puts in a powerhouse performance as psychotic Don at his most frightening when most vulnerable talking to himself in the mirror about his loose mouth. Kingsley plays Don as childish intolerant moody and utterly utterly vicious. It is the role Winstone has made his own over the years from Scum through to Nil by Mouth and casting him on the receiving end is a nice ironic touch. It also allows Winstone to exercise his range more than usual and he does not come up short.The film inevitably flags when Don is absent but to the filmmakers credit the pacing of the final third is briskly done an awareness that McShane and Fox could not outshine Don.Overall it's partly a heist story but mostly a love story one man's attempt to cover for and get back to the woman he loves.The director's music video roots are for the most part used well in surreal dream sequences with a mutated rabbit though personally I could have done without the final underground shot that seemed to detract from the overall oppressive tone. A minor quibble as this film is a near perfect blend of tension humour romance dread and horror. Pretty much unmissable.".

It stars Ray Winstone Ben Kingsley Ian McShane Amanda Redman Cavan Kendall James Fox and Julianne White. Music is by Roque Baos and cinematography by Ivan Bird. Retired to the Costa del Chill Out retired thief Gary 'Gal' Dove Winstone finds his tranquil existence shattered when menacing gangster Don Logan Kingsley arrives on the scene demanding Gal goes back to London to do another job. 2000 saw a slew of British gangster films released. The success of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels opened the door for film makers keen to do their bit for Brit Grit. As is always the way quality varies but the class of 2000 had a healthy rate of good 'uns of which Sexy Beast is a proud operator. The story is very thin very film noir an ex bad boy doing one last job that risks everything he has settled down for but there's a panache to how the makers construct the tale. It helps that it's boosted by a ferocious performance from Kingsley who is given licence to unleash his dark half as he swears stares gets violent and has a general disregard for anyone but himself. Director Glazer in what was his film after breaking out from advertisements and music videos shows a keen eye for stylist visuals and attention grabbing scenes. He opens with an outrageous sequence of Gal sun bathing by his pool the sun burning down and then a giant boulder thunders into view and land in the pool! All set to the sound of The Stranglers single Peaches. Quite a way to announce yourself in film. The first half of film is the best set at Gal's Spanish villa Glazer neatly frames the characters Gal lives with his wife and his two friends from England live nearby as they bicker and cower in the shadow of Logan who wouldn't be beyond sending them all to hell if he doesn't get his way. It's sweaty and tense a coiled spring like atmosphere tells us something is going to give  and it does. The second half of the piece is not so tense or thrilling though the robbery has a whiff of genius about it but the pay off works well because Gal has earned our respect as has his fellow sun seekers. Sexy Beast is not just sexy tongue in cheeks for the makers it's beefy and brutal but also strangely beautiful as well. Nice. 810".

It is wonderfully shot and the sound track brings some humour. You believe the characters are real. their interaction is in some part Verite. Amanda Redman and Ray Winston you believe they do love each other and Winston would move heaven and earth for her. Ben Kingsley plays the psychopath so well he actually reminds me of a yapping dog who will stop at nothing to get the rat. His whole persona is you will!. Its as if he is outside his body when he is interrogating Winstons refusal to do this one last job. His appearance causes such fear he does not need to be violent. The locations are beautiful as a contrast the black evil that is coming to the villa. Winston in his huge size and kind face is n o match for the shorter yet animalistic Kingsley who if you've seen him in Schindlers list is a total contradiction for this amazing character actor. He sits there like a king not even making demands except with his body language not even saying anything about why he is there. Everyone should watch this film. The performances are so intense its as if even the film crew walk on egg shells. The shots are amazing illustrating the vastness that is Spain away from the grime ridden England that Ray Winston's character has escaped. Kingsley does not so much as request help but talks in the rhetoric that even Winston cannot refuse politely. Stuttering like a child Kingsley's voice is calm one minute and instantly becomes an evil entity in what began as a calm film about a man made good from a life of crime. Even Lovejoy himself Ian Macshane is in his element as a don. Stylish never shouting its like a folie a deux when they get together. I cannot praise this film enough its cool its scary its stylish. Not your typical gangster film but it has created a new genre of gangster film. Just superb. Ray Winston Ben Kingsley Amanda Redman Ian Macshane. we salute you are the cream of British cinema that we do not see as much as we should.".

Kingsley does not so much as request help but talks in the rhetoric that even Winston cannot refuse politely. Stuttering like a child Kingsley's voice is calm one minute and instantly becomes an evil entity in what began as a calm film about a man made good from a life of crime. Even Lovejoy himself Ian Macshane is in his element as a don. Stylish never shouting its like a folie a deux when they get together. I cannot praise this film enough its cool its scary its stylish. Not your typical gangster film but it has created a new genre of gangster film. Just superb. Ray Winston Ben Kingsley Amanda Redman Ian Macshane. we salute you are the cream of British cinema that we do not see as much as we should.";

Spain is depicted beautifully and makes you want to live Gals life. It doesn't help that London is raining or appears to be cold the majority of the time.All in all this is about being unable to run away from the past no matter how much you have or how far you go.

Nestled in the midst of the wine women and song are soliloquies that drive home a more positive message and none of those made it into this film in fact no significant chunks of actual text from HST's books appeared at all. It's like they shaved off the surface 50 of Thompson's work and discarded the rest.Compare this to Fear and Loathing which was darker and more countercultural and contained whole narrations excerpted from the novel.

Unless you have a pretty thorough knowledge of HST's work it won't make much sense and its comedic value will not be enough to make it worthwhile. However if you have read FNL on The Campaign Trail and Strange Rumblings in Azatlan then the movie will probably be of interest to you. One area where this film is far superior to FNL in Las Vegas is in its depiction of Oscar Zeta Acosta the attorney who is the basis for Carl Lazlo here and Dr. Gonzo in FNL. Acosta was actually a prominent civil rights attorney in the 60's and 70's especially in the Chicano community in Southern California. He also was a notoriously hard partier by most accounts. This movie does a much better job of capturing his odd duality than FNL does and Peter Boyle is quite sharp in the role  interesting to watch for those of you who only know him as the father on Raymond.".

His portrayal of HST is taken from life more realistic more from the man rather than from his text or the legend of HST. The whole film itself mainly because of Murray's characterization and the realistic structured style of the abrupt interconnected randomness of everyday life is infused with a undying sense of fun and love for words imagination writing and the whole creative process which seems to me to get more to the core of HST as a man than the various vignettes of Fear  Loathing.Where The Buffalo Roam is wildly entertaining frenziedly hilarious and immeasurably fun. But when the general viewing audience who presumably do not have a true passion for HST and his works views both films and are given the choice between the legend and the man they more often choose the legend which is usually the trend in history.Whereas Fear  Loathing In Las Vegas has a romance for the stories and the myth Where The Buffalo has a romance for the man and the process and both have it for his personal style politics and priorities.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both of the HST films have problems. This film's problem is that it is too screenwritten Lazlo replacing The Brown Buffalo Blast Magazine replacing Rolling Stone etc. and lacks the weird surrealism that a drugfueled observation of American culture at the end of the 1960s deserves if not requires.It does play a bit like Caddyshack as someone else pointed out and it's hard to get really invested in the characters. And if you love HST as much as I do you really do want to get into the characters and in to the story because it's as important as it is funny. Where the Buffalo Roam is for the most part silly. It comes off as more a bunch of sketches than anything else. I did like Bill Murray in the part.

Both movies hint at this but don't go into it enough in my opinion.Where the Buffalo Roam captures a little of the sadness and the creeping hopelessness of the early 70s along with an indication of the hangover awaiting that generation in the 70s but both movies fall far short of Thompson's books and writing in my opinion.I was particularly saddened that both movies left out the We're looking for the American dream bit at the taco stand because I think that was important and the FL Vegas story seems decontextualized without it in terms of having a fairly serious and sad point under all of the humor and excess.In any case both movies are worth a watch but ultimately unsatisfying. Thompson is still best read. I think a good film about HST can be made but the right person needs to be at the helm.Richard Linklater or John Sayles perhaps...someone who isn't going to miss the deeper substance underlying and buttressing the humor. That being said there are far worse movies you could be watching than either.And like Thompson it still hasn't gotten weird enough for me.".

	onyx:emotionText "Both of the HST films have problems. This film's problem is that it is too screenwritten Lazlo replacing The Brown Buffalo Blast Magazine replacing Rolling Stone etc. and lacks the weird surrealism that a drugfueled observation of American culture at the end of the 1960s deserves if not requires.It does play a bit like Caddyshack as someone else pointed out and it's hard to get really invested in the characters. And if you love HST as much as I do you really do want to get into the characters and in to the story because it's as important as it is funny. Where the Buffalo Roam is for the most part silly.

Credit where credit is due Murray does a fantastic job with Hunter's mannerisms but he makes the poor guy out to be some sort of silly cartoon character.

Now this of course is not Murray's fault since he didn't write the script and that is his one saving grace.Jack Kroll wrote in his review for Newsweek magazine Screenwriter John Kaye has reduced Thompson's career to a rubble of disjointed episodes and the relentless mayhem becomes tiresome chaos rather than liberating comic anarchy. Thats the truth right there. If you want to get a real in depth look at the man read some of the Gonzo letters. I recommend The Proud Highway. A dmn good documentary would be Fear  Loathing on the Road to Hollywood which can be found on the Criterion Edition of Fear  Loathing in Las Vegas a fantastic representation of Hunter and his work but thats for another comment board.Bottom line folks the movie is sht. It reeks of bitter 80's humor and brain dead writing. Bill Murray is a great actor but he should be ashamed of this film. If you are a true Hunter fan stay as far away from this film as possible because it degrades him to the level of a sloppy clown which he was very far from.This movie is for the ignorant Raoul Duke duke and the poor soul who sits in his room all day watching 80's movies and dreaming they could use Doc Brown's time machine to go back to a time where they were considered normal. Now take all that I say with a grain of salt. I've only taken one Film Studies course so I am no critic of films but I have read every single Hunter S.

It's not funny enough to be a comedy it doesn't seem to have any point to make  so doesn't work as satire  it completely fails to convey the insane savage  hilarious spirit of Hunter S Thompson's writing.Bill Murray while doing a pretty good impersonation of Thompson's voice  more pronounced mannerisms really just acts like Bill Murray with a cigarette holder sticking out of his mouth for the whole film. The angry driven borderline psychotic journalist is nowhere to be found in this film just a kind of goofy idiot that makes you wonder why anyone would bother to make a movie about him or why anyone would read any of his writing.Peter Boyle as attorney 'Carl Lazlo' a character better known as Dr Gonzo in Fear  Loathing In Las Vegas or as Oscar Zeta Acosta in real life is completely  utterly miscast. The reallife attorney was a fighter for human rights in the Chicano community who hung out on the fringes of the law the fictionalised Dr Gonzo of Thompson's writing was a far more dangerous drugcrazed perverted degenerate. 'Lazlo' is neither just a dull pathetic fool who thinks shouting his head off in court might achieve something runs off to hang out with arms dealers then turns up again with some idea about starting his own country in the desert.There is no plot to speak of just a loose collection of scenes that happen to include these two characters in some way none of which go anywhere at all. Thompson watching Lazlo in court Lazlo turning up again at the Super Bowl  dragging Thompson off to his ranch  finally Thompson covering the 1972 presidential campaign  Lazlo popping up again with a dumb idea. Then the movie ends. No mention of the reallife events which would actually have made a good story  Nixon's victory followed by Watergate or Oscar Acosta's mysterious disappearance  just the end of the film. It's not even an anticlimax which is often how Hunter S Thompson ends his stories to give them a realistic bittersweet edge it's just the end. Nothing of any real interest has happened  the film's over.I can't really recommend this film to anyone. If you're not a Thompson fan there's no reason to see it  if you are you'll just be disappointed.".

Other people with other expectations will hate it especially if they've never read HST or HAVE read HST and weren't impressed.".

This film directed by Art Linson is more straight forward than Fear  Loathing which was directed by the acclaimed actor and director Terry Gilliam. It's easy to find the contrasting points between the two because their approaches were very different. Where Fear  Loathing makes full use of Thompson's point of view in scenes filled with hallucinogenic ramblings and drug addled visions Where the Buffalo Roam tells the story in a more straight forward manner from the perspective of an outside observer. Though it lacked any of the grand stylization which Terry Gilliam's film had it did have it's own sense of atmosphere developed mostly by Bill Murray's characterization of Hunter S. Thompson  the court room only becomes bizarre after Thompson enters with a lit cigarette in his mouth and a Bloody Mary in hand.Peter Boyle's portrayal of the famous chicano lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta in this movie known by the name Carl Lazlo was a bit weak though it surpassed my expectations  who knew straight laced Peter Boyle who is most currently starring as the father in the tv show Everybody loves Raymond could even get an ounce of passion into this role. Or maybe I'm just holding him to the high standards Benicio Del Toro created when he portrayed Oscar Zeta in Fear  Loathing.Contrary to the great similarities I saw between Bill Murray  Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson they acted almost identically with Thompson's mannerism down expertly Benicio and Peter played Oscar Zeta in two very different ways. While Peter Boyle's Oscar was seemingly straight laced and subdued only loud when he needed to be Benicio's portrayal was of the drug addled out of his mind loud and crazy all of the time Oscar which after reading Oscar Zeta's two books Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo and Revolt of the Cockroach People seems much more appropriate. both books are highly recommended reading if you are at all interested in radical lawyering.All in all I would say this film does a pretty good job of telling a straight forward story in a manner that's easily understandable  enjoyable. But the underlying fact is that Hunter S. Thompson was a crazy drug addled mostly unintelligible man  which is why I preferred Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I would give this film a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " This movie should have been so much better...";
	schema:reviewBody "As others have stated here what we though we were going to get with this film was finally an epic film about the battle of Stalingrad on the scale of the likes of A Bridge Too Far  Unfortunately of the three big budgeted movies made of this battle The other two being the somewhat mishandled Enemy At The Gates and the Excellent German Stalingrad film this is the worst which is a shame as it had so much potential. A group of Russian soldiers find themselves hanging onto a junction house blocking the way to the river which they must defend at all costs and the Germans occupy the street across from them and continually fail to take it. The Russians all fall for the same girl Katya who is the only civilian survivor in the house. The German semisenior officer Kretchman finds himself falling for a Russian woman who reminds him of his dead wife. After a promising start the film settles into over stated Russian melodrama with a huge intrusive score bashing its way into almost every scene making the moments in the film when its actually needed less effective. The film is narrated by the off spring of one of the main characters but I can't but wonder if this was an after thought to actually fill in for the lack of character that everyone seems to possess. Any real meant to fill out the characters bones is really missing from the script and while the acting is not at fault here the blame must lay with the writing and over concept here. True by this time in the war men are reduced to all but shadows of their former selves and having them revealed to be more human in fragile moments works at times and is one of the films few strengths but its not enough to save the film from being predictable hollow and at times frankly boring. What is out standing about the film is the VFX and Production design which is really first rate. The costumes and details of the period are incredibly accurate and everyone looks like they have been through several years of war already. the look of the film feels great but this cannot save the films many weak points. The Germans are all fairly one dimensional bad guys while the Russians are a little more redeemable but most of their back story always comes in the form of narration and not in their actual actions or dialogue. Some of the characters are a little more interesting than others but on the whole they're a pretty forgettable bunch. The big ending is rather an anti climax and there is no real pay off other than we know someone survived and had a kid who went on to tell the tale of their five fathers being five characters in this film. Even though at one point there's clearly six but never mind! The battle itself isn't put into any kind of historical context in the film in terms of the impact it had on the war or the change of history that followed. I mean this might as well have taken place in Kharkov or Rostov save for the shots of the river it really could have been anywhere but we're reminded its Stalingrad because of some statues. Films like A Bridge Too Far The Longest Day and even the Historically inaccurate but far more watchable Battle Of The Bulge work because they tell the story of a large sweeping battle from beginning to end with and still manage to keep you interested with real characters and interesting moments. Here we have a film that can't make up its mind if its an action film or a love story  it tries to be both and succeeds at neither. A shameful waste as the talent was clearly there.".

Heroes behaves really strange and illogical sometimes. Very messy scene where commander made hysteric about killed German soldier who came for water. Even animals do not devour each other at the watering! he says. What? Hey director haven't you seen Animal planet?..So the good name for this film is Saving girl Katya but not Stalingrad. It's just a director's fantasies about THE WAR and how does he see it but there is nothing related to Stalingrad battle at all. Now we can easily change decorations and make film with same mental content named Berlin or Kiev because we could simply imagine the same war story anywhere. So why Stalingrad?..".

	schema:headline " Not the epic movie the trailers suggested";
	schema:reviewBody "When I seen the trailers for this movie I was gobsmacked. The superb VFX suggested an epic movie about the battle for Stalingrad. Great this was going to be like The Longest Day or one of the other huge classic World War II movies. After the initial opener set in another part of the world we get to Stalingrad. After some opening battle scenes which are very well done indeed the realization sets in that what looks like an epic movie is in fact one set around a square in the city and mainly on the now famous Pavlov's House. The events depicted are set before The Russians encircled The Germans so we don't get to see the sight of half starved Germans. The movie settles into segments where the Russian heroes all seem to be obsessed with gaining the attentions or affections of 15 year old Russian civilian girl Natashka who bravely stayed in her home despite the carnage visited on the city. The apparent intention of the movie to show a love story set in Stalingrad isn't properly thoughtthrough simply because the hero who eventually wins Natashka's heart is a bolt out of the blue with little in the way of cluingin the viewer as it develops. We are left disengaged and wondering what and why about this. Thomas Kretschmann plays German officer Peter Kahn whose main priority seems to be with a Russian woman Masha who reminds him of his wife who died in an air raid back in Germany. He literally puts aside all common sense and military discipline with his obsession for Masha. He defies orders displaying little interest in the battle and risking courtmartial and the firing squad. There are many good things about this movie. The VFX and sound are amazing absolutely first class and up there with the very best. The realism they crammed into the VFX just has to be seen and appreciated. The German Panzer tanks are in fact a single Russian T34 disguised as a Panzer IV and then replicated by the VFX team into several more Panzers. Others have mentioned that Panzer IV tanks of 1942 didn't have the protective metal skirts shown in the movie but to me that is nitpicking. The German aircraft flying overhead and the flak coming up at them is an amazing scene as is the one where we see a damaged plane coming in and crash landing in the square. The hand to hand fight scenes are very realistic. The period uniforms seem to be quite accurate especially the German ones. The general appearance of the uniforms is welcome and shows them grubby and dusty which makes a welcome change from the unrealistically shiny boots and helmets in the thick of battle that we see in many war movies. Great attention to detail has been given to this. We get some aerial views of the banks of the Volga and the VFX periodrecreated city damaged and on fire which is very satisfying. They give the viewer a tantalizing glimpse and feel of how close the Germans came to victory. While overall I don't think this was a bad movie at all I do think an opportunity to expand it more was lost. I watched this with subtitles and the quality of translation is pretty poor in places with small mistakes that I found annoying. There really is little excuse for this. For me the VFX team saved the day. Their work and that of the makeup people is a credit to them and helps make this movie visually better than it otherwise deserves to be. I am giving this movie a 7 as a mark of respect and appreciation for the work the VFX and makeup team did. There is a short about 9 minutes I think VFX Making Of on Youtube that I highly suggest watching as it shows how the VFX was done.".

The actors play way too fake the story is crap everything is so underlined that is as dreadful to watch as the 30s Soviet or Nazi propaganda or 40s US propaganda really bad too. And actually this is all about this movie propaganda and not even good or subtle Brestskaya Krepost was also quite propagandistic but still a good film anyway. For example SPOILER the first battle scene Russians charge undeterred while on fire burning to death but still attacking none the less while the Germans well entrenched and heavily armed with MGs just throw their weapons and run SPOILER END. Really? How could anyone think there are out there watchers so dumb not to laugh out at this? The characters speak mostly in slogans not like normal people and everybody is ridiculously stereotypic from the German officer to the brave devoted scout. My opinion? about 310 with 3 points for the filming at least the filming crew knew what they were doing unlike the writer or the actors. My advice? Go watch Brest Fortress Brestskaya Krepost2010 instead.".

The impressive German war movie Stalingrad 1993 is one of the best of the genre ever depicting the bloody Battle of Stalingrad. The Russian Stalingrad 2013 is not a remake of the German movie but a melodramatic and corny love story in the environment of the devastated city and heroic attitudes of the Russian soldiers.

No absolutely not it's a about a group of Russian soldiers who fought for some house in the center of Stalingrad but they were not fighting for their motherland or peace but for a single surviving woman who inhabited that house other inhabitants of the city lived in basements as the city was was under constant bombing and it was crammed with snipers.The movie is rife with meaningless stupid dialogs similarly meaningless voice over which revealed that the budget was ... scarce actions which defied common sense and any logic especially the laws of war.For reasons which are beyond any logic the movie tries hard to vindicate the Germans to show them as people who are similar to the Russians even though the former started the bloodiest war in the history of mankind and the latter were its victims. Who cares that the Germans employed genocide and ethnic purges?

	schema:reviewBody "Oh dear I expected to see some war actions like how the city was attacked on first days more changes of battle place more focused on time line of the greatest Stalingrad events. More passion in peaceful moments or some crossstory in nowadays would make this film even more dramatic. But this movie disappointed me. And this is why.This is a Russian film so expect to see much of unnecessary talks and quite a bit shots that tells you nothing at all. Russian acting is Russian acting  nothing new in this case except actors from abroad. So you have to deal with this funny and sometimes even irritating acting.The Story. Well movie starts from very strange actions in Japan and ends like that too. I didn't feel necessity of these Intros and Outros. Main action starts somewhere in the middle of the battle in the city of Stalingrad. Ban bang bang. Some awesome burning shots and then boom  action went away. And from there a love and revenge takes place. No big tragedies of starving or cold. I really missed the reality of Stalingrad. Instead you're given audio flashbacksflashforwards of main characters told by narrator. Blah blah blah. For what? Is it supposed to be documentary? I barely can say it's a movie about Stalingrad as the whole War Action. More like about one place particularly  House of Pavlov which in my opinion had too be the MAIN TITLE and not Stalingrad. But then you may think more deeply  as it goes around one girl  maybe it could be Saving civil Katya  ? Oh by the way you get even two love stories in this movie but none contains a lapdance or passion so it ruins the romantic side of the movie. The whole war strategy is a real mess here on both sides. I couldn't get it. It's not realistic to me somehow.Characters. Well their actions are mostly illogical as they fight for the love. They get outside without any commands given. Walking like a bosses in their own yard. Killing comrade from OTHER division for his thoughts about taking some action instead of sitting was also very strange behavior as it would get the killer to war court. And reaction of those folks after this nonsense just killed me. It was so unrealistic. There were other problems with logic in dialogs too.Technical side of the movie is done very very well. CGI effects and background are brilliant and I really enjoyed some of the action like tanks and mines scenes but it lacks of really fast intense action scenes of soldier fight seen in Band of Brothers The Pacific etc. Scenes that thrills you and makes you say  Oh man. War is a such a terrible thing. Slowmo scenes were... they were nice to see but there was way too much of it. And not in particular scenes in which slowmo would really make you to feel for the character. Like the main hero is looking around and feels confused scared in slowmo. No you won't get it here. Audio quality is outstanding BUT as always and this drives me crazy as hell  some dialogs are very quiet mainly problematic for Russian people.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seriously why is almost every scene in this movie using slow motion? This one visual trick screwed up the film's pacing and tension so badly that whatever else might've been there couldn't have saved it. Slow motion is usually used to amplify powerful scenes not to blanket the whole movie with it. It can obviously enhance a scene in a movie if used sparingly but the filmmakers really went comically overboard with its use in this one. The movie's laughably propagandistic sentimentality does it no favors either though I guess Bondarchuck's pal Putin might appreciate it Bondarchuck has publicly supported Putin's moves in Crimea and otherwise.The script and the dialogue were absolutely terrible and cringeworthy. Who actually speaks in those propagandistic terms? They also set up the characters so badly I could scarcely remember anyone's name and didn't care about any of them. They're ridiculous caricatures with no humanity behind them and their actions are illogical and baffling most of the time. The characterizations are so minimal you'd struggle to see them with a microscope. The setup in the beginning and the narration overall didn't work either I mean was that Russian aid worker really telling the story of the bloodiest battle in human history to a group of scared German girls trapped under ruins? Way to depress them even further. The movie wasn't really about Stalingrad either but about this hastily put together group of soldiers defending some random building in Stalingrad. You could've transplanted them to any other random battle and nothing would've changed. There's the Barmaley statue of the dancing children and boats crossing the Volga to remind you it's actually Stalingrad but that's about it. If they chose this as the film's context then the movie should've been about resilience and brotherhood but none of that was to be found. Instead the film's focus was on the explosions and slowmotion combat. Michael Bay would surely be proud. I have to say I did get a few laughs from the movie though. When the few defenders of the building suddenly decide to storm out of their defensive positions  la 300 and when a gun crew manages to bank a shell off the armor of a broken T34 to a German position around the corner I just couldn't contain myself. I don't think the filmmakers intended those scenes to be funny though so make of that what you will.".

Would have expected Fedor Bondarchuk to come up with something much more substantial taking into consideration the topic...";

Was there a story line? I don't know. I don't think so. It was guns and lots of shooting and these cartoonish voices spewing nonsense. The spoiler is that is sucked. There is no movie here. Any actor involved should be embarrassed and remove it from their resume. The director and producer should return all the money the received to the investors. This was purely an exercise to see how many preteen boys would rent this movie. You would think that a movie about WWII and a grand city as Stalingrad would be almost impossible to mess up filming someones notes from that era would have been enough to make a great movie.

Technically it is nicely done with great sets and realistic uniforms but unfortunately it has a tepid story unengaging main characters OK captain Kahn and Masha were somewhat engaging dull musical score and slow motion in Every.

	schema:reviewBody "Review contains some spoilers! I was hoping for a Stalingrad movie that was showed the hardship that both side went through as in the Stalingrad movie from 1993 but instead i got a love story in a war setting sprinkled with many heavy CGI effects.Even though these days it's not possible of course to get bombers flying over a city and shot down the movie hangs to much to the use of CGI and looks more like a showcase of what the company that supplied the CGI effects can do with their computers. It's like they made the effects first than made a movie around it. The movie also is heavy saturated with slow motion effects it felt like i was watching The Matrix in Stalingrad i don't mind slow motion but it was a bit too much to my taste. Do we really have to have someone standing up from a bed walking to her window in slow motion?They made a good use of their budget to supply realistic sets only thing that looked really out of place was the fake sprayon snow that seemed to stick to everything nobody in the movie seemed to notice it was becoming winter and it was cold if snow will stick to buildings and its surroundings it has to be below freezing point. The weapons used also look authentic but the battlefield looks very empty when both sides were fighting Stalingrad was the ground were the war turned for the Germans and Stalin had no intention at all to give up the city bearing his name. I don't know when the movie actually takes place but when the Soviets started their counter offensive they had over 1143000 personnel present. But seeing there is snow coming down in the movie this is either taking place before or after the winter of 1942. But still the movie made it looked like only a hand full of Russians held a entire street and only 30 Germans were fighting against them. But aside that the story evolves around a girl that is discovered still living in her house turned to rubble and is being taken care for by five soldiers the story is narrated by her son who calls the five soldiers his five fathers. Another story beside this is a German officer played by Thomas Kretschmann a German actor who has played in many more WW2 related movies like the acclaimed Der UntergangEnglish title The Downfall he has a so called love story with a Russian girl a storyline we pretty much don't care for at all.The rest of the cast is a pretty unknown cast the woman who plays the 15 year old Russian girl is heavily misscasted in my view she is suppose to be 15 but in real life she is 26 year old and doesn't look anything near below the age of 20. But she holds up in her acting and so does the rest of the cast. But back to the story the movie is pretty much 60 talk 40 action people with no patience will get bored quickly the dialogs seem to go on and on.SPOILER alert!The movie ends in what makes no common sense to me with the Russians calling in artillery on their position and everybody is dead except Katya the Russian girl. Instead they could have just called in the artillery and fallen back to another Russian held position behind them.But to be rap it up the movie holds on too much to it's really great looking CGI effects has too much dialog and a side storyline we couldn't care for at all. But the cast holds up their own when it comes to acting the sets look realistic and the weaponry used authentic. But the ending lacked something there is not even a single word mentioned about how the battle for Stalingrad eventually ended how many soldiers and civilians died there how it was the turning point for WW2 nothing! Just a big STALINGRAD in Russian in the screen.".

Meanwhile the German company commander spends most of his time attempting to woo a Russian girl who eventually of course he rapes. Instead of blowing the whole building up with tank guns these valiant Germans led by fools perpetually storm the building in their hundreds only to be shot down and blown to pieces by grenades cleverly thrown by the handful of Russians inside it. Women stand at doorways in a sniper zone just to say goodbye. The Russians perform Italian operatic arias instead of Russian folk songs whilst stupid Germans always lose their lives by endlessly pausing before pulling the trigger. But worse of all the script reads like a Stalinist message about the heroic struggle of the people against a ruthless maniac German machine that would enslave them for a thousand years. The real importance of Stalingrad as a symbol essential to win for both sides is never explained. And the ruthless sacrifice by the Soviet leadership of millions of their own people is never mentioned. Avoid this rubbish and stick to the original German version which is ten times better.".

If I see a title called Stalingrad I expect it to at least be historically accurate. This movie is not except for the fact the Germans lost. I could probably have endured if the movie was about a meteorite containing an alien mutagen that landed at a military base in Russia. This gave the soldiers superhuman powers and allowed them to go back in time to save a John Connor. Sorry it comes across as 60s propaganda so if you are into that? Well you will love the movie. The 1993 film was more correctly titled as was the recent film the Dutch made in 2003 as a documentary in 3 part TV series. Those are worth watching.".

I could probably have endured if the movie was about a meteorite containing an alien mutagen that landed at a military base in Russia. This gave the soldiers superhuman powers and allowed them to go back in time to save a John Connor. Sorry it comes across as 60s propaganda so if you are into that? Well you will love the movie. The 1993 film was more correctly titled as was the recent film the Dutch made in 2003 as a documentary in 3 part TV series. Those are worth watching.";

Meanwhile the first adaptation of the novel has remained obscure and hard to see.For those unfamiliar with the novel or its adaptations the story concerns a planet similar to Earth that is undergoing its own version of the middleages. A group of scientists from Earth are studying the planet. To do so they are living among the people as if they were natives. The scientists are to remain objective interacting enough with the King and his court to keep up appearances but not enough to upset the time period. When Don Reba a rising lord tries to seize power with the help of the church one scientist finds it hard to remain objective.The novel's two film adaptations take very different routes. Aleski German's 2013 adaptation is an art film very concerned with its ambiance. It places the viewer in an unknown world and forces him to decipher it much like a scientist. This results in a unique visually striking film but also an often inaccessible motion picture. On the other hand director Peter Fleischmann's 1989 adaptation is a far more viewer friendly film. It sets up its story and characters in a traditional and easy to follow way. The viewer does not need to be familiar with the source novel to understand the film something not always true of the Aleski German adaptation. The downside of this approach is that Fleischmann's film seems merely ordinary unremarkable.Fleischmann's adaptation follows the Strugatsky novel fairly closely. I don't remember the peasant revolt taking up so much space and it certainly didn't play into the climax. I was disappointed by this ending because the scientist Rumata never loses himself in the violence the way he does in the novel. An optimism shines through the ending of Fleischmann's Hard to be a God that is absent from both the Strugatsky and Aleski German versions.Another point of contention is that while the Aleski German adaptation seems timeless Fleischmann's film shows its era. The desert look and stone walled castles remind one of other fantasy films from that decade Krull Hundra. The hero in his white wig calls to mind Connor MacLeod in the Scottish scenes from the first Highlander movie. Finally the 1989 film has an illadvised ending theme song in English whose chorus bears a passing resemblance to Foreigner's I Want to Know What Love Is. Nonetheless the Peter Fleischmann film is a fair adaptation of the source novel. Fans of the book should be modestly satisfied. Finallyit should be noted that film director Werner Herzog appears at the beginning of the film playing an imprisoned scientist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hard to Be a God is a live action movie from 1989 so this one is already over 25 years old. It was a coproduction of 4 countries and one of them being West Germany turned this one into a Germanlanguage film even if dubbed versions exist of course. The director is Peter Fleischmann and he is also one of the writers from this film possibly his most known career achievement more than a quarter century later. Fleischmann will turn 80 next year. Basically you could say that this film is all about Edward Zentara as he plays the character who has easily the most screentime. Also for this late Polish actor it is probably his most known work and occasionally he looks like a Kinski with long grey hair. Christine Kaufmann plays one of the female protagonists and the reason why I gut curious about this film is Werner Herzog who also appears as an actor in here. Sadly he has very little screen time only and his character is much more talked about than actually seen.This is a science fiction film and I may be a bit biased as this is probably not my favorite genre but I still did not end up enjoying the watch. It is futuristic but yet also has a very medieval touch to it which is not too common for this genre. The sets and costumes were fine and so were the main character's looks which made the film occasionally interesting but I still felt that this was mostly style over substance. The story never had me even close to the edge of my seat. And what is even more serious is that the film is longer than two hours so if you will be bored as much as I was then you will be bored for a very long time. The dialogues also felt pretty pretentious with how the characters were talking. These 105 minutes I would really only recommend to the biggest SciFi fans who have seen almost everything else that this genre has to offer. Yes this one here is a bit of a different film but different does not necessarily equal good and here is the evidence. Thumbs down. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " A tale of familial jealousy greed and suffering directed by a master";
	schema:reviewBody "If Ingmar Bergman had been an adult in 1922 directing silent dramas in Germany Der Brennende Acker known as The Burning Soil in the U.S. is likely the sort of thing he would have produced. The themes of family rivalry and filial guilt are similar to the motifs Bergman would explore decades later while the somber atmosphere and bleak landscapes are so Bergmanlike I wonder if the young Ingmar might have seen it while still at a young and impressionable age. As it happens the director of this film was the legendary F.W. Murnau whose own cinematic apprenticeship was reaching its conclusion he worked on this project virtually backtoback with Nosferatu the first of a handful of works that would earn him a reputation as one of the great filmmakers of his era. Some may find it difficult to appreciate this comparatively conventional effort in light of Murnau's later achievements but patient viewers with a taste for sophisticated silent drama will likely find this film interesting and rewarding.Der Brennende Acker depicts two households that of the wealthy Count Josef Emmanuel of Rudenberg his daughter Gerda and his muchyounger second wife Helga and the Rogs a fairly prosperous farm family who live nearby. As the story begins the elderly Rog patriarch is dying attended by his hardworking son Peter. Meanwhile the younger and more worldly son Johannes rushes home but arrives too late to bid his father goodbye. At the Count's castle we hear the story of the strange looking structure on his property which stands on barren land known as the Devil's Field. It seems that an ancestor of the Count's believed the land held a treasure and sent his serfs down a shaft to investigate but one of their torches set off an explosion. The Chapel of Atonement was built on the spot where the men were killed. The present Count Rudenberg who like the Rog patriarch is also dying is obsessed with the subject and learns that the land sits on an untapped oil field worth a fortune.

Through the influence of the Count's attractive daughter Gerda he becomes her father's secretary.

Based on the plot synopsis it probably goes without saying that this borders on soap opera but it's not the story or the histrionics that make it intriguing. Actually where the acting is concerned the film is quite lowkey for its time aside from an unfortunate moment when Stella Arbenina who plays Helga indicates a state of high emotion by flinging herself to the ground. No it's something harder to define that kept me watching with keen interest a sustained mood of wintry melancholy perked by a number of understated but impressive directorial touches. There's business involving a document torn into little pieces that is poetic. When Murnau was at his peak in such films as Faust and Sunrise he would stage his effects on a much grander scale but here he manages to create a beautiful moment with a few torn pieces of paper. And while some viewers may be disappointed to find no supernatural element in a work produced almost concurrently with Nosferatu several scenes in the Count's gloomy castle have a uniquely eerie quality. When an old servant tells the tale of the Devil's Field to the younger maids the lighting gives the scene a ghostly aura nicely augmented when we see the Count in his study reading about the tragedy at that same moment. The conflict between the Rog brothers is more prosaic and yes somewhat soapy but the actors are good and their scenes are never boring. The ending feels a bit pat but dramatically necessary after all the high emotion of the fiery climax.In short Der Brennende Acker is a lesser but decidedly worthwhile drama by one of the silent screen's greatest directors. In this early work Murnau shows deftness in laying out a fairly complicated story with several key characters skill in drawing subtle performances from his actors and real artistry in creating and maintaining an atmosphere of foreboding that builds to a satisfying resolution.".

	onyx:emotionText "If Ingmar Bergman had been an adult in 1922 directing silent dramas in Germany Der Brennende Acker known as The Burning Soil in the U.S. is likely the sort of thing he would have produced. The themes of family rivalry and filial guilt are similar to the motifs Bergman would explore decades later while the somber atmosphere and bleak landscapes are so Bergmanlike I wonder if the young Ingmar might have seen it while still at a young and impressionable age. As it happens the director of this film was the legendary F.W. Murnau whose own cinematic apprenticeship was reaching its conclusion he worked on this project virtually backtoback with Nosferatu the first of a handful of works that would earn him a reputation as one of the great filmmakers of his era. Some may find it difficult to appreciate this comparatively conventional effort in light of Murnau's later achievements but patient viewers with a taste for sophisticated silent drama will likely find this film interesting and rewarding.Der Brennende Acker depicts two households that of the wealthy Count Josef Emmanuel of Rudenberg his daughter Gerda and his muchyounger second wife Helga and the Rogs a fairly prosperous farm family who live nearby. As the story begins the elderly Rog patriarch is dying attended by his hardworking son Peter. Meanwhile the younger and more worldly son Johannes rushes home but arrives too late to bid his father goodbye. At the Count's castle we hear the story of the strange looking structure on his property which stands on barren land known as the Devil's Field. It seems that an ancestor of the Count's believed the land held a treasure and sent his serfs down a shaft to investigate but one of their torches set off an explosion. The Chapel of Atonement was built on the spot where the men were killed. The present Count Rudenberg who like the Rog patriarch is also dying is obsessed with the subject and learns that the land sits on an untapped oil field worth a fortune. As so often happens this wealth bears a curse and brings only misery to all who come into contact with it.Tension mounts between Peter and Johannes the older brother bitterly remarks that his sibling has acquired worldly tastes and has no interest in farming. Through the influence of the Count's attractive daughter Gerda he becomes her father's secretary. Johannes and Gerda seem to be on the verge of an affair but when he learns that the Devil's Field is worth millions and that it will be inherited by the Count's wife Helga he turns his attention to her.

There is positive restoration by the end of the film that is rather jarring but this seems to be a favorite theme of Murnau's. Instead of restoration with the father as in the biblical story of the prodigal son we see the genuine restoration of the two brothers and forgiveness. We're not quite sure if the two brothers in the bible story ever truly reconcile but in Murnau's story it is clearly evident. If you are someone who enjoys Murnau's films definitely see The Burning Soil. Interesting story good acting overall good condition of the surviving film.".

It has been exciting to see SUNRISE and other of his films make it to DVD many in beautifully restored prints. It is also exciting to discover some of his earlier works and see the genius of this master filmmaker developing. That is certainly the case with his 1922 BURNING SOIL. Like a reviewer elsewhere on this site I felt that I was watching a work done by Ingmar Bergman. The story may be viewed as somewhat melodramatic but the directing acting and cinematography are for the most part quite stunning. It is frustrating to read about a film that you would like to see and not find it available to see so I am pleased to let anyone interested in seeing this early Murnau work know that Grapevine Video of Phoenix Arizona has released it. The picture quality is quite sharp and the tones quite nice though the print has a lot of specks. However coming from the only known print to exist I was more then pleased with the print. The orchestra score provided by Lou McMahon does not fit the mood some of the time but for the most part it adds to the watching of the film. If you are interested in obtaining this title then get check it out on www.grapevinevideo.com . Grapevine Video offers a number of silent titles that can not be found anywhere else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any film directed by F.W. Murnau merits attention but The Burning Field is one of his more turgid efforts. This film reminds me of God's Little Acre Giant Duel in the Sun and Dallas ... and the comparisons are not to this movie's advantage. Several scriptwriters are credited but I suspect that the soapopera excesses of this film's plot can safely be credited to Thea von Harbou whose heavy hand is all over the storyline.Most of the action takes place on a farm owned by the Rog family who give fealty to Count Rudenburg. In the role of the Rog patriarch the great actor Werner Krauss is nearly wasted. Krauss does a bogstandard death scene ... but then unexpectedly just before he dies he makes an ach forget it gesture with one hand neatly defining his character just as he expires.Old Rog has two sons who come dangerously close to the hoary clich of good brother bad brother. Modest Peter merely wants to work the farm. Johannes wants something more out of life. The most impressive thing about this film is how the character of Johannes is written and performed by actor Vladimir Gaidarov. It would have been easy to make Johannes a clearcut villain. Instead he's an opportunist and a manipulator and somewhat unethical but he never quite descends to outright criminality.Early in the film there's a brief flashback to an earlier period apparently the 17th century. When this movie was made in 1922 the fadeout and the dissolve were already established in film language as the transitional devices for flashbacks. Murnau doesn't use them here. Instead a shadow passes across the screen image almost like a primitive example of an optical wipe.Lya De Putti gives an excellent performance as the Count's daughter. De Putti has a reputation as an exotic screen vamp but she really wasn't very beautiful. Here her mouth is lipsticked into a grotesque cupid's bow and her eyebrows are plucked into a shape that's both too elaborate and asymmetrical with it. A closeup reveals her fingers to be short thick and ungainly. Yet when she strides across the screen in full riding habit and spurs haughtily pulling a pair of ridinggloves onto her hands while spurning Alfred Abel's advances  Excuse me. My horse is waiting.  she is very sexy indeed.The photography is excellent throughout. Several times we see the Rog family's house in long shot in the midst of an absolutely flat plain. This shot reminded me of a very similar shot in George Stevens's Giant. Later an oil derrick appears near the Rog house. Again this also happened in Giant. George Stevens was a brilliant director who didn't have to borrow from anyone else yet the similarities in these two films are so strong that I can't help wondering if Stevens was influenced by this film.Murnau's sure hand wavers just occasionally. At several points during this drama small objects coins the fragments of a torn document are dropped or flung to the floor. With one exception all of these moments are shown in full shot. They would have been far more effective if Murnau had inserted a closer shot of the coins rolling the fragments fluttering. During one exterior sequence while De Putti and Gaidarov are emoting in the foreground nobody seems to notice a little black dog running through the snowdrifts behind them. The dog isn't in the script but he's there anyway.Stella Arbenina gives a beautifully subtle and poignant performance in a sympathetic role except for one ludicrous moment when her character goes out into deep snow wearing highheeled shoes. The modest farmer Peter is played by Eugen Klpfer an actor I've never seen before. In closeups of Klpfer I was amused to discover that he had two small moles on his left cheek ... in exactly the same places where Lon Chaney also had facial moles. Klpfer wears heavy makeup in this role yet the blemishes appear to be genuine. Is it possible that Eugen Klpfer was actually Lon Chaney moonlighting under another name? Probably not. I'll rate this movie 7 points out of 10. The plot has many flaws but the photography and the performances and Murnau's direction go a considerable distance to compensate.".

The star here is the director Friedrich Wilhelm PlumpeMurnau who made this film when he was roughly at the age of 30. The cast includes a couple known names too at least known to silent film connoisseurs. Consequently the acting here was pretty decent overall but unfortunately the story was not really too interesting to me. There are three writers here including the famous Thea von Harbou and I cannot really say whose fault it is exactly that the film wasn't a memorable watch. I guess it may be a case of too many cooks spoiling the brother. All in all I would say that these 100 minutes are only worth watching for the biggest German silent film fans who have seen all the more known films from the era and by Murnau. But I personally do not recommend it. Thumbs down.".

Prodigal son Johannes Rudenberg returns to his father's death bed where the delirious old man fills his head with the legend of Devil's Field. Flirty Gerda Rog De Putti sets her cap at him even though her father has more profitable marriage plans for her  she even gets Johannes a job as her father's secretary. Meanwhile Helga Rog's younger wife has always loved Johannes but when acting as secretary he witnesses the old man's will and realises that Rog is bequeathing Helga the Devil's Field he ditches Gerda and pledges his love to the older married woman. Only Johannes knows the secret riches it has to everyone else it is just a cursed piece of barren wasteground  so Rog thinking the young man sincerely loves Helga and thinking her inheritance is pitiable gives his blessing. While Johannes moves behind the scenes to secure a deal Helga is desperately trying to sell the land so she will have something to offer Johannes on their wedding day. And find a buyer she does in Peter Johanne's dour brother who has made himself old and bent by staying on the farm  he buys the land because he feels pity for Helga and because he thinks the land will help him win Maria. He is out of luck there because Maria informs him that she has only taken the maid's job to catch sight of Johannes on his trips back to the farm.Money and power the two things Johannes wants most in the world are taken from his grasp and he turns on Helga revealing his true nature. Nothing ends well in this true tragedy except for Maria who realises with a hand clasp Peter's true worth. Johannes sees the light but at what an awful cost that this viewer hopes will haunt him the rest of his life.".

	schema:headline " God's Little Acre meets Giant.";
	schema:reviewBody "Any film directed by F.W. Murnau merits attention but The Burning Field is one of his more turgid efforts. This film reminds me of God's Little Acre Giant Duel in the Sun and Dallas ... and the comparisons are not to this movie's advantage. Several scriptwriters are credited but I suspect that the soapopera excesses of this film's plot can safely be credited to Thea von Harbou whose heavy hand is all over the storyline.Most of the action takes place on a farm owned by the Rog family who give fealty to Count Rudenburg. In the role of the Rog patriarch the great actor Werner Krauss wears an elaborate makeup but has little chance to display his acting talents. Krauss does a bogstandard death scene ... but then unexpectedly just before he dies he makes an ach forget it gesture with one hand neatly defining his character just as he expires.Old Rog has two sons who come dangerously close to the hoary clich of good brother bad brother. Modest Peter merely wants to work the farm. Johannes wants something more out of life. The most impressive thing about this film is how the character of Johannes is written and performed by actor Vladimir Gaidarov. It would have been easy to make Johannes a clearcut villain. Instead he's an opportunist and a manipulator and somewhat unethical but he never quite descends to outright criminality.Early in the film there's a brief flashback to an earlier period apparently the 17th century. When this movie was made in 1922 the fadeout and the dissolve were already established in film language as the transitional devices for flashbacks. Murnau doesn't use them here. Instead a shadow passes across the screen image almost like a primitive example of an optical wipe.Lya De Putti gives an excellent performance as the Count's daughter. De Putti has a reputation as an exotic screen vamp but she really wasn't very beautiful. Here her mouth is lipsticked into a grotesque cupid's bow and her eyebrows are plucked into a shape that's both too elaborate and asymmetrical with it. A closeup reveals her fingers to be short thick and ungainly. Yet when she strides across the screen in full riding habit and spurs haughtily pulling a pair of ridinggloves onto her hands while spurning Alfred Abel's advances  Excuse me. My horse is waiting.  she is very sexy indeed.The photography is excellent throughout. Several times we see the Rog family's house in long shot in the midst of an absolutely flat plain. This shot reminded me of a very similar shot in George Stevens's Giant. Later an oil derrick appears near the Rog house. Again this also happened in Giant. George Stevens was a brilliant director who didn't have to borrow from anyone else yet the similarities in these two movies are so strong that I can't help wondering if Stevens was influenced by Murnau.Murnau's sure hand wavers just occasionally. At several points during this drama small objects coins the fragments of a torn document are dropped or flung to the floor. With one exception all of these moments are shown in full shot. They would have been far more effective if Murnau had inserted a closer shot of the coins rolling the fragments fluttering. During one exterior sequence while De Putti and Gaidarov are emoting in the foreground nobody seems to notice a little black dog running through the snowdrifts behind them. The dog isn't in the script but he's there anyway.Stella Arbenina gives a beautifully subtle and poignant performance in a sympathetic role except for one ludicrous moment when her character goes out into deep snow wearing highheeled shoes. The modest farmer Peter is played by Eugen Klpfer an actor I've never seen before. In closeups of Klpfer I was amused to discover that he had two small moles on his left cheek ... in exactly the same places where Lon Chaney also had facial moles. Klpfer wears heavy makeup in this role yet the blemishes appear to be genuine. Is it possible that Eugen Klpfer was actually Lon Chaney moonlighting under another name? Probably not. I'll rate this movie 7 points out of 10. The plot has many flaws but the photography and the performances and Murnau's direction go a considerable distance to compensate.".

Honestly I thought it had a wonderfully intriguing plot good acting and I was completely engaged. Yes there was a bit of romantic cheesiness but it seemed to handle itself well and even poked fun of itself at times for this fact. I think if it wasn't for the excellent work of Niccol and Saoirse it might have easily slipped into laughable cheese but amicably doesn't. Plenty of sophisticated action as well as thoughtprovoking concepts of love loyalty perseverance. A well rounded film overall. I especially enjoyed William Hurt but all the acting was on par.Perhaps the Twilights were focused on teenagers but as a 30something guy I really liked it. I would definitely recommend giving this movie a chance to all. I'm just in the market now for a shiny silver Lotus.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie you will either enjoy or hate to be honest. If you want something that is actionpacked and filled with cool scifi moments do not see this movie. Yes the movie is scifi but it's more about romance. It also is a tad slower.However the cast was fantastic and the script was beautiful. There were cheesy moments but it was still really sweet and well done. Basically what I am saying is if you like romance with a twist go and see it! If you are expecting something like Gattaca you will be disappointed.I really loved the movie and felt it held up to the book. I usually hate movie versions of books but this was really good! If you like the book chances are you are going to like the movie. There are tweaks of course but I thought they were mainly well done and helped get the same message across.".

	schema:headline " SciFi And Kissing";
	schema:reviewBody "The Host has an intriguing conceit. It is about a postapocalypse where aliens take control on every human body then the remaining unpossessed humans fear them despite that these aliens only want peace. The story might have an idea that the humans could be the real enemy here or it's just both of them. The SciFi bits are pretty interesting but it doesn't end there. It's based on a young adult novel so definitely there will be teenage hormones scattered around the context. It has romance that is suppose to save their world and change their lives but once again just like any other young adult film the romance is nothing more than a bunch of good looking people falling in love and doing romantic clich stuff. Love may not be a problem to these stories but this romance is terribly empty. They're just making out and saying ridiculously cheesy lines. It would have been a fascinating idea but it just can't get away from its typical teen angst.It is kind of similar to the recent young adult novel based film Warm Bodies except the antagonists in The Host are virtuous beings instead of ravenous monsters. It seems that both stories have the same morality. Humans are not the most peaceful beings either and maybe the order and mentality of both sides are the reason why they couldn't get along. When it goes to the romance it says that Melanie and Wanda's love between the boys might revolt their world's condition. But it strays from its plot giving us a lousily told story and romance. Mostly the romance. It is noticeable that most of their love only rely on their lips. Which means they kiss a lot. We do not get to know much about why they care for each other other than being one of the last normal human beings of their age. It is also filled with plot holes because of course it wants to appeal teens for the endless love that didn't even work. It is directed by Andrew Niccol who is somewhat a SciFi expert but it looks like he's afraid that too much SciFi than romance might disappoint these children. He could have been more indulgent.The film has a solid cast but not all of them standout. Saoirse Ronan plays two roles here and she fills enough heart on both characters. Diane Kruger looks like she is enjoying playing the film's villain. The roles of Max Irons and Jake Abel seems to be only designed for kissing slapping and sometimes strangling leaving William Hurt being the only likable gentleman of the picture.The script explains some points of the concept which is fine in that way in spite of the plot holes but it gets terrible on the romance. There are dialogues that may get way out of hand ends up being laughable. Even more laughable is one scene when the protagonist tries to wake up her subconscious by kissing her boyfriend. I don't know if I should blame anyone about it. I mean what choice does she have? Still it's ridiculous. The film is at least stunning. It gets to explore something magnificent around. The exteriors serves a lot of intrigue to its world. It features shiny cars and choppers. Most of the action are well shot even though the action itself isn't really that interesting but everything in the film looks good.The Host is not interesting enough. It thematically talks about peace and stuff. Well you can make peace out of love but the film only shows kissing and I think there is more in love than just making out. Hormonally this could be a perfect escapism for teens. An apocalyptic world about relationships of these good looking couples with fast awesome cars crashing on the road. But the story seems to offer more. Again they are unable to show it because the only fan service for adaptations of teen books is to follow every single sequence from the book because they love comparing. Too bad they could have also shown what's behind the words as well. The Host is another victim of a generic young adult film adaptation that doesn't understand much of the meaning of the story and throw away the most bland of all romances.".

	schema:headline " A great opening is drowned by the next two hours of slow boring torture.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Host from Chockstone Pictures opens and closes with two scenes that contain elements of great science fiction. The problem is that what comes in the middle is one of the longest chunks of torpor you'll ever experience. This movie is so slow that after a while you fear that the movie will go in reverse. Some movies dare you to look at the screen. This one dares you to stay in your seat.To be sure the movie has a fantastic premise. Imagine what might happen to Earth after Invasion of the Body Snatchers ended. Aliens from another world called souls have come to Earth taken over our bodies flushed out both our personalities and our emotions and replaced them with their own. Imagine what happens if one operation doesn't go quite right. What might happen if the human personality was still inside a mind that had been replaced? That is the problem facing an alien host named Wanderer Saoirse Ronan. She hears a voice in her head the human voice of the person who previously occupied the body she has been given. The girl inside her mind is named Melanie who still has memories of her human occupation. Soon those memories are being shared with Wanderer. She keeps this information from her betters and goes on the run. You can already guess their response.This means we get to sit through a long series of laughable scenes in which actress Saoirse Ronan is forced to spend a lot of time talking to herself. We hear the alien speaking and then we hear the human voice in her head. This works when she thinks she is about to die but when Wanderer kisses a guy that Melanie can't stand it becomes ridiculous. Ronan is a fine actress who has been better elsewhere. Watch her sometime in Hanna and her Oscar nominated performance in Atonement. Here she's a real trooper pulling off dialogue that is  to put it nicely  utterly ridiculous.What develops from this plot isn't as ingenious as one might hope. Instead of exploring the possibly of this bizarre situation The Host becomes one of those old familiar lasthopeforhumanity stories in which characters stand around talking about the situation in long boring scenes of dialogue that should have remained on the cutting room floor. It opens with an effectively creepy leisure pace but then never picks up any steam. More on the plot will not be revealed here suffice to say that after that great opening the rest of the movie just kind of coasts.The Host was written and directed by Andrew Niccol who has a talent for creating smart inventive stories about people trapped by their circumstances. He wrote the great Gattaca 1997 about a naturalborn man trapped in a world of synthetic humans. He wrote The Truman Show 1998 about a man trapped in his own reality show. He made Lord of War 2005 about a man who confronts the moral implications of the international arms deals that he puts into motion.Niccol has some of those inspirations here but he is at the mercy of a script based on a book by Stephanie Meyers the popular writer of the Twilight series. This film as with that series is tilted toward something meaningful he can't seem to get the movie out of first gear. All of the characters look alike talk alike sound alike. They stand around and have long boring conversations about the same thing over and over and over and over. It's like the movie had a great launch and then spent the rest of its time driving around in a circle.".

Didn't have high hopes for it as I thought it would face the same fate as the Twilight series.. But I needed to see it to make the call...And I was pleasantly surprised! It stayed true to the book  of course they had to cut out some scenes otherwise it would've been very long  but I never felt like the cuts ruined the story.One thing I will really praise is the acting. Unlike most movies today I thought The Host had a great cast and never did the acting seem unnatural. Even the cheesy lines were delivered well. Props to the kid who played Jamie he made me cry! And Saoirse was brilliant in playing two personalities.Anyway I wrote this review my first ever IMDb review ever because I felt it was unfair that the movie was getting too much flak just for its relation to Meyer or Twilight. There are worse movies out there just relying on special effects and pomp to cover up the lack of plot and characterisation. See the movie or read the book first before you judge this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Outside of The Twilight Saga The Host is Stephanie Meyer's biggest novel and since the success of her supernatural series her scifi novel has been adapted. There is a stronger cast and director for The Host than the Twilight Saga but how does it fare on its own terms? In the near future Earth has been conquered by a parasitic alien race known as The Souls who implant themselves into human bodies. Melanie Stryder Saoirse Ronan is a member of the human resistance who gets captured when she tries to protect her younger brother Jamie Chandler Canterbury. Melanie gets implanted with a Soul called Wanderer with the aliens planning to use Melanie's memories in order to find the human resistance. As Wanderer explores Melanie's memories she finds out about Melanie's lover Jared Max Irons and the pair plan an escape to the desert to find the resistance camp. Within the camp Wanderer falls for another human Ian Jake Abel causing problems for all of them.Let's get the comparisons with Twilight out the way yes there is a is love triangle or should that be a love square? The Host has a much better lead actress with Ronan then Kirsten Stewart and has a stronger supporting cast with the likes of William Hurt and Diane Kruger. Andrew Niccol also gives the film more creditability behind the camera acting as both the writer and director. The Host has interesting ideas that had many potential avenues to explore but unfortunately it focuses more on the love story instead of all of the other aspects that could have lead to a much more meaningful film.Ronan does rise above the material and gives very strong performance as you would expect from her. This is even more remarkable that she has to argue and talk with herself like Homer Simpson arguing with his own brain. Whilst there was the potential for themes of locked in syndrome as Melanie is trapped inside her own head fighting to control her own body or going through a more literal internal conflict. But it turns really silly when she argues with herself over two men as opposed of having a much more difficult time of having a stronger conflict within her character. Ronan gets battered and beaten throughout the film as she gets hit verbally abused and discriminated against and yet still persevere through everything she's up against.Whilst Ronan does a good job the two men she is meant to be conflicted about are blank stales. Neither actor has much of a personality or character and they are very indistinguishable from each other. Ronan has no choice but to carry the film considering that there was nothing going for the main love interests. At least Hurt and Kruger looked like they were having fun with their roles and were highly professional with their performances.The idea of some sort of insider for an oppressive regime having an awakening usually because a love interest and ends up turning against their own side has been used before. We have seen it in novels like NineteenEighty Four Fahrenheit 451 and We and films such as Metropolis and THX1138. The Host does twist this age old idea in scifi even if the execution was lacking.The Host had a really strong premise with opportunities to explore multiple themes. They could have been themes about identity the battle within the mind split personalities trust and how humans would survive after this invasion. But like Twilight the film only touches on these concepts and puts all of its focus in the wrong places.Much like Twilight The Host has been criticised for its dialogue and being unintentionally funny. It is true that the film has some bad dialogue but with some of the moments that were comical that had be intentional with some of its moments of cultural clash and the bickering between Wanderer and Melanie. There are also some dark moments and there were really refreshing when they do come around.Niccol is known for being an excellent writer director making Gattaca and Lord of War and was nominated for an Academy Awards for his screenplay for The Truman Show. The Host is his first adaptation and it felt very rigidly close to the source material. What it results to is a bland experience that has episodic nature having miniplots with some developments instead of a larger overarching story. Looks wise the film is pretty flat and dull using nothing but silver chrome for the alien technology concrete and glass for the buildings and the humans are based in an empty desert environment. The cinematography and the special effects were solid but Niccol was coasting and he is much more capable then this.Currently on Rotten Tomatoes The Host has an 12 rating and seemingly on course to be considered one of the worst films of 2013. Whilst it is hard to argue that The Host is a good movie it is certainly not terrible its crime is merely being mediocre dull and forgettable.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com".

	schema:headline " A good movie an okay book adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read the book before the movie came out but ill give a movie review separate from my book ideals of what it should have been.As a movie on its own its good. Not great. They have a little bit of action and when i say little i do mean little under 5 minutes. There are some chrome vehicles modern looking bland clothing etc. This movie is really about what makes us human. With a love triangle. Not nearly as dominant as it was in twilight. A very interesting premise for a movie. The acting was great I really loved Jake Abel as Ian O'Shea. Dian kruger added some depth to her seeker attitude. Max Irons I found to be the weakest actor of the bunch some of his lines were delivered poorly so help me but what really ties the cast in is William Hurt.He ties them all together and ads some charm to his clich lines that makes him very likable. Other noticeable actors were Scot Lawrence Doc and Francis Fisher Maggie but neither were given the screen time needed to develop any sort of charter although it would have been ve3ry interesting to see. Nice scenery and nice shots. The music and some scene lacking was great and added a indie touch to it.Now based off the book this movie kinda blew it. it was extremely different cutting out characters and adding things that never were. I personally felt that by making all the Aliens dress the same drive the same vehicles took away from the depth of the battle between the resistance and aliens. They were supposed to be creative and find individualism in human hosts which was very lacking. Instead the movie went in the direction of aliens turning humans into one mass of boring un unique sheep. I also wish they had kept a few of Wanda's experiences from other worlds in the movie even as flash backs etc. This movie lacked as a scifi as all we see are humans with contacts. It lacked as a romance as her love interest was gone for most of it.If anything its a good movie about  what is considered human? a and how shall we react that makes us human.Not bad i enjoyed it anyways and my husband actually stuck around to watch it too lol.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have read the book before the movie came out but ill give a movie review separate from my book ideals of what it should have been.As a movie on its own its good. Not great. They have a little bit of action and when i say little i do mean little under 5 minutes. There are some chrome vehicles modern looking bland clothing etc. This movie is really about what makes us human. With a love triangle. Not nearly as dominant as it was in twilight. A very interesting premise for a movie. The acting was great I really loved Jake Abel as Ian O'Shea. Dian kruger added some depth to her seeker attitude. Max Irons I found to be the weakest actor of the bunch some of his lines were delivered poorly so help me but what really ties the cast in is William Hurt.He ties them all together and ads some charm to his clich lines that makes him very likable. Other noticeable actors were Scot Lawrence Doc and Francis Fisher Maggie but neither were given the screen time needed to develop any sort of charter although it would have been ve3ry interesting to see. Nice scenery and nice shots. The music and some scene lacking was great and added a indie touch to it.Now based off the book this movie kinda blew it. it was extremely different cutting out characters and adding things that never were. I personally felt that by making all the Aliens dress the same drive the same vehicles took away from the depth of the battle between the resistance and aliens. They were supposed to be creative and find individualism in human hosts which was very lacking.

But I found myself in front of a terrible teenmovie. And not the good kind like we used to see in the 90's. Artistic work is completely absent. The world shown in this film is interesting but not described sufficiently.I found that the narrative form was quite ineffective and the dialogs were so dull that not a single piece of philosophy can be extracted.On the top of all that the love story is foretold and occupies the 34 of the scenes. And the acting even Saoirse Ronan that already did very good job in other movies was so lame you can't relate to the characters. In my opinion this film lacks of an audacious directing to be good. There was material but it has been spoiled.If you're over 15 I don't recommend this film. If you're under well I don't recommend it neither but I'll understand if you find some pleasure to see it.".

Shiny silver cars bikes and helicopters did nothing to excite us as there was no exciting car chases!!

I read the book a couple of years back and absolutely LOVED it. It's a great book  intelligent innovative entertaining and addicting. To put it in perspective the book in about 600 pages and the move was about maybe 200 pages of it? It made me sad because they turned it from Hunger Games status to Twilight status  and Stephanie Myers is to blame there. Known for Twilight and vampire love stories the writers and director of the Host tailored to the sales rather than the story. They cut out all the action and background information and just gave the love triangle  which is exactly what the Twilight movies did. Honestly it was just so bad. My friends never read the book and were so confused the entire way. I had to explain everything to them afterwards because in the movie they took out all the background information! They skipped over WAY too much. The result of the movie a futuristic story about aliens taking over the mind's and body's of the human race which leads to rebellion and a cheesy love triangle. ALSO The ending sets up for a sequel to this movie  a sequel that doesn't exist because Myers never wrote a second book of the Host... so I don't know what they're trying to pull but seriously I don't get it. PLEASE I BEG YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I'M TIRED OF THE FILM INDUSTRY GETTING AWAY WITH THE MURDER OF GREAT NOVELS. DON'T SEE IT!!!!!!!!".

To see the true IMDb score click the link for the number of users and look at the bell graph. Eliminate the 1s and 10s and you'll see that what you're left with is a solid 7.Saoirse Ronan was perfectly cast for this role as the sensitive conflicted alien slowly gaining the trust of the human survivor group. Diane Kruger and William Hurt were also good. Once again I'm struck how so many Hollywood movies lately have nonAmerican actors playing Americans. What's that all about? The Host is part of a new genre I would call sci fi for chicks. If it bothers you to see a soft sciencefiction film with lovesick young people noble suicides impossibly handsome young men aliens with emotions etc. don't go see this one. It's the old male v. female dilemma Should we kill the hated aliens or coax them out and make friends with them? There was not enough exposition at the start about the horrors of the alien invasion. The writers and producers seem to have assumed that moviegoers would understand why the characters want to remain human and why they would refer to a humanhosted alien as it. Perhaps it was better explained in the book.The device of Melinda's consciousness remaining fully alert and Wanda and Melinda actually talking to each other for our benefit might put some moviegoers off. I'm not sure. I haven't read the other reviews. However once I suspended my disbelief I was able to go with the flow.They threw the male viewers a bone Kruger and Ronan to start. there were a few car and motorcycle chases involving futuristiclooking chrome vehicles and shoot outs. Hey this is a Hollywood movie after all.The theme of humans hosting aliens is not original but they took the concept in a different direction. The movie is slick and well made but there were a few clichs and many many aspects of the story that were glossed over left unexplained or just not realistic. The survivors here were mostly young Hollywood pretty boys not a ragged group of tough survivors like on Walking Dead for example.Still I appreciated some of the details of the good alien theme like a society of honest and trustworthy aliens that doesn't need cash to function or where they will simply give you their car if you need it or where everyone drives at the speed limit. God forbid we should have a society like that! Kill them! And I liked the part where the other seekers looked at the evil seeker played by Kruger and pointed out that she was getting a little too obsessed. After all the aliens saw themselves as the good guys. There are many species that coexist in symbiosis. It's interesting to think that maybe it would do our species good. This is actually a very old theme. There's not much difference between her body has been taken over by an alien and she is filled with the Holy Spirit or even she is possessed by a demon.".

	schema:headline " Unbelievably original movie is going to make a lot of people very happy!";
	schema:reviewBody "Got to attend a special preview screening in DC a few weeks ago. I wasn't quite sure what to expect... I enjoyed watching the Twilight movies but I wouldn't exactly call myself a Twihard. The Host though is ... AWESOME. You get all the stuff you'd expect from Stephenie Meyer  like some very hot dudes and a very unique romance... this time it's a love box rather than a love triangle. It's hard to explain but it's genius. I can guarantee you won't have seen anything like it!! Alien invasion  hot people trapped in caves  the most inventive kissing scenes ever. As well as all the Twilighty stuff you also get amazing performances  Saoirse Ronan is the ultimate kickass chick. She's got her pick of the men Max Irons and Jake Abel who are absolutely going to be stars after this but there's so much more to her than that. She's an independent powerful warrior woman. Jennifer Lawrence watch out!! And why is no one talking about the kid who plays Saoirse's little brother yet?! He is adorable and so good. There is a scene where I teared up watching him. William Hurt was surprisingly hilarious as Uncle Jeb and Diane Kruger is deliciously evil as the Seeker. The movie also has a pretty thrilling sci fi plot breathtaking scenery crazy vintage cool costume design and some seriously goodlooking chrome cars. This is a quality movie. I guess that has something to do with Andrew Niccol being the director  from The Truman Show to Gattaca to In Time he seem to make very stylish smart movies.I haven't read the book though I just bought a copy with the movie poster on the front!! but I hear the movie sticks very closely to the novel. I think Twilight fans are going to be very happy. I think The Host novel fans are going to be very happy. I think a lot of people who didn't expect this movie to make them happy are going to be very happy!!Movie is out March 29th and I am seriously counting down the days until I can see it again. PS Stephenie  if you're reading this  hurry up and write the next book so we can have our sequel! I have to know what happens to these characters. Hoster for life! are we calling ourselves Hosters or what ?".

The Host is a totally different genre from twilight and should appeal to a totally different audience with the main theme being an alien invasion from the point of view of the alien with a little bit of romance on the side. The movie sticks mostly to the plot outline of the book a few minor details are not mentioned but no major plot changes occur overall I think The Host is a wonderful example of how brilliant movies always come from brilliant books and I hope to see a few more scifi novels and perhaps movies from Stephanie Meyer in the future. I really can't wait for the DVD release!".

	schema:reviewBody "The tonal combinations in The Host are rather unique especially considering such heavy sciencefiction settings generally don't surface in romantic teen dramas. Unfortunately the creativity quickly gives way to annoying gimmicks unconvincing dialogue and inadvertently hilarious situations. The concept of two minds inhabiting one body works on paper and perhaps in outlandish comedies but the grating voiceovers that occur in the film only work to trivialize the heartfelt dramaturgy and serious themes of love and sacrifice that attempt to surface. Copious early flashbacks and nonsensical character motives frustrate further while investing in the protagonists enough to care about the zealous amorosity that eventually appears becomes a monumental hurdle indeed.Earth has found peace unlike anything it's ever experienced  but at what cost? When the world's inhabitants are taken over by an invading alien life force that assumes its host's soul and steadily erases their identity the planet appears to have achieved tranquility. But for those that refuse to succumb death may be the only answer. Melanie Stryder Saoirse Ronan is one such rebel and in an attempt to protect her younger brother Jamie Chandler Canterbury and her lover Jared Howe Max Irons she throws herself from a building after being discovered by alien enforcers led by The Seeker Diane Kruger. Not dying from the fall Melanie is implanted with an ancient alien being known as the Wanderer whose job is to unravel the girl's memories and reveal the location of any surviving humans. But both The Seeker and Wanderer underestimate Melanie's willpower and soon the resolute young girl has convinced her sympathetic brainparasite to help her reunite with her loved ones and fight back against their relentless pursuers.We've been invaded by an alien race claims the narrator as the movie opens. The infrequently interesting sciencefiction themes in The Host are immediately and colossally overwhelmed by a preoccupation with whimsical romantic teen fantasies. The project could have been redeemable had the entire premise been transplanted into a darker weightier environment or had it been treated with the respect of an appropriate tone think Children of Men or Dark City. Author Stephenie Meyer's unmistakable infatuation with love triangles and meandering embraces amongst characters from worlds apart once again overtakes any originality  here the momentarily creepy idea of an alien occupation of the mind. Multiple personalities battling for supremacy lucidity infected by thought control and a perhaps unintentional nod to Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde take a prompt backseat to mushy dialogue and plenty of PG13 kissing. Unexpectedly none of the guys take their shirts off.While it starts with brief thrills the film quickly and completely loses its direction. It becomes preachy at times annoying at others and most offensively repeatedly contradictory. One of the major plot points centers on dual intellects inhabiting Melanie's body which is specifically kept a secret due to fellow refugees' likely disbelief. But they all exist in a world described by savior Jeb William Hurt as sciencefiction. What exactly would anyone not be willing to believe? And immediately upon recovering Melanie's body Jeb proceeds to show the seeming infiltrator the inner workings of their hidden stronghold including how they get light and water a layout of the underground structure and even history on the extinct volcano origins. She's also allowed to wander around unguarded. At least they didn't hand her a map  but why does no one bother to interrogate her? These revolutionaries have survived years of warfare by blindly trusting the enemy? Reason and rationale so suspiciously elude The Host that it will be amusing to see if Twilight fans succumb to the similarities Meyer's story has drudged up and flock to see this borderline unwatchable mess. At least Lotus Cars with their conspicuous product placement will likely increase sales when fans want to feel like they're a part of this potential franchise Meyer's hopes to turn the series into a trilogy.The Massie Twins GoneWithTheTwins.com".

I am a major fan of Saoirse Ronan i think she is wonderful but I struggled to watch this even with her in it. The script was cheesy and the whole voice in the head thing was portrayed really weird. It felt to me like she had Dissociative identity disorder and I'm a fan of the books!! I dunno how else they could have done it but i just found it a bit strange.. The whole love story felt really weak to me maybe as in the twilight films because so much of the novel is inner dialogue it's hard to show on film as so make it really weak to see. I felt nothing for her liking of either characters. The souls were wrong I can understand the want for more action but i hated it. They are too suspicious of everyone in the film and there is a scene at the beginning of the book that was cut out of the film where it's sort of explained about how the Souls work as a community and it makes sense that Wanda can just walk in and take the groceries. I fell bad for Meyer the movie versions of all her books have been butchered. Yeah i liked the twilight novels and The host is one of my favorite novels at the moment It's so well done!So yeah I'm not a fan of the film. Huge let down and just boring really.

While the casual viewer might find the pacing slow and uneventful character driven drama is the goal here.The story involves the aftermath of an alien invasion where parasitic beings take over the bodies and minds of their human 'hosts' The invasion is nearly complete when Melanie one of the few remaking free humans is captured arnd given to an alien called Wanderer as a host. Melanie remains conscience and begins to fight her domination. This is an interesting thoughtful film. Performances are top notch with the only problem being the physical similarity of three of the male leads. As noted elsewhere this ads confusion on who is who in certain scenes. While there are no vast battles and the setup of the resolution is slightly confusing I still greatly enjoyed this thoughtful film.".

On the face of it the film could have been a very PC affair with a load of pandering however aside from loads of white authority stereotypes the film is pretty balanced and interesting look at the plight of Yasmin. The story is interesting enough and lots of issues are touched on  interracial relationships fear old world versus western values disaffected youth and so on mostly it all works although the nature of the beast means that Yasmin's situation is quite extreme because so many situations are rolled into the experience of the Husseini family.The cast is pretty good though and it is mainly their work that keeps it worked and stops their characters just being big clichs. Panjabi is a good actress and her Yasmin is well crafted with conflicting loyalties and desires making her an interesting character and a good performance. Ahmed's Nas is a good performance very natural and it is not his fault that he has to carry the extreme experience of disaffected youth being drawn into terrorism. Jackson is lumbered with a poor character  merely a combination of all the mistrust that we are being old that all white people have towards Islam he tries his best and is natural at the start but once 911 occur he is clumsy and poorly written when viewed next to Yasmin.Overall this is a good film that does a good job of summarising the Muslim experience since they became public enemy 1. Being Northern Irish I know how it feels and also know how it feels to suffer under the Prevention of Terrorism Act as was and I am not too sympathetic with Muslims groups who play the race card in every discussion on this subject so I liked that the film didn't do that. The title role is well performed and the film does a good job of pulling a lot together without making it one big clichd PC mess.".

I was so surprised when I found out that the main writers and directors of the film were not Asian or Muslim. Usually whenever nonMuslims analyse and study Islam and Muslims they don't completely understand the true Islam as we see it but this time I was quite surprised.I think the good points of the film is that it is quite a balanced portrayal of the lives of Muslims living in British society. This film captures the dilemmas that second generation Muslims face trying to uphold their religion and values whilst also attempting to integrate into society. It is good in that it shows the positive and the negative of both sides the Muslim and the English. This is quite realistic. It also distinguishes the different types of Muslims such as the more extremist ones who are less tolerant and interpret Islam inaccurately and the more moderate ones who carry the true Muslim message such as Yasmin's father who believes in peace and harmony.However this film still does not go far enough in challenging negative stereotypes about Islam and Muslims. Whilst it is true that there are British Muslims who do reject their religion and culture just like among other religious groups there are also a huge number of British Muslims who manage to successfully fulfill their religious and cultural demands whilst also integrating well into the wider society. For example I know many very successful and religious Pakistani and Iraqi people living in Britain who sympathise with Muslim countries but also oppose violence extremism and terrorism.I found the acting directing and production was done very well. Although I found the ending too abrupt there was no real resolution or conclusion to the film.Overall I found it was quite an accurate representation that showed the grey areas rather than simplistic representations usually associated with Islam but still didn't go far enough in challenging some negative attitudes. However still better than the awful representation of Muslims in 'East is East'.".

Archie panjabi fantastic performance and a realistic portrayal of a Muslim. I would recommend seeing this if you want to see how Muslims really felt.I have recently seen a lot of dramas about Muslim during the 911 period and have not been happy with how Muslims are constantly being made out to be terroristso i was surprised to see a realistic drama that showed Muslim in a good light. Also this drama is based on true facts as the film makers did research in the Muslim community and asked Muslims about how they were treated during that time.Over all i thought this was a good and realist drama and world recommend it to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of British Muslims.".

	schema:headline " Bend it like Blunkett";
	schema:reviewBody "The above title was suggested as a suitable alternative name for the film by one of the crew who was I was chatting to after its screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. David Blunkett's attempts to flout or rewrite the law have produced widespread condemnation from civil liberties groups and lawyers  but one of the minority groups most affected is British Muslims. In this warm lighthearted comedy set in a British Muslim community immediately around and immediately after 911 we see the horror of what members of that community were faced with as a result of the social institutional and shamefully police and legal disregard for their civil liberties. In explaining the extensive research behind the film Director Kenneth Glenaan says the examples used innocent families being awoken by police 'terror' squads thrusting guns in their faces detaining them indefinitely etc were typical of many actual cases as were the scenes of discrimination and abuse in the workplace and in the street.In our story a modern working Pakistani woman Yasmin has a traditional if layabout husband who is falsely imprisoned as a terrorist suspect. It turns out that the rather simple chap isolated by his poor English had been making long phone calls to his brother back home  who it so happens was a teacher at a school that had received funds from the Kashmir Liberation Front which has connections with terrorism. Yasmin was about to divorce him but the disingenuousness of the authorities eventually leads her to take his side as she realises injustices are being perpetrated against him. Other members of the family cover a range of attitudes from the newlyrecruited activist son distributing flyers when not selling hash or working at the local mosque the father who keeps trying to introduce a note of common sense to the youths who find their newfound Iif fictitious aura of potentially dangerous freedom fighters' helps them attract local white girls. We see the way a decent white person woos a Pakistani who is not a practicing Muslim how she has adapted to western values yet we also see the bigoted look of shock on his face when she suggests he accompany her to the mosque one day. We see police tactics from the point of view of Muslims who have nothing to hide the repugnance of those police tactics yet when we examine them honestly we realise they are quite what we might expect  and we wouldn't have found them repugnant unless we saw them from the receiving end.But Yasmin is not a diatribe or an ode to the miseries of a disenfranchised group. It is a film about the many positive experiences that everyone can relate to within a small British Muslim community. It takes away much of the mystique and makes everyday Islam a little less arcane to the western newcomer. It uncovers more similarities than differences. It is a film that crosses borders that lets us enter other peoples' hearts in a similar way that a Full Monty by the same writer did but it also leaves us with very serious questions to consider.A few of things I pondered during this filmIn Britain most white people cannot distinguish by looking between a Pakistani an Iraqi a Palestinian a Syrian etc. Neither can we distinguish the accents a point also made by Control Room filmmaker Jehane Noujaim  the 'Iraqis' toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein did not appear to be Iraqis.When we hold our western democracy up as an example for other countries to emulate it is shameful that our government should be guilty of implementing such unworthy measures as those experienced by British Muslims.The attitude of the British government has pushed Muslims together of whatever background if faced with a choice of two evils people are more likely to be understanding of family and those of the same or similar culture. The attitude of our government in clamping down unjustly and indiscriminately on Brtitish Muslims in itself helps to foster terrorism and gives terrorist recruiters more ammunition just as Bush's actions in Iraq in immediate practical terms increased the threat of terrorism.Not all people in a Muslim community are Muslims! Some haven't been to a mosque for years.The lies told to the British public over Iraq cause untold suffering to innocent British Muslims. Not only indirectly through prejudices introduced through the system but they are blamed in a totalitarian way simply because they are Muslim. The real culprits those with massive oil interests primarily Osama bin Laden and co and George Bush  co and those that fund and keep terrorism covert primarily Saudi Arabia and the CIA are given a light dusting by the public and the authorities  largely because they are untouchable and Saudi Arabia's foreign investments are so vast that upsetting them will upset the Western economy.In the Muslim  Arab's mind all the Middle East conflicts centre around Palestine. This has been said again and again but is ignored by Westerners.

	onyx:emotionText "The above title was suggested as a suitable alternative name for the film by one of the crew who was I was chatting to after its screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. David Blunkett's attempts to flout or rewrite the law have produced widespread condemnation from civil liberties groups and lawyers  but one of the minority groups most affected is British Muslims. In this warm lighthearted comedy set in a British Muslim community immediately around and immediately after 911 we see the horror of what members of that community were faced with as a result of the social institutional and shamefully police and legal disregard for their civil liberties. In explaining the extensive research behind the film Director Kenneth Glenaan says the examples used innocent families being awoken by police 'terror' squads thrusting guns in their faces detaining them indefinitely etc were typical of many actual cases as were the scenes of discrimination and abuse in the workplace and in the street.In our story a modern working Pakistani woman Yasmin has a traditional if layabout husband who is falsely imprisoned as a terrorist suspect. It turns out that the rather simple chap isolated by his poor English had been making long phone calls to his brother back home  who it so happens was a teacher at a school that had received funds from the Kashmir Liberation Front which has connections with terrorism. Yasmin was about to divorce him but the disingenuousness of the authorities eventually leads her to take his side as she realises injustices are being perpetrated against him. Other members of the family cover a range of attitudes from the newlyrecruited activist son distributing flyers when not selling hash or working at the local mosque the father who keeps trying to introduce a note of common sense to the youths who find their newfound Iif fictitious aura of potentially dangerous freedom fighters' helps them attract local white girls. We see the way a decent white person woos a Pakistani who is not a practicing Muslim how she has adapted to western values yet we also see the bigoted look of shock on his face when she suggests he accompany her to the mosque one day. We see police tactics from the point of view of Muslims who have nothing to hide the repugnance of those police tactics yet when we examine them honestly we realise they are quite what we might expect  and we wouldn't have found them repugnant unless we saw them from the receiving end.But Yasmin is not a diatribe or an ode to the miseries of a disenfranchised group. It is a film about the many positive experiences that everyone can relate to within a small British Muslim community. It takes away much of the mystique and makes everyday Islam a little less arcane to the western newcomer. It uncovers more similarities than differences. It is a film that crosses borders that lets us enter other peoples' hearts in a similar way that a Full Monty by the same writer did but it also leaves us with very serious questions to consider.A few of things I pondered during this filmIn Britain most white people cannot distinguish by looking between a Pakistani an Iraqi a Palestinian a Syrian etc. Neither can we distinguish the accents a point also made by Control Room filmmaker Jehane Noujaim  the 'Iraqis' toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein did not appear to be Iraqis.When we hold our western democracy up as an example for other countries to emulate it is shameful that our government should be guilty of implementing such unworthy measures as those experienced by British Muslims.The attitude of the British government has pushed Muslims together of whatever background if faced with a choice of two evils people are more likely to be understanding of family and those of the same or similar culture. The attitude of our government in clamping down unjustly and indiscriminately on Brtitish Muslims in itself helps to foster terrorism and gives terrorist recruiters more ammunition just as Bush's actions in Iraq in immediate practical terms increased the threat of terrorism.Not all people in a Muslim community are Muslims! Some haven't been to a mosque for years.The lies told to the British public over Iraq cause untold suffering to innocent British Muslims. Not only indirectly through prejudices introduced through the system but they are blamed in a totalitarian way simply because they are Muslim. The real culprits those with massive oil interests primarily Osama bin Laden and co and George Bush  co and those that fund and keep terrorism covert primarily Saudi Arabia and the CIA are given a light dusting by the public and the authorities  largely because they are untouchable and Saudi Arabia's foreign investments are so vast that upsetting them will upset the Western economy.In the Muslim  Arab's mind all the Middle East conflicts centre around Palestine. This has been said again and again but is ignored by Westerners. Right Wing USA has no real intention of 'solving' the IsraeliPalestinian conflict except as part of U.S. expansionism as outlined by the NeoConservatives' blueprints that guide U.S. foreign policy.

	schema:reviewBody "Yasmin is a relatively low budget Britishfinanced and made film about a young attractive British Pakistani Muslim woman brought up in northern England. That is an unusual and welcome starting point for a film. However the film's weaknesses do not overcome this stimulating basis.Yasmin Archie Panjabi with a strong performance that suffers from the script and who at times seems to be playing more towards her own background rather than Yasmin's works for some sort of charity or social services. She is in an arranged marriage with Faysal Shahid Ahmed playing well given the limitations of his role and Nasir newcomer Syed Ahmed in a powerful performance is a devoted but restrictive father. Her family lives through the attitudes to nonwhite Britons and to the changes wrought by 911.Given the appropriate shooting style the first DoP was sacked replacement Toni SlaterLing has done a fine job of making things interesting without coating them in sugar the competent and sometimes excellent direction from former actor Kenny Glenaan and generally fine performances all round it is on the writing and plotting that criticism must centre.Unfortunately writer Simon Beaufoy's script is one that flashes with occasional brilliance before subsiding into a hinterland between credibility and exploitation. Much has been made in the publicity for Yasmin about the extensive workshopping process that led to the script. The idea for the film started with the Oldham and Bradford riots of 1999 before morphing into rather different territory under the pressure of 911. The film never does manage to balance between these two poles.A film inspired by those riots would need a sharply observed sense of place and of the mixture of identities inherent in being born nonwhite in Britain. Yasmin has the latter though the identities are rather crudely displayed sometimes but it does not have the former. The workshops took place across the north and the film is set in what is described in the publicity as a northern mill town. Quite what the presence of a mill has to do with anything in a northern town today  except tourism  is baffling. Yasmin was actually shot in Keighley. Not making the location explicit is understandable but the idea of an interchangeable 'north' betrays the same lack of precision that afflicts the characters.To encompass differences of gender nationality religion and age is to ask a great deal of any character or script and it proves too much for either the film or Yasmin to bear. Her character so central to the film is forced to display these different identities rather than possess them. She is therefore left with little sense of self to give to the viewer.The beautifully realised opening entirely without dialogue for a good few minutes is the strongest part of the film but is the base it then goes on to ignore. Yasmin's work is what enables her to escape the binds of the other parts of her identity and yet we never find out what it is. It funds the Golf cabriolet she drives there's even a line of dialogue on this it gives her a life away from her husband and her home she is employee of the month which we only find out when someone has drawn an Osamastyle beard on the picture. It is about as realistic a portrayal of work as an average Hollywood movie.Yasmin's work also represents an independence that doesn't seem to fit with an arranged marriage. Quickly it is made clear that the marriage is an unhappy one her husband Faysal  the thick Paki as she describes him  being more concerned with his new goat than in trying to bridge the gap to his wife.The only character who isn't required to represent things beyond his character and is therefore the strongest is the father. Setna infuses the struggles of maintaining a family traditions and sanity with palpable tastes of loss confusion and frustration.Finally then Yasmin is a victim of overambition. If there had been more time devoted to the atmosphere in Britain between Muslims and Christians before and after 911 perhaps we would have heard the two leaders' words in a more different context. If there had been time to explore Yasmin's marriage to Faysal we might have been able to understand better why she turns to him amidst the difficulties of his and then her arrest. If there had been time to sketch race relations as opposed to religious ones in Britain before 911 we might have had a better understanding of the film's setting and of the struggles within Yasmin's family. If we had seen more of the role of the mosque in that community we might have been able to understand better the attraction Nasir feels towards becoming involved with terrorists. As those terrorists tell Nasir the war against Islam has gone global. In which case there is all the more need for specifics for an understanding which can only come through exploration not display.Although Yasmin tries to do far too much it is an interesting to watch it do so. So far there are distributors for most of Europe except the UK which is something that should change for this unbalanced and unusual film is worth watching nonetheless.".

	schema:headline " Sensitive and responsiblyhandled racial drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "Yasmin is a lowkey sensitively handled examination of racial and religious prejudice filmed in Keighley. It is scripted by Keighleyborn Simon Beaufoy already the writer of successful Yorkshirebased films like The Full Monty 1997 and Blow Dry 2001  here Beaufoy is in for him uncommonly sombre frame of mind exchanging his usual light hearted comical style for something much 'heavier' and more serious. Yasmin focuses on the aftermath of the 911 terrorist attacks detailing how the atrocities affect  and irrevocably change  the lives of a Muslim community living in the north of England.Yasmin Archie Panjabi leads a curious double life. She lives on a deadend terraced street opposite her own father and brother sharing her house  but not her bed  with a 'husband' named Faysal Shahid Ahmed. Her marriage to Faysal is a sham a mere gimmick a union of convenience designed to get him approval for his full British passport. Every day Yasmin heads off to work at a disability unit  stopping off en route to change out of her Muslim clothing and remove her wedding ring. At work she is no longer the dutiful Muslim wife instead she becomes a sassy outgoing young woman with very 'Western' sensibilities of permissiveness. There is also a clear bond between Yasmin and her work colleague John Steve Jackson. Things change in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. As quickly as they embraced her as a friend Yasmin's workmates suddenly treat her with mistrust ignorance and dislike. Piece by piece Yasmin is forced to confront her existence and make painful choices. Her impetuous younger brother Nasir Syed Ahmed vows to join the fight against the Western forces by going to Afghanistan to become a freedom fighter her husband Faysal is indefinitely imprisoned as a potential terror suspect despite there being no evidence her father Renu Setna meanwhile tries desperately to encourage his family and neighbours not to retaliate as the cultural tensions between whites and Muslims threaten to boil over into violence.Yasmin is a worthy film for sure taking some topical themes in its stride. The performances are generally good especially Setna as Yasmin's outspoken father and Panjabi in the title role. Less effective is Syed Ahmed as her brooding brother  it's not so much that he plays his role badly more that it's a badly written part  the typical 'angry young man' a clichd character in this type of film if ever there was one. The many different faces of cultural prejudice are handled pretty responsibly. The film doesn't whitewash its viewpoints like so many of these films do. Characters from both cultures are shown in positive and negative lights. More skilfully the film remembers that real people aren't just onedimensional caricatures  in real life there are many shades of grey between 'prejudiced' and 'notprejudiced' and there is often a lot of ambivalence about the way people from one culture feel about someone from another. Yasmin doesn't paint its characters in broad simplistic strokes  it's more balanced than that. The biggest shortcoming with the film is that amid all its worthiness it occasionally ends up being a little dull too. It is never preachy thankfully but there are patches where one finds one's mind wandering inattentively. These lulls are not frequent  and they never last long enough to ruin the film  but they are there nonetheless. Overall Yasmin is a thoughtful look at race relationships built around an event that shook the world and changed  perhaps irreversibly  the way that many people from different cultural backgrounds feel about each other.".

Her impetuous younger brother Nasir Syed Ahmed vows to join the fight against the Western forces by going to Afghanistan to become a freedom fighter her husband Faysal is indefinitely imprisoned as a potential terror suspect despite there being no evidence her father Renu Setna meanwhile tries desperately to encourage his family and neighbours not to retaliate as the cultural tensions between whites and Muslims threaten to boil over into violence.Yasmin is a worthy film for sure taking some topical themes in its stride. The performances are generally good especially Setna as Yasmin's outspoken father and Panjabi in the title role. Less effective is Syed Ahmed as her brooding brother  it's not so much that he plays his role badly more that it's a badly written part  the typical 'angry young man' a clichd character in this type of film if ever there was one. The many different faces of cultural prejudice are handled pretty responsibly. The film doesn't whitewash its viewpoints like so many of these films do. Characters from both cultures are shown in positive and negative lights. More skilfully the film remembers that real people aren't just onedimensional caricatures  in real life there are many shades of grey between 'prejudiced' and 'notprejudiced' and there is often a lot of ambivalence about the way people from one culture feel about someone from another. Yasmin doesn't paint its characters in broad simplistic strokes  it's more balanced than that. The biggest shortcoming with the film is that amid all its worthiness it occasionally ends up being a little dull too. It is never preachy thankfully but there are patches where one finds one's mind wandering inattentively. These lulls are not frequent  and they never last long enough to ruin the film  but they are there nonetheless. Overall Yasmin is a thoughtful look at race relationships built around an event that shook the world and changed  perhaps irreversibly  the way that many people from different cultural backgrounds feel about each other.";

	schema:reviewBody "I initially thought 'Yasmin' was going to be just another preachy 911 aftermath flick but I was pleasantly surprised. It tells the story of a young Muslim British who leads a double life. There is a Yasmin who wears a burka when she's out in her neighbourhood who cooks for her father and brother and who is only legally married to a potential immigrant. Then there's a Yasmin who wears modern Western clothes hangs out at the pub with a colleague she fancies and doesn't mind an occasional drink. She knows that her family and neighbours won't accept this side of her and she knows that her colleagues won't accept the Muslim side of her. However after 911 Yasmin is forced with an identity crisis and it is here that she discovers her strength and the beauty of who she really is. 'Yasmin' never goes over the top which in a way is its strength but also its weakness.The execution for one is too simplistic. The cinematography the lack of score the washed out colour look the sound design doesn't occasionally feels too dull. There are also some cultural clichs that 'Yasmin' seems to not have been able to escape.Archie Punjabi is marvelous in the title role. It's a tour du force performance which she plays very subtly unlike the hyped Hollywood performances that beg for an Oscar. The rest of the cast do a decent job especially the actor playing her husband.'Yasmin' attempts to tell a different side of the aftermath of the 911. Even though it's not shown for more than a few minutes it's still an intriguing perspective and an important story.".

	schema:headline " Yasmeen manages to juggle living in two cultures until she's forced to make a choice between them";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally a movie about a strong Muslim female. Although Yasmin is NOT a Muslima in the beginning of the movie. She is only a Muslima by name by birth in a Muslim family. Only after facing hardships she becomes more interested in her religion.She reminded me a bit of myself I'm also a Foreigner born in a Western country having issues with the Westerners as well as with my own people. But on the other hand she is very different from me. She is so strong while it took me years to become strong and dare to do what I wanted to do.Apart from that I can easily identify with her balancing more to the westerners in the beginning she tries to fit in at work for example with her British colleagues but isn't really accepted. She is always the Foreigner in their eyes no matter what.Then she comes home and enters a very different world. At home her family culture is dominant. Different believes different values. She isn't too pleased with them. She doesn't see the beauty of her parents culture of their heritage because she didn't really get a chance to experience it's beauty she has mostly experienced the negative sides of her culture so she isn't very happy at home.She really wants to embrace the western life style but then something horrible happens the attack on September 11th of the Twin Towers. Suddenly the innocent teasing colleagues drastically change their behavior towards her now they are truly nasty. This really hurts her. What is even more ridiculous is that Yasmins boss does nothing about it and instead wants Yasmin to take some time off work until those emotions die down and also claims that Yasmin is making to big a deal out of this! And that part is a very important aspect of this movie. It shows how wrong many nonMuslims were in their accusations towards ALL the Muslims while the attack was the action of a small group of mislead Muslims. Islam doesn't allow to kill women and children elder people destroy houses and buildings crop etc. etc. even in war time When for example a Christian or just a white person blows up something or does some other horrible deed we don't expect ALL the white people or all the Christians to apologize for that do we?! This movie shows that treatment those underlying cooking emotions of the western people against Muslims which suddenly reached the boiling point and overcooked after September 11th. That attack on the Twin Towers was an excuse for many people to openly mistreat attack say nasty things about and to Muslims all over the world.Yes that attack was a horrible deed many innocent people died both in the planes and the Twin Towers plus surrounding area but what is just as horrible is the reaction that followed it towards ALL the Muslims. Most Muslims were horrified shocked by that vicious attack yet they became the targets of different kinds of attacks themselves.They did a great job in showing all that with this movie the inner struggles of a person between two cultures and how people change how hatred creates more hatred. Dialogue between different groups races cultures is very important so people can understand each other instead.Yasmin has a kid brother he is a very western boy completely nonMuslim worse than his sister in that aspect to the point he actually sins with girls and smokes and deals drugs. Then hypocrite as he is he goes to the mosque with his father to call the Azaan and pray...Also there is a story line between a love which never really happens between Yasmin and her British colleague. He likes her but she keeps her distance waiting for her divorce she is married to her cousin from Pakistan and waits for the moment he will have papers which will allow him to stay in England then she will be free from him. Her colleague doesn't know about that she just tells him she has some family business to take care off and he has to wait.The experiences with the British authorities however change Yasmin as well as her kid brother who becomes very religious and decides to go to a training camp in Pakistan to become a fighter Yasmin her kid brother her father her husband along with her colleague who was in her home by coincidence are all arrested and accused of being links to terrorist groups... in the end Yasmin starts to lean more towards her own culture and becomes interested once again in her own religion. When she runs into her colleague in a shopping mall he first doesn't recognize her because she is wearing shalwar kameez then he asks her to join him in the pub she refuses because she is thinking of going to the mosque and asks him to join her instead. He refuses and their ways are separated.So there are many interesting story lines in this movie.It shows the struggles and strength of females the struggles of Muslims in the west the struggle of children being torn between two different worlds they both belong to it shows discrimination of Foreigners and particularly Muslims it shows how that discrimination and racism worsened after the September 11th attacks it shows the clash between the older and the younger generation both their power struggles it shows how normal and even very free people can turn into possible fanatics.It's a great movie which with all these different aspects never becomes clich or lecturing. One would think with so many things going on it would become messy but it isn't. It's very well done and I recommend it to anyone from any culture.".

In Yasmin we see the world through the eyes of a Muslim woman who in herself struggles to deal with her Muslim faith whilst trying to fit into the western society. Throughout a majority of the film she steps outside her religious boundaries refusing to wear her vail in front of her workmates. Even so she still stands out of the crowd.By the end of the film Yasmin resumes her Muslim faith whilst her brother Nassar who is sick of being treated as though he is a terrorist by the white community especially after being blatantly bombarded and terrorised by police in his own house leaves to join Islamic extremists in Afghanistan.It was interesting yet quite disturbing when I found out that there were scenes from the film that were entirely real. For example the scene where a Muslim woman is walking through the streets and has milk thrown on her with young boys tormenting her calling her names this is real all caught on camera and presented in the film to display the reality of racism within the streets of Britain. It is very disturbing to see that sometimes life is more than just a movie and the fact that these young kids displayed such a hatred towards the Muslim community.It also reestablishes the fact that during a time of terrorism the British community view anyone of ethnic Islamic originculture as a threat. The film is held together by a cast of actors with little to no acting experience and therefore their performances provides a sense of realism to the film which in turn delivers a powerful message to the white and Islamic community about racism terrorism and the power of hatred.".

All I witnessed were bad representations of stereotypes bad acting and you could say offensive characters. We'll start with that fact that only one person could act and that was Renu Setna who played Khalid the father. He portrayed a good example of a traditional Muslim father and for that I have to give him credit. Although I have read that Archie Panjabi is a wonderful actress I did not see this the main point being her accent was horrendous. Not even to mention Steve Jackson's John diabolic performance  he can not act to save his life.Also I have to say that the fact the scene of this poor elderly woman not realising the cameras helping the Muslim lady being discriminated was left in to draw the audience  shows how bad the rest of the screen writing was.".

We'll start with that fact that only one person could act and that was Renu Setna who played Khalid the father. He portrayed a good example of a traditional Muslim father and for that I have to give him credit. Although I have read that Archie Panjabi is a wonderful actress I did not see this the main point being her accent was horrendous. Not even to mention Steve Jackson's John diabolic performance  he can not act to save his life.Also I have to say that the fact the scene of this poor elderly woman not realising the cameras helping the Muslim lady being discriminated was left in to draw the audience  shows how bad the rest of the screen writing was.";

As you can guess from the title the plot is focused on emancipated Yasmin Husseini who switches between her traditional Muslim and her modern western life. After the incidents of 911 an arranged marriage and a night in prison she withdraws from her doublelife and comes back to her Muslim origin. Without using any spectacular visual effects Yasmin catches you with a lot authenticity. All of the different but interesting and individual characters make the film very dynamic. On the one hand there is the conservative father Khalid who just tries to conform to his western life without losing his Muslim tradition. Yasmin's brother Nasir on the other hand is fed up with his life in the western culture. Another important person is Faisal the import and Yasmin's husband who is not able to communicate with anyone of the Husseinis but a goat. Yasmin as the main character has to cope with all these family members and tries not to hurt or disappoint anyone. You will see how she manages all that although going on with her ordinary modern lifestyle.I want to recommend this movie to all of you because it shows a point of view from the other side of dealing with terror and religious identity. You are demanded to think about Muslim culture and our established prejudices.".

John seems to be Yasmin's secrete love but he actually does not know about her life at home because she hides it. I think the director's intention was to tell us that we that we have to overcome prejudices. He wants us to think about a person and not to form an opinion on things others have done. He wants the audience to start thinking not to judge over people without knowing them and say that they are enemies because they could be victims as well. I think Yasmin is a good movie because it shows the effects of attacks from another angle. Not from a westernworld person's but from the Muslim's not only have to handle the fears everyone has got but also the way they are treated because they have the same religion as the terrorists.

The movie deals with the problems of a woman who tries to live two different lifestyles while hiding her background. It deals with the prejudice that English people have got with other religions. I think the director's intention was to show the audience the invisible war that is going on in England against Muslim people especially after 911. I could feel sympathy for Yasmin because I think it must be really hard to live such a life according to the laws of her father and to the expectations of the English people of her. I really like the film because it has made me think about how people can feel when they get rejected. It shows how life can change after such an event like 911 and how Islamophobia has grown in the English towns. I would recommend the film because it has got a really good story and subtext.

	schema:reviewBody "Bitter Ernte or Angry Harvest is a West German Germanlanguage movie that had its 30th anniversary last year and was written and directed by Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland. Just like her work Hitlerjunge Salomon this one has its focus on life during World War II but not on the military actions or politicians from that time. Instead the story here is about a Jewish woman who manages to jump from a train that was supposed to get her to a concentration camp. The entire film 100 minutes approximately is about the woman's life at a local farmer's shack. The man decides to take her into his house but his motives are far from those of a good samaritan especially as we know all along she is married and her husband may have succeeded with his flight too. Armin MuellerStahl plays the epitome of an antihero here and definitely deserved his German Film Award nomination. If lead actress Trissenaar does so too I am not sure but I guess the duo carried the film nicely because they are together in here in the majority of scenes.This film was nominated for an Academy Award but lost to the Argentinean entry back then. It is another solid installment in the way Germany worked on dealing with the aftermath of World War II and for MuellerStahl and Holland it is among their most important and most known works. Even if I was not entirely impressed by this film I still liked the focus Holland put in here and also how she managed a strong balance between happy and unhappy moments throughout the entire film. The way people talk in these 1970s and 1980s film seems occasionally a bit weird by today's standards but I guess we just have to cope with that. And maybe they really spoke like that back then. It's also not so bad that it destroys the viewing experience somehow. Trissenaar's character is somewhat interesting as she must be among the most miserable characters in film history. Fighting for survival she makes a couple bad decisions in her sad situation that ultimately lead to tragedy. From that perspective the character was a crucial addition in this film but I still believe it was more due to Holland's writing than the actress giving a great performance. Anyway I am okay with the Oscar nomination and also okay with the fact that it did not win as it is a good but great movie mostly carried by MuellerStahl. A good watch for everybody with an interest in Nazi Germany and what life was like back then. I recommend it.".

The DVD from CCC Filmkunst 1984 bears only the English title Angry Harvest and no indication that it should be originally Bittere Ernte a Harvest not angry but grievous spoilt too like the apples dumped out so that sack can be used for a darker purpose. Or I suppose one could think of Julia Ward Howe's Divinity trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored but it never has come to that. The perpetrators of great wrong sit comfortable. We know that the Holocaust cannot be represented in art forms. With the perpetrators too we would destroy the screen. That's why it's odd that Roger Ebert listed among Critics of this film and usually so generous in his sympathy should have condemned the movie for not showing enough devastation. The film does something else with Arendt's insight into the banality of evil. After Sunday mass occupying German soldiers chat with local girls. Property can be acquired in a way that is perfectly legal once one knows it was expropriated from a Jew who probably won't be back to claim it. And thus to Leo Wolny who is such a nice man and will bring you potatoes if you are out and soothe your fever. This is something different from what the box calls a compelling story of love and desire. It is about a man and his peers who are bitterbse fiercely evil.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I have written anything for IMDb. Youth Without Youth is not only a very personal approach to a barely known novella by Mircea Eliade but also a homage to Romanian culture and civilization. I felt really good watching a legendary filmmaker like Coppola before the special screening in Bucharest walking on the stage and thanking sincerely to the Romanian cast and crew and in the end thanking all of us for Mircea Eliade. I read Eliade's novella some months ago and I found it difficult and anticinematic unlike La tiganci or other texts of his. Youth is as I saw it a meditation on time and the relation between human memory and identity. Eliade has been concerned with the theme of la vita est sueno life is dream for a long time and his fiction shows it. Coppola also has been preoccupied with time dreams and memory in his late films like Peggy Sue Dracula and Jack. It might seem strange and paradoxical but beyond the horror clichs and the gory makeups one can see lots of formal similarities in Dracula and Youth.... The Italian American director is definitely bound to European Romanticism and he tried to infuse a lot of new symbols the mirror the moon on the bluish night sky the skull etc to an already symbolheavyloaded narrative. Tim Roth is the ideal choice for the central character old Dominic Matei that grows young after a lightning stroke. The rest of the numerous cast is composed mainly of Romanian actors most of which are famous in our country. Iures is known for the international public also and handles his role elegantly as usual. Maria Lara is a Romanianborn German actress playing the role of Dominic Matei's lady friend and lover. The relationship between Dominic and Laura is beautifully developed by Coppola's rewriting of the initial novella. Near the end of the film there is a moment shot in Malta where Dominic decides to break away from Laura because of the dreadful effects of his supernatural youth on her physical condition. Both actors are impressive in this delicate scene.This film was all in all a pleasant surprise for me. I was expecting a more Hollywoodish speculative and commercialoriented style. Anyway I personally still think the D.P. and the photographic department in general was overwhelmed by the magnitude of this project. Coppola should of thought more deeply about his choice because Mihai Malaimare Jr. the D.P. and digital imagery was simply not enough ! It took over 2 years to complete this film anyway so why didn't he use film instead of digital mediums? Was money really a problem here? Maybe Roth asked for a big fee I don't know. This film won't be appreciated by a wide audience because Eliade's literature is very special and restrictive you need to fancy Romanian folklore and oriental philosophies in order to get into this. In fact Eliade's novella was clearly inspired as the main title shows by one of the most beautiful and profound fairytales ever Tinerete fara batranete si viata fara de moarte hard to translate into English but it might sound like Eternal youth and life without death. Even if you are not Romanian you should check it out! It will change the way you feel about time and life the way Eliade changed Coppola from an old mainstream Hollywood director into an arty European film experimenter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't pay too much attention to the press rsum for this film. It has nothing to do with Nazis and American agents. Although they do appear in the film they are not central to its plot and this is certainly not a spy drama. If this is what you are expecting you risk being severely disappointed. This film will never be a box office smash hit.No this is a film which explores the concepts and possibilities of Reincarnation Karma Mysticism Spirituality and Time. What if time is not linear? What if reincarnation is real? What if human potential could be exponentially enhanced scientifically? If like me you are fascinated by these esoteric subjects anyway and you can forgive the quirks such as upside down camera shots and occasional weak dialogue then I suspect that you will love this film. It tackles these timeless questions whilst always managing to be engaging and entertaining  and it is beautifully shot. At no time did I feel that the film lacked pace or interest.Bruno Ganz is becoming one of my favourite actors. After Vitus he turns in another great performance here as the doctor who treats Dominic Tim Roth after he has been struck by lightening. A brilliant academic who has sacrificed his entire life to the study of the origin of languages Dominic knows that at the age of 70 he will now die without achieving his goal his life purpose. The lightening bolt burns him to a crisp but instead of killing him instantly it gives him a new lease of life regained youth superhuman brainpower and thus a second chance to complete his life's work.He also regains the love of his life now reincarnated as Veronica. Under his power Veronica regresses back through the ages each time speaking an older language until as she nears the origin and his work nears completion he realises that he can have his life's desire but first there is a test and a choice to be made.This fascinating film which Coppola wrote directed and produced is well constructed and satisfying. It really made me think and hours after the end the pennies were still dropping. In what it sets out to do for me it is a great success.".

Although they do appear in the film they are not central to its plot and this is certainly not a spy drama. If this is what you are expecting you risk being severely disappointed. This film will never be a box office smash hit.No this is a film which explores the concepts and possibilities of Reincarnation Karma Mysticism Spirituality and Time. What if time is not linear? What if reincarnation is real? What if human potential could be exponentially enhanced scientifically? If like me you are fascinated by these esoteric subjects anyway and you can forgive the quirks such as upside down camera shots and occasional weak dialogue then I suspect that you will love this film. It tackles these timeless questions whilst always managing to be engaging and entertaining  and it is beautifully shot. At no time did I feel that the film lacked pace or interest.Bruno Ganz is becoming one of my favourite actors. After Vitus he turns in another great performance here as the doctor who treats Dominic Tim Roth after he has been struck by lightening. A brilliant academic who has sacrificed his entire life to the study of the origin of languages Dominic knows that at the age of 70 he will now die without achieving his goal his life purpose. The lightening bolt burns him to a crisp but instead of killing him instantly it gives him a new lease of life regained youth superhuman brainpower and thus a second chance to complete his life's work.He also regains the love of his life now reincarnated as Veronica. Under his power Veronica regresses back through the ages each time speaking an older language until as she nears the origin and his work nears completion he realises that he can have his life's desire but first there is a test and a choice to be made.This fascinating film which Coppola wrote directed and produced is well constructed and satisfying. It really made me think and hours after the end the pennies were still dropping. In what it sets out to do for me it is a great success.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was bound to happen that Youth Without Youth the first film written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola in fifteen years the first directed in ten would be lauded by the critics for not being a real comeback kind of project. It's surreal philosophical mystical and even has a mood about it that calls as a throwback to old romantic melodramas of the 40s and 50s hence the opening titles. It's not even any kind of great film. It's pretentious in a few stretches maybe moreso and it takes a convoluted explanation that comes second in 2007 film only to Southland Tales for being more complex and bizarre. But unlike Kelly's film Coppola at least has a hold on what he's doing or what he's trying to accomplish. Coppola once said that art is all about taking riks and to make films without risk is like sex without children.In the grand scheme of things at least with his career Youth Without Youth seems to be slightly minor a risk when compared to the likes of Apocalypse Now or One From the Heart. But it's a risk that Coppola takes all the same and through the intellectual thicket which contrary to some critics isn't completely dense there is some truly potent cinematic expression. So the plot the plot... A linguistics professor Dominic Tim Roth is an old man when he gets struck by lightning in 1938 then proceeds to age back to 40 in recovery only to then find that he's being watched and planned for abduction by Nazi scientists who want to use his newfound superpowers mostly that he can at times harness powerful energy as Dominic describes as out of a science fiction novel. This might be enough for a movie alone but there's more years later a woman from Dominic's past from before the lightning strike appears again also still apparently young and she can talk in ancient languages so then...Yeah I could go on with that. Suffice to say there's also talk about how this whole timewarp connects into the realm of consciousness itself or what makes up knowledge or the pursuit of language and all relating to time leading up to an ending that flips around itself all inspired by an old Chinese tale that goes around and around. What it means I still can't quite figure and it at least shows Coppola won't spoonfeed any kind of easy ending even the whole it's only a dream concept has some holes to fill leaving ambiguity as something a little more logical. Frankly I've never read any of the Mircea Eliade's writings but there's a lot to it that strikes up references to other works. I couldn't help but think the plot and its themes were as though Philip K. Dick was forced to make a melodrama on his own terms from an unpublished book. Or that there was a connection to the Fountain or even Dr. Who or something else. The comparisons are endless.But what remains at the end of trying to figure out what the hell Youth Without Youth will say as its ultimate message is an original work sincerely with the verve of a filmmaker who just says 'f it' and makes the movie he wants to make on his own terms with subsequently his own money. If there is any risk to the project it's that Coppola gambles on narrative cohesion with elements like two Dominics following the lightning strike one of which of course prods the other to complete his life's work as a failure or the power of emotion with two people in love vs. the tremendous daunting task of unlocking secrets of language and consciousness and what time even means. Couple this with technique that veers into the abstract with upside down camera angles and upfront antiNazi imagery ala Indiana Jones and a music that strikes up the most melancholy and precise of aforementioned melodrama and it becomes the weirdest hybrid Coppola's ever made.And yet and yet if Youth Without Youth is one thing above all else it's well... interesting. I never felt like getting up and even leaving to go to the bathroom much less leaving the film for good. I cared about Dominic and Veronica as I did the direction Coppola took the story even if pretensions particularly in the second half seemed to loop into the equation. And Roth is not to forget to mention terrific in the role seeming to understand where his character may or may not be headed as he continues with his research and finds that he is sort of doomed in time unless he goes down a certain path. He even gets to dig into a certain subdued humor underneath the skin of the picture where a few times there's some laughs to be had at the expense of what's going on with Dominic as though some old philosopher discovered a comic book and incorporated it into his character. It's a very strange movie experience and not one I can easily recommend. But I do all the same and Coppola fans will either like it or as case is turning out they wont.".

	schema:headline " Coppala's Best Film Ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "I know I am in the minority here but in my opinion Youth Without Youth is the best film that Francis Ford Coppala has ever made.My apologies to fans of The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now. While his more popular masterpieces were certainly well made films Youth Without Youth takes a lot more chances and does not make any compromises.The film is about a 70 year old man who is struck by lightning. After he recovers from his injuries he appears to be 30 years younger and does not age for the following 18 years  or maybe not. The ending leaves much to interpretation which will infuriate many people who are not willing to think for themselves. Parts of the film appear to be dreams sequences maybe the scenes that start upside down. Maybe the entire film after the lightning strike is a dream. Maybe the entire film was meant to be taken literally but probably not. At times Youth Without Youth seems like a David Lynch film without the horror aspects. There are doppelgangers and people with supernatural powers.

	onyx:emotionText "I know I am in the minority here but in my opinion Youth Without Youth is the best film that Francis Ford Coppala has ever made.My apologies to fans of The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now. While his more popular masterpieces were certainly well made films Youth Without Youth takes a lot more chances and does not make any compromises.The film is about a 70 year old man who is struck by lightning. After he recovers from his injuries he appears to be 30 years younger and does not age for the following 18 years  or maybe not. The ending leaves much to interpretation which will infuriate many people who are not willing to think for themselves. Parts of the film appear to be dreams sequences maybe the scenes that start upside down. Maybe the entire film after the lightning strike is a dream. Maybe the entire film was meant to be taken literally but probably not. At times Youth Without Youth seems like a David Lynch film without the horror aspects. There are doppelgangers and people with supernatural powers. It is surreal and strange and some scenes do not make sense in their sequence but are important in the entirety of the film.Youth Without Youth is not a film for everybody. In fact most people will probably not like it. But if you are a person who is willing to think about a film and bring your own interpretation to what is happening you might end up loving this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Ford Coppola returns to completing his own films for the first time in 10 years he's been working on Megalopolis which he's more or less abandoned and done some reshoots for friends. He's made a film that is probably best described as philosophical pulp. Its based on a deeply philosophical Romanian novella that has haunted him for much of the last ten years.The plot an aged scholar turning 70 and feeling he has been a failure. Deciding to go to the big city and commit suicide he is struck by lightning not long after arriving and while he is recovering from his injuries it is discovered that he is in fact now seemingly half his age. Its 1938 and during his recovery the Nazi's invade and they take a very keen interest in his condition causing him to flee.Recounting the plot further the Nazi bit is more a catalyst then the point since the film covers over 30 years from the point of the lightning strike. would be foolish since odds are it will leave you incredulous its very mystical and plays at times like a pulp novel with a great deal on its mind not to mention give you a false sense of what is really going on. This is a movie that has a definite direction in which it is going and odds are you will not completely see most of it coming. The best thing to do is just buckle up and let the film take you where its going to go. And lets face it this is the sort of story that with slight revision would have fit very nicely in an old copy of Weird Tales. The driving force is very much like a pulp story from the 1930's or 40's.Its very heady stuff. Reincarnation personality the question of what is a successful life the nature of love language atomic war the evolution of man what would you do with a second chance are among the many questions raised by this film. The plot is not constructed to be just a ripping story but rather a means to the examination of the ideas that Coppola is tossing about. Coppola has hung a great many ideas and notions on his narrative threads and he's done so in such away that in order to navigate through the maze the threads form you will have to deal with the laundry hanging from them.Its this juggling of ideas in a pulp frame work that has been the bane of this film. I know that many people don't know what Coppola was getting at I'm not entirely sure myself. The plot seems almost silly its almost like Stephen Kings Golden Years but spiced up with almost too many ideas. No doubt its confused people who were looking for another Godfather Bram Stokers Dracula The Rainmaker or any other Coppola film. Its not something that an American filmmaker would make certainly not one of Coppola's pedigree.Then again I would argue it is. the film is very much a European film. It looks and feels like a film that belongs in the line up of a European director. There is nothing typically American in the film at all. It feels alien when compared to most American films. Though if you look at the scenes in Italy in the Godfather or even the first two Godfather films in total this film fits neatly into how the earlier films feel visually. There is a lyric beauty and sense of place and time that is rare in films. there is a poetry.Its a film you will have to think about. You have to be willing to let the film go and do what ever it wants to. Certainly one can easily dismiss it as not meeting your expectations but doing so will cause you to miss out on a film that will get your little gray cells going.Is it a perfect film. No. I like the film and think its a good film. I think its a grasp exceeds its reach. To be perfectly honest somewhere in the last 20 minutes the film shifts gears and goes into a coda Coppola's words in the commentary that ends the film. Its here I think that the film falters since I don't think the ending really works. No doubt its what the end of the original story is in the commentary Coppola talks about what he had to do to make it work on screen but its something that didn't translate to the screen well. I was left wondering what it all was about in total. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it but I just felt out of sorts and desirous of a second viewing where all of the bits through the film might come together.Perhaps thats the best thing I can say about the film its not a film one should dismiss until one has had a chance to see the film twice since there are too many pieces that don't connect up until the very end.Worth a look for those willing to work with the film those will expectations go and for those that like head trips.7ish out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Most reviews haven't lied about this movie it is elliptic it is cryptic it is full of selfindulgent pseudointellectualism and cheap symbolism. The plot meanders and doesn't make complete sense. These things are all true and yet I found myself liking it very much.I wanted to watch this movie for no other reason other than that I had never seen a Coppola movie on the big screen. Being 23 I'm afraid I've missed all his earlier great ones and when I finally grow up he stops making movies. So imagine my enthusiasm when he interrupts his 10yearold break. Another reason less superficial is that I simply like linguistics a topic which is very much at the centre of this movie as the main character Dominic Matei in a delightful performance by Tim Roth struggles to find the origins of language and human consciousness. This is the plot at its simplest. Adding more details would involve bringing up transmigration of souls rejuvenation Nazis multiple personalities Chinese philosophy dead languages I'll have to add Protoelamite to my vocabulary and a few more things.Technically speaking the movie is outstanding I understand this movie was a critical and commercial failure but still the spite it has received from every awards institution is disheartening. The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr rivals anything made in 2007. The beautiful music by Osvaldo Golijov is superior to anything Dario Marianelli Alberto Iglesias or Michael Giachinno composed this year. The makeup is amazing it has to be considering it needs to realistically portray Tim Roth and the beautiful Alexandra Maria Lara as old people. The art direction and costume design are also beautiful this movie starts in the 30's and goes all the way to the '50s travelling across the globe and making occasional flashbacks to 19th century Romenia so imagine how many different sets and eras they had to recreate. How come this aspect of the movie was ignored by the Academy or BAFTAS for instance is beyond me.The acting is superb and the movie benefits from a fantastic ensemble Tim Roth Alexandra Maria Lara Bruno Ganz Andr Hennicke and even Matt Damon in a cameo. Without so many good actors especially without Roth the movie could have been unbearable. For truth be told Coppola is trying to bite more than he can chew. He certainly has intellectual ambitions in this movie which is admirable nowadays more admirable is that he made this movie as he envisioned it without interference but he lacks the panache to pull them off. Having been ready for it I didn't find it too offputting but I can understand why other people would react so aggressively towards it.'Youth Without Youth' is a fascinating demanding frustrating movie. It's definitely not for everyone. But it still has a lot of artistic merit and if anything else it shows Coppola still knows how to bring big ideas into movies which only leaves me more enthused about his next movie 'Tetro'.".

Without so many good actors especially without Roth the movie could have been unbearable. For truth be told Coppola is trying to bite more than he can chew. He certainly has intellectual ambitions in this movie which is admirable nowadays more admirable is that he made this movie as he envisioned it without interference but he lacks the panache to pull them off. Having been ready for it I didn't find it too offputting but I can understand why other people would react so aggressively towards it.'Youth Without Youth' is a fascinating demanding frustrating movie. It's definitely not for everyone. But it still has a lot of artistic merit and if anything else it shows Coppola still knows how to bring big ideas into movies which only leaves me more enthused about his next movie 'Tetro'.";

Since then the legend of cinema has walked away from being a director for hire. I guess he is still smarting from the failure of his Zoetrope Studios.In Youth without Youth Coppola turns to European art cinema and not for the first time. His black and white Rumble Fish was heavily influenced by the German Expressionist style.Tim Roth plays Dominic a 70 year old man in Pre World War 2 Romania who is struck by lightning and is rejuvenated astounding his doctor Bruno Ganz. Dominic is 30 years younger with a regenerated body he even grows new teeth he undergoes various tests put to him by his doctors. However it is not only the physical body that has improved also his mental faculties have gone through a quantum leap. This also arouses the interests of the Nazis once the war erupts.Of course Dominic hides that he has an alter ego that converses with him and seems to have enhanced powers himself. Also whereas the older Dominic was striving to finish his life's work in the origins of linguistics now he has the time to research and write further. He speaks many Oriental languages now he can read by just looking at a book.As the war rages on Dominic escapes to Switzerland to continues his research. In the 1950s a meeting with a woman called Veronica who reminds him of Laura a lost love turns the film further on its head. Veronica transmigrates to another soul back in time such as an early disciple of Buddha in ancient India. She keeps going back further in time speaking in ancient languages enabling Dominic to get very near to the first spoken text but at the risk of losing Veronica for good.The film is a mixture of vision and story. It could easily be something that could had been made by that other American filmmakers Terrence Malick or David Lynch. The film sets its stall out with the European Arthouse cinema style it is not a literal movie as the film feels dreamlike. You do wonder if this is all a dream of Dominic after being struck by lightning.The film is little known but I was surprised by how accessible it was and how much I enjoyed the film. Coppola has never been afraid to experiment and at times he has misfired badly. Even here some of the scenes set in India does not convince as they are too modern with modern cars driving past. There is even a shot of The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai that crops up in scenes set in Uttar Pradesh.However this is an intriguing experimental even a slightly unnerving film. Roth should be given plaudits for drawing the viewer in and keeping them invested in his character.Youth without Youth shows the world that Coppola is still a master filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a 10 year hiatus from directing Francis Ford Coppola returns with his new film Youth Without Youth. Based on a novella by Romanian philosopher Mircea Eliade Coppola admitted that this film is not intended for general audience appeal and is a very personal project that was ultimately brought to fruition for his own satisfaction. Sadly that is undeniably apparent as Youth Without Youth struggles to find its place amongst genres is continually bogged down by monotonous dialogue and his overwrought by nonsensical visuals and a convoluted storyline.Dominic Matei Tim Roth is disenchanted by his inability to finish his life's work which is to research the origins of language. As thoughts of suicide cross the 70 year old man's mind he is struck by lightning. He wakes up to discover that over the course of 10 weeks in the hospital he has miraculously made a full recovery and has been rejuvenated with the body of a 35yearold and a fresh set of teeth. He also ascertains that he has an extremely advanced brain that can store limitless amounts of information and that he can gain the knowledge of books by simply passing his hand over them. It is 1941 and he realizes that he's become a valuable scientific specimen and must flee the Gestapo which is in search of him for research by Dr. Rudolph one of Hitler's top scientists. He learns to forge documents and lay low and through the course of the next couple of decades he rediscovers his true love Laura Alexandra Maria Lara the woman he loved and lost who has apparently undergone a similar phenomenon.If that sounds unnecessarily complex or genre transcending it's because it is. So circuitous in fact that the story often fluctuates between illogical proportions and absolute nonsense. Dominic makes a reference at the end of the film about a king who dreams of being a butterfly who dreams of being a king. It probably has some sort of meaning to this horribly incoherent mess which on the most lucid of scales is essentially about the inability to conquer time. Symbolism with three roses frequents the film as does a doppelganger for Dominic much like Jekyll and Hyde except that he is visible most often only in mirrors and they both exist at the same time. Neither makes much sense although Dominic's alternate personalities arise from the lightning strike phenomenon. Attempting to touch upon the reasons behind Dominic and Laura's conditions scientific jargon such as transmigration of the soul and mental psychosis are offered although it's unlikely that the audience actually cares at that point.Youth Without Youth has several interesting visuals including subtle swastikas that grace notebooks and garter belts to alert the suspicious Dominic and to notify the audience of the time period. Upside down camera angles as well as sideways and slanted shots look unique although they really serve no purpose. The cinematography flounders under the heavy amount of narration and convoluted dialogue that gums up the flow and pacing of the film. The lack of a specific genre hurts too as there are clearly sciencefiction aspects at work and yet the setting is during World War II and the look is of noir and drama. Perhaps the least sciencefiction of all sciencefiction films Youth Without Youth also includes moments of schizophrenia and hallucinations to add to the disorder.The film can't seem to figure out what it wants to be so resultantly the audience won't be able to figure out what exactly is supposed to be going on. If it is indeed a work done solely to please its creator then the studio and Coppola should anticipate the negative reviews that criticize its lack of focus purpose and meaning  especially to those of us who haven't been sipping wine nonstop for the last 10 years.Mike Massie".

Dominic makes a reference at the end of the film about a king who dreams of being a butterfly who dreams of being a king. It probably has some sort of meaning to this horribly incoherent mess which on the most lucid of scales is essentially about the inability to conquer time. Symbolism with three roses frequents the film as does a doppelganger for Dominic much like Jekyll and Hyde except that he is visible most often only in mirrors and they both exist at the same time. Neither makes much sense although Dominic's alternate personalities arise from the lightning strike phenomenon. Attempting to touch upon the reasons behind Dominic and Laura's conditions scientific jargon such as transmigration of the soul and mental psychosis are offered although it's unlikely that the audience actually cares at that point.Youth Without Youth has several interesting visuals including subtle swastikas that grace notebooks and garter belts to alert the suspicious Dominic and to notify the audience of the time period. Upside down camera angles as well as sideways and slanted shots look unique although they really serve no purpose. The cinematography flounders under the heavy amount of narration and convoluted dialogue that gums up the flow and pacing of the film. The lack of a specific genre hurts too as there are clearly sciencefiction aspects at work and yet the setting is during World War II and the look is of noir and drama. Perhaps the least sciencefiction of all sciencefiction films Youth Without Youth also includes moments of schizophrenia and hallucinations to add to the disorder.The film can't seem to figure out what it wants to be so resultantly the audience won't be able to figure out what exactly is supposed to be going on. If it is indeed a work done solely to please its creator then the studio and Coppola should anticipate the negative reviews that criticize its lack of focus purpose and meaning  especially to those of us who haven't been sipping wine nonstop for the last 10 years.Mike Massie";

Coppola has created a fragmented ruminative strange and potentially pretentious odyssey through parts of 20th century history as his mysteriously revivified protagonist struggles with issues of love mortality and the roots of human language over the course of three decades.

The film made me think that Coppola's central thematic concern is that of individual loneliness  that striving to achieve greatness which puts a man it's always a man outside of genuine relationships destined in the grasp of achievement to lose his true love who stands for his soul. Michael Corleone and Count Dracula are both worthwhile comparison characters. Youth Without Youth is haunting and fertile without being a wholly successful film.

	schema:reviewBody "A note first on style to me Youth Without Youth is one of the most gorgeous modern films it's one of the few films where the production team are exerting control to the extent when they can be described as using a palette. In this case the colours orange and blue predominate beautifully. There has been some suggestion in modern criticism particularly in Sight  Sound that orange  teal is a ugly fad that noone will miss I think Youth Without Youth is definitely deserving of special treatment. Certainly the blue here is less dingy than elsewhere in the orange  teal canon. The film is about a once brilliantly gifted scholar Dominik Mattei played by Tim Roth who appears to have wasted his life and is now an old man when suddenly he gets a second chance and returns to youth. The film is interesting how did he waste his life? Is it because he didn't complete his life's work a great book which was to contain a grand unifying theory on consciousness and the origins of language or because he didn't pay enough attention to his beloved Laura?There are two main points of interest in the film for me one relates to the allure of the situation Mattei is in and the dilemma it presents and the other to the structure. As a teenager I read Daniel Keyes' 1959 novella Flowers For Algernon which in two different forms has the rare prestige of having won both of science fiction's key writing awards the Hugo and the Nebula. It's about an experiment performed on Charlie a man with a very low IQ who as a result of the experiment progressively becomes the most intelligent man alive. At one point he criticises the scientist who performs the experiment mentioning that the best rebuttal of his theories yet written has come from India. The scientist says he has not ever heard of the document which he discovers was written in Hindustani and which he was therefore not in the position to read anyway. Charlie records I asked Dr. Strauss how Nemur could refute Rahajamati's attack on his method and results if Nemur couldn't even read them in the first place. That strange look on Dr. Strauss' face can mean only one of two things. Either he doesn't want to tell Nemur what they're saying in India or else  and this worries me  Dr. Strauss doesn't know either.One key point of Flowers For Algernon and also this film is the allure of supernatural intelligence what would our thoughts be if we had IQs in the thousands and could read books at a glance? The key tone of the Flowers is sadness as we find that Charlie's new found faculties are temporary in nature and subside gradually. This tone dovetails with the film as well because another of the key features of both artworks is the conflict between intellect and emotion. Is it more important to love or to embrace aloof intellectual pursuits? My slanter tells you all you need to know about my position! In any case it's a very sad story and I believe that is the heart of Youth Without Youth as well it's an elegy.The parts of the film where senile Mattei is shown are very poignant and remind me of Mr Blank from Paul Auster's book Travels in the Scriptorium. Both men are vaguely aware of their past mistakes and also both men are utterly alienated. A kind of tender nastiness pervades these bits if that isn't too oxymoronic. Francis Ford Coppola has mentioned his identification with Mattei particularly regarding his failure to complete his scifi project Megalopolis.My other point concerns the structure. There's a passage towards the end where the Mattei describes an oriental tale of a dream where a prince dreams that he is a butterfly which dreams it is a prince who dreams he was a butterfly et cetera. It's not clear in this film just which parts are dreamt and which not or whether that matters. It's more that the overall aesthetic conception of Mattei's story of the prince and the butterfly is what matters. In this sense it is similar to the Saragossa Manuscript or the 1001 Arabian Nights where it is to a large extent the structure itself that intoxicates.There is also the issue of familiar to readers of Watchmen of whether demigod powers should be used for good or evil whether indeed it is right to interfere in human destiny at all or whether they should be directed internally towards solipsism. This makes Roth is well cast he is a typecast baddie and this aura of badness here allows this ambiguity to take root. The film also sounds wonderful and this is mainly due to the ethereal tone of the cymbalom. If you liked Tim Roth in this film I suggest you watch another movie in which he stars The Legend of 1900 directed by Giuseppe Tornatore which is also wonderful in a similar enigmatic way.And this review is dedicated to Claire who is the first rose.".

	schema:headline " A great director lost in Romania";
	schema:reviewBody "This meandering recreation of a novella by Miorcea Eliade famous as the author of 'The Myth of the Eternal Return' largely set and shot in Eliade's native Romania is Coppola's first movie in ten years. Its satisfyingly lush miseen'scne and sweeping scope show the hand of a master who's used the relatively economical facilities of Eastern Europe to great effect. But the hand falters and the effort is misguided. 'Youth WIthout Youth' is a pointless farrago of time travel and creaky science whose vaguely tendentious arc is puzzling to say the least and wholly uninvolving.Don't take my word for itit's been a while since I read that book by Eliade in college and I probably didn't really understand it all that well at the timebut the author who's linked with Jung and taught at the University of Chicago was keen on 'hierophany' or the idea of the manifestation of the sacred in the profane everyday world. He thought that was what myths were all about breakthroughs of the sacred into the profane or manifestations of the divine which he liked to call 'hierophanies.' Eliade was one of those thinkers like Karl Jung and Joseph Campbell who found a way to make sense of all the world's stories. He also had a troubling sympathy for extreme right wing politics.Youth Without Youth is a story about a seventyyearold man Professor Dominic Matei Tim Roth a brilliant but funbling professor in Romania in 1938 who's still grieving over a broken engagement with his lost love Laura the protean Romanian actress Alexandra Maria Lara forty years before and despairs of ever completing his lifelong project a book rather like Mr. Casaubon's Key to All Mythologies in George Eliot's 'Middlemarch' that traces the ultimate origin of the world's languages. Reviewers suggestand Coppola may himself have confirmed thisthat the director identifies with Matei's frustration due to the foreverdelayed completion of his Megalopolis project. And here is where Eliade's fantasy comes in Matei's struck with a bolt of lightening that ought to have fried him down into a puddle of dark essence but instead he quickly revives in hospital as a much younger man who somehow or otherdon't ask mecan bond anew with Laura and through her because she seems to have become a medium timetraveling back to Sanscrit then Babylonian and who knows what to the origin of tongues.But wait a minute. Is this the feisty offkilter Tim Roth who blended so well into Quentin Tarantino's feistier moments in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction? Do we really feel comfortable watching him earnestly seeking the most primitive of all tongues? Roth has proved himself as versatile as Ms. Lara but somehow he lacks the gravitas or the good looks for this job.Anyway Professor Stanciulescu Bruno Ganz the supervising physician wants to observe Matei's miraculous revival but a Nazi doctor starts sneaking in to steal him away using a sexy undercover agent known only as the Woman in Room 6 Alexandra Pirici. Things get hokier and hokier as a Doppelganger Matei pops in representing his more rational scientific side and Matt Damon helps him change identities and slip away from the bad guys. Fast but no very forward to 1955 and Matei finds a young woman who exactly resembles his lost Laura. She's hiding in a cave after a car crash and speaking only Sanscrit.This is like a series of Twilight Zone episodes cut together without proper transitions. Two hours isn't a terribly terribly long time for a movie to run but it can seem pretty long when things get this dicey and it didn't help to have to stop right in the middle of all this and stare into space for a while during the traditional Italian Intervallo. In the end the story of a Faustian search for the world's secrets and for eternal youth just sort of dribbles away into a finale that lacks finalityor even closing credits.Seen in the Metropolitan Cinema on the Via del Corso in Rome October 30 2007 with the original soundtrack. It was moved here from the recent Rome Film Festival as was Roy Andersson's 'You the Living.' Unlike the latter it was being shown with the original soundtrack but considering the stilted and often dubbed dialogue that was less of a virtue than it might sound. The most interesting thing about this movie is Coppol's largely successful effort to produce grandiose effects using the bargain location of Romania. To some extent that worked. But this isn't the first instance of Coppola going out on a limb on a project. This time a masterpiece most definitely was not the result. The conventional cinematography is attractive but the occasional use of upsidedown shots is pointless and the music isn't very interesting.".
