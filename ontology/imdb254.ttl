I'm not a big fan of horror or this type of Hollywood slasher movie as I find them too obvious and not scary. However here the gore is well used and the general creepy mood wins the film.  The movement of the deceased Dr Vannacutt is very creepy and is much better than some of the gore.Sadly the final 20 minutes feels it needs to reveal a bigger evil and the secrets of the house are brought to life in boom of CGI beasties.  At this point it reverts to form and because just another Hollywood creature feature and it is a bit of a let down.  However up to this point it works very well and it's real creepy.The cast are all pretty good and do camp' when necessary but don't take away from the terror that's coming later.  Rush plays nicely to the camp in his homage to Price's role in the original.  Jensen Diggs Gallagher and Kattan all do well and the cast do better than the scream queens that usual inhabit these films.Overall the film starts like any other Hollywood horror but the clever direction creepy music and imaginative visuals of Dr Vannacutt all create a creepy feel to the film that is better than the gore that also comes.  The final section slides back into standard fare with the old CGI evil coming to get us  but up till then it's surprisingly good stuff.".

I'm not sure  maybe it is the normality of being like those that are insane which brings a more genuine horror  to us.  Whatever it is House on Haunted Hill certainly uses all the mental derangement cliches to full effect.  I could easily pan this film by sayingand rightly so that its predecessor the original House on Haunted Hill directed by William Castle is a far superior film.  That Castle's film was filled with better acting better timing and easily a better script.  But I liked this film which is not really a remake entirely.  It has many elements that are not in the first film  most of them centering around the mental aspect aforementioned.  The house in this film was once an asylum where people...thousands perhaps..were brutally butchered in the name of mental good health.  The house is scary.  Empty corridors large vast rooms incredible special effects all add to the frightening aspects of the film. The biggest problem with the film is that much of it just doesn't add up in terms of making sense of the plot.  The film fortunately is more special effects driven than plot driven and at least is able to deliver the goods in that arena.  The acting is pretty good with all the leads really doing quite a good job.  Geoffrey Rush gives his best Vincent Price impressionpencilthin mustache and all delivering lines with bravura gusto.  The other exceptional standout is Chris Kattan as Watson Pritchard. Kattan is just wonderful in the role showcasing his obvious talent.  As far as great horror films go...this film is adequate yet very thrilling exciting and entertaining.  If you are like me and love the old one...just look at this film as a totally different entity.

	schema:headline " NOT A BAD REMAKE";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a bad remake.  It is R rated so parents beware this is NOT the Price classic of 1958.  Within the first scene there is gore surgery on a wide awake man violence the inmates of the asylum break loose and attack the staff and nudity uniforms ripped open on the women.  This is crucial to the plot Hill House is not the same murder house from the original it's a former asylum for the criminally insane where torture and experimentations are done on the inmates.  A fire breaks out and all but five die.Jump to present day.  Multimillionaire Steven Price is the name a nod to Vincent? played by Geoffrey Rush doing his best sideshow barker impersonationWilliams Castle impersonation and wife Famke Janssen are having a party in the restored former asylum.  The guest's trip to the house is still via several hearse and from this point much of the original plot is maintained.The part that bothered me about the arrival scene at the house  was the inappropriate song.  It set the wrong mood and I worried about what was going to be next. Thankfully the rest of the score except the end title was strictly orchestral and sent a nice dark mood to try to help to scare you.

This is crucial to the plot Hill House is not the same murder house from the original it's a former asylum for the criminally insane where torture and experimentations are done on the inmates.

The guest's trip to the house is still via several hearse and from this point much of the original plot is maintained.The part that bothered me about the arrival scene at the house  was the inappropriate song.  It set the wrong mood and I worried about what was going to be next. Thankfully the rest of the score except the end title was strictly orchestral and sent a nice dark mood to try to help to scare you.

But anyways House on Haunted Hill is of course remake of the same title back in the day the original star of the movie was Vincent Price it was spooky and creepy the only problem? The original has some what lost it's effect it had on people don't get me wrong it's still an excellent film but compared to a lot of horror films of today it seems rather tame. So of course you know what that means Let's remake the story and add tons of computer CGI and gore! But was this remake really that bad? Actually I'd say that I did enjoy it it had good suspense and very grizzly images that will stay in your head. It's a pretty decent update of this chilling ghost story and never lets go.The film is set in an abandoned asylum where numerous murders were committed in the past. The head of the facility Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt performed grotesque experiments and medical procedures on the patients killing many in the process. The hospital was closed when some of the patients escaped killing almost the entire staff and burning the hospital. We then meet Evelyn a spoiled trophy wife and Steven Price an amusement park mogul with a wicked sense of humor each of whom would gladly kill the other. Evelyn fancies spectacular parties so Steven leases the house from the owner Watson Pritchett for his Halloween birthday bash. Evelyn gives Steven a guest list two pages long he shreds it to spite her and then creates one of his own. The five people who show up for the party Jennifer Jenzer Eddie Baker Melissa Margaret Marr Dr. Donald Blackburn and Pritchett himself  aren't the ones he invited. Neither Evelyn nor Steven know who they are. Despite this Price continues the party's theme offering a million dollars to anyone who stays in the house and survives until morning. Of course this isn't any easy task as the ghosts are about and ready for a bloody good time.While I would recommend for nostalgic reasons to stick to the original as it is a true classic I say that this remake is still worth the look. It's definitely worth it in the dark I can't tell how much this one scene frightened me beyond compare when the reporter is filming in the basement to get an idea of what the asylum was like and the ghosts only appear on camera she sees them torturing a patient and they look up at her and goosebumps are the least of your worries at this point. All in all this is a very decent remake compared to other sad remakes we had that year like The Haunting. But still I wonder what Vincent Price would say if he was able to see how they updated the story maybe even do his little rap Thriller style! You know I had to get that in.610".

Working from Robb White's original story screenwriter Dick Beebe and director William Malone  previously responsible for such unassuming Bmovies as SCARED TO DEATH 1980 and CREATURE 1985  remain faithful to Castle's original whilst goosing the material with newfangled effects technology and levels of gore which Castle had been denied during his lifetime. Production designer David F. Klassen has also updated the eponymous house a clifftop monstrosity whose plunging Art deco exterior masks the Gothic ruin within haunted by monstrous spirits who 'come alive' and terrorize a cast of defiantly modern characters including Geoffrey Rush as a cynical fairground entrepeneur clearly modelled after Vincent Price and Famke Janssen as his beautiful bitchy duplicitous wife.The film's uneven tone veering between horror and humor and back again is likely to divide viewers from the outset but the horror scenes are played with remarkable gravity and attentive viewers will spot visual references to the likes of GHOST STORY 1981 and JACOB'S LADDER 1990 particularly a 'guest appearance' by one of the most hairraising phantoms from that former title. Some of the original film's charm has been lost along the way replaced by profanity and splatter though not as much as some outraged critics would have you believe and there's nothing in the remake which compares to the bloodfreezing shock induced by Carol Ohmart's encounter with a blind whitehaired ghost in Castle's version but Malone's update deserves a mark for trying.

	schema:reviewBody "THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 1999 Starring Geoffrey Rush Famke Janssen Taye Diggs Chris Kattan Peter Gallagher and Bridgette Wilson Director William Malone   Running Time 96 minutes   Rated R for strong terror violence and gore language and brief nudityBy Blake FrenchIt's been such a long time since I have been truly terrified by a movie that is supposed to be scary. To my pleasant surprise however The House on Haunted Hill did scare me out of my wits at times. Curiously I find myself disliking the film because of the flawed characters and structure yet recommending it due to the enticing and thrilling material contained within the tensionfilled story line.The first thing I would like to do in reviewing The House on Haunted Hill is compare and contrast it with the milder horror flick released earlier this year called The Haunting. That film surprised America with an unexpected PG13 rating unlike the appropriately Rrated The House on Haunted Hill. Although The Haunting did work due to an intriguing story line it missed the fact that in order to please an audience attending a screamfeast it needs to do some experimenting with its atmosphere characters and antagonism so we know what we're up against. That film had little to no violent gory or shocking material only contained marginally passable psychological terror. That is the main reason why that very film directed by Jon De Bont didn't manage to become a memorable summer movie experience.Unlike The Haunting The House on Haunted Hill is not afraid to graphically pick off its characters one by one in a grizzly manor to provoke horrifying fright in an audience. It is great fun to predict who is going to be next to go and how they'll be murdered. Personally I've been longing for this kind of material for quite some time now.This film does however have a lot in common with The Haunting. For example both movies are shot in somewhat of an oldfashioned stylean effective characteristic.  Both offer quite a bit of scary material. But The House on Haunted Hill seems to be more of an ambitious if flawed thriller. The story centers on a clan of five strangers who each are offered one million dollars if they spend the night in a closeddown Psychiatric Institute that was massacred by its own patients after a rebellion in the 1930's. In charge of this whole arrangement a twisted and rich theme park owner Steven Price Geoffrey Rush and his wife Evelyn Famke Janssen who have been experiencing marital problems for some time now. They're throwing together this party for Price's birthday but when an elaborate and efficient security system traps them in weird events begin to occur. Things that may or may not be part of an intricate plan to induce money murder and survival.What or who is responsible the unusual assurances at the institute?

What exactly is the instate haunted by? Why did the patients rebel in the 30's and not sooner? Their motives are clear but why wait so long to do something about the hell accruing because of their doctors? The House on Haunted Hill is not the movie to answer these questions. Neither is it the film educated enough to properly develop an explanation of the characters to us. Stephen Price is developed well in one of the film's first scenes. But for the rest of the characters each of them saying their name and what they do for a living doesn't quite cut it here. Because of this the movie's many plot and character twists aren't as effective as they should be because we don't know the characters to begin with. So if the movie tries to tell us that someone is not who they appear to be how are we supposed to believe itwe never really knew who they were from the beginning?Also to this film's dismay the direction is all over the wall here. William Malone does a good job of focusing on each of the scary elements but not on the characters. When they walk slowly down a dark deserted hallway they seem to get off focus of where they really are and the circumstances they are in. Also nearly crucifying the production there aren't any boundaries here. Seemingly anything and everything can happen. At least The Haunting had some guidelines of where reality is taken into account.The Psychiatric Institute is a perfect terrifying atmosphere for this movie to be placed in. The fact that the strange and seemingly dangerous occurrences could be part of Price's trickery or something else on that matter just strengthens the drama more and increase the line of raising tension. The filmmakers take advantage of most of the opportunities they receive to use the house's many dark hallways and creepy chambers. In particular there is a especially disturbing sequence in a chamber which is supposed to make an insane man sane or a sane man insane that produces such a horrifying perspective of a character's mind it is almost safe to say the filmmakers went too far over the edge here.I also find to my liking the film's performances which are creative and full of energy. Geoffrey Rush is a great stuck up fraud and he is able to accomplish much with his character due to his wonderfully fresh development unlike the other characters. Famke Janssen Deep Rising 1998 I also am surprised to enjoy in a sly conniving role. Taye Diggs can't really do much in this type of movie he is more fit in films like The Best Man or How Stella Got Her Groove Back but what he does seems underplayed. Who really stands out here is the always appealing Peter Gallagher who brings a hidden regularity to his character. But regardless of his character he doesn't scenesteal nor does he overact.The House on Haunted Hill may be a very flawed film but at lest it serves its purpose to provoke fear in an audience. It is a very close call for me recommending the film or not and a medium review is given. Someday I might regret my decision to warrant The House on Haunted Hill with a minor recommendation. But as of this day and age I feel obligated to.Brought to you by Warner Bros.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 1999 Starring Geoffrey Rush Famke Janssen Taye Diggs Chris Kattan Peter Gallagher and Bridgette Wilson Director William Malone   Running Time 96 minutes   Rated R for strong terror violence and gore language and brief nudityBy Blake FrenchIt's been such a long time since I have been truly terrified by a movie that is supposed to be scary. To my pleasant surprise however The House on Haunted Hill did scare me out of my wits at times. Curiously I find myself disliking the film because of the flawed characters and structure yet recommending it due to the enticing and thrilling material contained within the tensionfilled story line.The first thing I would like to do in reviewing The House on Haunted Hill is compare and contrast it with the milder horror flick released earlier this year called The Haunting. That film surprised America with an unexpected PG13 rating unlike the appropriately Rrated The House on Haunted Hill. Although The Haunting did work due to an intriguing story line it missed the fact that in order to please an audience attending a screamfeast it needs to do some experimenting with its atmosphere characters and antagonism so we know what we're up against. That film had little to no violent gory or shocking material only contained marginally passable psychological terror. That is the main reason why that very film directed by Jon De Bont didn't manage to become a memorable summer movie experience.Unlike The Haunting The House on Haunted Hill is not afraid to graphically pick off its characters one by one in a grizzly manor to provoke horrifying fright in an audience. It is great fun to predict who is going to be next to go and how they'll be murdered. Personally I've been longing for this kind of material for quite some time now.This film does however have a lot in common with The Haunting. For example both movies are shot in somewhat of an oldfashioned stylean effective characteristic.  Both offer quite a bit of scary material. But The House on Haunted Hill seems to be more of an ambitious if flawed thriller. The story centers on a clan of five strangers who each are offered one million dollars if they spend the night in a closeddown Psychiatric Institute that was massacred by its own patients after a rebellion in the 1930's. In charge of this whole arrangement a twisted and rich theme park owner Steven Price Geoffrey Rush and his wife Evelyn Famke Janssen who have been experiencing marital problems for some time now.

	schema:reviewBody "The similarities between William Castle's campy 1959 original and this typical Hollywood remake are kept to a minimum. We have the premise of 5 people who're offered a million  if they survive spending a night in 'the house' and Rush who brings tribute to Vincent Price who played the lead role in the original. Other than this Malone just follows the routine remakestandards meaning bigger louder and more spectacular. If you're not too harsh this actually is a pretty enjoyable movie and  at times  a successful mixture between an oldfashioned 'haunted house' chiller and a modern special effects playground. Thanks to some sort of miracle Malone managed to cast class actor Geoffrey Rush and a more than decent supportive cast. Rush is talented enough to make his performance of eccentric impresario Steven Price look like a homage to Vincent Price instead of doing a lame impersonation. To me however the absolute star of this film is Jeffrey Combs ReAnimator who plays the small role of the demented Dr. Vannacutt. As usual Combs' character is the cause of all horror and his grimaces are more diabolical then ever. He's an amazing horror icon and I simply can't get why he isn't enjoying an immortal successstatus. Until about 5 minutes before the ending the use of CGI is imaginative and not irritating at all. The finale is overly fake and kinda ruins the film. If you're not too demanding The House on Haunted Hill guarantees a lot of fun and a few scares. Definitely a better remake than Jan De Bont's The Haunting and Steve Beck's 13 Ghosts.".

It's fun and has creepy 20s flashbacks galore throws in plenty of blood and adds a plot twist or two to the original story.The plot concerns Geoffrey Rush's amusement park entrepreneur inviting a small number of guests he's never previously met to his wife's birthday party intending to host it in a disused asylum that was the scene of a terrible tragedy. However the couple hate each other with a passion and each may be planning to murder the other before the night is over.

It appears they are the descendants of those who died the first time around and now the house won't let them out...Rush's character Steven Price is surely a homage to good ol' Vincent of that ilk and superhero fans can enjoy the sight of Famke Janssen from XMen and Ali Larter from Heroes amongst the cast. The flashback sequences are excellent and appear to have had an influence on games like Bioshock and the old creepy crypts of the house are genuinely unsettling. House On Haunted Hill has excellent production design and it's always great to see Jeffry Combes show up as the sinister Doctor. There are flaws however. The characters are not particularly welldeveloped so we don't care what happens to most of them much and the story is very diffuse not focusing on anything in detail before moving on to the next set piece. But House isn't bad as horror remakes go  in fact it matches the original and is bound to keep the gore hounds happy. Recommended as good roller coaster ride.".

The only reason and there really isn't ANY that you should see this film is for the performances by three lovely and talented actresses Ali Larter Famke Janssen and especially Bridgette Wilson.  They make the film worthwhile or at least the scenes that they're in.The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because one of my favorite actresses Bridgette Wilson was in it and I was excited about seeing her camping it up in a horror movie like she did a few years ago in I Know What You Did Last Summer.  And sure enough there she is with video camera in hand as pseudocelebrity Melissa Margaret Marr the best dressed and biggest ego of the group.  Just when I think the movie might not be so bad with her in it what happens?  She dies!  That's right.  Within the first fortyfive minutes Bridgette Wilson is already gone and there's nothing left but Famke Janssen who does all she can  as Geoffrey Rush's psychotic wife before she herself too dies and Ali Larter who deserves so much better than this movie and can be seen in a much better movie right now Final Destination.  As for the scares puhleese.  The only frightening thing is that people still pay to see movies like this.  The cheesy original was scarier anyway and had more fun with its cast.  Nothing is truly scary at all although it is a little gruesome at times.  So while I wait for Bridgette Wilson to do another horror film I'll have to say that HOHH is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.".

The film is great when they are haunted by the ghosts of the past inmates and by the sinister doctor. And even better when conspiracies start to unravel. At the end however the film ruins its nightmare inducing ghost story with a CGI megaspirit. The ending is a predictable and a stale waste of film. The director could have done it much better with a lower budget ending and the clever editing that made the rest of the film scary.Also a surprise ending would have worked a hell of a lot better then the Hollywood mush that it did end with. Overall though i think that it's a great film to rent if you like the haunted house story. Just turn it off before the ending ruins it. 610".

Unless the story is particularly deep or the plot difficult to follow subsequent viewings generally do not change my initial reaction to a movie to any great degree. So as I sat to watch The House on Haunted Hill I wasn't expecting much. The film is not without some major faults but overall I enjoyed my second experience. Scenes such as the operating room flashback or touches like the hall of embalmed bodies are the stuff of nightmares as far as I'm concerned.The house itself is another major bonus to the movie. The interior is presented lit and shot in a manner that creates almost immediate atmosphere. The seemingly endless corridors the surgicalmedical rooms with their devices of torture and the blood present almost everywhere added to my feeling that the house is the real star of the movie.But as I said the movie does have its faults. I'll just mention two First  paper thin characters. It's really difficult to care about many of the character in this movie because we know nothing about most of them. Other than Geoffrey Rush's character the others are there merely for the slaughter. They aren't real.Second  the ending. This appears to be everyone's major complaint and with good reason. All of the atmosphere and creepiness the movie had built is destroyed the moment the CGI darkness makes an appearance. It is so out of place with everything that had gone on before. It's to bad that the writers couldn't come up with a good ending  I would have much preferred an ending involving the doctor or former patients. The movie had been heading in that direction all along.When I initially saw this in the theater I would have rated it a 410. My opinion has now however changed. I may never consider it a masterpiece but there are some moments that are very effective and make it worth watching.".

I loved this as a kidOK so maybe now it's not my favorite but being that this movie stayed with me as a kid and helped fuel my interest in movies I'd say there was plenty of good to this.What I liked best about it was the adventure. In these times a movie like this would never be made at all or at least not without computer generated monsters chasing the family and lots of car chases. The best thing about this movie is it's earthiness and tranquility. The feeling of being in the middle of nowhereI can appreciate all types of environments but there is something so beautiful about being in the country when it's perfectly still with just yourself and the environment. In this movie that feeling is created beautifully it touches the nature and quiet country feeling. The scenery and country feeling created is beautiful.It is also not boring at all as this family struggles to make it out in the middle of nowhere.Lots of wildlife and lots of Action packed adventure.Lots of adversities to overcome. And as mentioned the cinematography is greatyou'll feel like your out there in the wilderness too!I'm not saying this is the best movie in the worldbut for those who can appreciate a story revolving around a family and their struggles out in the wilderness it's great. I was enamored as a kid. I wanted to be out there with them! I think this is a good movie and would give it at least an 8. Of coarse it wont appeal to everyone but shouldn't be forgotten either.".

It is wholesome family value oriented and in general a great joy for kids. It makes you want to go out camping and enjoy what little wilderness we have left in the US. While I do have to agree with other posters that you simply can't up and leave as they do in this film ie  no preparation re hunting fishing planting learning etc. you just can't fit all that into a film. And it would bore the kids to death. It is a familychildren's film after all not an adult action flick.I highly recommend this film to anyone with children.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie as a kid and loved it. Today I saw it again with my wife and two kids and loved it. There are aspects that are completely unrealistic i.e. a welder knows how to build a very nice log cabin a fast grizzly does not run down the little girl who happens to be ten feet away the man is not seriously mangled by the mountain lion the dog is not killed by the wolves etc. but what I loved about it was the fact that the family does what so many families long to doget out of Dodge and head for the high country.People weren't meant to be stuck in a box 247 because they are enslaved to a house payment the monster SUV and all the other trappings of civilization. Families were meant to hang together and kids were meant to learn from parentsnot MTV the druggies on the corner or their friends at school. Parents to your children love is spelled TIME. This film reinforces that notion and illustrates that this misguided idea of quality time being more important than quantity is ridiculous. The pragmatic message from this film is for parents to sell the BMW and buy a Chevy sell the mansion on the hill and buy the house in the valley chuck the ladderclimbing job and take the one that allows you to be home for dinner every night. After all nobody every regretted not spending more time at work but they did regret not spending more time with the kiddos.I believe that it's a movie that was ahead of its time and I'd love to see a more modern and more realistic take on the subject. Besides it's a good family film which is a rarity these days. It's not a perfect film by any standard but the scenery is beautiful and the plot is visionary. That's why I give it an 8 out of 10.".

Although the action scenes may startle young ones  they probably WON'T with all the stuff they see in the movies today. And yes the movies DON'T show all the important stuff like how they knew how to build a cabin etc but it's a MOVIE not REAL LIFE. If you want REALITY I would strongly suggest you watch PBS's Frontier House. That was GREAT and it CHALLENGED 3 families to live an 1883 lifestyle. No easy way out here folks! These people were REALLY doing it. Otherwise I will ALWAYS cherish these movies and when I have children of my own share them with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of hippies living in Los Angeles who were forced to grow up and get jobs when they had kids decide they've had enough of the smoggy city and pack up their family to move to the Rocky Mountains. Once there they play with bears and befriend a grizzled old mountain man. That is when they aren't running for their lives from wolves or a big grizzly named Three Toes.Ah the Wilderness Family. Despite its laughable premise it's actually one of the better of the getting back to nature genre of family dramas that popped up in the 1960s and 1970s when the times they were achanging and people thought by the 1980s the world would be overpopulated with unbreathable air and no natural resources left. Really there's not much wrong with the idea of living the natural life and getting away from the crowded cities. But these movies were often so irresponsibly naive treating living off the land like it' s a cake walk and there are just as many Disneystyle friendly wild animals as there are ones that will kill you. Oh and they never talk about bugs. As anyone who has ever been camping can attest bugs are the worst. Nature's PR guy should get a raise for keeping bugs out of the brochures. And I don't want to even get into understanding why these movies all seem to have old men wandering around the mountains being friendly with kids.Like I said this movie is one of the better examples of this genre. At least here it is shown that you have to work to live in the wild and there are some dangers unlike the completely unrealistic My Side of the Mountain where a kid goes to live in the wilderness and befriends animals and a creepy old guy who plays a flute. That kid had it easy but there is some effort made here to portray the struggle it takes to live in the wild although this is still far from realistic. The cast here is decent led by Robert Logan as the stubborn hippie dad and George Buck Flower as the mountain man. Corny hippie soundtrack oddly works. As always with these types of films the best part is the scenery. No sets or cheap CGI fakery going on just real grass trees rivers mountains and animals. It adds an authenticity to things missing today. Plus who doesn't love a good view? This was followed by two sequels that are pretty much more of the same.".

As people started moving into the mid1970s they were leaving behind the hippiedippy daze getting into more sophisticated drugs then becoming clean corporate slaves. Everyone began forgetting how wonderful the earth was because they were too busy drilling it for oil or tearing down trees to make room for our growing population. This film's answer?? Make a senseless decision involving your entire family by moving into a wooded area you know NOTHING about where there's no help for miles and you have no skills dealing with wild animals baking from ABSOLUTE scratch hunting etc. We went from the streets of L.A. to the hills of the Rockies in less than two minutes. Were there books taken out of the library on survival techniques in the wilderness? Did the family take shooting lessons? Was there any talk on food such as how are we going to grow a garden or bake bread or fish or hunt? If there was we weren't allowed to see it. We are supposed to believe that this family knew all this that they had a thriving garden in the city that the woman could bake bread without so much as a wooden spoon and that the father had been shooting at the neighbor's cat regularly. The only reason the mother and father had had kids is for the cute factor alone though it fails miserably at the feigned feel of it all. The little boy sounds like he's reading lines but can't read yet and the daughter seems drugged into a dazed happiness about everything. Their dog Crust is that honestly his name?? Crust??? must have attacked wild animals at home as well seeing as he attacks EVERYTHING in this film it's surprising he doesn't mutilate flowers if they move too much in the wind becoming a threat to the family. Here are some things that make me refuse to have suspension of belief The father flyfishes. He is NOT going to feed a family of 4 on fly fishing. That's called sport not necessity. The dog survives brutal attacks of wolves bears and MOUNTAIN LIONS. Something is wrong when a domestic dog from the city makes it out alive in those circumstances with barely a scratch. How much does a contruction worker make? Enough to ensure a plane to bring supplies every so often? How about when he has no more job and makes no more money? A 10 to 13 year old girl would never outrun a bear. Just from my own opinion I would have lost all faith in myself my family and my dog to be able to survive in this place with the attitude and lack of planning that this family accomplished.Reviews of the plot aside I'm thinking of starting a drinking game. It's called Take a shot everytime you see the boom mike.".

My 11 year old thoroughly enjoyed it though she too could see through it and also see the microphone in heaps of scenes  delightful. We will now watch the second one and be just as delighted entertained and taken back to a simpler time. Not just in the movie but remembering the seventies in general.".

Los Angeles family moves abruptly not because of crime or overpopulation but SMOG. that smog will get you every time. They blindly move into an isolated section of the wilderness 25 minutes away from the nearest people. The parents apparently didn't do their homework because their house is a rundown oneroom shack that makes Charles Ingalls' house look like a mansion in comparison. But wouldn't you just know the father is a manofalltrades just like Ingalls so he's able to build a new house.The entire rest of the film is filled with lots of shouting. And YELLING. And SCREAMING. And ARGUING. And SHRIEKING. Did I mention the shouting because there is a lot of it. You really think these people would tone it down now that they are just by themselves and would seemingly value their peace and quiet but I suppose not. Oh and wild animals. Lots of befriending wild animals and running from wild animals. If you like shouting or wild animals this is the flick for you.Obviously there's no large cast with this film. The father does lots of YELLING. The mother is acceptable if not bland. The daughter alternates between being in a seeming euphoria and positively SHRIEKING at the top of her lungs when she is in danger. The boy is young and has vast difficulty carrying his end of the load.Despite all of this the movie does have a few redeeming qualities. The scenery provides for some spectacular shots. The movie also does a good job of portraying animals as living things and explaining the value of befriending them or respecting their territory. The father does kill a moose but explains to his son they had to because they needed to eat and not because the dad wanted to mount its head on the wall.".

The family is likeable the animals appealing that is one very brave dog and the rural photography is firstrate. This is filmed on some very picturesque locations in Utah and Colorado. Gene Kauer and Douglas M.

Moreover there's a neat and enjoyable array of lovable animals that include adorable raccoons playful bear cubs and a big cuddly bear named Samson. To balance things out we also have another much meaner bear a predatory cougar and a vicious pack of wolves. Special kudos are in order for the extremely brave loyal and protective family dog Crust who saves the Robinsons from several scrapes throughout. Robert Logan and Susan Damante are both solid and credible as the parents while Hollye Holmes and Ham Larson are cute and likeable as their kids.

The carefully staged scenes involving man vs. animal andor animal vs. animal could frighten little ones ooohhh look daddy they're beating and biting. What fun.Still you can't help but enjoy the idea of getting out of the big city and opting for life with Mother Nature and mother bear the latter justifiably ticked because her cubs have been humanized.The humans in the picture are good folk to watch. Logan a Brooklyn boy yet looks like a rugged mountain man. The wife is pleasant and the children seem to be having a good time. Like other reviewers I can't help but wonder why the daughter in this pic was replaced by another daughter in the two followups. There is zilch about her on her web site which contains wonderful information  her name.The movie is certainly watchable the scenery beautiful and the story  well it's like a fairy tale.Somebody complained about the speeding in rebuilding not building their humble abode. Shoot Ty Penningtonhe does it every week. Of course he has a host of experts and several hundred people to help.

	onyx:emotionText "It's nice to watch this flick every now and then  no cussin' no fussin'  a family where arguments are few and far betweenbutalthough it is praised as a wonderful offering for little and big ones there are some nervous moments involving some animals who resent the invasion of their turf. The carefully staged scenes involving man vs. animal andor animal vs. animal could frighten little ones ooohhh look daddy they're beating and biting. What fun.Still you can't help but enjoy the idea of getting out of the big city and opting for life with Mother Nature and mother bear the latter justifiably ticked because her cubs have been humanized.The humans in the picture are good folk to watch. Logan a Brooklyn boy yet looks like a rugged mountain man. The wife is pleasant and the children seem to be having a good time. Like other reviewers I can't help but wonder why the daughter in this pic was replaced by another daughter in the two followups. There is zilch about her on her web site which contains wonderful information  her name.The movie is certainly watchable the scenery beautiful and the story  well it's like a fairy tale.Somebody complained about the speeding in rebuilding not building their humble abode. Shoot Ty Penningtonhe does it every week. Of course he has a host of experts and several hundred people to help. If Logan is still around they might draft him.The Wilderness Family is for the most part pleasant harmless entertainment unless of course you're an animal about to become a dinner.Still it is far less vicious than city life where you can get snuffed for no good reason.";

It's nothing fancy and the little girl crying tends to get old but it's a good movie. It tells the story of a family who packs up and leaves the city to live in the mountains. They start in an old cabin and build their new home. Ther are no fancy effects. It was definitely not a high budget movie but one to be enjoyed time and time again. My only complaint is the portrayal of the wolves. It showed them as vicious creatures attacking the little girl even though Boomer explained what happened later. I always take the time to talk to my kids about the truth. This is definitely a movie I will watch over and over and continue to show my students. Best of all it's a real movie with real people not a cartoon and there's not a cuss word to be found!".

In addition mountain man Boomer and his mule are occasional guests in this and subsequent episodes. Some reviewers label Boomer as creepy. I didn't get that impression at all. Rather he comes across as a knowledgeable grandfather who probably likes animals better than most people. Some reviewers complain that these episodes have little or no plot. Well there are so many interesting things happening that you don't need a complicated plot. The same is true of certain raucous comedies and some musicals. As in the other episodes there is an alteration between disasters or fights and periods of play and glee a good format. I enjoyed the film for the most part. The shots of wild animals and the fights with some of these are spectacular. However they didn't bring that much equipment and supplies with them so I have to wonder where they got all that food and equipment ?Skip seems to have great familiarity with wilderness living. He seems indestructible and brushes off any disasters or fights with animals as nothing to worry about. In contrast Pat is often stressed out after a negative experience and sometimes cries. Canine Crust saves or helps save the situation numerous times throughout the series.The family gradually adopts several animals as pets beginning with a nosy raccoon. Soon they are feeding 2 small bear cubs whose mother can't be found. The kids discover a pair of cougar kittens which follow them home. Skip takes these back to where they were found and has a fight with the mother Skip aided by Crust.Crust has a fight with a bear then 3 wolves at once and miraculously survives these with only minor wounds. Skip scares the wolves away with several shots in the air. Apparently he didn't want to kill them unless absolutely necessary.They make a pet of a friendly adult bear but another bear 3 toes terrorizes them. Maybe he's mad because he lost 2 toes escaping from a trap.Skip and Toby are nearly crushed by a boulder slide. Then Skip's canoe capsizes when he's going to find a doctor when Jenny runs a fever. If you or your kids enjoyed this film you might check out The Further Adventures of the Wilderness FamilyPart 2 andor The Mountain Family RobinsonPart 3.

	schema:reviewBody "Tempest is a somewhat selfindulgent uneven discursive movie. But as Lord Byron another visitor to Greece protested to his friend John Murray about his similarly selfindulgent and discursive Don Juan It may be profligate but is it not life is it not the thing?The connections to Shakespeare's Tempest may seem as another commentator here claims a bit tenuous. But watch the film again after rereading The Tempest and they'll seem far closer. What makes this film flawed is its uneasy mixture of straightforward normal narrative and sudden jarring apparent improvisation particularly between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest these scenes are the most remarkable and gripping in the film if the hardest to watch.The music of this film composed by Stomu Yamashta is also overlooked. Particularly fine is the perfect little piece played to accompany the afternoon siesta as people animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to sleep away the hottest part of the afternoon. It's a sublime moment and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it somewhat unified the fact that aside from extensive flashbacks and the very end it is the story of one day on an island from awakening to night. Overall I'd rather watch this film a hundred times than see some bombastic Hollywood piece of crap once. And in fact I probably have watched it several dozen times. Most times I see something I missed before.Confession I'm biased. This was the second movie I took my GreekAmerican goddess wife to see.Trivia notes on this flick It was Molly Ringwald's first movie as well as Sam Robards'It was actually not filmed on an island but in Gytheion the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesus of GreeceThe by today's standards primitive special effects were done by Bran Ferren who later became head of Disney Imagineering and still later was an adviser to the US intelligence communityPaul Mazursky the director chose the title of his recent autobiography Show Me the Magic from the script of Tempest.".

But to be honest these scenes are the most remarkable and gripping in the film if the hardest to watch.The music of this film composed by Stomu Yamashta is also overlooked. Particularly fine is the perfect little piece played to accompany the afternoon siesta as people animals and seemingly the entire island collapse to sleep away the hottest part of the afternoon. It's a sublime moment and representative of the best aspect of this movie and the one thing that keeps it somewhat unified the fact that aside from extensive flashbacks and the very end it is the story of one day on an island from awakening to night. Overall I'd rather watch this film a hundred times than see some bombastic Hollywood piece of crap once. And in fact I probably have watched it several dozen times. Most times I see something I missed before.Confession I'm biased. This was the second movie I took my GreekAmerican goddess wife to see.Trivia notes on this flick It was Molly Ringwald's first movie as well as Sam Robards'It was actually not filmed on an island but in Gytheion the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesus of GreeceThe by today's standards primitive special effects were done by Bran Ferren who later became head of Disney Imagineering and still later was an adviser to the US intelligence communityPaul Mazursky the director chose the title of his recent autobiography Show Me the Magic from the script of Tempest.";

Cassavettes is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scenestealing performance by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos Cassavettes' manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing New York New York. This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense.

The movie Tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit. What Tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative. Cassavetes portrayal of PhilipProspero is in itself worth a 1010 rating and when you add Gena Rowlands Susan Sarandon a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald Raul Julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... I rest my case. One of the best movies of the 80's. Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time that I saw this film was at an outdoor cinema during the first summer I lived in Greece. I doubt that it is even possible for anyone anywhere to have a better summer than I did that year. I doubt that is would be possible to improve upon this wonderful movie although I was beginning to think that I may have overlyromanticized this film because everything else around me that summer was so perfect. This would have been 1984 and I hadn't seen the film again until last night.It's not like I didn't try to see the film again. When I got back to the States a few years later and the whole video craze was in full bloom I looked for a copy of Tempest in every mom and pop video store in the Washington D.C. area without success. Years after this came the internet and Amazon.com. I tried to buy the film but I could only find it on VHS format and I had already abandoned that technology. I could never find it on DVD anywhere until a few weeks ago. I bought it and had it mailed to my brother's home in Chicago and he relayed it to me here in Spain. Even Homer's Odyssey only took ten years.As I said I saw the movie at a little outdoor theater in a southern suburb of Athens called Glyfada which although attached to the sprawl of the capital has more of a beach town feel to it than big city. These little theaters were rather impromptu affairs that looked like someone had just set out a few chairs in their back yard and invited a few friends over. All that I remember is that they seemed to specialize in movies that were filmed in Greece. This was probably why I went to see Tempest.I have praised this movie for so many years that I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the memory I had of it after seeing it so many years ago. I don't think anyone could blame me for overrating it considering the perfect setting for the first time I saw it. As it turns out I've been a bit conservative in my praise.It is hard for me to imagine that a movie this good could even be made in this day and age. The run time is 142 minutes which for a romantic comedy or whatever the hell it is is very very rare. If these kinds of movies make it to two hours these days it's some sort of miracle. I didn't remember that the movie goes for almost two and a half hours but I immediately was aware of the slow and deliberate pace of the storysomething not synonymous with boring. The director has a story to tell and he isn't about to be pressured into rushing things. A more hurried pacing of the film would have defeated the purpose of why the characters had escaped to a deserted island in Greece. In fact the story involves two islands Manhattan and an enchanted Greek isle hidden somewhere in the crystalclear Aegean. It's difficult to say which one looks more beautiful in film.As I watched this movie for only the second time in 23 years I felt like I was watching a movie made by adults for adults. I don't get that feeling very often when I watch movies. Most of the time I'm lucky if the movie doesn't insult me although I avoid the worst of the comic book remakes and lowbrow action flicks. I know that most movies aren't made with my demographic in mind. Tempest on the other hand has found in me the perfect target audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first time that I saw this film was at an outdoor cinema during the first summer I lived in Greece. I doubt that it is even possible for anyone anywhere to have a better summer than I did that year. I doubt that is would be possible to improve upon this wonderful movie although I was beginning to think that I may have overlyromanticized this film because everything else around me that summer was so perfect. This would have been 1984 and I hadn't seen the film again until last night.It's not like I didn't try to see the film again. When I got back to the States a few years later and the whole video craze was in full bloom I looked for a copy of Tempest in every mom and pop video store in the Washington D.C. area without success. Years after this came the internet and Amazon.com. I tried to buy the film but I could only find it on VHS format and I had already abandoned that technology. I could never find it on DVD anywhere until a few weeks ago. I bought it and had it mailed to my brother's home in Chicago and he relayed it to me here in Spain. Even Homer's Odyssey only took ten years.As I said I saw the movie at a little outdoor theater in a southern suburb of Athens called Glyfada which although attached to the sprawl of the capital has more of a beach town feel to it than big city. These little theaters were rather impromptu affairs that looked like someone had just set out a few chairs in their back yard and invited a few friends over. All that I remember is that they seemed to specialize in movies that were filmed in Greece. This was probably why I went to see Tempest.I have praised this movie for so many years that I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the memory I had of it after seeing it so many years ago. I don't think anyone could blame me for overrating it considering the perfect setting for the first time I saw it. As it turns out I've been a bit conservative in my praise.It is hard for me to imagine that a movie this good could even be made in this day and age. The run time is 142 minutes which for a romantic comedy or whatever the hell it is is very very rare. If these kinds of movies make it to two hours these days it's some sort of miracle.

On the other hand if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play you should look elsewhere. As an experiment however it succeeds just spectacularly. Charming moving funny sad dramatic ... it's all of that and much more. Cast locations script music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. Susan Sarandon's turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... he steals the show in several scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play and much more overt about it than Forbidden Planet.  Cassavetes is always a joy to watch and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight.  His take on the Prospero role is well suited for the sort of craggy allknowing expression he brings to the story.  This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat he conjures up a storm accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's Go.  This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe.  Add to this an excellent performance by Raul Julia plus good work by Susan Sarandon Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald and the film becomes a nice little treat to occupy the space behind your eyes.".

I have been unable to find it in  video stores however. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who  basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place.  There are no phones no TV boredom which when hit with quietness like  that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. And each  character does so. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to  be sexually involved with John Cassavetes' character but he is unable  to well you know. Gina Rowlands is the wife that loves him but is  just about to give up on their marriage. He is demanding and  frustrating to everyone. There is another character in the movie a  Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex but things  that she is curious about. But he is irritating and horny and i didn't  like this character. The locale of the film is what makes this film so  so good. It wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else. I recommend this  film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last time that I saw this was years ago and I thought that I was too young to understand the themes of this movie.  I just recently seen this movie again and now I realize that I wasn't naive the movie was just bad.Here's a breakdown of the story.  John Cassavetes plays Phillup Dimitrius an emotionally and spiritually burnedout casino designer for a rich Greek industrialist.  Phillup feels empty inside because he marriage is crumbling from his wifes' longing for her old acting carrier he's lost touch with his teenage daughter and can't stand his bosses healthailing temper and brownnosing cronies.  To top things off his two unhappy worlds come together in the worst way when he finds out that his wife Gena Rowlands cheating with his boss.Phillup decides to make a clean break from every and I mean everything by going off to the remote islands of Greece.  He then goes crazy in a different way.  Nothing could be better for Phil.  He's indulgently happy with his daughter and new Gypsylike new girlfriend Susan Sarandon. Things are fine for him until his wife along with Phil's old boss come in search of Phil to bring Phils' daughter Miranda played by brat packer Molly Ringwald home to New York.I could not get over how boring this film is.  The strange thing is this. This film was made twenty years ago.  It had such potential for being a groundbreaking film.  It told it's story out of continuity.  This narrative aspect was what helped films like Pulp Fiction Out of Sight and Memento become monster hits.  The film also dealt with the theme of a successful businessman feeling empty inside a theme used in films like Fight Club American Beauty and Office Space.  The film also had the early performances of Molly Ringwald and Susan Sarandon.  The two of them get into a charming rendition of Why do Fools Fall in Love.None of these things can save this movie because they are all used in the most clumsy and boring way.  The conversations in this film is just constant banter of Phil bickering with all of his associations.  It takes far too long to get past the exposition to even hold ones interest.  When the gang get to Greece the story goes from boring to drownmyselfinthelake boring. Phil gets far too selfindulgent to even make sence.The climax of this film the headlining storm comes and goes.  It practacly contributes nothing to the plot.  There's even a usless scene where Phil trys to come off as if he's come to some kind of spiritual wisdom by killing a goat and just comes off as being more arrogant and mentally disturbed.The film tries to to add a subplot of Miranda forming a romance with the son of Phils' boss played by Sam Robards.  Sadly his presence is a electrifying as watching paint dry.  Their relationship is even more predictable and tediously useless.The only thing that keeps me from screaming is complete anguish and boredom is the winning performance of the lategreat Raul Julia.  Julia plays the local hermit Kalibanos.  His character adds the only amount of scale to the story.  He foils Cassavete wonderfully.  He's crazy but in the good way. He's eccentric.  He gives the film little life by  playing the claranette singing to his goats and making advances to Miranda with his trinatron. This film would have been better if it got rid of half of the exposition all of the useless banter between Phil and his wife and put more focus on Phil's relationship with Kalibanos.  Sadly the film overlooks this more entertaining plotpoint.To sum up unless your going to use your DVD to jump to the moments with Raul Julia don't bother wasting your time with this film.".

A darling of film critics for his earlier work often with his reallife wife Rowlands he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him too. It's not Prospero but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own.It's all here he tells one of his faithful companions Aretha's dog Nino. Beauty magic inspiration and serenity. That it is. Tempest transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and finds some nice resonances in Philip's displaced life. Show me the magic he calls out to a stormtossed city skyscape and Mazursky's version augmented by Donald McAlpine's sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sunburnished Greek landscapes does just that.It's not a perfect movie by any means. In fact the big finale which is the only part of the movie that follows Shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film and after meeting Sarandon in all her braless glory it's hard to understand Philip's continuing concern for his wife let alone his leftfield desire to make an unhappy sacrifice in order to restore the natural order of things.But there's a lot to love about Tempest. In addition to Cassavetes there's Ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic Kalibanos Raul Julia. Ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes but with an emotional depth those later Hughes films didn't delve into. Ringwald and Julia never got any Oscar attention but they both would win Golden Globes for their playful work here.

When Tempest hit the screens Julia was the toast of Broadway as the lead in Nine.It's Mazursky's show even if it feels at times that Cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. Philip introduces himself to Aretha by telling her I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown. He plays his character as an amiable obsessive seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island.Adding to the enjoyment is Gassman's rich performance as the other man who is as completely amiable as Julia while telling a youthobsessed Philip Boys don't have half as much fun as we have. They're nervous...and they make love in the back of an old sports car. Despite being overlong and pretentious in spots like so many art films Tempest is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like Shakespeare intended even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a GoGos concert.".

More is the pity that there were no Asian characters in this remake of Che Xuan's General Tsao Lightning never acknowledged by the director or his fine ensemble cast. Yet one sees the intertwinings of the Xuan genre 1966 made just before the Macaoan director's untimely death in Venice. The Tempest thus rises above the ashes on the shoulders of giants to become the cinema qua non of the 1980s. I give this film three thumbs up four if there is time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film much like Skywalker02 did but when I could manage to see it again and with formal film training psychology and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about..I really click with the film. I remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death much like poltergeist when it first came out and many other popular films. I felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant airtime I know cable isn't really on air given it but I was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. However recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. I think that Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were likely studying the script together and I would be a bit surprised if Surandon had coached Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects while good do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. Surandon nailed hers as Raul Julia did also. Cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances but I will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. A steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes but overall I can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.All in all I don't find this film to be the take me out and drown me kind of boredom fest as Skywalker02 would have you believe. I think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. I would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. I do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements such as Terms of Endearment which as far as I am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. How could a film like that get more attention than this one. Talk about boredom.Best thing don't take my word or anyone else's see the film and support our industry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1982 and loosely based on Shakespeare's play Tempest stars John Cassavetes as Phillip a rich architect in a troubled marriage in New York City. When his wife Gena Rowlands decides to return to acting and things blowup he escapes to Greece with his daughter Molly Ringwald where they unite with a freespirited singer Susan Sarandon. Meanwhile Phillip's wife hooks up with his former boss Vittorio Gassman and they come to Greece looking for the daughter. Raul Julia plays an eccentric goatherd on the island while Sam Robards appears as a teen lothario. While I'm sure the Greece cinematography would be spectacular on the big screen it certainly is on the small screen Tempest isn't a film I'd likely want to see in the theater it flopped at the box office. Yet it works fine as a likably offbeat drama in the home.If you're a Sarandon fan you'll definitely want to check this out because she's in the prime of her life 35 yearsold during filming and is splendidly portrayed by the director Paul Mazursky from the getgo typically in alluring Mediterranean apparel. Likewise statuesque Lucianne Buchanan appears in the final act as blond Delores. This was Ringwald's debut. She was fine for the meaty role of the daughter but I was never enthralled by her which isn't to say I don't like her. Actually I'm not enamored by any of these women but they're all certainly agreeable one way or another.There are several highlights like Phillip coming home drunk to his wife's showbiz party where he awkwardly asks her producer director Paul Mazursky to dance. Needless to say it's the epitome of an uncomfortable social situation. The best part about Tempest however is that it's essentially an island flick although the cast aren't necessarily castaways and the island is a little bit North of the tropics. If you're a sucker for island flicks like me then Tempest is worth checking out. It's uniquely entertaining and somehow warmhearted. I realize Phillip Cassavetes is the Prospero character from The Bard's play and Prospero was a magician but the movie never explains Phillip's seeming ability to control the elements. We're just supposed to accept it. Why sure! In any case I presume he's projecting his mentalspiritual struggles on to the forces of nature. For those not in the know Cassavetes and Rowlands were husband  wife for almost 36 years which ended with the former's passing in 1989 at 59 yearsofage. He died of cirrhosis of the liver. The film runs 142 minutes was shot in New York City Atlantic City NJ and mostly Gytheio Greece which isn't an island but the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesus of Greece.

Tempest is a coproduction French Italian and Yugoslavian that deals with a cossack uprising against empress Catherine II's ruling in Russia. It is in my opinion a very acceptable movie rather accurate to facts in its underground and with a fine screenplay in the surface.The plot is interesting and precisely managed by Italian Director Alberto Lattuada. The film doesn't lack spectacle and intensity with fine battle scenes and action sequences that could qualify it as a true epic. Wide open outdoor color shooting and good interior settings also help the product.But what really hurts the picture and badly is the important role of Russian officer Grinov played by a completely miscasted Geoffrey Horne. He just doesn't fit at all as the man who unknowingly saves the rebels leader life and from then on is the character that allows viewers to know about Pugachov's reasons and ideas that led him to raise against the empress in an almost impossible task. Horne's acting is definitely poor and he lacks the strength and passion his role demands. On the other hand Van Heflin does a very good work and plays most convincingly Emelyan Pugachov the man who dared to challenge the powerful Catherine in fact I can't recall a bad performance from Heflin in films. The rest of the cast is correct mainly Agnes Moorehead Oskar Homolka Silvana Mangano you just can't understand how she could fall in love with Horne's dull and inexpressive character and Viveca Lindfors as the empress.But all in all Tempest is a watchable and most entertaining film in its genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dino DeLaurentis produced this fine film Tempest of Alexander Pushkin's novel set during the reign of Catherine the Great starring Van Heflin as the rebel pretender Pugachev who said he was really Czar Peter III who was Catherine's husband and whom she overthrew several years earlier. Viveca Lindfors plays a cool and calculating Empress Catherine.But the thing to remember is that this is not a work of history. Pushkin did write history as well but this film is not history as such. It is based on Pushkin's novel The Captain's Daughter and the protagonists are Geoffrey Horne and Silvana Mangano. It is through their eyes that we see both their love and the background that led to this attempted revolution against Catherine.Young Horne for an indiscretion is sent in exile from Catherine's court to a frontier outpost commanded by Captain Robert Keith. With a little matchmaking help from her mother Agnes Moorehead the two are fated to be mated eventually.But in the meantime the revolt of Pugachev is growing. As it turns out Horne and his servant Oscar Homolka saved the life of a frozen peasant on the way to the outpost. When Pugachev overruns their outpost Horne's life is saved by the fact it's none other than Van Heflin now styling himself as Czar Peter.Heflin who was a consummate actor playing all kinds of everyman roles as an American transfers well as a Russian peasant. A whole lot better than Henry Fonda did as a Russian in War And Peace. But that's not the end for Horne. For his warnings about the growing discontent of the peasantry and Heflin's popularity with them he gets himself into a nice little jackpot. Aided and abetted by the dying words of Helmut Dantine another officer who actually did turn traitor to Catherine. Dantine also had eyes for Mangano.Pushkin was a romantic writer and Tempest first and foremost a love story just like Gone With The Wind against the epic background of a great war. As far as the novel goes Tempest sticks fairly close to the plot of The Captain's Daughter. And the spirit of those times of Catherine the Great are captured in the novel and in this film.Tempest is a good historical epic which is sadly neglected today. I'm sure the Russians have adapted this same story maybe better. But this is a fine version as is for the English speaking world.".

But this attests to the movie's impact in an ultimately affirmative way. One week later we visited the Gettysburg Battlefield and my father's unspoken wish that I fall in love with history came true.I cannot overstate the film's influence on my life  I taught history for three decades and earned my PhD in education while doing so. 28 years later I was asked to recount the key points of the story and I spent nearly thirty minutes doing so in incredible detail. I became a devoted fan of Van Heflin and Agnes Moorehead. I also began to probe in depth the complex history of my mother's homeland and began to admire Alexander Pushkin's genius. I spent years trying to obtain a copy of the film and finally did so only last week I found a wealth of material for psychological studies simply in comparing my recollections with what the film actually presented.I did not expect to find such fidelity to historical and even cultural accuracy and I regret that many moviegoers at the time were probably not prepared for the insights that Pushkin via Tempest offered them. The climactic battle scene illustrates the division of the Cossacks especially on the eve of the faraway American Revolutionary War into factions one of these supports the crown even if it rests on the head of an Austrianborn czarina another reacted to the evils of czarist autocracy and yet another wished only to live undisturbed and draw upon its traditions to assuage the misery of struggling to survive in equally hostile natural and political environments.Perhaps only the diminished quality of my copy impels me to rate the film 8 instead of 10 certainly a production which so influenced my life and therefore quite possibly many others deserves respect equal to the very simulated but overwhelming post battle impact it had upon me.".

Incidentally these last couple of years I have been trying to land a serviceable copy of the film  both for myself and a filmbuff friend of my Dad's  but while this was the most satisfactory of three I had at some point it still leaves a lot to be desired gleaned from a German print albeit Widescreen when the others were not with the English dialogue mixed in there remain several imperfections like audio dropouts and fluctuating levels while one brief scene is still presented in German with superimposed English subtitles! Anyway the film was clearly made by mogul Dino De Laurentiis as a followup to another Russianset epic WAR AND PEACE 1956 which had been a coproduction between the U.S. and Italy this was a more Europeanbased venture inspired by an Alexander Pushkin tale actually shot in Yugoslavia! though it still featured numerous Englishspeaking actors and a few of them were even ported over from the famed Leo Tolstoy adaptation namely Oscar Homolka Helmut Dantine and Vittorio Gassman. The others include Viveca Lindfors as Catherine The Great  which is why I incorporated this in my current viewing schedule as part of an intermittently progressing Josef von Sternberg retrospective Van Heflin as the pretender to her throne a peasant who believes himself to be her deceased husband Peter III!  curiously enough I have just checked out the thematicallyrelated SHADOW OF THE EAGLE 1950 and which had actually employed a similar ruse Geoffrey Horne fresh from his secondarycumcowardly role in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI 1957 but now upgraded to leadhero status Robert Keith Agnes Moorehead and Finlay Currie the most notable element on the Italian front then is Silvana Mangano Mrs. De Laurentiis herself  obviously albeit ably filling in the female protagonist slot.Again in comparison to WAR AND PEACE this was given a manageable runningtime of 122 minutes when the earlier film had lasted for a staggering 208 and while that one recruited two directors and two cinematographers one foreign and one local in each case this would only utilize homegrown talent in either department with d.p. Aldo Tonti being involved in both pictures as well  though Michelangelo Antonioni soon to embark on his major arthouse period was reportedly brought in for a brief stretch during filming as would also be the case around this same time with the peplum SIGN OF THE GLADIATOR! In any event apart from the rich and sprawling visuals pertaining to scenery costumes and battle sequences the main asset here proves to be Piero Piccioni's rousing score.That is not to say that the plot is not involving  at least Heflin's bloodthirsty campaign built more on his vainglorious personality in the type of largerthanlife part Orson Welles would often get to play in such international productions than actual battle tactics and the noless ruthless military strategies by which Catherine defeats the usurper incidentally the two leaders only get to meet briefly at the very end  but it is bogged down somewhat by clich the eternal triangle situation involving Horne Mangano and hissable villain Dantine melodrama Currie's disowning of son Horne after he is accused by the dying Dantine of treason and sentimentality not only longsuffering manservant Homolka's devotion to Horne but Heflin's enthusiastic attachment to same after having been saved by him from freezing to death.In conclusion I would like to point out that I also own the 1928 American film by the same title with John Barrymore which though still a Russiabased epic it is set during the seminal 1917 revolution that toppled the monarchy once and for allthough the Communist ideals of the Proletariat regime that came into power in its stead emerged pretty soon to be just as oppressive as the old system the longterm result of which was the country's dismemberment into smaller independent states and its former reputation as a superpower getting severely diminished in the process!".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many versions over the years of the fanciful story The Man in the Iron Mask the most recent one being the 1998 film starring Leonardo di Caprio. Back in the late 1970s Richard Chamberlain took a stab at it with highly entertaining results.This particular version was directed to great effect by the talented James Whale who gives us a fast energetic and athletic telling of the story of twins separated at birth one who will be King of France and one who does not know that he is royalty. The twins are played by Louis Hayward Joan Bennett is Maria Theresa Josef Schildkraut is Fouquet and Warren William leads the Musketeers as D'Artagnan. As one post on this board mentions the Musketeers are getting up there in age here Alan Hale Miles Mander and Bert Roach are the heroic swordsmen and friends.It's important always that a good actor plays twins so that they have different personalities. This often is not the case. One may be mean and one may be good but they talk the same look the same act the same etc. Louis Hayward does a fantastic job in his dual roles. As the arrogant King he is foppish cruel dismissive and lustful. As Philip of Gascony he is gentle and unassuming with a very different demeanor and even a different vocal timber. Hayward was a very smooth actor. It's not exactly clear what happened to his career and why he ended up in the '60s doing spaghetti westerns. Apparently this film set him up for a resume of playing twins which he gamely did finally becoming a very successful producer.Although she was no match in acting for Vivien Leigh anyone who has seen the Gone With the Wind screen tests knows what a beautiful Scarlett Joan Bennett would have made. She's stunning here as the confused Maria Theresa in glorious costumes with her serene smile porcelain skin and beautiful bone structure. Warren William an early leading man who was the movie Perry Mason is very likable and does well with the athletic sword fighting as D'Artagnan. Having been a leading man when talkies began by this time he was moving into character roles. With his pencilthin mustache he was a familiar presence in films until his death in 1948 at the age of 54.This is a wonderful movie a nice remembrance of the good old Hollywood period pieces when they really knew how to do them. Look for a young Peter Cushing as a King's messenger.".

Some of the special effects work is noticeably dated but is overall fine. The story is interesting and wellpaced and doesn't suffer the slow patches that some other adventure films of the era do.

	schema:reviewBody "Though The Man In the Iron Mask is swashbuckling adventure at its finest it's hardly an accurate picture of the times. But Alexander Dumas was no more writing history here than he was in The Three Musketeers which in many ways this is the further adventures of.Twin sons are born to Louis XIII and his wife Anne of Austria and in order to avoid dynastic rivalry one of them is sent with the King's trusty right hand D'Artagnan to raise in his native Gascony. The other becomes the well known Louis XIV and ascends to the throne as a child of six.Warren William is the aging but still very capable D'Artagnan. In his scenes especially the film bares more than a slight resemblance to the version that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. did as his last silent film. I would not be surprised if a lot of stock footage was incorporated here by producer Edward Small and director James Whale.Louis Hayward essays the difficult dual role of both Louis XIV and his twin brother Phillip. Hayward's first big break came as Anita Louise's lover and Fredric March's father in Anthony Adverse where he lost a duel to Claude Rains. Hayward never lost too many screen duels after that though his swashbuckler parts that he mostly did after service in World War II never matched up to this.Joseph Schildkraut and Walter Kingsford are the evenly matched pair of ministers vying for preeminence as Fouquet and Colbert. Colbert did in fact triumph but not in the way as shown here. And Fouquet was a guy who liked to live high on the hog. In real life that's what actually brought him down.The Man in the Iron Mask is an often filmed tale here in America I'm sure the French have done many versions. For adventure and romance you can't beat it and this version is one of the best around.".

	onyx:emotionText "Though The Man In the Iron Mask is swashbuckling adventure at its finest it's hardly an accurate picture of the times. But Alexander Dumas was no more writing history here than he was in The Three Musketeers which in many ways this is the further adventures of.Twin sons are born to Louis XIII and his wife Anne of Austria and in order to avoid dynastic rivalry one of them is sent with the King's trusty right hand D'Artagnan to raise in his native Gascony. The other becomes the well known Louis XIV and ascends to the throne as a child of six.Warren William is the aging but still very capable D'Artagnan. In his scenes especially the film bares more than a slight resemblance to the version that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. did as his last silent film. I would not be surprised if a lot of stock footage was incorporated here by producer Edward Small and director James Whale.Louis Hayward essays the difficult dual role of both Louis XIV and his twin brother Phillip. Hayward's first big break came as Anita Louise's lover and Fredric March's father in Anthony Adverse where he lost a duel to Claude Rains. Hayward never lost too many screen duels after that though his swashbuckler parts that he mostly did after service in World War II never matched up to this.Joseph Schildkraut and Walter Kingsford are the evenly matched pair of ministers vying for preeminence as Fouquet and Colbert. Colbert did in fact triumph but not in the way as shown here. And Fouquet was a guy who liked to live high on the hog. In real life that's what actually brought him down.The Man in the Iron Mask is an often filmed tale here in America I'm sure the French have done many versions. For adventure and romance you can't beat it and this version is one of the best around.";

I was lucky enough to see it at a screening at school and loved every minute whether it was the swordplay the action or even the chilling moments that featured Louis Hayward as either the evil...and most definitely unbalanced...King Louis XIV or his twin brother Philippe trapped in that nightmarish iron mask.But more importantly it gave me a group of unusual heroes in D'Artagnon and the Musketeers in an era when most youngsters' heroes were cowboys riding the TV range. A wonderful group with Warren William holding every scene he is in as the aging but still courageous and adventureloving D'Artagnon. It wasn't until a few years later that I saw Errol Flynn's ROBIN HOOD and recognized Alan Hale as my first movie Porthos.It's sad that James Whale directed movies no more after this one but what he left us is one of the best of the classic costume adventures that is still a joy to watch and a wonderful journey to the legend of the men whose battle cry was One For All! And All For One! Catch it when it is repeated on TCM and for a couple of hours be a kid again!".

Louis Hayward is excellent as the twins and the scenes with the 2 twins together rival anything Hollyweed can do now only done much more simply and directly. They don't even look like matte shots. And the scenes with Hayward in an iron mask rival any of Whale's horror films simply in their superb use of lighting for effect. Just goes to show further what a superb craftsman he was and how he was comfortable in any genre. The supporting cast is fine though frankly I never found Joan Bennett interesting she does well here. And stalwarts like Schildkraut and Hale do their usual fine work. Frankly I thing Warren William is highly overrated in the other reviews here. Yes he does a creditable job but no better than any others in the supporting cast. Personally I think Whale's direction is the real star here effective without being overly flamboyant. He could have easily rivaled Cukor or any of his other gay contemporaries' work but unfortunately he insisted on being honest and open about who he was. Something that is frowned upon even today.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the record the film under review is universally considered the best and most exhilarating to quote the late eminent British critic Leslie Halliwell version even if Whale himself apparently was not that fond of it by this time he had lost favor with the Hollywood bigwigs and basically had resigned himself to be a directorforhire!. Still I completely disagree with his unenthusiastic appraisal  as this is certainly one of his most impressive nonhorror efforts and easily ranks among the Top 10 Swashbucklers ever to come out of Hollywood! The film was an independent production courtesy of Edward Small he had already financed the definitive 1934 version of Dumas' THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO likewise a cinematic staple and a personal Holy Grail for me before finally watching it some 3 years ago and would subsequently make the 1941 rendition of THE CORSICAN BROTHERS again inspired by a Dumas tale and like IRON MASK itself involving twin protagonists. In fact he would be the force behind no less than 7 swashbucklers throughout his career including 2 original sequels to MONTE CRISTO  both incidentally starring the lead of this one i.e. Louis Hayward! Despite not having the backing of a major studio the movie lasts for a generous 112 minutes the IMDb mistakenly lists this as 96 but then it is 110 according to the Leonard Maltin Movie Guide and as per the aforementioned Halliwell tome 119! and looks terrific indeed sets are expansive costumes lavish and the cinematography splendid. However two other contributing factors to the film's overall success is a literate script by George Bruce and a remarkable if essentially lowkey roster of actors to play the extensive cast of characters. Warren William is D'Artagnan and Alan Hale Bert Roach and Miles Mander The Three Musketeers from yet another Dumas perennial  interestingly the same year as this film saw a rather good musical spoof adaptation of that novel but the bestremembered version was still 9 years away! To get back to Hale for a moment his Porthos here came hot on the heels of another beloved folk character i.e. Robin Hood's bestknown sidekick Little John  incidentally his reallife son would recreate the elder Hale's 1939 role both in LADY IN THE IRON MASK 1952 in which Louis Hayward himself is now D'Artagnan and in the inferior bigscreen remake of IRON MASK retitled THE FIFTH MUSKETEER 1979 and which actually followed this very viewing!! Joan Bennett had not yet attained artistic maturity which would come via her noir phase during the next decade Joseph Schildkraut makes for a wonderful dastardly villain Walter Kingsford is a vaguely familiar character actor here relishing the opportunity to tackle a sizeable characterization while Montagu Love is something of a genre fixture! Albert Dekker has an small but important early part as King Louis XIII and though similarly restricted to the prologue this was Nigel De Brulier's fourth and final appearance as Cardinal Richelieu since 1921 and which had included the 1929 version of the same source material!. Finally for horrormovie buffs Whale regular Dwight Frye and future Hammer stalwart Peter Cushing his debut! turn up in bit parts here though the former's is a speaking part appearing as Schildkraut's valet he receives no credit whereas the latter  who only gets a couple of medium shots as one of the many soldiers at a tavern brawl  does!Anyway the film throws in a variety of elements and while it may stress some at the expense of others notably romance and court intrigue visa'vis its sporadic bursts of action to my mind there is little cause for complaint. That is unless one carps for a duel between the two Haywards which was added for THE FIFTH MUSKETEER  a film that generally followed the George Bruce script here so scrupulously that his name ranks beside that of Dumas in the credits! As for the notion that Whale was so disinterested that he failed to imbue the film with any of his distinctive touches suffice to say that the prison sequences feature shadowy lighting and a whipping that particularly evokes a similar scene in FRANKENSTEIN 1931 while the regal Hayward sensibly despairing  there's an oxymoron for you!  of being strangled by his overgrown hair once his head has been trapped in the appealinglydesigned mask is a surefire display of his recognizable caustic wit recalling THE INVISIBLE MAN 1933's observation that to avert detection he must be spotlessly clean at all times another more broadly comic scene finds William hamming it up in the fashion of John Barrymore posing as Kingsford's doddering servant when soldiers arrive to arrest him. The climax then surprisingly sees the death of all four Musketeers a driverless coach careening off the edge of a cliff and the union blessed with mutual love when once it was to be solely a marriage of convenience between Spaniard Bennett and the 'new' French King.Interestingly having recently rewatched Luis Bunuel's swansong THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE 1977 I was reminded of the ambivalent nature of its heroine during those scenes where Bennett here is confounded by the apparent contradictions within the personality of foppish King Louis XIV who is to marry her against his will whereas the more downtoearth twin exhibits affection and consideration. By the way another classic swashbuckler to split the central role was THE PRISONER OF ZENDA  whose finest incarnation emerged in 1937 and numbered among its cast Montagu Love! Finally the TCMsourced copy I watched sported rather low audio so that I had to take the volume practically to the maximum in order to hear the dialogue and unfortunately also suffered from a handful of minor jumpcuts!".

Dwight Frye not credited can be spotted as a valet about 34's of the way in. He has a few lines but we are so used to seeing him as Fritz in Whale's Frankenstein movies that he's not easy to recognize he's a little heavier looking in this film for one thing.Hayward was a good choice for the dual roles. A good actor there was always something rather unpleasant at times about his looks while at other times he looked quite handsomeI think he was used to great advantage here for that reason.Almost all the leads were independent artists not contracted to any particular studio so it was rather weird seeing Warners' top character man Alan Hale in this not that they give him a whole lot to do! I'm guessing that some footage from the 1920s version of this film with Douglas Fairbanks was incorporated into at least one scenethe king showing the newborn prince from his balcony early in the film.After seeing this I began to wonder if Stan Lee or Jack Kirby did not draw inspiration for their Dr. Doom comic book character from the iron mask shown in this film.".

Hayward is excellent in the roles though his King is probably on the short list of 25 most evil screen portraits. The story was most recently remade with Leonardo DiCaprio to mixed results. The movie is a great deal of fun thanks in part to Whale's sense of the absurd such as when D'Artagnan The always wonderful Warren William pretends to be a servant to throw off some pursuers.

	schema:reviewBody "Boris Karloff found this to be true in 1935's The Black Room but his set of twins were not sons of the King of France. When King Louis XIII's wife gives birth to two sons why is it never a daughter? one is not presented to the people but gets to be raised by D'Artagnan one of the three musketeers. When the king dies the son he raised ascends the throne as Louis XIV named the Great in history books and the remaining son Philippe becomes a rebel after his father is outcast from the court. Louis XIV is presented as an evil fop although history doesn't record him this way who doesn't care abut the people. If the future Marie Antoinette said Let Them Eat Cake this version of the greatest Bourbon King of France wouldn't care if they starved.When Spanish Princess Marie Terese Joan Bennett arrives as Louis's future Queen she is revolted by his inhumanity. When the King discovers he is the intended target of an assassination plot Marie Terese is taken with Philippe who has assumed the King's place after being arrested for his caring believing her initial impression of the king was a misunderstanding. Of course the king discovers the truth about his lookalike and thus comes in the Iron Mask.This lavish historical drama may not represent France's greatest era of the monarchy but it is an entertaining and impressive vision of that time. Hayward in a double role sneers as the evil King Louis XIV but gets to be noble and even imitate his twin as the decent Philippe. Would you believe the usually more modern hard as nails Marion Martin as the Madame DuBarry type mistress? I didn't at first but she tones down her usual streetwise manner in that part. As for Bennett I feared she might be wasted as the hapless heroine but she actually gets to do more rather than simply look pretty and fret over being rescued. Warren William is excellent as D'Artagnon and Joseph Schildkraut gives an outstanding performance as the villainous Fouquet. Under the stunning direction of James Whale the film is a visual treat much like his glorious movie version of Show Boat with a touch of his past horror film glories thrown in. This film only goes into swashbuckling action a few times but it never lacks in entertainment.".

However the sumptuous costumes and sets more than make amends as does the stirring score beautiful cinematography sword play that is as far away from clumsy as you can get and James Whale's direction which is suitably sympathetic without it ever been plodding or overlyflamboyant. The script is witty and intelligent and the story is as compelling as you'd expect. Bennett aside the performances are great. The Musketeers are well done and it was nice seeing Peter Cushing in his screen debut but for me the standouts were the malevolent Fouquet of Joseph Schildkaut Warren William's noble D'Artagnan and the altogether riveting dualrole performance of Louis Hayward as the arrogant cruel Louis and the gentle romantically helplessness of Phillippe.

When I say complicated I mean complicated.Louis XIII Albert Dekker in a tiny role is King of France and needs an heir to the throne. To his dismay his feckless wife gives birth to twins. Well you can't have TWO heirs to the throne so the younger of the two babies Philippe who grows up to be Louis Hayward is sent packing to be adopted and raised by D'Artingnan one of the original four musketeers now living in the boondocks. No one must know of his true identity says Dekker  besides himself his wife his trusted adviser Colbert Walter Kingsford and D'Artagnan himself. There is a slight problem because the Queen was attended by a doctor and midwife. Too bad there is no D'Artagnon for the doctor and the midwife remarks Kingsford a little sadly before having them dispatched and the audience is permitted to shake its head in sympathy.The good King passes on pari passu where one hopes he's lucky enough to run into the souls of the departed doctor and midwife.Then it REALLY gets anfractuous. There's a lot of whispering plenty of secrets men tiptoeing behind screens to eavesdrop a face listening on the other side of the door one of those keys that is worn around the neck and must be stolen while its owner sleeps secret passages under the palace the gallop of pursuing horses behind the desperately fleeing stagecoach the fencing mle the impostor mistaken for the real thing the confused mailorder Spanish bride out of The Prisoner of Zenda. The Louis Hayward who has become King of France is a real mean son of gun. His staring eyes pop. His mouth is shaped into a halfmad grin. When someone challenges his authority he leaps to his feet and shouts L'Etat C'est moi! in English. I wonder if he really said that. I thought the conviction was limited to American presidents. Come to think of it Joseph Schildkraut plays the oily Fouqet toady to the venomous King and he says In this case we must all hang together or we will most assuredly hang separately. I never read Dumas' novel only flipped through it when I was a child looking for risqu parts. But I don't believe Dumas wrote that. I think it was an American who said it maybe Benjamin Franklin or Abe Lincoln. Do I have to Google it? Well  if you insist. Franklin. Joseph Schildkraut probably gives the best performance. He's outrageous but it's in keeping with the nature of the plot and the tempo of its presentation. There are many other familiar names in the cast  Schildkraut was perhaps better known in the theater than on the screen though he was quite good as Anne Frank's father  but the roles are rather small.Enough digression. Let me wind up that abstract of the plot. The bad Louis Hayward winds up drowning while wearing the iron mask he'd fashioned for his brother. That mask is a pretty hideous artifact too. The good Louis Hayward assumes the other's identity marries the beautiful Spanish princess repeals all taxes cleanses the moneygrubbing banks of their miscreant scum outlaws smoking of tobacco in any form but permits marijuana decrees that all citizens over 40 are now UNDER 40 so no Social Security or Medicare payments will be necessary takes a vow of poverty even at the expense of his marriage and goes about washing the naked feet of beggars in Paris.James Whale the bisexual Englishman directed it all with an entertaining dash you might not have expected from the man who brought us Frankenstein.".

Mr. Hayward who seems to be somewhat forgotten today really electrifies the story with his presence. His ability to give two distinct personalities to the two Twins to such a degree that one will find himself doubting that it is indeed one actor's portrayal. Honest Schultz it is! STANDOUT VILLAIN of the show would have to be Joseph Shilkraut as Royal Minister Foquet the conniving weasel who taught the young King to be a cruel selfish  truly evil Despotic Ruler. The Viennese born Mr. Shilkraut had been in pivotal roles dating back to the Silents. It was he who so energized the portrayal of Judas Iscariat in director Cecil B.

Just kiddin' 'bout that last one folks!THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK has so much to recommend it and very little to detract from its total effect on the screen. Well in the interest of impartiality and absolute fairness we have one complaint. The rear screen projection shots seem to be often out of proper scale to the subjects in front. This seems to be particularly evident in one of the scenes showing the King riding in the Coach with angry burgers in the background jeering sneering and shouting down his 'Royal Highness'.OTHERWISE the scripting  dialog the acting directing the all important costumes Because it's a 'Costume Drama' Schultz! the countryside and the Villages  Palace sets are magnificent. In fact it appears to us that the film may well have been done at various Studios 'Medieval' Sets. 20th CenturyFox's RKO's etc.. The shot of the crowd outside the Palace when King Louis XIII presented the newborn heir appears to have been taken from stock footage used in the Silent Screen's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME Universal 1923 which of course starred Lon Chaney.SO in closing let's tell you that both Schultz and Me give it Four Stars at least.NOTE This is our first review in sometime that has no footnotes!POODLE SCHNITZ!!".

But the original is just perfect.Technically they didn't have Democrats in either 1650 or bad ones in 1939 but who isn't reminded of them in the scene when bad king Louis says The peasants revolt against the salt tax aye. DOUBLE IT! This to support his hateful and treacherous regime while the people are starving. Louis will tell any lie. twist any purpose while preening in the mirror. A male Nancy Polosi. Dread the thought! Meanwhile his twin brother Phillip lives among the people unaware of his royal birth. In time he will enter the castle and when he is king he is pure Republican ever sensitive to the real needs of the people Phillip repeals the hated Salt Tax and two other severe taxes as well  returning the wealth to the people.Thank God we had producers like Edward Small directors like James Whale and great actors like Louis Hayward in 1939  still alive and well on VHS. The remake by Jerry Bruckheimer a few years ago isn't even a bad memory in 2008 but this 1939 film clings to life after 69 years.".

But the original is just perfect.Technically they didn't have Democrats in either 1650 or bad ones in 1939 but who isn't reminded of them in the scene when bad king Louis says The peasants revolt against the salt tax aye. DOUBLE IT! This to support his hateful and treacherous regime while the people are starving. Louis will tell any lie. twist any purpose while preening in the mirror. A male Nancy Polosi. Dread the thought! Meanwhile his twin brother Phillip lives among the people unaware of his royal birth. In time he will enter the castle and when he is king he is pure Republican ever sensitive to the real needs of the people Phillip repeals the hated Salt Tax and two other severe taxes as well  returning the wealth to the people.Thank God we had producers like Edward Small directors like James Whale and great actors like Louis Hayward in 1939  still alive and well on VHS. The remake by Jerry Bruckheimer a few years ago isn't even a bad memory in 2008 but this 1939 film clings to life after 69 years.";

	schema:reviewBody "Janet Gaynor is best remembered for being the star of three silent classics SEVENTH HEAVEN SUNRISE and STREET ANGEL for which the then 22yearold actress won the first Best Actress Academy Award and became the last superstar of the silent era. She was wildly popular in the 1930's as well right up to her selfimposed retirement in 1938. In the early 1930's she was in fact the most popular young actress on the screen. Alas because most of her films were made by Fox and have had little circulation since initial release with the very notable exception of the classic A STAR IS BORN she tends to be overlooked among the thirties stars today. SMALL TOWN GIRL however is better known than most of her films mainly because the MGM film airs quite often on TCM.SMALL TOWN GIRL is an excellent light romantic drama with an utterly endearing and empathic performance by Janet. She stars as a twentysomething girl who has become bored out of her mind by the daily routine of her life  working at her brotherinlaw's mom and pop grocery customers buying the same things every week eating the same meals every specific day of the week having to listen to mindless small talk of customers as well as the repetitive comments of friends and relatives. Perhaps worst of all is her utterly unromantic and unambitious semiboyfriend James Stewart. Janet appears to be the only person in town who knows there's a better way of life out there but she's powerless to find it. When the kids of a nearby college and young football fans cause a slight traffic jam passing through town going to a game Janet looks on with wistfulness at their carefree fun and promising lives. After almost being run down by handsome make that gorgeous Robert Taylor he stops and they talk a bit. He asks is she knows a short cut to the tavern he's headed to and with his warm personality and obvious breeding has little difficulty persuading her to join him. They have a wonderful evening and Taylor gets quite plastered apparently a frequent occurrence for him and Janet herself imbibes in champagne for the first time but remains sober. Driving her home Taylor impulsively decides to propose to her and drives to the justice of the peace where some of his friends were just married. Janet protests mildly but finds herself unable to turn away from this prince charming that dropped in her lap from out of nowhere and finally agrees to marry him.Driving away after becoming man and wife the ever intoxicated Taylor runs off the road in a slight crash in a ditch and falls asleep. The next morning he sobers up and doesn't remember anything but learns he is now a married man. When he learns Janet wasn't drunk at the time they married he suspects her of being a fortune hunter meanwhile she learns he was already engaged to socialite Binnie Barnes and he's the son of a wealthy man and is a promising young doctor. Taylor decides to avoid scandal they will live as man and wife innameonly for six months and then divorce. He is quite cool now to Gaynor whom he sees as an opportunist and his hostile demeanor has Janet now disliking him as well. But as time passes Janet recaptures the attraction and affection she initially felt for him whereas he is still waiting for the day the marriage will end and he can openly see Binnie Barnes.Janet Gaynor gives a wonderful performance in this movie the viewer is completely with her at all stages. Her sincerity shines through every scene and shows you why 30's audiences loved her so much. She is very fine in the early scenes fully capturing small town discontentment as well as her impetuous first night with Taylor and she never makes a false move throughout the film. Robert Taylor is so dashing it's hard to imagine any woman who could resist his charms. He is excellent and like Janet you can't help but being drawn to him even when he is unsympathetic because you know he is better than his actions. The supporting cast generally has insignificant roles but James Stewart in one of his first films is so credible as the bland boy next door it's a wonder he didn't end up typecast for good as the Ralph Bellamy of rural films the perennial second placer. Elizabeth Patterson as Janet's mother and Lewis Stone as Robert's father do what they can with their small roles and it was fun to see a toddler on screen Janet's sister Isabell Jewell's daughter being a pickyeating little brat unlike most films of the era with perfectly mannered children. SMALL TOWN GIRL is a small gem in MGM's crown and most definitely worth seeing.".

But I've seen her in films like State Fair and Three Loves Has Nancy and it's the same part the girl from the tiny hamlet who conquers the big city and the men in it. With a title like this there was only one casting possibility.Janet's a girl who's thoroughly stuck in a rut in her New England hamlet and yearns for a little adventure. She finds it in the person of Robert Taylor a young doctor who comes from a wealthy Boston family. After a night's carousing Gaynor and Taylor are married to the chagrin of his fianc Binnie Barnes and her boyfriend James Stewart. Remember this is Boston so Taylor's father Lewis Stone prevails on Taylor to give the marriage a few months trial. Of course this is where the balance of the story comes in. In many ways this plot seems like a harbinger of The Way We Were.Taylor's career was now in full swing as Small Town Girl was the next film after his breakout performance in Magnificent Obsession. Remember in that film he was a playboy who became a doctor. Here's he's a doctor who doubles as a playboy. Never mind though feminine hearts all over the English speaking world were fluttering over MGM's latest heartthrob. My mother who was a juvenile at this time told me that Taylor's appeal back in these days was just about the same as Elvis's.James Stewart was at the beginning of his career as well as MGM had him in about seven features in 1936 mostly in support. Interesting though with worse career management he could have gone on playing hick roles like Elmer the boyfriend. But it was also obvious there was a spark of stardom with him as well.Gaynor would leave the screen a few years later Taylor was at the beginning of his career. He'd have better acting roles in his future but for now Small Town Girl is a great example of the screen heartthrob he was at the beginning of his stardom. Fans of both stars will like what they see in Small Town Girl.".

The story has Gaynor's character  bored Carvel resident Kay Brannan  whisked away by a knight in shining armor Taylor's overly charming and insistent Dr. Bob Dakin in a white convertible among black sedans passing through town in the traffic after the HarvardYale football game for an evening's celebration at the town's Tait's Tavern. Their wild night results in both getting drunk she for the first time and later finding themselves in front of a justice of the peace whereupon Kay's recollection of her humdrum existence allows her to somewhat consciously decide to marry the pleading bachelor unaware that he was already engaged to a debutante more in his class Priscilla Hyde played by Binnie Barnes. When Bob comes to he learns of their predicament and insists his lawyer back in Boston can fix everything. She then learns the full extent of his wealth and stature and of his engagement to Pris when they then drive to his home his father's large estate.Bob thinks Kay deliberately hooked him and perhaps she did to get out of Carvel but both agree to make the best of it for 6 months until they can quietly divorce to avoid a scandal. Pris agrees too though somewhat reluctantly. Initially she goes abroad for a month or two but when she returns she expects to start seeing Bob discretely but regularly. Meanwhile to keep up appearances Bob and Kay had gone on a honeymoon cruise aboard the family yacht captained by Edgar Kennedy's character and stewarded by Chinese mate SoSo played by Willie Fung.During their trip the married couple learned to stop fighting one another in private. But before it could develop into more something that Kay clearly wished for Bob cuts their voyage short to return to his medical practice in Boston.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was by far the best dramedy I have scene. Simple concise deep enough clearly understanding of the humancondition weakness and heart. This picture is absolutely brilliant and no one can take that away. I had to wait to watch this. I have adored Bob Taylor for three months now since I discovered him in late May early June this year. I have been watching all the films of his I can get my hands on. Due to leftwing folks in Hollywood who took his blacklisting response on communism too much to heart he has been slowly erased from MGM TCM Warner classics etc. Since his passing in 1969. Fear not RT fans he is making a comeback and I am one of the few loyal fans on this planet who will partake in bringing back the magic he had on the silverscreen.Small Town Girl Is one of his earlier pictures what with his being only twentyfour years of age during its production. He made a lot of great movies this year including His Brother's Wife Where he met and got to know pal and future failed marriage Barbara Stanwyck. He also had his big break later in the year with Greta Garbo in Camille which is one of the few films that withstood the test of time and people still know about only because of Garbo of course. Anyhow I digress Janet Gaynor. Never had heard of her before this film even despite being raised on all of the classics 1920s onward And even before but now I am so happy this was my first impression of her. Gaynor's portrayal of Katherine Brannan or Kay as she is so called is spoton. She has the most impeccable expressions when it comes to the various emotions of this character throughout the film. There's the frustration in the beginning of a girl being trapped in her own family not being able to relate to them the way she perhaps once had. I relate to her so I suppose that's ultimately why I adore this film so much. I love my family and I have recently returned to them which is another reason I love it cause she sees how important that is when the time comes... then there's the sassy catty version of Miss Brannan where she really tries hard to be the newlywed of Mr T's character Bob Doc Dakin. Whenever I read his name before the Englishman in me pronounced it Dawkin when really it is Daykin Now for Mr Taylor... Ahhhhh Mr Taylor. His performance couldn't have been done better by anyone. And I mean it! Not just cause I am biased and adore the man but to play the scuzzyplayboy in the beginning you have no inkling is in a relationship actually affianced to Priscilla and then to play this sweet innocent Kay and to take her for a ride in all senses of the word besides the modern vulgarity Ohhh and then how he develops as she makes him a better doctor a better professional a better PERSON! Love his performance and hers.This is a mustsee if you like any fun films from the '30s specially '36!ENJOY. and pay close attention most quotable little dramedy I've ever seen.".

Gaynor's portrayal of Katherine Brannan or Kay as she is so called is spoton. She has the most impeccable expressions when it comes to the various emotions of this character throughout the film. There's the frustration in the beginning of a girl being trapped in her own family not being able to relate to them the way she perhaps once had. I relate to her so I suppose that's ultimately why I adore this film so much. I love my family and I have recently returned to them which is another reason I love it cause she sees how important that is when the time comes... then there's the sassy catty version of Miss Brannan where she really tries hard to be the newlywed of Mr T's character Bob Doc Dakin. Whenever I read his name before the Englishman in me pronounced it Dawkin when really it is Daykin Now for Mr Taylor... Ahhhhh Mr Taylor. His performance couldn't have been done better by anyone. And I mean it! Not just cause I am biased and adore the man but to play the scuzzyplayboy in the beginning you have no inkling is in a relationship actually affianced to Priscilla and then to play this sweet innocent Kay and to take her for a ride in all senses of the word besides the modern vulgarity Ohhh and then how he develops as she makes him a better doctor a better professional a better PERSON! Love his performance and hers.This is a mustsee if you like any fun films from the '30s specially '36!ENJOY. and pay close attention most quotable little dramedy I've ever seen.";

And here's an interesting bit of trivia there are more than a few connections to MGM's popular Andy Hardy. The small town that Gaynor's character comes from is called Carvel. The stage play that served as the basis for the Hardy series set the action in a fictitious Idaho town called Carvel but in most of the Andy Hardy movies the location is much more generalized and is basically Carvel USA. But in this film it is clearly established that Carvel is in the east. Road signs during one of the scenes indicate that Carvel is 97 miles from Boston.Janet Gaynor would reteam with director William Wellman for A Star Is Born. Meanwhile MGM would remake this film in 1953 with musical scenes starring Ann Blyth and Farley Granger.".

It's a definite case of WTH the next morning when they wake up in his car with a marriage license sitting between them. This Carvel is no relation to the home of Andy Hardy in the series which began the following year at MGM but like some omen bad or good Lewis Stone is cast here as Taylor's very serious father. He's a doctor who works at a Boston clinic and is involved with the snooty and selfish Binnie Barnes who agrees to go away for six months to avoid the scandal while Taylor and Gaynor pretend to be on their honeymoon and attempting to make their marriage work.Comedy erupts on Taylor's yacht as Gaynor deals with sea sickness even though she's ordered the most magnificent of foods she feels are typical high society cuisine. But once they settle into their marriage Gaynor's feelings become clear even though Barnes' sudden return from her trip means nights alone as he neglects her and the clinic especially a young patient who adores him and Barnes simply hangs up the phone when Gaynor desperately tries to get ahold of him. Uncle Henry Charley Grapewin is dapper here as the well dressed head of the clinic who has no faith in Taylor's future as a top doctor thinking him a fool and warning Stone that he may not have a long future if his frivolous behavior continues.This is at its most entertaining during the first half although at over 100 minutes it does tend to drag a bit. At times Gaynor's small own girl is totally like Esther Blodgett during the early scenes even though she adds some glamour along the way covering provincial innocence that Barnes considers nonthreatening. But classic Hollywood always gave the underdog the man and while Taylor may seem at home in fancy nightclubs the one in Carvel seems way out of place and on yachts he's certainly not going to find happiness with the selfish Binnie no matter how much she tries to manipulate him. It's no surprise to discover that A Star is Born's William Wellman directed this and it would be Gaynor's next role which brought her screen immortality.Joining Taylor Gaynor Barnes and Stone are James Stewart as Gaynor's small town admirer really given nothing to do Nella Walker as Taylor's kindly society matron mother who sees through Barnes and obviously would prefer Gaynor as well as Frank Craven and Elizabeth Patterson as Gaynor's parents and Andy Devine as their soninlaw whose seemingly giant baby pelts everybody with rice pudding and potatoes. It's typical MGM light romantic fare where the praises of home and family explodes off the screen city people are presented as pretentious and shortsighted to the rest of the world and the sweet country folk are praised as only as Louis B. Mayer could demand them to be.".

I think they did a horrible job on his makeup though. His eyebrows looked painted on and the eyeshadow was too noticeable at times. Binnie Barnes was easy to hate in her portrayal as the ruthless fianc so she did her role justice.I think the ending was worst of all. I hated that they brought Gaynor's boyfriend Jimm Stewart back in the picture and had him gushing over her again. She gives the impression she might be interested only to have Taylor show up in his fast sports car and whisk her off. I think it makes women look flighty and trifling with men's hearts.

In Minnelli's films his neurotic lonely unsettled characters always lead to some climactic nightmarish outburst even the musicals but here the whole movie is really a neurotic outburst. Amazingly it all snowballs out of seemingly the most trivial decision the new draperies.What's interesting is that there is no antagonist like Howards End or Eastwood's Unforgiven all the characters do bad things for understandable reasons and thus construct the cobweb. This compares favorably with other nuthouse movies especially ones about the group therapy systemCuckoo's Nest based on Ken Kesey's novel of 1950 5 years before Cobweb and The Caretakers with Joan Crawford as the inflexible head nurse. Those films tend to focus on patients having hysterics and running riot. They don't indict the system but one despotic individual within it a head nurse Kesey's narrator claims that she represents a larger controlling force but even then shows that other wards in the hospital are not the same. However Cobweb takes a more subtle nobody'sfault approach that ultimately has wider darker implications. It implies that these pitfalls are endemic to the system because they are part of human nature which is a more sinister idea especially for the 50s than being able to blame a convenient miniHitler. Therefore it works more convincingly as a microcosm of a society that thinks it's healthy. It's also more salutary and hopeful than those films because it proceeds from this cleareyed cautionary assessment.In the true sense of melodrama it underlines apparently innocuous early scenes with heavy foreboding music by Leonard Rosenman.

None of today's antipsychotic or moodstabilizing pharmaceuticals was yet in use. One scene shows a patient in a hydrotherapy tub  used for sedation. Dr Devenal when things are falling apart ruefully looks at the book he has written  The Theory and Practice of Milieu Therapy. This was an important movement in the 1950's proposing that the patient community was a significant element of the treatment. Patient governments voted on many aspects of institutional life and even at times on treatment decisions that properly were the responsibility of professional staff. Conflict over new drapes seems today to be a foolish plot element but although exaggerated it fit the context of the time.".

This was an important movement in the 1950's proposing that the patient community was a significant element of the treatment. Patient governments voted on many aspects of institutional life and even at times on treatment decisions that properly were the responsibility of professional staff. Conflict over new drapes seems today to be a foolish plot element but although exaggerated it fit the context of the time.";

She plays off Widmark and Boyer in fact The Cobweb would have been a better film had she been the central character. There's also a real good performance by Olive Carey as a Ratched like nurse Ms. O'Brien.

Like Minnelli's Hollywood melodrama The Bad and the Beautiful his 1955 film The Cobweb depicts the indoor routine of a secluse insulated group of people and like the former it focuses on professional careers atoning for emotional hangups particularly isolated disheartened home lives. In a sense the film follows the quest for the perfect family. The film's effect relies on the acute lucidity with which the audience can relate to the characters. The Cobweb becomes a personal film for Minnelli in more manners than one.The psychiatric environment embodies a disparaging enthrallment for Minnelli after years of shepherding Judy through myriad institutions. The curious scenario and some of the characters strike a unity playing to the inner pretentious aesthete in us all. The animosity between the clinic's patients and the bickering personnel detonates over a presumably frivolous decorative issue the choice of new drapes for the lounge. Though for an epicure like Minnelli the matter is invariably not frivolous but crucial. Furnishings express not only ornamental but more deepseated conscientious matters as well.Richard Widmark plays a clinical psychiatrist stuck between his household family of his wife Karen and their two children and the makeshift family that he propagates in his clinic with selfmotivated staff worker Lauren Bacall and agitated teenage artisan John Kerr. Widmark and Bacall ask Kerr to create new drapes for the clinic's library as a healing activity not knowing that Gloria Grahame Widmark's frustrated wife and a stately administrator at the clinic played with bureaucratic bustle by Lilian Gish have already taken charge of doing it. This unfolding intrigue conveys considerable labyrinthine kindred civil and administrative warfare. Reproach flourishes in the forms of the artist as refugee profession as rectification for private disenchantment the grind between cultivating one's identity at the cost of solitude and the compulsion to follow and synthesize into a comprehensive society.The clinic on screen doesn't parallel any specific or incidentally real institution. The group scenes play out like Minnelli's usual party scenes a neurotic congregation of looselipped freethinkers and recoiling selfobservers boldly highlighted by Charles Boyer's admirably selfeffacing performance. He is an actor utterly sure of himself and needs no abstract means of support. And no matter how many times one has heard thoughts expressed by however many people Lauren Bacall always makes them sound original. Thus The Cobweb is not impaired by a lack of realism but embellished by a uniquely expressionistic blend of tones.The movie's household scenes are more horrific than those at the clinic. Many couples will identify strongly with the arguments between Grahame who believes her husband is implying malicious affronts and Widmark who never says anything to his wife that means anything but exactly what he's saying. Widmark is not giving a wooden portrayal of a sensitive man but a sensitive portrayal of a man who is not bothered by much. Conversely Grahame famously said It's not how I looked at a man it was the thought behind it. I believe her because she plays Widmark's wife as someone unhappy with who she is and what she has because her mind is scattered and she is not content with thinking.It's a nugget of blackly hilarious embroidered reality that indicates the immediate misanthropy about family life in the flush 1950s and how many American marriages persist in selfinsulated conditions to this day with similar results. Note this bit between a patient and his psychiatrist Your'e supposed to be making me fit for normal life. What's normal? Yours? If its a question of values your values stink. Lousy middleclass wellfed smug existence. All you care about is a paycheck you didn't earn and a beautiful thing to go home to every night. Or the fleeting brush between Grahame and Kerr in which they consider the connotations of flowers.".

Then too the scenes simply follow one another without heightening the various dramatic impacts. The overall result is to disengage the viewer from what's on screen creating what amounts to a limp drama.As I recall the movie got promoted on the basis of its marquee cast including the classic Lillian Gish making her first appearance in a number of years. The large number of names of course required the script be extended so that each star would get an appropriate amount of screen time. This results in a number of subplots and an overstretched 2hourplus runtime way more than the slender who'sgoingto decidethedraperies premise can sustain. However unlike most reviewers I don't object to the running issue of the curtains ridiculous as it sometimes seems. After all this is an institution for troubled people including the staff so they may well obsess over something seemingly as minor as a decoration. Then too who makes the decision serves as a catalyst for bringing out the various unresolved conflicts among the residents. I just wish the surrounding drama was better written acted and directed.

	schema:reviewBody "You can see what attracted Minnelli to this story as it's partly about a conflict over decor. Maybe this worked in the novel but it's hardly the stuff of compelling screen drama. Of course the choice of drapes is symbolic of independence to the patients and symbolic of her power to Miss Inch and it's actually a realistically mundane conflict such as might actually occur anywhere. It just seems to be much ado about nothing when it's acted out.Minnelli uses a bit of the soundtrack of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers here the picture that trumped his own Brigadoon at the box office  in a scene at the movies. Guess he had no hard feelings.One of Minnelli's interesting misfires. Even though it doesn't really work I've seen it three or four times.The acting is good overall. Richard Widmark as the director of the clinic has two leading ladies Lauren Bacall and Gloria Grahame. This is one of the few times I've ever really seen Grahame miscast. She had a wide range after all she played everything from Violet Bick in It's A Wonderful Life to Rosemary Bartlow in The Bad And The Beautiful to Ado Annie in Oklahoma. But I think you will agree her role defeats her best efforts here. She starts out very well but I'm not sure I always understood where she was coming from as the film wore on. Bacall plays a simple sensible girl and does a good job. Lillian Gish plays the unpredictable Miss Inch Charles Boyer the selfdestructing Dr. Devanal John Kerr the young and artistic Stevie a role originally announced for James Dean. Oscar Levant is called upon to go outside his usual comfort zone and I'm not sure he makes it. Susan Strasburg is excellent in a small role.".

Of course the choice of drapes is symbolic of independence to the patients and symbolic of her power to Miss Inch and it's actually a realistically mundane conflict such as might actually occur anywhere. It just seems to be much ado about nothing when it's acted out.Minnelli uses a bit of the soundtrack of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers here the picture that trumped his own Brigadoon at the box office  in a scene at the movies. Guess he had no hard feelings.One of Minnelli's interesting misfires. Even though it doesn't really work I've seen it three or four times.The acting is good overall.

Just because you've got an excellent ensemble cast doesn't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp! Think about itthe film featured Richard Widmark Lauren Bacall Charles Boyer Gloria Graham Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and yet it still was a bad film! The basic premise of the film isn't bada private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients! Also the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife Widmark and Graham had a lot of promise. However the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalowith bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film. In fact it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of General Hospital. Subtle this film ain't!! Realistic this film ain't!! While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors. For example Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talentespecially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies. Yet here Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accentit just didn't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and onedimensional. Also Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place. Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre.Overall this is a rather awful film. It is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn't very pretty. My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent.PSIn a case of art imitating life Oscar Levant played one of the patients. In real life the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions.".

It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children.The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a reallike lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors many of them Academy Awardnominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest.In a short analysis The Cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly. It just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch.".

However it's the lack of communication in regard to that issue and the complications ensuing therefrom that form the crux of the story. Along the way it becomes clear that the staff are not all that much more welladjusted than the inmates. They display a great deal of professional and personal jealousy insecurity and frustration. But then as the frustrated head of the Bullock household wisely observed in the classic screwball comedy film My Man Godfrey All you need to start an asylum is an empty room and the right kind of people. There are plenty of the right kind of people in The Cobweb among both the staff and the inmates.Directed by Vincent Minelli and featuring a firstrate cast including one of the great stars of silent films Lillian Gish The Cobweb had all the elements to have become a really great movie. Nevertheless somehow it doesn't quite come off. Perhaps it's because the film is a little bit too talky.

Perhaps this form of psychotherapy considered the top drawer treatment of the era should be resurrected maybe the 'family unit' scenario is called for in this world of today where innocence has been totally lost. Now that neurosis at least is accepted in our society the problems of these people seem mildly absurd. Perhaps it's a farce and I was just too dense to get it. Interesting dynamic between the shrink and his wife in 2014 she'd get lawyered up and take him for everything he's worth. Bacall is sultry and beautiful as always. It's amazing that she could do a movie like this as Bogart if he wasn't already deceased had to be very very ill.".

Luckily enough the authors carried on unshaken by total failure of the film at the Box Office as well as among the critics and delivered quite a pleasant Lust for Life biographical film on the life of Vincent Van Gogh a few years later. The Cobweb is based on a novel by William Gibson who also wrote some additional dialogs to the film. The story follows the troubled life of two groups of people one of them being the patients of a mental hospital and the other  doctors who try to run the hospital along with their rather disturbed families.    Dr. Stewart McIver Richard Widmark has introduced a new method of curing the mentally ill on the grounds of a Hospital whose medical director is Dr. Douglas Devanal Charles Boyer who isn't quite supportive of the project. The curing method consists in giving the patients maximum freedom I'm a doctor not a jailer' says Dr. Stewart in the film and engaging them in healthy activities they have inclination for. What the majority of them productively do by making drapes for the Hospital's library. The story of one of the patients not involved in this healthy enterprise and who also happens to be the most troubled of them  Steven John Kerr we follow throughout the film. He is a talented wanttobe painter with suicidal tendencies who is given a freedom to paint and exhibit his works on the Hospital's grounds what he successfully does meanwhile entering a romantic relationship with another patient a shy girl Sue Susan Strasberg who had never ever left the premises of the mental institution and is quite fearful of the outside world.    The relationship between the two of them is probably the most touching element of the film that could actually save it from being a complete bore in the relationships field which happens to be the very thing film is about but unfortunately it never gets to be developed enough while other characters we are left with are utterly helpless to make the viewer care about them in a long and tedious journey through their miserable lives inside the human cobweb' in search of the solution for the drapes for the library' problem. A rather disappointing drama from Vincente Minnelli that stands poorly compared to his other works.  510".

Scenes some no longer than a few seconds were inserted seemingly at random thereby interrupting continuity. I guess they were meant to imply concurrency but they were just annoying. Some were simply unnecessary and did nothing to advance the plot. Then the dialog. It contained so many clichs it was way over the top. There were many instances where I couldn't help but smirk when I should have been somber. And don't get me started on the subject of the drapes. Why such a mundane decision was made the film's pivot point is beyond me. I suspect it was meant to be allegorical but for the life of me I couldn't find the meaning behind it.On the other side of the equation was Gloria Grahame who as always was a joy to behold. But then she always looks good. She tossed her lines just like she tossed her hair with abandon and passion. Too bad she didn't have better ones. And Lilian Gish was an absolute wonder. I agree with another reviewer that had she been made the focal point of this movie it would have been far superior. The rest of the cast was rather formulaic. But when either of these two actors appeared I couldn't help but take notice and wonder what they'd do next. They made an otherwise entirely forgettable effort a guilty pleasure.".

Negative cost approximately 2 million. Initial domestic rentals gross approx. 1 million.COMMENT The most difficult type of role to accomplish successfully is one in which a person conceals his or her true character under a false personality. Players cast in such roles are faced with quite a problem. They must act convincingly enough to dupe their fellow players and yet unconvincingly enough to reveal their true characters to the audience. There are many examples of outstanding portrayals of this kind  Pierre Blanchar in Symphony Pastoral Gloria Grahame in Human Desire Mary Murphy in Hell's Island Edmond O'Brien in The Barefoot Contessa for which he deservedly won an Academy Award. The latest example is admirably executed by one of the world's foremost actors Charles Boyer in The Cobweb.Boyer provides a fascinating study of a oncebrilliant psychiatrist now a deteriorated man. Nominal head of a clinic for nervous disorders he hides his gross inefficiency his moral corruption his cowardice his deception and his cunning beneath a bogus charm. Ironically by too zealous an application to his work his own mind has become so warped that besides wrecking his own life and that of his wife he now begins to wreck the lives of the people he seeks to assist.Secretary of the Clinic is Victoria Inch a vain insolent brawling commandeering middleaged spinster determined to be on the winning side of any quarrel. Interested solely in herself she has no regard whatever for the feelings of other people least of all the patients in her care. This role is superbly portrayed by veteran Lillian Gish.Oscar Levant is excellent in his characterization of a patient who discourages others in order to increase his own sense of importance. Newcomer John Kerr either lacks experience or natural acting ability. His performance may depend entirely on the work of ace director Vincente Minnelli.Minnelli has a flair for satirical charactersketches. That's why he excels in his treatment of Miss Inch. Watch out for the scene in her home between herself and Richard Widmark. Notice also the talkative bore who makes a nuisance of himself at the patients' meetings the two ambulance men on the riverbank the loutish types in the picturetheater etc.The film's only defect is its rather pat conclusion. All the plots are nicely straightened out to the complete satisfaction of the box office. Even Miss Inch's heart is touched. In spite of this one shortcoming the picture is nevertheless quite absorbing and certainly well worth seeing.".

We are left in no uncertain terms that the film will be overacted from the outset that it is scripted for morons filled with pantomime villains and cheesier than my nephew's feet. Like Broken City the screenplay is by a man on this occasion Tom O'Connor who has absolutely nothing else to his credit on IMDb.I stumbled upon this having been unaware of its existence. It arrived without fanfare drowned by the other Bruce Willis vehicle A Good Day to Die Hard and will likely sink without trace but for pillocks like me who see it and then review it. I sincerely hope Willis is as embarrassed about his presence in it as he seems to be about the aforementioned Die Hard 5. I'm not actually sure what he did in Fire With Fire other than run around a bit and then try to hide from the camera when he realised how bad it is.Fireman Jeremy Coleman Josh Duhamel who previously 'delighted' in the execrable Movie 43 escapes a hold up in a convenience store by ber villain Hagan Vincent D'Onofrio. Seen as a major witness in a trial to rid the world of Hagan Coleman is placed in the witness protection programme and whisked away to a far off state where he is allowed to keep his forename and does nothing to alter his appearance. He is placed in the care of US Marshall Talia Rosario Dawson who caters to his every need. Predictably.And then the baddies come after him again. Predictably. Baddies which include Britain's greatest acting export Vinnie Jones who mystifyingly has 71 film and TV credits to his name compared to just 57 for Sir Kenneth Branagh. Explain that!. Yes that's the level we're at here and it doesn't improve one iota.In a moment of tenderness Talia asks Coleman how he gets people out of fires and he delivers his next line ins such a way it might just as well have a great big flashing neon sign that states 'REMEMBER THIS LINE. I'LL SAY IT AGAIN AT THE END OF THE FILM WHEN I PREDICTABLY SAVE YOU FROM A FIRE.' The thing is when we get there he gets it wrong! And even the fire from which they escape looks like the cheap special effects i.e. from a gas canister on Casualty.Oh in case you didn't get the whole title thing it has a double meaning Coleman has to beat the baddies at their own manner i.e. with guns and he's a fireman and there's a fire.

The Hero transforms into a killing machine after shooting some cans in the forest yea right. But the worst is the end. He burns down a house and several gangsters with 2 bottles of some inflammable liquids. That was one of the worst final scenes I have ever seen. It looks like the villains took a bath in that gas before they entered the building and walls and stairways made of stone do burn like paper and of course everything explodes because it is gas station but I didn't recognize that. Summary If this would have been an ad for some barbecue lighter then it was great but it wasn't. Stupid movie for simple people. Not even worth for Willis Fans. Now after this review I am asking myself why I still gave it 510 it should have been 34 at max. Probably because I am a Bruce Willis fan.".

Summary If this would have been an ad for some barbecue lighter then it was great but it wasn't. Stupid movie for simple people. Not even worth for Willis Fans. Now after this review I am asking myself why I still gave it 510 it should have been 34 at max. Probably because I am a Bruce Willis fan.";

When they decide not to kill him Jeremy is left alone to ID the murderer. Not wanting loose ends Jeremy is now a target and he must now fight for his life to survive and also to take care of the killer the the cops have been trying to get for years. I will start by saying that I am a pretty big Bruce Willis fan but he has been very hit or miss lately. I really liked Catch .44 but thought SetUp was lame. Also as a disclaimer the quote I used is actually from this movie not from the movie Taken so don't let that confuse you. The movie itself isn't anything new or amazing but it is actually pretty fast paced and keeps you interested and watching the entire time. The movie when you break it down is just another vigilante type revenge movie but again because it's so fast paced and entertaining you can't stop watching. Also Vincent D'Onofrio gives such a great performance in this that watching for just for him is almost enough to keep you till the end. Overall this is a fast paced exciting action movie that is the perfect kind to just put in and veg out to. I liked it. I give it a B.".

You may notice I'm not going into great detail about the storyline. That's because there isn't really much to give away in terms of plot. It's just a revenge film. And it's not that bad. It's the sort of film you rent over buying and probably shouldn't pay too much attention to the minor plot holes here and there.I didn't mind it and certainly didn't think I'd wasted an hour and a half watching it. However the thing I was hoping for was to see the firefighter using his firefighting skills to flamb his tormenters. In fact... I thought that was the whole point of the film i.e. he uses what he knows to start fires with which to exact his revenge. As it turns out he just buys a gun and shoots them.Oh and Bruce Willis is in it too. But then it was never released in the cinema and Bruce seems to have a clause in his contract that states he must never appear in a film that's actually given a theatrical release.Anyway as I say rent this before you buy.

It seemed like it was made for TV because its really basic and the acting was quite average. The thing that gets me is that these directors are really not taking advantage of the fact that they have these top actors. They keep on bringing out these stupid movies with terrible plots not realising who they are working with. The ending of this movie was terrible and the white fire cracked me up. Once I knew that 50 Cent  Vinnie Jones was in this film I knew just what to expect so it didn't surprise me that it went straight to DVD. There isn't any twists or anything clever with the storyline and I just couldn't wait for it to end. Terrible!RoundUp Like everyone else when you see Bruce Willis I'm the cast you just have to watch it but this was one movie that I wish that I didn't watch. The leading actor wasn't bad in Transformers so I won't totally put the blame on him. It is definitely the directors fault who should have known that this film was going to be a flop. It was a bit weird seeing Bruce Willis in a thrilleraction movie not getting involved in the actually nitty gritty of the movie. All he done was sit behind a desk in the police station which made the movie even worse. It also could have done without the love story which just made things complicated but it wasn't the major thing wrong with the movie. I think you can tell that I wasn't that impressed.Budget 20million Worldwide Gross 5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there thrilleraction movies about someone who witnesses a murder and is threatened to be killed if he testifies. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "I am truly amazed at the bad reviews for this film. People giving it 1 or 2 out of ten. I think they just expect it to be garbage because it has a strong cast but went straight to DVD. I don't pretend to understand the ins and outs of film production but there is no reason quality wise why this didn't go to theatres. It is a well paced thrilling action vengeance picture that satisfies in every way. Is it amazing? No. Is it good? Absolutely. It has all the elements that make a great action film. The gore in the film is through the roof. There are some truly nasty violent scenes that hearken back to the 80's when Bruce Willis was king. As I expected Bruce Willis was not in the film very much just slightly more than a cameo although he has some good lines and a particularly fun badass scene of him beating up a thug easily. Fire with Fire is a terrific straight to DVD entry that is worthy of any action fans attention.Josh Duhamel leads the film expertly. He is a great leading man and holds his own in the film. He has terrific action scenes and brings an emotionally charged charisma to it. I have always liked him and I think he still has some big roles ahead of him. I wasn't entirely sold on Rosario Dawson as his romantic leading woman but as it turns out she did a good job. Their chemistry together wasn't amazing but they both had good characters and it served the film well. Bruce Willis as I mentioned was sort of a background supporting character but he is good in the role. He has some powerful lines and some good scenes and as a huge Willis fan I can watch him in just about anything. Vincent D'Onofrio was fantastic as the villain. He was old school 80's great action villain. He was evil to the core and a great antagonist. I was worried that like many action films he wouldn't get a really great ending to his villainy but there are no worries in that front because his death scene is A! For those of you concerned that 50 Cent is in the film or Rampage Jackson...they have blink or you'll miss it cameos as gang bangers.TV Director and stunt man David Barrett has had a lot of experience with action films and with great Television shows. So he knows how to tell a good story and he knows great action. I think you'll see him become more and more of a film director because he certainly has talent and an eye for this sort of thing. Before I knew where Barrett's background was I thought Fire with Fire felt like a really good TV series or a start to something sort of like The Fugitive. This won't become a classic action flick in fact it will likely be mostly forgotten but don't let that deter you because the film is actually well worth seeing and something action fans can warm up to. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Released August 31 2012 by director David Barrett starring Josh Duhamel Rosario Dawson Bruce Willis and Vincent D'Onofrio among some other notable talent. Fire with Fire centers on a dedicated firemen Duhamel who witnesses a brutal double homicide at a convenience store. Managing to escape with a bullet in his arm he now holds the sole testimony that can put the violent crime lord D'Onofrio away for good. Matters become complicated when while under witness protection his life and the lives of everyone he holds dear are threatened. Realizing no matter what he does their lives will forever be in danger he forgoes marshal protection and takes the fight to the crime lord using any means necessary to find and kill his adversary.Fire with Fire point blank is a low end action film that doesn't pretend to be anything else. Sure there is a love story thrown in there but only to give more reason for the violence and choices the protagonist makes. There is also a side story about a cop Willis forced to choose between his duties as a cop and his personal morals but unfortunately his actions never really play a part in the main plot so it becomes inconsequential. Knowing this you can't go in expecting a movie that will blow your socks off or even be that memorable after a few days. Although with a pretty solid list of actors you also can't it expect to be a total failure.I'm pretty happy to report that this movie is far from a failure but also far from a Mission Impossible II action flick which is why I gave it a 5 smack dab in the middle. The acting by all actors involved is done well enough to help you believe and carry the story especially by D'Onofrio who gives you that cold but calculated killer feel. Duhamel does well as the action lead plenty of practice with the Transformers films I'm sure.I will say with Duhamel's character supposed to be this do right save lives kind of guy the script writers or Duhamel didn't give his character that feeling of really struggling with the violent acts he had to commit. Sure he showed the typical signs like puking but other then that I just feel Duhamel didn't show the struggle the character felt internally.Rosario Dawson was nice to watch as a female lead. Wasn't really a damsel in distress by any means and the film didn't focus on trying to rescue her from some evil captor which is always refreshing.The fighting choreography is well acted and fits with the feel of the film a gritty bar room brawl kind of fighting. Makeup is passable with the blood bullet holes in bodies and so on and so forth looking plenty realistic. A typical fastpaced heart racing blood pumping soundtrack is missing from the film either that or I didn't notice it. There was only one noticeable action song in my opinion and it was towards the beginning but I did not research its name.The ending was like any normal action movie clich and featured that iconic character phrase or saying that all action movie characters have I believe his was I need you to trust me. Do everything that I ask and I promise we'll survive this. Do you trust me? The movie is relatively fast so it does get right into the action and it is possible you will feel like your missing the meat of the movie but I don't feel it hurts this film too much because if it went on too much longer I think it would have hurt the film more then helped it though a few more violent scenes from Duhamel and D'Onofrio to show what they were both really capable of would have been nice.So as you can see the film's positives balance out with the negatives. There are not too many failures to make it bad and not too many successes to make it great which is why its simply decent. If your a fan of D'Onofrio who I enjoy on Criminal Intent or Duhamel who I've only watched on Transformers then you will enjoy this movie as the two get plenty of screen time. If you like Rosario Dawson or find her attractive you'll also like the film as she is prevalent for a good amount of time and has pg13 sexual scenes as well. Action movie fans with no real high expectations but who enjoy a simple plot with a bold protagonist will also enjoy this.My last note is towards Bruce Willis and Curtis Jackson 50 Cent. If your looking for a Bruce Willis action film where he has plenty of acting time and kicks butt all day this is not the film as he plays no real significant character and is not shown often. Albeit he has one pretty neat fight sequence that lasts three to five seconds and is fun to watch. As for Curtis I know many who enjoy his music but not so much his acting though I will admit I enjoyed Before I self Destruct. I'll tell you right now his total screen time is three minutes max and in those minutes he does decently well portraying his insignificant character. I actually laughed when I saw him on the cover of the movie poster as he literally is no part of this film other then a gun seller I assume it was for whatever publicity.Either way this movie gets a 55 from me. Watching it not watching it either way it won't affect you negatively.".

There was only one noticeable action song in my opinion and it was towards the beginning but I did not research its name.The ending was like any normal action movie clich and featured that iconic character phrase or saying that all action movie characters have I believe his was I need you to trust me. Do everything that I ask and I promise we'll survive this. Do you trust me? The movie is relatively fast so it does get right into the action and it is possible you will feel like your missing the meat of the movie but I don't feel it hurts this film too much because if it went on too much longer I think it would have hurt the film more then helped it though a few more violent scenes from Duhamel and D'Onofrio to show what they were both really capable of would have been nice.So as you can see the film's positives balance out with the negatives. There are not too many failures to make it bad and not too many successes to make it great which is why its simply decent. If your a fan of D'Onofrio who I enjoy on Criminal Intent or Duhamel who I've only watched on Transformers then you will enjoy this movie as the two get plenty of screen time. If you like Rosario Dawson or find her attractive you'll also like the film as she is prevalent for a good amount of time and has pg13 sexual scenes as well. Action movie fans with no real high expectations but who enjoy a simple plot with a bold protagonist will also enjoy this.My last note is towards Bruce Willis and Curtis Jackson 50 Cent. If your looking for a Bruce Willis action film where he has plenty of acting time and kicks butt all day this is not the film as he plays no real significant character and is not shown often. Albeit he has one pretty neat fight sequence that lasts three to five seconds and is fun to watch. As for Curtis I know many who enjoy his music but not so much his acting though I will admit I enjoyed Before I self Destruct. I'll tell you right now his total screen time is three minutes max and in those minutes he does decently well portraying his insignificant character. I actually laughed when I saw him on the cover of the movie poster as he literally is no part of this film other then a gun seller I assume it was for whatever publicity.Either way this movie gets a 55 from me. Watching it not watching it either way it won't affect you negatively.";

Kung Fu Cyoborg is actually a romance story with robots as its subplot. Now with romance as its main plot don't expect amazing and explosive action. Yeah there are a few action scenes but they are not really fantastic in fact they disappoint. The rarelyappeared Wu Jing is the only one in the movie to use Kung Fu plus he barely use it hence the title Kung Fu Cyborg.The story When it is production people are saying that it would be the Chinese's Transformers. Indeed it is but it is obviously no match for Transformers. Transformers has a massive budget and Kung Fu Cyborg has a low budget. So there is a difference in the CGI robots. In Kung Fu Cyborg you get cheap CGI robots fighting but at least they are entertaining. But when it comes to the story it is where it is not good. The romance story tends to get a bit boring and the comedic scenes are not very amusing. There are no main action plot even there is no main villain. Action fans like me will be disappointed in lack of action. The romance plot starts a bit slow but the pace of second half of the movie seems to be faster.Overall It is not so bad but it is disappointing as it lacks of amazing action. When we hear the title Kung Fu Cyborg who does not think it will be fulled of action. On the whole it may be disappointing but at least some entertainment values are there. It is okay if you just leave your brain at home and not expect any amazing action scene.".

This may be profitable for the Hong Kong movie makers as well with 1.5 billion potential audience the market might be bigger than Europe and Americas combined. The visuals of this movie is definitely mainland China. It takes place in one of the province's police station. The year is 2048 and they have a cyborg cop that uses its talent in a funny way. The sense of humor is Hong Kong but the color and cinematography is mainland China. I don't like the bluish tint on the color and very 2 dimensional appearance of the scenes but the story is definite improvement over many of the stuffy movies coming out of China. This genre is hit or miss. Recently I've watched a really bad Wong Jin movie that was oriented for the mainlanders. I'm hoping that the mainland influence isn't going to adversely affect the quality of Hong Kong movies but would be the other way around.This is a pretty good movie with some cool depiction of the future. Action is over the top in some areas. The cyborg guy K1 is a rascal and that adds to the comedy of the story. People's motivation for their actions seems pretty pretentious. I guess lot of acting ability is needed when you are constantly under scrutiny. I both worry about the future of Hong Kong movies and have hopes for the mainland Chinese movies.

As a romance it's very funny without ever needing to resort to the anarchic destruction of many 'screwball' affairs as a comedy it laughs at its characters with loving affection rather than glee and discomfiture.In the best of farces absurd events unfold with a seemingly inevitable logic. It must be admitted that in this picture the plot occasionally skates past shortterm expedients that just have to be taken for granted  but the ensuing situations are milked to such good effect that it's easy to turn a blind eye. The film is rich in setpieces both verbal and visual with a host of lively minor characters to accompany the noteperfect performances of the principals.Laird Cregar excels as usual in the role of the resonant urbane Warren performing with impressive agility in his swimmingpool scene while Spring Byington is here the best I have seen her the actress submerging her trademark mannerisms in an actual character. Gene Tierney is sweet smart funny and distinctly shapely as the girl who pulls off the perfect con and then learns what she has really done. Henry Fonda  for my money both more credible and more sympathetic here than in The Lady Eve  plays a mathematical dreamer with a passion for sailing and the sea while some eyecatching yachts of the era star in the background apparently shot on location! The film starts off light and gradually gains in intensity and emotional weight as it goes along with frequent upwellings of laughter to season some very genuine feeling. The two lovers are charming together from a very Freudian first scene in which the camera settles on Linda's trim contours as a somewhat dislocated John tries to describe the lines of his yacht to the final escape Perhaps the highlight is the taxicab sequence in which our hero intoxicated with excitement is convinced he has devised a 'system' to beat the roulette wheel while Linda and the audience in on the secret find him both hilarious and adorable at the same time.Like all good comedies Rings on Her Fingers laughs at our human frailties but it does so with a gentle touch. It shares with Some Like It Hot an essential innocence and sweetness at the root of its effervescent humour and scarcely sets a foot wrong in the process. I enjoyed this littleknown littlerated picture very much indeed.".

Tierney is a shopgirl drafted by Byington and Warren to help them con rich men out of their money. One of their marks is Fonda with whom Tierney falls in love. Problems arise and that's putting it mildly.Mamoulian loved scripts that contained characters with dual identities such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Mark of Zorro so Rings on Her Fingers must have appealed to him. It has Tierney a New York salesgirl posing as an heiress Fonda an accountant who at first gives the impression he's a rich man Cregar posing as a yacht owner and Byington posing as Tierney's wealthy mother.I liked this charming comedy but I have to take issue with calling it screwball. It's played too straight. Fonda creates a wonderful character  a sincere caring person who wants to live life in the present and not live as others  lock up their money and in so doing lock up their lives. His internalized approach to acting did not lend itself to comedy. Tierney is gorgeous and a good actress but comedy wasn't her thing. Picture the airport scenes with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant and you get the point.Laird Cregar is wonderfully bombastic and funny as the conniver Warren  what a loss to filmdom that he died so young and Spring Byington does a great job as his partner.Henry Fonda never forgave Darryl F. Zanuck for forcing him into a sevenyear contract in order to do The Grapes of Wrath though Mamoulian was a great director I think Fonda probably felt misused here. Opposite a pro like Stanwyck he fared in comedy much better. Tierney is lovely though.Good film.".

It's full of surprises and neat little touches and bits of dialog. Everyone is at their best even the normally somewhat annoying Gene Tierney who plays a shop girl posing as an heiress. The plot's twists and turns extend to the very last scene. And Spring Byington is quite good. Henry Fonda plays the hero as an honest accountant who scrimps and saves to buy a boat but is conned out of the money by Byington and Tierney posing as mother and daughter. By the end he is also seduced by dreams of great wealth ill gotten and becomes a gambler with a system. Creiger who died tragically while in his twenties gives a great performance as a member of the gang. The film reminds me a bit of Preston Sturgis particularly the Lady Eve. Worth a watch!".

The plot gets out of hand when Tierney wants to return the stolen money to Fonda. Spring Byington as Tierney's mother is always a pleasant addition to any movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Former department store clerk SusanGene Tierneyis in a dilemma. She helped swindle John WheelerHenry Fonda out of 15000. in a phony yacht sale. Now discovering that he is no millionaire and had put his life savings into that boat she feels sorry for him and is developing a crush on him. She wants to give back his money without him learning that she was in on the swindle. How to do that? She conceives a plan to induce a casino managerplayed by Henry Stephensonto arrange things so that Fonda always wins at various games while she pays the manager with her 15000. Fonda figures he's so lucky or brilliant at gambling that he can quit his job as an accountant. But then fellow swindler Laird Cregar pressures Stephenson to make Fonda lose it all so that he can get his 15000. back. Tierney arrives again and after arguing at length with Cregar once more pressures Stephenson to make Fonda win again. He again wins his 15000. Meanwhile Fonda has a detective working on catching Cregar whom he believes is the only swindler. However the detective eventually concludes there were 3 involved and he knows which 3. The climax  near the end is the most exciting part with Tierney playing hide and seek with the detective at the airport where she's trying to get a flight to CA before he catches her. She's also hiding from Tod a friend of Fonda's who is arriving on another plane and who thinks she will marry him soon. Tod and Fonda briefly meet and mention they will be getting married soon unknowingly to the same girl.On the surface it's not a bad romantic farce dare we say a screwball comedy? However there are too many glaring instances of required suspended disbelief for my liking which downgrades it in my eyes. For example why would Fonda hand over the 15000. without a certificate of ownership shown or given? And why would Cregar hand over the entire 15000. swindled to Tierney a newcomer for 'safe' keeping? And just how did Stephenson manage to 'fix' the various gaming methods so that Fonda either won or lost all the time? And how did that detective manage to conclude that there were 3 swindlers involved instead of one without talking to one of them? Heavy heavy Cregar did an excellent job as a suave intelligent swindler. Too bad he would die 2 years later from complications of surgery necessitated by his crash dieting trying to change his image from a heavy heavy....Perennial mother Spring Byington hardly came across as a legitimate 3rd member of the swindlers....Senior Henry Stephenson was included in many a film as a grandfatherly figure.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to the Citadel Film series book The Films Of Henry Fonda Rings On Her Fingers was the third of a three picture deal that Rouben Mamoulian had with 20th Century Fox. The other two films done in this package were the Tyrone Power classics The Mark Of Zorro and Blood And Sand. Would that this film were light years as good as those two were.Not that it's bad but it's strictly second rate Mamoulian and definitely second rate Fonda. This was the period in Fonda's career where he had signed a studio contract to get the role in The Grapes Of Wrath and Darryl Zanuck would be forcing him into things that were second rate. This part that Fonda has here was a ripoff of what he did on loan to Paramount for The Lady Eve. Fonda is once again the naive pigeon of some con artists played by Spring Byington and Laird Cregar.

	onyx:emotionText "According to the Citadel Film series book The Films Of Henry Fonda Rings On Her Fingers was the third of a three picture deal that Rouben Mamoulian had with 20th Century Fox. The other two films done in this package were the Tyrone Power classics The Mark Of Zorro and Blood And Sand. Would that this film were light years as good as those two were.Not that it's bad but it's strictly second rate Mamoulian and definitely second rate Fonda. This was the period in Fonda's career where he had signed a studio contract to get the role in The Grapes Of Wrath and Darryl Zanuck would be forcing him into things that were second rate. This part that Fonda has here was a ripoff of what he did on loan to Paramount for The Lady Eve. Fonda is once again the naive pigeon of some con artists played by Spring Byington and Laird Cregar. They're using Gene Tierney who is lured by the chance of easy money into their nest as the come on in a confidence game.

	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen Henry Fonda in very many forgettable performances but Henry Fonda's performance in Rings on Her Fingers is one of his clunkers. The film stars the beautiful Gene Tierney who is a wholesome hard working girl named Susan Miller alias Linda Worthington selling girdles until two scammers wave a bunch of greenbacks in her face to join them in suckering foolish and gullible men out of their hard earned money. One of the men these three 3 con artists decide to con is a wealthy young man named John Wheeler played by Henry Fonda.The latter half of the film kind of reminded me of the many confusing and chaotic comedies that Abbott and Costello had so much success in making films in the same era of the 1940's decade. I guess I have a bit of a hard time appreciating Henry Fonda playing the sap who falls in love with his con artist girlfriend. When Gene Tierney whose alias is Linda Worthington is being chased by a private detective in the airport and the two men who both want to marry her are also present Linda must stay on her toes to keep the two men apart from each other while either one is in her presence. I just felt that this film could not decide if it wanted to be a crime film or a comedy romance or a drama? In the end it does not matter as it really is a forgettable film other than seeing the beautiful Gene Tierney in a bathing suit squirming around on a blanket trying to get Henry Fonda's attention.I give it a 6 out of 10 rating".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie on TV. I have to confess I had never heard about this title until I discovered that it was about to be shown today. I have always liked Henry Fonda and hold Gene Tierney as one of the most beautiful actresses Hollywood has ever produced. That irresistible onetwo punch and my love for old BW movies were responsible for an hour and a half of my life That I will never get back.The direction of this movie is very loose and without any sense of respect for the good cast. Things happen out of the blue and people keep unexpectedly appearing in settings without any reason or logic just to conveniently help the story along. It's as if the director has shot this in a manner of inventing scenes as he went along without much forethought. The last scene is completely silly and as one character correctly points out corny. By then one does not care to even think about what clue from 'the note' and the two hours ago comment prompts John Wheeler to do what he does.Fonda is oddly cast as Wheeler the shallow and gullible sap who stays one dimensional throughout the story. Someone like James Stewart would have taken the role and given it more depth. With his talent for both comedy and drama Stewart would have given us a more edgy performance forcing us to actually care for this character instead of almost rooting against him as a moron who deserves what he gets. Tierney is of course as beautiful as ever. Her character the conflicted con is faced with the most complicated situation and because of that has to pretty much carry the movie. She is a good enough actress to do that but the lame script and an obviously undemanding director deny us and her a more memorable performance. The set pieces should have kept us on the edge of our seats with comedic anxiety and the fear that things could unravel at any moment. Tierney's character should have been asked to head off the potential disasters through her wit and smarts rather than by lucky coincidences. It's really too bad. With tighter direction and a plot not so laden with holes and possibly Jimmy Stewart as Wheeler this forgettable flick would have had a chance to be at least a minor classic. Going back to the beginning of this writing I have to confess I had never heard about this title and now I know why.".

If you want to watch a not so good movie about a gang of thieves headed by a pretty lady thief and starring Henry Fonda you might want to try Rings on Her Fingers...but I wouldn't. Oddly despite the similarity of the plots and being only one year apart the two films are so much different.When the film begins Gene Tierney is a working girl approached by a couple of grifters Spring Byington and Laird Creger. They want her to help them fleece rich guys...and she readily agrees. Their first mark is John Wheeler Fondaa guy who is planning on buying a yacht. Instead they pretend to own a yacht and sell him a yacht that isn't even theirs. But Wheeler is a bit of a boob and doesn't realize Susan Tierney is one of the gang and soon they fall in love and plan on marrying. The only trouble is that she's not the only fakehe's not rich at all. While this idea could have worked what follows is just rather dopey. She wants to help him recover much of the money they stole and arranges for him to start winning at a casino. Then he gets the notion that he's superlucky and quits his job to become a professional gambler. During all this time a private detective hired by Wheeler is investigating the theft. What's to come of all this? Who cares.The bottom line is that you have two films with very similar plots yet one is not very good due to pedestrian writing. Additionally the writer made Fonda's character such an idiot that he was frustrating to watch. All in all the film SHOULD have been a lot better given the cast but it is at best a timepasser. A bit of a disappointment.By the way if you do see this film or other early Gene Tierney films you might not recognize her. Like a few other actresses Rita Hayworth immediately comes to mind the studio decided to do a BIG makeover and they really accentuated Tierney's cheeks in her films starting around the time she starred in Laura 1944.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some have rightly criticized this movie as being a glossedover fictionalized lowerbudget presentation of Babe Ruth while The Pride of the Yankees afforded teammate Gehrig a bigbudget Alistcast project.However both were off the proverbial mark. Gehrig was not quite the totallyaffable individual Gary Cooper portrayed and his mother not quite the Aunt Bea type shown.Babe Ruth was a largerthanlife persona bawdy irreverent and a national icon which in more recent times have only seen perhaps Muhammed Ali and Michael Jordan afforded anything close to the equal amount of acclaim. And one must always remember these two have had the benefit of television including dozens of cablesatellite venues and far greater electronic and print media than Ruth ever knew.There is an interesting film clip I've seen many times. Ruth who batted third is rounding third base and going to home plate after hitting a home run while Gehrig waiting to bat fourth has his back completely turned ignoring him much less shaking his hand. These two were not on speaking terms for significant amounts of time while teammates  far different from the tone of either of their biographies.This is quite a fictionalized movie however few biopics of this era  sports or otherwise  weren't. But it should be noted that Ruth now well past a half century since his tragic illness and death and much further beyond his prime  still has led Athlete of the Century and similar lists with only forementioned Ali and Jordan along with Jim Thorpe as close contenders.I for one would like to see a film which would present both Ruth and Gehrig in a realistic style made today. Dennis Quaid after putting on a few pounds and a little padding and makeup could portray Ruth. He's lefthanded and can portray a baseball athlete ala The Rookie playing a role of a character a decade younger than he with Costner as Gehrig. Kevin also can handle a bat and ball Gary Cooper playing Gehrig had the baseball talent of a 12yearold and the film had to be shown inreverse to make him appear lefthanded. While Costner is righthanded his athleticism and better techniques today could overcome this.They are a little longerintooth now who isn't? but both are in excellent shape look younger than they are and modern techniques and makeup should be able to overcome any problems of their playing younger.Personally I think a firstclass film with two major stars playing Ruth and Gehrig in a story presenting the harder edges of their personalities relationship family lives etc.  as well as all the positive aspects we've seen before  could be an amazing flick.Finally this film is a lot better now not because its story or presentation have improved  but for its nostalgic view of 1940's film and the baseball locations and scenes as they were then.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a lad I remember taking the book this film was based on out of the Brooklyn Public Library. Babe Ruth's ghost written memoirs by Bob Considine were considered so innocuous that it could be found in the children's section of the library. The Babe had only been gone from us for about seven years when I read the book and saw the film. The film is as how he would like to have been remembered. Of course it was hardly the character he was. Left out of this film is the hedonism that ran rampant in his persona the drinking the womanizing the brawling. What gets me about this film is that William Bendix was a huge baseball fan in fact he was a bat boy for the New York Giants as a kid. So too was William Frawley when he wasn't drinking you could find him at a game in a given city during the season.Some of the bare bones facts of Ruth's life are covered and some of the stories attributed about Ruth are presented here. Left conspicuously out of the film are Ruth's first wife and daughter. This was a film intended for kids and that wouldn't have quite fit. In a recent biography of Ruth I learned that the Considine book wasn't even Considine's. Bob Considine was a fine journalist and reporter who was not a sportswriter per se. Ruth agreed to the memoirs while he was undergoing treatment for cancer to leave a permanent legacy. But he proved such a difficult subject to interview because he dominated the sessions with his own rollicking anecdotes when he wasn't in pain from the illness. Long time Ruth friend and noted baseball writer Fred Lieb helped Considine with the book with no credit as Lieb ghosted a whole lot of the book himself helped by his encyclopedic knowledge of Ruthiana.In that era of the Twenties what has been termed the Golden Age of Sports Babe Ruth's was the brightest star in the sports world. He was a larger than life figure down to the fact that his excesses were larger than life. He transformed his sport to one of power from one of speed. He drew sellout in every American League city transformed the New York Yankees into the greatest sports franchise ever.Ruth had a couple of good made for TV films about him that were closer to the truth. But he deserved what Lou Gehrig got a big A budget film from someone like Samuel Goldwyn. Still he did better in a biographical film than Jackie Robinson.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is often pointed to cynically by sportswriters and fans as the ultimate ridiculously sugarcoated sportshero film. Who's to argue? If you know Babe Ruth and what he was like you almost have to laugh at some of the stuff in here. That's not to say Ruth was a bad man because he wasn't. He was extremely likable guy whom his teammates all loved he was fantastic with kids and very very generous man. But he also had a lot of faults too some of which got him in big trouble with his managers and league officials. His health was a problem at times thanks in part to his opulent lifestyle. He was a glutton and an adulterer and life wasn't fun for him as he got unfairly passed over to be a manager something he desperately sought. Very few if any of these negative qualities are the in the film  just the good 'ole boy  the kind William Bendix played on his TV show The Life Of Riley. Also unrealistic  and typical of sports movies in the classic era  is Bendix trying to throw and hit a baseball. Thank goodness modernday movies don't have actors like this who are clueless on how to play the actual sport they are portraying.Yet as sweet and unrealistic as this film can be it's a lot better than doing the reverse which is what Hollywood did in 1992. Too bad you usually get two extremes when it comes biographies made in Hollywood. In the classic era films our heroes could do no wrong. Since the '60s our heroes are shown to be blemished more than anything else. Where is the middle ground.The solution obviously is to be fair and balanced but don't look for that in most biographies made into movies especially dealing with sports heroes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know of no two human lives that are more clearly stories than that of the two great Yankee teammates Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Most lives a litany of events some of which are part of stories that cut diagonally across the life rather than encompassing it and driving it forward. Those stories do not emanate from or thus reveal the character of the person portrayed.Ruth was an undisciplined manchild with a prodigious talent that enabled him to reinvent and save his sport and made him the symbol of his era a time when America was emerging as a world power and breaking the bonds of its own traditions to create a more modern and exciting way of living. But he offended not only the traditionalists but the businessmen who controlled his sport or used to until he came along. When age and his lifestyle began to catch to him they disposed of him for all but ceremonial purposes. Meanwhile his age passed and the world grew more serious. He wound up lonely and depressed and became a cancer victim at the early age of 53.Gehrig was a serious dutiful momma's boy also blessed with a prodigious talent that thrust him into where he most hated to be the limelight. It's interesting that the worst year of his prime was the one year he didn't have either Ruth or DiMaggio as a teammate 1935. He fared much better in their shadow. He was noted by those who noted him as a strong reliable workhorse of a man and a player someone you could count on. He was amazingly beset by a disease which robbed him of his strength the very quality in him people most admired. And that in turn thrust him directly into the lime light. People didn't think he could respond but he looked into his heart and said what was there and nobody ever forgot it.How could you miss telling stories like that? But amazingly Hollywood has always seemed to get Lou's story right and the Babe's wrong. Even though there were casting problems in all the movies made about them the quality of Pride of the Yankees and of A Love Affair The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story is superb on both counts. Meanwhile The Babe Ruth Story is one of the worst movies ever made and both the TV movie Babe Ruth and the film The Babe are deeply flawed.Pride of the Yankees is old fashioned Hollywood sentiment but done by experts. I find Teresa Wright's alternate clowning and crying to be a little too much and I've heard all the stories about Gary Cooper's attempts to learn how to play baseball he was a cowboy and an artist but no ballplayer. But he was a great actor and he got to the essence of the character beautifully. His delivery of the final speech is perfect for which reason he was asked to repeat it to the troops over and over during his travels during WWII. I'll be loving it always.The Babe Ruth Story casts a stumpy potatofaced introvert William Bendix as the big moonfaced extrovert Babe Ruth. It's a competent B movie version of his life for the first half. It might have just been a disappointing followup to Pride of the Yankees if they'd left it at that but about halfway through the script suddenly delves into science fiction and turns Ruth into a maker of medical miracles with one ridiculous scene after another. He is however unable to save himself in the end or even the film.All I saw of Babe Ruth was a few scenes but once I saw Stephen Lang wearing what appeared to be a plastic mask which tried but failed to make him resemble Ruth I wanted no part of it.The Babe is the Gone With the Wind of Babe Ruth movies which isn't saying much. But is a good retelling of his life and Goodman enacts the part superbly. It ends at the right moment with Ruth hitting his last three home runs in one game in Pittsburgh to stick it to those who were jeering him. But Goodman is twice the size Ruth ever was. The Babe as old photos show was about 200 pounds when his career started and worked his way up to perhaps 250 pounds when he quit. Goodman must have been a minimum of 350 pounds when he filmed this movie and sent the wrong message that you can be a blimp and still be the greatest player in the sport an image that baseball people really resent.While casting is not the only problem it could have been improved and that might have helped. Physically someone like Dick Foran or Wayne Morris would have been a better match for Gehrig than Cooper but they wouldn't have given as good a performance. Kurt Russell who played some minor league ball or Jeff Bridges would have been a much better choice for A Love Story than Hermann. That other Reilly Jackie Gleason would have been a much better choice than Bendix for The Babe Ruth Story especially if he had eaten the script. Maybe the best time to do a Ruth movie and do it right would have been after Roger Maris broke his record. Either Claude Akins my favorite choice of all or Simon Oakland would have made excellent Ruths. Ramon Bieri was a good Ruth in A Love Story. I'm not sure who would play him these days.Of course the best performance as Babe Ruth was by the guy who played him in Pride of the Yankees.".

It's easier to exploit a live man's life than a dead one's Mrs. Ruth suggests. That's a primary reason why the production and everything associated with it was hurried. In the book she also stated that she would forgo all royalties from the film's showings...if it were to be permanently shelved. It wasn't...but should have been. In fact it never should have been done if speed indeed were the primary motivation.Babe Ruth was the greatest American sports hero ever...including those who followed him during the second half of the twentieth century. Babe deserved a much granderand accurateportrayal than this '48 laugher.There were only two positive elements to the story..and both involved casting. Claire Trevor as the Babe's second wife Claire and Charles Bickford as Brother Matthias were excellent choices. But selecting comic William Bendix for the title role was more than a case of poor casting it was one that completely undermined both the film and its title character.Through Bendix's portrayal audiences see the Sultan of Swat as a buffoonish character. Someone who belongs in a cartoon. Not that Bendix didn't try his best. But he was miserably miscast. Mrs. Ruth in her book stated that she would like to have seen Paul Douglas portray her husband. Not only was Douglas an excellent actor she said but he had been an athlete in his youth. He easily could have handled the baseball scenes.The whole tone of The Babe Ruth Ruth story was embarrassingly melodramatic. Again The Babe deserved much better.Haste makes waste the saying goes. It certainly is true here.".

Someone who belongs in a cartoon. Not that Bendix didn't try his best. But he was miserably miscast. Mrs. Ruth in her book stated that she would like to have seen Paul Douglas portray her husband. Not only was Douglas an excellent actor she said but he had been an athlete in his youth. He easily could have handled the baseball scenes.The whole tone of The Babe Ruth Ruth story was embarrassingly melodramatic. Again The Babe deserved much better.Haste makes waste the saying goes. It certainly is true here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Made by Allied Artists so they can capitalize on the success of MGM Lou Gehrig biopic 1942's Pride of the Yankees and the recent news of Babe Ruth's failing health in 1947 The Babe Ruth Story was quickly made in 1948 in hopes of a big return. Sadly it didn't get that as the movie bomb in the box office. For a movie call for its inaccuracy it did get some accurate things right. Indeed he grew up in an orphanage started as a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles in 1913 traded to Boston Red Sox in 1914 where he transitioned to the outfield traded to the Yankees in 1920 where he emerged as a legend then once accidentally hit a dog during practice and then finally the Yankees traded him to the Boston Braves in 1935 that cause him to retired at the end of the season where he indeed ref a prowrestling match once. Still this movie is often pointed out as too heavyhanded and too squeaky clean to be taken serious. I have to agree with that but it's doesn't make it a really bad movie. It's just makes it a misguide film. Directed by Roy Del Ruth with the screenplay written by George Callahan  Bob Considine the movie serves as the ultimate ridiculously sugarcoated sports bio pic of film of all time. It tells the story of baseball legend George Herman 'Babe' Ruth William Bendix on his rise to baseball until his fall. When he isn't busy being a baseball legend Babe Ruth found the time to save a sick boy's life save animals and cause another crippled boy to walk! You almost have to laugh at some of these cheesy moments that I mention. It's incredibly corny but at least that part of the stories are surprising true. Indeed there was a 'dying' boy that he promise to make a home run for him in the next game. He made good on that pledge. Still the film took liberties with important facts of what really happen. First the film portrayed Ruth visiting the dying boy during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs rather than the factual 1926 World Series vs the Cardinals. Second the film has Ruth visiting the boy home in Gary Indiana in person and shows Ruth in the boy's bedroom telling Johnny that he will hit a home run if Johnny hangs in there rather than the factual account of sending autographed baseballs and a note to Johnny in New Jersey. Third is that the boy in the film had cancer. While in real life he was supposedly kick in the head by a horse but the confusion as what was the condition affecting the boy has led to claims that the entire incident was a hoax. Who knows if the boy was really sick or not. Babe Ruth's called shot was also kinda true although neither fully confirmed nor refuted. Still he never cured a sick child just by saying hello but he did brighten the lives of thousands of children sick and healthy with his tireless devotion to them. It is conceivable that his support helped a few sick ones stay positive enough to recover. The movie portray Babe Ruth so Godlike it felt like a weird cult religion was brewing. One of the funniest line in the film had to be 'Sue Baseball? That's like suing the church. Indeed some people honestly believe everything that this film is spilling out about Babe Ruth. The real Babe Ruth had a lot of bad qualities the movie doesn't show. Yes many of them could be madeup by Ruth haters but I wish the movie kinda dig deep into finding out if some of them were true like his wild partying ways. The movie even skip his love affair with his first Helen Woodford and went straight to his love story with his secondwife Claire Hodgson Claire Trevors. I guess they didn't want to show that Babe Ruth was divorced and did adultery in UberConservative America. They were perfectly capable of being realistic when they wanted to be. It's just that when they wanted to be lighthearted and whimsical for the sakes of the fans. For a movie that about baseball it shows very little of the sport. When you do see him in small bits of action William Bendix's babe looks out of shape. First off he's a righthanded actor when clearly the real Babe Ruth pitch left hand. This made for awful tossing sequences. Bendix in uniform looks Yogi Berra than Babe Ruth. In the early going Orson Welles was one of the names supposedly in the running to play the Babe. Too bad nothing came of that because William Bendix's performance is very questionable. While Orson Welles isn't the best athlete at the time he would make Babe Ruth a real character. Bendix makes Babe Ruth look a stupid likable moron like Forrest Gump in the film. At less they didn't show Babe as an unlikeable pig like certain other biopic films do like 1992's Babe. One thing that bug me about this film is that Babe Ruth doesn't aged in the film. He looks 40 when he supposed to 20 and when he's dying he looks pretty damn healthy for lung cancer victim. Since the movie was made when the real Babe Ruth was still alive. The movie has this odd eerily ending that can go both ways as if Babe Ruth might live. The film premiered on July 26 1948 to negative reviews and Ruth died 3 weeks later on August 16 but still overall It's not unwatchable. It has a lot of oldfashion charm to it. It wasn't hurting anybody when it was made and still after all these years. It was pretty much an easy watch. Despite all the negatives about it I enjoy watching it. It's so bad it's good.".

One of my favorite parts is when Claire yells at Babe to remember about Johnny lying sick in the hospital who will obviously die if Babe doesn't smash a homer. Amazingly Babe hears Claire above 50000 other screaming fans makes incredibly outrageous gestures pointing to the centerfield bleachers and socks the homer with a dreadful swing that would make a 6 year old girl embarrassed. How can you not love it? When the group of kids sing 'hymns' ie take me out to the ballgame outside his hospital window?

	schema:reviewBody "Okay for one minute let us forget our sentimentality over the many contributions to the National Pastime made by the real Babe Ruth and look at this minor league effort of a movie. William Bendix a journeyman character actor was unable to inject any life into the role thanks to a terrible script devoid of accuracy pure corn paying no attention to the facts. So Bendix gives us a cardboard performance standing in front of cardboard sets. He failed miserably in trying to emulate The Babe who is arguably the most visible if not recognizable ballplayer in history. It was virtually impossible to convince the audience that Bendix is The Babe especially in the year of Ruth's death. Strike one! Like Gary Cooper in The Pride of the Yankees Bendix was a natural righthander trying to swing lefty. In Pride Cooper swung from the right side while wearing a cap and shirt with reversed Yankee logos  and the film was flipped to turn him around to appear lefty on the screen. With no such specialeffects aid Bendix looks embarrassingly awkward klutzy trying to sell the audience he's the great lefthanded Bambino. He looks like anything but a major league baseball player let alone The Babe  and it is hard for the audience to suspend its belief enought to accept Bendix as a star athlete like Ruth. Strike two! The clicheriddled script is so bad it's hard to take seriously. Sure the Babe ordered hisself a milk in a tavern. Pure drivel. Sure the real Babe died testing a miracle drug. Writer's embellishment. Yer out! Maybe this movie was intended to inspire 12yearolds. But I'm not 12 and The Babe Ruth Story is the sports movie equivalent of Plan 9  another movie intending to be serious but turning out to be unintentionally funny  but The Babe Ruth Story never developed Plan 9's cult following. Plan 9 is so bad it's entertaining. The Babe Ruth Story is plain bad and tough to watch. Babe Ruth has been portrayed numerous times on the Big Screen and for someone so recognizable it is hard for us to accept most actors attempting the part. Bendix isn't believable at all and neither was John Goodman although he came closer. Perhaps the best reincarnation of Ruth was by Joe Don Baker as The Whammer in The Natural. When Baker's character is introduced on the train he looks so much like the real Ruth it's scary. Someday someone will make a great movie about Babe Ruth. We're all waiting.".

With no such specialeffects aid Bendix looks embarrassingly awkward klutzy trying to sell the audience he's the great lefthanded Bambino. He looks like anything but a major league baseball player let alone The Babe  and it is hard for the audience to suspend its belief enought to accept Bendix as a star athlete like Ruth. Strike two! The clicheriddled script is so bad it's hard to take seriously. Sure the Babe ordered hisself a milk in a tavern. Pure drivel. Sure the real Babe died testing a miracle drug. Writer's embellishment. Yer out! Maybe this movie was intended to inspire 12yearolds. But I'm not 12 and The Babe Ruth Story is the sports movie equivalent of Plan 9  another movie intending to be serious but turning out to be unintentionally funny  but The Babe Ruth Story never developed Plan 9's cult following. Plan 9 is so bad it's entertaining. The Babe Ruth Story is plain bad and tough to watch. Babe Ruth has been portrayed numerous times on the Big Screen and for someone so recognizable it is hard for us to accept most actors attempting the part. Bendix isn't believable at all and neither was John Goodman although he came closer. Perhaps the best reincarnation of Ruth was by Joe Don Baker as The Whammer in The Natural. When Baker's character is introduced on the train he looks so much like the real Ruth it's scary. Someday someone will make a great movie about Babe Ruth. We're all waiting.";

I've reviewed a lot of biographical pictures from Hollywood's Golden Age and I tend to be very forgiving of the liberties taken with the facts to tell a compelling story in a limited amount of time. But brother this one really pushes it. This is so cheesy and overthetop with its attempts at sanctifying Babe Ruth. He cures two sick kids in this thing for crying out loud. One of them was paralyzed! William Bendix was probably as close to ideal casting for Ruth as you were going to get but the script really just plays him up as a big saintly teddy bear instead of treating him like a real person. There are also a number of clichd characters hanging around like the fatherly priest the chorus girl with a heart of gold and the unflaggingly loyal friend. I should also point out that very little of the movie actually deals with the game of baseball. There's only a handful of scenes that show the game being played and most of them are just Bendix poorly imitating Ruth's pitching and hitting. It's really a pretty lazy part of the film. I won't rate it as low as many others are and I certainly wouldn't include it on my worst ever list unless we're being super narrow on what that includes. It's perfectly watchable and even enjoyable at times. But it's so unbelievably corny and tired I doubt even the biggest fan of classic Hollywood or baseball will walk away loving it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think anyone could claim this is a great movie. But it gets more criticism than it deserves in my opinion.Facts are Ruth was idolized by kids partly because he loved to spend hours signing autographs for them and spent hundreds of hours trying to cheer them up in hospitals and elsewhere. He was known for giving outrageously big tips to waiters etc. He did violate lots of club rules before the Yankees suspended him. And as a youth he did go into and out of St. Mary's because his father didn't really know how to handle him. Babe and his wife Claire were truly in love.In other words much of his life and personality are portrayed correctly by this movie. They got some of the basic facts of his playing career correct including the three home runs in Pittsburgh right before he quit as a player.But there are lots of problems with other elements of this picture that do not make it better. First of all like all the baseball movies of the era they gloss over most of the facts about the player's career. They blend so many things together that you get a distorted view of when things happen. And they certainly try to make the star appear to be a better person than he was omitting most of his flaws.Another problem is they need more than about 90 minutes to give a good story of someone's life but didn't get enough time. They wanted to appeal to nonbaseball fans by focusing largely on each of the players' love lives and only marginally show details of him as a ballplayer.So if you watch this film you can take away some basic knowledge about what sort of person Ruth was and his personality. Where the film falls apart is the distorted image of Ruth almost totally ignoring his faults totally ignoring his first wife and misleading you on the timing of some of the events in his life.I much prefer this film to that awful TV movie or the Goodman film that came out about 20 years ago. They presented a man who seemed to have no likable characteristics at all. As I recall there were almost no scenes of Ruth interacting with childrensomething he did often. He came across as a total jerk who would not have been liked by anyonewhich is far from the truth.If you want to really learn about Ruth read Robert Creamer's book on his life. None of the movies do him justice except in small ways.".

Riley than the hero to thousands. His attempt to recreate a pitcher's windup and throw is absolutely pathetic. And while you can make a younger actor look older trying to pass Bendix off as a kid coming out of school is quite the stretch. Why Mark Koenig or Mel Allen let themselves be a part of this film is beyond me.The movie did have some respect for statistical facts but as for the other events of Babe's life it took quite the poetic license. In this movie Babe isn't the womanizer and drinker he was in real life. No he's some sort of healer bringing back kids and dogs from the dead and making crippled boys walk just by his presence.Babe Ruth himself attended the premiere of this film and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't hasten his demise.With the tripe Hollywood is putting out of late I'd be hard pressed to call this one of the worst movies of all time.

They are much more true to the real Ruth but because of this they are also rather unpleasant films! As for me both the unpleasant and saccharine portrayals are something I'd just as soon avoid.The verdict100 phony from start to finish and not worth your time unless you LIKE bad movies.";

He could sing anything and did with complete conviction. His operatic arias in this film are superb and those of us who are lucky enough to have heard the outtakes from the soundtrack will agree that he was coming to terms with the fact that he had to adjust to his voice getting bigger. It was a really awesome instrument. The power was immense but he could also sing falsetto when required. His Ave Maria in this film is one of the most moving I have ever heard.

Serenade is a very dramatic Movie with great performances from the likes of Joan Fontaine and in particular Sarita Montiel who really makes this Picture. Add this to the beautiful colourful backdrops and a haunting and dramatic score in the use of 'Serenade' and what you have is a cocktail for a fabulous Movie! For a two hour Film this could have been 'overlong' but in fact the two hours fly by as the whole is so absorbing.This lush Masterpiece from 1956 is so underrated as to never have been released on either Video or DVD in the United Kingdom  and only on Video for a limited period in the USA. If you want to own this Movie you're going to have to be patient and hunt madly but it will be well worth the time spent! And for those who've already seen it they will want to own it also and so you'll have some pretty stiff competition in obtaining one of those scarce copies! If you haven't seen it then book yourself a night in when it is next shown on TV for a great piece of entertainment and have the chocolates and wine at the ready for a good quality night's viewing! This is a superb production  oh and don't forget the tissues!Simply magic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Serenade is far and away Lanza's most interesting movie. True The Great Caruso is a more accessible film and the best introduction to Lanza but Serenade packs a far greater punch. This is melodrama to the nth degree and fittingly it contains some of the finest dramatic singing ever recorded.Let's get the quibbles out of the way first. Injudicious editing has made some of the scenes appear silly and illogical. The speed with which Lanza becomes obsessed with Joan Fontaine seems absurd and the ending could have been so much better. Would that the scenarists had had the courage to follow more closely the James Cain novel on which this movie is based but then again this was Hollywood 1955. Had the movie been made without the censorship constraints of say a mere ten years later it could have been a masterpiece. All I can say is read the novel and you'll see what I mean!I would also criticize Anthony Mann's direction at times. Retakes of some of Lanza's hammier moments should definitely have been made and the film lacks at times the full dramatic treatment that its subject deserves. Retakes of Lanza's Nessun Dorma and Di Quella Pira should also have been made. In both arias he sounds uncharacteristically strained and in each case a second take would have sorted out the problem.Quibbles aside Lanza's acting is often outstanding the Ave Maria scene for instance is a revelation. Vincent Price Lanza's acidtongued and hilarious manager in the movie later remarked offscreen how impressed he was with the tenor's dedicated approach to his acting. Sarita Montiel is also outstanding in her role as a fiery Mexican bullfighter's daughter providing Lanza with his bestever leading lady.But what makes this film a vocal masterpiece is Lanza's singing. La Danza Torna a Surriento Amor Ti Vieta O Paradiso the Otello Monologue Dio! Mi potevi scagliar... and the heartrending Lamento Di Federico are all astonishing feats of singing. By 1955 Lanza's voice had darkened into a lirico spinto tenor that often borders on the dramatic. It is rare indeed to hear a tenor with such baritonal fullness AND a ringing tenorial top. Eat your heart out Placido Domingo! Lanza  For my money the Otello Monologue is the pinnacle of Lanza's operatic legacy and the finest recording of this aria. The scene in which it appears is also brilliantly acted by Lanza. As the critic John Cargher would later remark Lanza's rendition of the Otello Monologue alone would assure him of immortality.All criticism aside Serenade remains a source of immense pleasure to me and it is richly deserving of far wider appreciation.".

Juana helped Mario convince us that he was a man who could be snatched from the diabolical and devastating ensnarements of Joan Fontaine's spoiled heiress Kendall Hale.  The introduction of her character when Mario flees in disgrace to Mexico permits a scenic and worththepriceofadmission tour of Mexican locales.The music is fairly well presented in this one.  Not being an opera connoisseur I am not qualified to comment knowledgeably on Mr. Lanza's renditions of operatic excerpts but I have always found his tenor voice to be among the most listenable So many of them just bleat! and his constant reprising of the title song throughout this movie did not grow tiresome at least to these ears.A side note  Mario's father quite a dear old gentleman who had remarried lived down the street in the Huntington Palisades section of Pacific Palisades in southern California where my family owned a home.  I frequently saw Mario's Cadillac parked in his father's driveway but alas! never caught a glimpse of the goldenvoiced Mario himself who was you may be sure his father's pride and joy.".

Too bad she sings no songs in this movie although the Mexico scenes are colorful and welldone.But as usual it is Mario's great voice which truly shines here. He sings more opera arias in this film than in any other movie of his except possibly The Great Caruso.  His combination of lyric sweetness magnificent dramatic sound and ringing top notes plus sheer versatility is unmatched even by some of the greatest classicallytrained singers including Pavarotti and Domingo.  And he is certainly better than today's pop opera darling Andrea Bocelli. Vincent Prince and Joan Fontaine still gorgeous here bring their usual great support.  The final scene at Joan Fontaine's party actually has great dramatic tension although somewhat marred by a less than satisfying ending to the movie.   Still very watchable.".

Jack Warner who'd been trying to snag Lanza for years readily agreed.The script by the otherwise excellent Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts is a highly bowdlerized version of the book retaining not much more than the title and character names. The film almost relentlessly exposes Lanza's considerable weaknesses as an actor in a way MGM never did. His singing by contrast is some of his best especially in the scenes from Verdi's Otello with Metropolitan Opera great Licia Albanese as his Desdemona a role she sang often at the Met.As was his wont Lanza's increasingly irresponsible unpredictable behavior cost him the other two pictures in his Warners contract even though Serenade was a boxoffice success.

There's a TV channel in Russia called Culture and TV programs and films goes there WITHOUT ANY ADDS! Can you imagine it? I can! So yesterday I've made a very good tape record of Serenade on VHS NOT SVHS tape recorder and I'd like to say a few words on this film. When I watched it for the first time now it was for the third time it hasn't made anything to me that is I thought the film is good and that's all. But now I think that it is not all. I can tell you that yesterday I hardly could help... crying! Yes that's it! Because there was Mario Lanza and there certainly was Sara Montiel the most beautiful woman in the world. If it happened that you haven't seen this film yet please watch it! What for? I beg you pardon if you don't like Mario's singing! just watch it to enjoy Sara her voice and her eyes. Remember NOT TO MISS the scene in the final in which Sara plays just... so fine that you cannot believe your eyes and your ears. But don't worry about her  she would be all right! There is also a lot of highclass music not only fascinating Othello's aria from Verdi's opera worths mentioning!. In all aspects this is indeed one of the best film of all movies of all times and peoples. If I could give it 1000  I would but I can give 10 maximum... Just so fine that you cannot believe yourself! I'm deeply sorry for my bad English.".

	schema:reviewBody "For his one and only film away from an MGM release Mario Lanza went to Warner Brothers in 1956 to star in a film adaption of James M. Cain's novel Serenade. It's the story of an opera singer discovered and then abandoned by society girl Joan Fontaine and then redeemed by the love of a good woman played by Mexican film star Sarita Montiel.James M. Cain was an author who had given the screen a few classic films from his work like Double Indemnity Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. But Cain was unable to give the screen anything more than a turgid melodrama with Serenade. It was not in the class as a novel or a film as those other three works.However one watches a Mario Lanza film to hear him sing and he's in good voice with the usual mixture of classical opera Italian folk songs and a pair of new songs by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn who had already given him Be My Love and Because You're Mine. Mario sings the title song and My Destiny from Brodzsky and Cahn and they're good but not in the league with those two other classics identified with him. My favorite out of the score is La Danza which is sung toward the beginning of the film. Lanza did an outstanding record of this as did his idol Enrico Caruso in the early days of commercial recording.The Code was still firmly in place or Vincent Price's character as the opera impresario would be more obviously gay. As it is Price gets the best lines in the film and makes the most of them.If watching Serenade I'd fast forward to Mario's songs and listen to them. They're what gives Serenade any lasting popularity.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the fourth of just 7 starring vehicles for turbulent Italian tenor Mario Lanza although not his best or most popular that remains 1951's THE GREAT CARUSO Anthony Mann was easily the best director he ever had. It was actually Lanza's first film in 4 years a period marked by the debacle of THE STUDENT PRINCE 1954 where director Curtis Bernhardt decided he had had enough of the star's tantrums had him summarily fired and replaced by Edmund Purdom who mimed to Lanza's own singing! Anyway the screenplay here is so predictable that it seems written on autopilot and one is hardpressed to believe that it was based on a novel penned by hardboiled noir writer James M. Cain it comes as no surprise then to learn that the film version was heavily bowdlerized! Incidentally Cain was also behind similar musical soap opera stuff like WHEN TOMORROW COMES 1939 and its remake INTERLUDE 1957 that had equally boasted the services of notable directors John M. Stahl and Douglas Sirk respectively for their transition to the screen! On a personal note it is unfortunate that while respected Maltese character actor Joseph Calleia got to work with two of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers of that time within the same year it was only on their least interesting movies this and Nicholas Ray's HOT BLOOD! what is even worse is that another Maltese who goes by the name of Joseph Calleia is currently enjoying worldwide fame as a tenor himself  thus endangering his earlier namesake who died back in 1975's own fledgling reputation on his home ground! The supporting cast of SERENADE is quite good actually Joan Fontaine she has the right looks for the role of the bitchy society dame who entraps Lanza in her tangled web but there is next to no chemistry between them! Sarita Montiel Mann's wife at the time she has the role of Lanza's beautiful Mexican redeemer Vincent Price a breath of fresh air as the witty artless impresario Silvio Minciotti as Lanza's first restaurateur employer Vince Edwards as Fontaine's temperamental prizefighting pet and Edward Platt as the director of Lanza's illfated stage debut performance of Othello  which he hysterically abandons in midaria simply because Fontaine has not turned up to see him!. Similarly histrionic moments occur during a thunderstorm in the Mexican plains almost evoking John Ford's THE QUIET MAN 1952! and when a jealous Montiel incidentally she has her own jilted lover to contend with! loses it by bullfighting a mocking Fontaine at a society party that precipitates an unbelievably contrived climactic traffic accident with an inevitable happy outcome just as Lanza is about to go live on the airwaves! To counter such melodramatic if appropriately operatic outbursts perhaps the film's best sequence is the simple and moving one in which Lanza and Montiel enter a Mexican church to pray and it is here that he regains his selfconfidence having spent some time on the skids and then returned to his roots as a fieldworker! by singing Schubert's Ave Maria.Apart from the aforementioned Othello the film also shows Lanza performing a famous aria from Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore incidentally I have just acquired Renato Castellani's 10hour biopic of the famed Italian composer shot in 1982 for Italian TV with Ronald Pickup in the lead! as well as 2 new songs in English one of them 'composed' and played on the piano by Vincent Price and the title tune which is reprised for the finale. Having mentioned the English numbers just now it is odd given his proud heritage that when Lanza is about to leave home early on in search of success managed by his cousin Harry Bellaver he treats his paisani to a pop tune  and in a foreign tongue to boot! By the way this viewing came via a TCM U.K. broadcast of the Warner Bros. production albeit screened fullframe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mario Lanza at the age of 34 was a complete mess  bloated from drinking overweight and making a film comeback of sorts. Though his voice had been heard in The Student Prince he hadn't appeared in a film in four years. Serenade based on the novel by James Cain minus the gay love affair was the vehicle to return him to the screen. Cain was a great lover of opera and incorporated it into this novel and also into the novel Mildred Pierce.Lanza plays Damon a vineyard worker with a golden voice who is discovered by a socialite Kendall Hale Joan Fontaine who sets him up with a major voice teacher. With the help of Kendall and those around her Damon is given a star buildup. The only problem is Kendall is someone who encourages artists and then dumps them. Damon is in love with her and on the night of his debut we assume at the Met singing Otello a good choice for the story but he never would have sung it until he was in his fifties at a minimum if at all she doesn't show up. He is so obsessed with her that right before he strangles Desdemona he walks off stage removes his costume and makeup and goes to Kendall's place. What an idiot. His career in tatters he goes to Mexico City and gets a job as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. But he's having a nervous breakdown. No wonder  the role is completely wrong for him. Damon winds up ill and is brought back to health by a family which includes Juana Sarita Monteil. With her help Damon gradually feels strong enough to try singing again. But can he? Lanza had a beautiful natural voice. Technique wasn't his strong suit he scooped a lot and tended to oversing  but he brought opera to the common man. Before him opera singers in films had been divas and divos  Jeanette MacDonald Grace Moore et al.  but Lanza always played the truck driver with the beautiful voice. There were comments here on this site that his voice had darkened  frankly at 34 that shouldn't have happened yet. As a person ages we're talking 40s and 50s here the vocal cords thicken and often the middle voice warms up and becomes stronger and some of the top goes. Joan Fontaine at nearly 40 was a stunning woman with a beautiful slim figure. At this point in her career she was playing the society woman often in roles too young for her as in Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. But the sweet naive girl of Rebecca had turned into the rich woman with an educated speaking voice and cool looks. Unlike other actresses of her age Fontaine managed to eek out more years in good films than some of her counterparts because of this change in image. She does a great job as the cold Kendall. As Juana Sarita Monteil is beautiful and her passion and intensity are a great contrast to Fontaine. The gowns in the film were gorgeous for both women.Mario Lanza was a tragic figure possessed of a beautiful voice and a natural tendency toward stockiness. Due to the pressure on him to lose weight his crash dieting and drinking eventually affected his heart. In fact there was nothing wrong with his appearance or his very likable relaxed screen presence. But as with Judy Garland Louis B couldn't leave it alone. Lanza was a problematic individual difficult to work with and someone who sexually harassed his female costars. He was his own worst enemy but what a legacy.".

People forget that back in 1955 it would have been impossible to film Serenade as written by the author. You can also say that Anthony Mann was not the ideal director for this kind of musical melodrama since he was more at home in the film noir and western genres. In spite of all that Serenade is not a bad movie and can be enjoyed by all but most specially by opera lovers. Mario Lanza is mesmerizing singing some of the world's most beloved music. In my opinion he was never more effective as a singer than on this Warner Bros Technicolor production. As an actor Mr. Lanza has some good and bad moments playing Damon the humble California vineyard worker who achieves fame and fortune only to be destroyed by his obsessive passion for beautiful socialite Kendall Hale Joan Fontaine who enjoys making stars out of her lovers and then dropping them for the next hopeful in line. When he hits rock bottom in Mexico he is rescued and rehabilitated by a wealthy bullfighter's daughter the earthy and also beautiful Juana Montes Sarita Montiel. When Damon goes back to the U.S. with Juana to relaunch his career Miss Hale shows up again with every intention to manipulate the singer once more. Will she succeed? All that mayhem is worthy just to listen to Lanza's glorious voice sing with outstanding gusto Torna a Sorrento a most moving Ave Maria Schubert or Puccini's Nessum Dorma from Turandot. As both a singer and an actor Lanza is particularly effective in his rendition of Verdi's Dio Ti Giocondi from Othello doubtless one of the artist's best moments in film. I find the supporting cast brilliant with special mentions going to Vincent Price as the sarcastic witty opera manager and the gorgeous Sarita as the temperamental Juana.".

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing with corrections admonishments on spurious opinions etc. peters1591  ....he had only 18 minutes of voice. He could not sustain it in a full scale opera is absolute nonsense. He had already sung in complete opera performances THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR and MADAMA BUTTERFLY done some 80 crosscountry concerts with the Bel Canto Trio with George London and Frances Yeend and for the last several years of his life gave concerts that would have included a minimum of about 60 minutes of singing more than in most tenor roles in the standard opera repertory one of them the Royal Albert Hall concert that was issued by RCA Victor while he was still alive. Even worse is this reviewer's allegation that Lanza was killed by Mafia types. This has long been discredited and had no basis in even suspicion to begin with just someone making up a new 'hook' with which to sell a book. Lanza was extremely sick with half a dozen ailment the worst of which was a bad heart. Given the way he lived you could almost justify a claim that he unknowingly committed suicide. But he was NOT murdered by the Mafia or anyone else!Neil Doyle  Schubert's Ave Maria is hardly rendered in ringing tones. In fact just the opposite.TheLittleSongbird  Actually the OTELLO Monologue is not at all very heavy stuff for Lanza to take on. The first half is mostly done in halfvoice on the same note the aria never rises beyond Bflat and it is actually quite easy to sing except for the very end. The whole role lies low which is why so many famous Otellos  Zenatello Zanelli Melchior Schmedes Guichandut Vinay to name a few  had successful professional careers as baritones before switching up to tenor to be able to sing the relatively lowlying Otello andor the Wagner tenor repertoire most of which lies similarly low indeed every second Wagnerian tenor in history seems to have had a second career in OTELLO. The hard part of it is getting the proper emotion into those semiparlando passages and Lanza manages to do this pretty well without being in any way outstanding when compared to the great Otellos. It is not to denigrate him when I say I could easily name 30 or 40 equal or superior versions while still liking his. But to hear a Martinelli Met broadcast of this piece or Melchior's Germanlanguage performance or Zenatello's Fonotipia recording and comparing any one of them to Lanza's would be as unfair as would be comparing Olivier's King Lear to one by John Wayne.artzau  His music was marginal his phrasing and articulation shoddy is pure nonsense  possibly received opinion from snobs. There was nothing marginal about his musicality which is I assume what was meant and his phrasing and articulation were excellent in Italian French and Spanish and damned near miraculous in English. Indeed his clarity of diction in the English language far surpasses that of any other classicaltrained singer I know of even John McCormack's who was a paragon of virtue in this respect but managed to sing all languages with a brogue!. His only equal in this respect is Eileen Farrell but she had to dispense with her legitimate soprano voice and assume a completely chestbased popular singing style that seems as much modeled on Judy Garland's as on any other pop singer who comes to mind. But when Farrell sings English in classical song or in the few opera excerpts she ever did in English she is not at all clear in her enunciation. Some other classically trained singers come close  like Robert Merrill  but there is always something about their sound even in popular music that sounds 'classical'. When Lanza sings Kern or Rodgers or Berlin or Herbert we hear a full operatic tenor voice that makes the lyrics totally clear in plain oldfashioned nonrolled 'r' and broad 'a' pronunciation so that it still sounds like a popular or Broadway song and not a piece being done by some opera singer who is slumming think Richard Crooks. Kathy Jurado never existed. If you mean Katy Jurado she did exist but was not in this film. I won't argue opinions except to say that your comment about how bad he was as an opera singer was not and is not shared by the many opera singers he sang with  George London Frances Yeend Lucine Amara Dorothy Kirsten and especially Licia Albanese and Elaine Malbin. I see Ms. Malbin every three months at the quarterly Mario Lanza Luncheon held at Patsy's Italian Restaurant Sinatra's favorite goto place in New York City she still raves about him as did both Lucine Amara and Licia Albanese when they used to attend the luncheons.Well that's it and I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings in expressing my own. But the subject of Opera is a vast one and often you really do have to submerge your life into it to really understand that vastness. One can call Lanza this that and the next thing but what does it matter if one's standards of comparison are incomplete? Leo Slezak father of Walter was the greatest MiddleEuropean tenor of the first 30 years of the last century holding a place there fully equal to that held by Caruso in this country. Caruso was not all that popular in Italy and rarely sang there after coming to the Met. Melchior is universally regarded as the greatest Wagnerian tenor of all time but if your exposure to him is only through MGM films you haven't even started to understand his greatness. You may have heard Caruso and Melchior but probably not Slezak so what's the point of pontificating on who was the greatest tenor of the century until you have. And then there are about two or three hundred other tenors I might mention. The point is don't worry about it and just go about enjoying Lanza for what he was  to my mind possessor of the most beautiful lyric tenor voice America has ever produced.As for the film well if you seen the dozen or more films made by both Beniamino Gigli and Richard Tauber and the halfdozen or so made by Jan Kiepura and Joseph Schmidt it will enable you to more easily appreciate what MGM gave us from the EddyMacDonald era through Grayson to Lanza and ending with INTERRUPTED MELODY and what Warners at least tried to give us in their Grace Moore biopic SO THIS IS LOVE and with SERENADE maybe America's last gasp at including Opera in America's standard screen culture.".

	onyx:emotionText "Continuing with corrections admonishments on spurious opinions etc. peters1591  ....he had only 18 minutes of voice. He could not sustain it in a full scale opera is absolute nonsense. He had already sung in complete opera performances THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR and MADAMA BUTTERFLY done some 80 crosscountry concerts with the Bel Canto Trio with George London and Frances Yeend and for the last several years of his life gave concerts that would have included a minimum of about 60 minutes of singing more than in most tenor roles in the standard opera repertory one of them the Royal Albert Hall concert that was issued by RCA Victor while he was still alive. Even worse is this reviewer's allegation that Lanza was killed by Mafia types. This has long been discredited and had no basis in even suspicion to begin with just someone making up a new 'hook' with which to sell a book. Lanza was extremely sick with half a dozen ailment the worst of which was a bad heart. Given the way he lived you could almost justify a claim that he unknowingly committed suicide. But he was NOT murdered by the Mafia or anyone else!Neil Doyle  Schubert's Ave Maria is hardly rendered in ringing tones. In fact just the opposite.TheLittleSongbird  Actually the OTELLO Monologue is not at all very heavy stuff for Lanza to take on. The first half is mostly done in halfvoice on the same note the aria never rises beyond Bflat and it is actually quite easy to sing except for the very end. The whole role lies low which is why so many famous Otellos  Zenatello Zanelli Melchior Schmedes Guichandut Vinay to name a few  had successful professional careers as baritones before switching up to tenor to be able to sing the relatively lowlying Otello andor the Wagner tenor repertoire most of which lies similarly low indeed every second Wagnerian tenor in history seems to have had a second career in OTELLO. The hard part of it is getting the proper emotion into those semiparlando passages and Lanza manages to do this pretty well without being in any way outstanding when compared to the great Otellos. It is not to denigrate him when I say I could easily name 30 or 40 equal or superior versions while still liking his. But to hear a Martinelli Met broadcast of this piece or Melchior's Germanlanguage performance or Zenatello's Fonotipia recording and comparing any one of them to Lanza's would be as unfair as would be comparing Olivier's King Lear to one by John Wayne.artzau  His music was marginal his phrasing and articulation shoddy is pure nonsense  possibly received opinion from snobs.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this with an operaloving friend when it came out in early 1956 and even then our 17yearold selves thought it was pretty hokey. Which did not stop us for one minute from each going out and purchasing the LP soundtrack to which I still listen to this day. The problem with operabased films and especially with operabased films starring Mario Lanza is that there are usually two factions at work  1 those who can't stand the fact that arguably the greatest lyric tenor voice of its time was 'misused' and hardly entered the legitimate realms of classical singing and 2 those who love this singer so much that they simply cannot countenance any even minor denigration of their hero. I hope I'm one of the rare people who can legitimately inhabit both factions meaning that while I can rue the loss of his voice to the world's opera and concert stages I can be legitimately grateful for all he meant to my generation as it was Lanza who brought a then12 year old moviegoer to Opera with THE GREAT CARUSO in 1951 and I still wallow in the sound of his voice some 67 years later. All that said I am writing this because there is an absolute plethora of misinformation contained in many of the two dozen or so reviews under this title and while we are usually admonished not to use our reviews as a battering ram against those of others sometimes it is really necessary. I speak not of opinion. Everybody deserves to have his or her own. I speak of factual errors and assumptions although one or two opinions may be so extreme that they deserve at least a bit of admonishment so here goes. And if this goes on past my allotted number of words please look for a Part Two which I will surely do since that which is important enough to do at all is important enough to do completely.lanzafan  Lanza does not sing falsetto but mezza voce which is not at all the same thing. I cannot recall Lanza ever singing falsetto. His may have been ONE of the voices of the century but not THE voice of the century. Even if you really think he was better than say Caruso and Pavarotti how does one compare his voice with those of Kirsten Flagstad or Rosa Ponselle Ezio Pinza or Nazzareno de Angelis Mattia Battistini or Titta Ruffo? You see the problem! You must have legitimate standards for comparison and listening to all the available evidence before making such a statement is mandatory.Derek McGovern  Nessun dorma is not I think so much strained as simply bland an unusual criticism for any Lanza performance but the aria was not nearly as well known during the 1955 recording sessions as it would become over the next 60 years so he may not have heard many other versions when he did this one. You can think his Dio! mi potevi scagliar! is the best one ever done but how many others have you heard? I have heard hundreds and I could easily name 30 or 40 equal or better ones most especially from Martinelli Melchior and Del Monaco among the better known names close to Lanza's own time.Greg Coutoure  We weren't nearly as accepting of nonAnglo leading ladies back then. That may depend on your definition of Anglo but I would posit that we very much accepted Lupe Velez Rita Hayworth Leslie Caron. Gina Lollogbrigida Ingrid Bergman and Sophie Loren back then to name only the first halfdozen that come to mind. Mario Lanza's father did not remarry but stayed married to Mario's mother until the day she died in 1970. If you saw ML's Cadillac parked in or in front of his father's driveway it was actually parked in or in front of his parents' driveway.BobLib  Vincent Price does not play a music critic in the film. And I've never heard that Lanza was a fan of James Cain's SERENADE and tried to get MGM to make it years earlier. Given its homosexuality theme the thought is totally ridiculous. In addition to which I can't imagine Lanza wanting to play a lead of dubious sexuality at any time in his short life!RBHB  The voice of Mario Lanza is the greatest in history... see lanzafan abovebkoganbing  Lanza never made a commercial recording of La danza the three available versions consist of two from the soundtracks of THE GREAT CARUSO and SERENADE and the third is from his radio show and in all three he sang only the first half of the song only God knows why unless he was just too lazy to learn the second half.MARIO GAUCI  Lanza was not an Italian tenor he was an American tenor. Curtis Bernhardt had no power to have anyone fired at MGM let alone its biggest male star. He and Lanza had major differences over the tenor's prerecorded singing of Beloved and Lanza walked off the production which was the last straw for Schary and MGM. At that point Bernhardt certainly had a legitimate grievance but he did not have Lanza fired Schary did. Current Maltese tenor Joseph Calleia does not go by that name. It IS his name. Monteil was not Anthony Mann's wife at the time the film was made. They married in 1957.jjaxn  Joan Fontaine had played hardedged villainesses before LETTER TO AN UNKNOWN WOMAN for example as the murderess in IVY and would continue to play softedged types for years after LETTER for example Rowena in IVANHOE the concert pianist in SEPTEMBER AFFAIR etc.. The actress who really had a quick makeover from mostly sweet blonde andor brunette nearingenues to black haired femme fatales in Noirs was Joan Bennett.blanche2  Lanza does not walk off the stage right before he strangles Desdemona this is their Act 3 confrontation. He doesn't kill her until their 2nd confrontation late in Act 4  with intermission better than an hour later! I've been listening to him for 67 years have everything he ever did and Lanza does not scoop a lot and certainly not in the sense of scooping as a means to get to an otherwise difficult top note and if he tends to oversing whatever that may mean what is to be said about Del Monaco Rysanek and Bastianini naming only singers of his own time all three of whom were very great opera stars? As for prior divas and divos of the silver screen I might point out that Nino Martini played the same kind of working man of the earth tenor roles in the 1930s as did Lanza two decades later. The comment that voices shouldn't be darkening at 34 is somewhat nonsensical. Voices darken when they darken some early some late. Domingo was singing Otello at 34 even before his voice darkened appropriately and he's still singing at 77. Vinay a famous OTELLO was a famous Otello from his 36th year and his voice was so dark he'd been singing baritone into his mid30s. This is the first time I have ever seen an allegation of Lanza sexually harassing his female costars and I would have to know where THAT came from  certainly not from Grayson Blyth Morrow he didn't like Morrow because she smoked! Fontaine Montiel or Allasio.atlasmb  Lanza was not the PREMIER tenor of his time. He was the most famous one thanks to Hollywood but that is not the same thing at all. Premier would indicate that he was the most important opera tenor on the planet against whom all others were compared and found wanting. He was not and they were not. Today for example the PREMIER tenor of his time is probably Jonas Kaufmann but the most famous one is surely Andrea Bocelli who is close to being a joke among serious opera lovers and musicians.Like him or not not even detractors ever joked about Lanza's voice.".

	schema:reviewBody "While some are better than othersnone masterpieces none abominations either all of Mario Lanza's films are worth seeing in some shape or form at least once. Of which Serenade even with its flaws replaces The Great Caruso as the best of themnot counting The Student Prince which only had Lanza's voice featuring as good as that film is. Something to bear in mind is that Serenade is a film that should be judged on its own merits as a film other than the title and some characters names it does deviate quite substantially from the superband superior book it's based on. As an adaptation it's pretty much a bowdlerisation being tonally significantly toned down due to censorship as a film on its own merits while not perfect it's very good.Serenade's weakest aspect is the script to sum it up in one word it's patchy with much of it feeling very bland with the exception of Winthrop's very witty dialogue and the writing being rather soapoperaish in the frothy and melodramatic sense. The romance between Damon and Kendall's characters also seemed rather hastily written and rushed in development and the chemistry between the two of them felt cold. Also the ending didn't do much for me it just felt forced and didn't quite seem to gel with the rest of the story.The production values are absolutely topnotch though the costumes and sets being the very meaning of lavish and the photography is rich and vibrant in colour as well as looking so professionally shot the Ave Maria and Otello Monologue scenes are superbly filmed. It is very difficult to put into words how good the music is without resorting to superlatives the music score is energetic sumptuous and whimsical while Serenade while no Be My Love or Because You're Mine is a worthy main song. There are many operaticclassical music favourites here that will delight many an opera fan with Otello's Monologue Ave Maria and Lamento di Federico coming off particularly strongly.Serenade has one of the betterexecuted stories perhaps even the best of any of Lanza's films. Despite being longer than the average Lanza film at two hours it didn't feel that long to me and is more eventful Lanza's MGM efforts story wise were as thin as a wafer and less predictable than his earlier films and even is more emotionally investing the book is darker but the film isn't any less poignant. Mann's directs with a sure hand and the characters engage at least while not having an awful lot of dimension to them. The performances are very good with the best acting performance coming from Vincent Price giving one of my favourite supporting performances by far in a Lanza film who is menacingly urbane and hilariously acidtongued.Lanza's performance contains the best overall acting he ever did he overdoes it occasionally sure and Nessun Dorma sounds uncharacteristically strained but his achingly sincere acting in Ave Maria and poignancy in Lamento di Federico more than makes up. He is at his best in the Otello Monologue this is different and very heavy stuff for Lanza to take on but he brings riveting intensity and heartwrenching emotion that it was difficult to not be moved by him. Lanza is also in golden voice it's darker and heavier than his earlier films but has lost none of its beauty or what made the voice distinctive musicality and phrasing are fine too. Joan Fontaine while not at her absolute best is both alluring and coolly vindictive and Sarita Montiel is sensual and fiery with her performance certainly not being devoid of heart like Lanza her actingespecially in her very telling reaction to hearing him singing in the Ave Maria scene is magical.All in all well worth watching and a must for Mario Lanza fans. Fans of the book beware but opera and Lanza fans will be in heaven judging the film on its own it has replaced The Great Caruso as my choice for his best film. 810 Bethany Cox".

Overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only Renoirs sophomore effort. For fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future Renoir movies especially THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID 1946 and THE GOLDEN COACH 1952  in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her  but also THE RULES OF THE GAME 1939  showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters' backs are turned away from them  and FRENCH CANCAN 1955  Nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point. Personally I would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to G.W. Pabsts PANDORAS BOX 1928 Josef von Sternbergs THE BLUE ANGEL 1930 and Max Ophuls LOLA MONTES 1955 in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan.Having said all that the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release  a mad undertaking as Renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late fathers paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good! Stylistically NANA is quite different from Renoirs sound work and owes a particular debt to Erich von Stroheims FOOLISH WIVES 1922 a film Renoir greatly admired  and on a personal note one which I really ought to revisit presto having owned the Kino DVD of it and the other von Stroheims for 4 years now. Anyway NANA is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the midpoint in particular going on too long.The overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times  particularly that of Catherine Hesslings Nana and Raymond GuerinCatelains Georges Hugon one of her various suitorsalthough technically they are being their characters i.e. a bad actress who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage and an immature weakling respectively. However like Anna Magnani in THE GOLDEN COACH Hessling Renoirs wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as the epitome of elegance as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to enslave every man she meets. Other notables in the cast are Dr. Caligari himself Werner Krauss as Nanas most fervent devotee Count Muffat Jean Angelo as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of Nanas and future distinguished film director Claude AutantLara billed as Claude Moore and also serving as art director here as Muffats close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latters neglected wife! The print I watched  via Lionsgates Jean Renoir 3Disc Collectors Edition  is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifullytinted one which had been previously available only on French DVD. Being based on a classic of French literature by Emile Zola no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are Dorothy Arzners in 1934 with Anna Sten and Lionel Atwill and which I own on VHS and ChristianJaques in 1955 with Martine Carol and Charles Boyer which I am not familiar with.".

	schema:headline " A solid and entertaining silent film by the father of French cinema Jean Renoir";
	schema:reviewBody "Nana 1926 is the third film by the great Jean Renoir. I've been unable to find his first film which he codirected with another filmmaker but having seen his second film and solo debut La fille de l'eau a.k.a. Whirlpool of Fate 1925 I was a bit surprised by Nana for a few reasons. First there's the star of both films Catherine Hessling. In La fille de l'eau she played an innocent young girl and she did so about as well as could be expected given how almost absurdly overdrawn her character was in terms of virtue and purity. In Nana suffice it to say her role is a bit different. She plays a tart a prostitute. Once again her character is ridiculously exaggerated caricatured to an absolutely laughable extent. Here however unlike in Renoir's last film Hessling does nothing to help matters. Her acting in Nana is so over the top that it at times becomes a marked hindrance to the integrity of the film. I would expect this kind of performance in a Keystone comedy from 1914 maybe but not from a Renoir film in the latter half of the '20s. Furthermore the narrative breaks down into tragic melodrama in the latter portion of the film and any thematic substance from the first half of the film is ultimately diluted in the perceived necessities of plot and story. This is unfortunate but not unexpected it's common of so many silents from this era.That however is about the extent of my criticism for the film. It's a good film overall or at least a solid one. In some ways it surpasses La fille de l'eau and in other ways it falls short of it. The narrative in Nana is stronger than its predecessor's The characters are more complex and less archetypal and the themes are more pronounced while they last. To venture further into the subjective I'd say that Nana has higher entertainment value than Renoir's last film and that it's more dramatically engaging.On the other hand there was an element of visual poetry in La fille de l'eau that is missing from Nana. Perhaps it's the issue of color tinting at least in part. I've always felt that color tinting degrades a film's artistic value. La fille de l'eau was not tinted and it preserved a certain artistry in the film's aesthetic that the tinted images in Nana simply can not match. I will concede though that if Renoir is going to insist on color tinting the tinting in Nana is handled well  a series of similarly toned warm tints providing a more consistent visual mood than for instance the messy rainbow of colors from all parts of the visible spectrum in Fritz Lang's The Spiders films. La fille de l'eau also featured impressive montage and one wonders where the editing talents displayed in that film disappeared to for Nana. That's not to say that Nana is poorly edited but simply that it doesn't exhibit the noticeably skilled use of montage that we saw in the former film. Renoir is credited for the editing in Nana whereas I can't find a credit for the editing in La fille de l'eau so it's possible that it wasn't Renoir's editing talents that we saw in that film although I'm still willing to guess that it was.Finally La fille de l'eau gets a nudge for a fantastic dream sequence that I'm sure anyone who saw the film will remember. But enough contrasting. There are certainly similarities as well. The most obvious place where the two films can be compared is in their social inclinations. Both films and for that matter every Renoir film I've ever seen feature a blending of characters from different social classes. Boudu Saved From Drowning The Lower Depths Grand Illusion The Diary of a Chambermaid The Golden Coach  Renoir loves to throw lower class characters and upper class characters into the same setting and see what comes of it. It's his way of exploring his humanist disposition. Other filmmakers have done it in their own way. Kurosawa liked to look to the lower classes alone to find the true nature of humanity. Visconti though not exactly a humanist liked to look largely to the upper classes to explore human nature. Renoir likes to look at both together  the coexistence of the two in a particular setting  and he defines humanity through the shared qualities as well as the conflicts that arise under those conditions.Nana is a very much a male film in that like Luis Buuel there is a focus on the power of the female and the manner in which a woman can trigger a maelstrom of chaos in the lives of the men who fall at her feet and who set aside everything  even that most precious social status and respectability  in order to attain the object of their passion. This theme has the potential to be feminist of course but not here. The film's sympathies are almost entirely with the despairing male characters and the female tantalizer is depicted as an absolutely ridiculous human being although she is ultimately afforded a small degree of humanity.On a side note there's a role in 'Nana for Werner Krauss the German actor who appeared in films like Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Pabst's The Joyless Street. He's good. In fact excluding Catherine Hessling the whole cast is pretty good.The film is made by a fairly young and inexperienced Jean Renoir and yet it is clearly the work of a professional. Renoir was not the master of the cinema that he would later become but already he was a good filmmaker and his talent for storytelling is evident even this early in his career.RATING 6.00 out of 10 stars".

I've been unable to find his first film which he codirected with another filmmaker but having seen his second film and solo debut La fille de l'eau a.k.a.

She usually has the same face which reminds me sorry to say of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all.The film was also quite long drawn the camera work was uninteresting aside from a shot of a horse race and the editing was dull. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's Box simply scores on every level where Nana fails.This film is only for Renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs.".

Such as even General Zhao. It parodies films from Su QiEr to Ip Man to of course Chau's classic pair of films A Chinese Odyssey. Mo lei tau films definitely aren't for everyone but they smash any slapstick films Hollywood has ever released.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'd probably know by now how adamant I am that the best and only way to enjoy a Hong Kong comedy is to watch it in Cantonese otherwise chances are a lot of jokes especially the verbal ones will likely be lost in translation. I had the chance to watch this during my recent trip to Hong Kong but decided somehow to pass it up for other films. Needless to say one of the major interest why I decided to watch this film back in Singapore and compromise on having to sit through this in Mandarin besides having a friend watch this as well is no doubt fueled by Ronald Cheng and Charlene Choi coming out of the closet proclaiming an end to their secret union.Gossipy news aside I'm never convinced about singer Ronald Cheng's ability as an actor though I had wondered how well he had fared being in a comedic leading role. I'm still not convinced actually that he's leading man material despite having tickled my funny bone in the film which I attribute more to writerdirector Jeffrey Lau who had gone to elicit laughs right from the get go and had enough fuel from opening credits to plenty of sight gags toilet humour a string of cameo appearances and enough of movie references here to keep you engaged throughout.In essence I liken Lau to Asia's version of Hollywood comedies as churned out by the Zucker siblings where a film can stand on its own with enough craft in comedy rather than the recent slew of relatively terrible Hollywood comedies that know nothing except to string together films of the same genre and then poking fun at them en masse. Here though the idea is simple and Red Cliff  Three Kingdoms form the basis and backdrop at which comedy finds its place. It's essentially a crazy little love story between an unnamed bandit played by Ronald Cheng who becomes Zhao Yun when the time travelling titular Pandora's Box gets activated and an immortal called Rose Betty Sun who is out to find The One true love whom she believes to be Cheng's character.So time travel drops them smack into the Battle of Red Cliff and part of the fun here is to identify the whole slew of cameo appearances by China and Hong Kong actors who seem not to mind the very bit roles one scene or two to lend a helping hand at boosting the film's star attraction. And these appearances come quite fast and furious together with almost a laughaminute comedy that Lau weaves into the narrative most of which are genuinely funny until it started to run out of steam and paid not too subtle comedic homage to Hollywood films like Titanic The Matrix and King Kong even.Needless to say the narrative itself is simplistic and delivered in a choppy manner stringing together gag after gag and the finale was quite off the mark with a sudden tribute paid to one of Lau's earlier and more famous works with Stephen Chow. Still it did what it had set out to do to help you relax and enjoy a riproaring time at the movies so the objective's met and I've got little qualms about it since I honestly am admitting this was much better than expected and had found myself laughing at some points with tears uncontrollable.".

This is another of those films.This one had a particular resonance for me as it's set in Michigan in the mid 70's.  I lived in Michigan in the mid 70's and have been across the Ambassador Bridge many times. It was also interesting in that I had just seen Threesome' in which Josh Charles plays a character in love with Stephen Baldwin's character.  Add to that the great songs of the period that brought back so many memories and the unexpected appearance of David Schwimmer in an early minor role and this was an unexpectedly enjoyable movie experience. If stories about young men coming of age and becoming the person that they will later be are enjoyable to you then I can highly recommend this movie.".

So of course they are caught between making some easy money and the risk of facing some serious jail time.  WARNING possible small spoiler coming up...After they've delivered the money and accepted the drugs now they are getting cold feet about whether or not to risk trying to cross the border with the drugs don't worry I won't reveal what their decision was.  All they seem to be concerned about is getting busted losing their courier fee their friendship and loyalty etc.  However the BIG thing that they totally don't even take into consideration at all is this  if they don't deliver the drugs aren't the dealers who are waiting for the drugs going to be pretty darned pd off?!?!  The dealers have paid a suitcase of money so if they don't get their drugs the young buddies would presumably be hunted down like dogs.  This whole angle is not even mentioned!!!  These guys should be more worried about this danger than losing their courier fee which is chump change compared to what the drugs would be worth to the waiting dealers.

This movie really speaks to me it's characters are a few years removed from high school their hobbies are fighting and drinking beer and there's this nostalgia thing throughout. I give it 9 out of ten now. Maybe in 10 years that will change.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to Tennesse Williams I am more familiar myself with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire but when studying The Glass Menagerie for A Levels three years ago I was struck by how moving the story and the character of Laura was. And apart from a few closeups that distracted from the momentum of some scenes I loved this version and consider one of the better perhaps even the best versions of The Glass Menagerie. The production values look striking and even with the close ups the photography is not half bad. I will be honest in saying that Paul Newman is a better actor than he is as director. That is not to say that he didn't do a good job he didin fact it is for me one of his better directorial efforts but this is the same Paul Newman who has been responsible for some of the finest performances I've seen like in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Cool Hand Luke The Hustler and Cat on a Hot Tin Roofwhere he played Brick and for me his directing while impressive is not quite up to the same standard. What is impressive here though is that from his work as Brick no doubt he does capture the basic core of The Glass Menagerie instead of missing the point of it. Back to the rest of the film's assets the story is still moving and the script is just as beautifully written and thoughtful as Williams' own writing. And there are great performances too James Naughton is excellent as Jim and John Malkovich's Tom is wonderfully fey and gives his monologues a suitably dreamlike quality. The best two performances though come from Karen Allen as a heartbreaking Laura and especially the superb Amandaone of Williams' juiciest characters of Joanne Woodward. In conclusion a great wellacted version of The Glass Menagerie. 910 Bethany Cox".

I have also shown various movie versions to my students as well.I enjoyed this version but it's not the one I would show my classes.I thought that Woodward's Amanda was softer and sweeter than Gertrude Lawrence and Katharine Hepburn. Some parts I would have liked to have seen her a bit more emotional but I feel that Joanne Woodward turned in a touching performance. The character of Amanda can be quite funny Judith Ivey did a wonderful job as Amanda on Broadway in the spring of 2010. I feel that Woodward brought out some of that humor in the role. I also liked the other three too. All good performances but the pacing of the movie slowed it down. Also the film looked quite dark. I know it's a memory play set in a dingy apartment but it was a bit too dark especially when the lights have been turned off.What's up with Tom visiting the now vacant and abandoned apartment building?Overall I prefer the 1950 black and white version. Unlike many others I really liked Gertrude Lawrence's Amanda. I also liked Arthur Kennedy and Jane Wyman. Kirk Douglas was a little bit too energetic but still good.When I showed Katharine Hepburn's Amanda my students begged to return to the black and white version. This  coming from kids who hate black and white movies.I am glad I finally sat down to watch this version but for me I will stick with the first film version even if it has that insipid happy ending.".

	schema:headline " Perfect cast in a classic story";
	schema:reviewBody "I first noticed James Naughton when he starred in the cheesy 1970s TV version of the Planet of the Apes and later learned that he has had an amazing stage career over the years. It's a shame he may be more widely remembered for his work in that series than for his theater endeavors which by nature aren't usually recorded. Fortunately his heartbreaking performance as Jim O'Connor was saved for posterity. He's perfectly cast here as the charming former high school golden boy who comes to the Wingfield home for dinner offering a ray of hope for a happy future for painfully shy Laura Karen Allen in a wellacted stretch from her most famous role as the spitfire lover of Indiana Jones in Raidres of the Lost Ark.Joanne Woodward shines in a multilayered brilliant turn as one of the most interesting characters in modern literature Amanda Wingfieid. She gives just the right touch to small moments that give the viewer an enlightening peek at the desperate condition of the fading southern belle  such as a moment on the telephone coaxing someone to renew their newspaper subscription so she can scrape off her small commission. John Malkovich also turns in a terrific performance making the aftermath of the dinner party compelling though painful to watch. Malkovich has evolved into an actor whose quirkiness can sometimes overpower his character. In this relatively early work his brooding sexiness gives an endearing depth to the story's narrator a character who in the wrong hands can be utterly dislikable. My only real quibble with this film is has to do with the technical direction. Paul Newman drew out such great work from his cast that it's unfortunate that distracting camera work takes attention away from them at times when it shouldn't. One can see that he was trying to make the stagy story more movie like and intimate with closeups and quick cuts from camera angle to camera angle. For example when Jim accidentally breaks one of Amanda's favorite glass animals we don't really need to see a quick tight closeup of the unicorn and his broken horn that momentarily breaks the momentum of the scene. It's more than enough to hear the sad young woman's touching twist of the situation comforting Jim for causing the break by saying she'll imagine that her treasured unicorn has had an operation to make him look like a regular horse and will be happy now that he's not a freak. The camera work certainly does not render the film unwatchable and I think it shouldn't be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie shows a great understanding of the original play. The use of lighting music and actor choice exemplifies the mood and theme of the play. The actors bring out all the emotions and characteristics that Tennessee Williams put into his original piece. The setting is a 1930's apartment in Saint Louis and is told from the perspective of Tom. Laura Tom and their mother Amanda live there together because their father abandoned them. Amanda fears that Tom is becoming an alcoholic like his father and she worries about Laura's future. Laura dropped out of Business College and has a leg defect. Amanda views her daughter as damaged goods. Laura is shy and does not get attention from boys and so Amanda tries to make Laura pretty for Jim a man Tom knows for work. Laura realizes that Jim is her high school crush and gets embarrassed and doesn't eat dinner. Jim then takes the time to talk with Laura and the two ended up dancing together and kissing. Jim didn't tell Laura that he was engaged and he leaves after revealing the information to Laura and Amanda. Tom leaves his family at the end of the play just as his father did. The cast was limited to four people making the actors all have to communicate well with each other.The viewer notices each time something is meant to be awkward and each time something is meant to be serious. Each of the four actors portrayed their parts fantastically and exemplified the characters as written in Williams' original play. The candlelight shows a different kind of mood than light from the light bulb. Then Tom gives Laura some dandelion wine and leaves the candles in the room with them. He asks Laura to move closer so he can see her. After Tom and Laura look at her glass collection they go open the door and dance. Tom gives her confidence in herself that no one else ever has. This setting was created so that the viewer sees the room in a romantic setting. The music in the movie were pieces that would be played during the time it was written and set which was the late 1930's. The music adds to the tone especially when Laura tried to distract Amanda from the fact that she dropped out of Business School.".

I love Amanda and Blanche and Maggie and Baby Doll and all those incredible erotic literary women he lovingly created and left to us to enjoy. However this version just doesn't hit the mark. The main problem really is that all the actors are far TOO OLD. Karen Allen must be nearly 40 in this film and really not believable as the sheltered shy misfit of the play and the same can be said of John Malcovich who usually is one of my favorite actors. Joanne Woodward is good as Amanda one of the more demanding female roles in cinema but just lacks the ability to suck you in and make you pity her although I think that has more to do with the lackluster supporting cast and direction than her acting ability. Not a good adaptation.".

I thought that Joanne Woodward does an extreamly good portrayal of Amanda Wingfield. She acts exactly like I thought she would actflighty and maybe a bit shallow but at the same time you have this overwhelming feeling of pity for her and her family. Obviously here is a woman who was breed for a delicate life but was forced to live differently after her husband left. And I knew I recognized Laura!!!! I who have watched Indiana Jones all my life! Karen Allen! She's pretty good in this. She plays the role wellshy timid mousy... and trapped and dominated by her mother. As far as Tom played by John Malkovich wasn't that good. He has no emotion in his voice and he speaks in these horrible slow tones that make me want to scream. Usually he is very good I wonder what went wrong? But overall it's a pretty good show. Except that I find a striking similarity between Amanda Wingfield from Glass and Blanche Dubois from Streetcar. Don't you? Perhaps Tennessee Willaims had limited experience with southern women. ".

The direction is at times curiously overbearing  the staging is not only unnecessary but sometimes intrusive. The transparent curtains for example are used for their fullest effect with James and Laura but this effect is a misreading of the scene. The split screen implies a much simpler interpretation than the scene calls for. Laura is smothered yes and hidden but the reasons why and her actual state of mind go beyond the obtuse battiness of her mother. Everyone that is absent in that scene including the fifth character belongs there just as much and even more than James does. For that matter I'm surprised that more wasn't done with the absent father figure than the ridiculous smiling picture on the wall.".

He banishes her from East Lynne and forbids her from ever seeing her son again.Distraught she runs off to Europe with Levison in hopes that one day she may see her son again.East Lynne is a wonderful adaptation of the book with good performances.The film at first feels like a stuffy British drama but becomes more powerful as the film goes on with an ending you won't see coming.The print of this film is in good shape but can only be viewed at the UCLA Instructional Media Lab Powell library.The print was recently restored but on three frames inexplicably there is an X drawn across the frame.

The time period is updated to 1871 the original novel was written in 1861. The story is at its best for the 1st half then slows down somewhat and finishes off well. It is unfortunate that it would be difficult if not impossible to view any of the previous 13 silent film versions. The Mack Sennett parody East Lynne with Variations1919 is represented by 2 enticing stills in the book King of Comedy1954 but perhaps that is all that survives. As for this 1931 film adaption there is a shortened version available on DVD that's missing 12 minutes. One source claims it is without the last reel. If you refuse that and don't want to go to UCLA for the complete copy your next best bet is at a used book sale or ebay for the movie book adaption. The movie was novelized by Arline de Haas in 265 pages includes stills from the filmfor some reason only the 1st half and published by Grossett  Dunlap. If you've never read the original novel be forewarned that it's over 600 pages! In America it seems this classic story has been forgotten but in England there was a 1987 BBC Radio 4 dramatization in 7 parts and a play revival in 1992.".

The same holds for Welch who works like a Trojan and kinda dances like one in her numerous musical numbers and while never quite pulling off the dialog Ya big lug! is rather endearing in her efforts. Special applause for Tiffany Bolling as Welch's best friend. She is funny and real and would have made a wonderfully vulnerable Queenie.Even when being batted around by Coco Welch looks like she could punch Coco into the sound era.

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the 1920's film star Fatty Arbuckle scandal in which he was tried but acquitted of raping a young girl during a Hollywood party resulting in the demise of his career this is adapted from a narrative poem that has some similarities to Arbuckle but notable differences as well. Dukes plays a writer who narrates the story from his hospital bed. He recounts the difficulty that his associate silent film comedian Coco has had in holding onto a career in the cinema business. Coco hasn't had a film released in five years and is throwing a huge bash in order to show his latest opus to various studio heads in the hopes that they will distribute it for him. Unfortunately for him it's the dawn of sound and his film is silent. His livein lover Welch is a grateful and loyal but restless sexpot who he mistreats regularly and increasingly as his career dwindles. Together Coco and Welch host this bash and soon find that the studio heads are more interested in other parties or in hooking up with loose women on the premises. King plays a hot new actor who's brought to the party by starlet Bolling who is one of Welch's best friends. Once he eyes Welch King can think of virtually nothing else the rest of the night. Meanwhile Ferra a teenage girl has come to show Coco her talent in dancing never dreaming of all the angst and drama unfolding in the house. Eventually the party escalates into a near fullon orgy and the divergent personalities clash ending in violence. Coco gives an extremely strong performance in one of his better roles. His desperation is palpable and he gets to show both his comic and dramatic skills through the framework of the film. Welch is attractive but very plastic and anachronistic. She never seems genuine at any point in the film. Her character is supposed to be acting like a content and secure hostess but Welch carries this facade throughout the entire film with only occasional lapses into realism. She also performs a couple of sexy but largely inappropriate dance numbers. King provides a welcome does of male sex appeal. His angular features are a perfect contrast to the rotund Coco and he shows off his enticing physique in one key scene. Dukes Bolling and Dano as Coco's longtime chauffeur do well in their respective roles as well. The biggest problem with the film is that nothing wild happens until it is almost over! The period costuming and decor are interesting and there are some good moments along the way but the highflying wildness is not in evidence at all until over an hour into it. Then when the debauchery starts it is pretty tame all things considered certainly compared to the REAL parties of 1920's and 1930's Hollywood! Those familiar with the Arbuckle case may be expecting the story to take a different turn than it does. It's actually a pleasant surprise when things don't go exactly as one might be anticipating but the major catalyst for the violence at the end isn't even shown! A particular lovers tryst is only alluded to. A whimsical score with some clever songs good acting by Coco and the attractiveness of Welch and King are the primary assets here. It's not bad but it could have been much better.".

Jimmy is doing what he does best writing a screenplay about the terrible events that put him in the hospital and ended up taking the lives of two people one a major screen heartthrob at the party.It all started when comedian Jolly Grimm who hadn't made a movie in years invited all the Hollywood big shot producers and a number of actors actresses and hangers on to his place to view his new film Brother Jasper that he hoped will restart his fledgling career. Having had an amazing 27 hits in a row Grimm is now considered a hasbeen by the studios and hasn't been giving any staring parts in any of their major motion pictures. Grimm decided to go over their heads and make a movie that he stares in and and directed himself. Grimm still needs the Hollywood honchos to distribute his movie for it to reach the public and it's at the party that Grimm is throwing that he hopes to impress them in just doing that. Tense and nervous the day before the big party Grimm takes it out on his livein girlfriend Queenie Requal Welch who put up with his manicdepressive actions for years but now it seems that even she reached her breaking point with Grimm unable or not wanting to control his violent outbursts anymore that she's at the receiving end.Showing Jimmy the movie Brother Jasper to get his professional opinion Grimm's told that the movie needs a number of changes or cuts like a comedic cannibal scenein what's supposed to be a heartwrenching and serious film that has poor Jimmy almost thrown out of the Grimm Mansion. With all the Hollywood illuminates showing up to see what Grimm hoped to be his masterpiece and the movie that would catapult him back on top of the weekly theater ticket receipts and on the silver screen things don't go as well as Grimm hoped in fact the party turns out to be a total and deadly disaster for him.Loosely based on an incident about actor Fatty Arbuckle back in the 1920's when he was arrested and put on trial for the rape and murder of a young starlet that he invited to a drunken party and orgy of his. Arbuckle was found innocent but his career was finished and he died a poor and broken man some ten years later.James Coco is at his best as the tragic Jolly Grimm who ends up not only losing any chance of getting back in the Hollywood limelight but also looses Queenie first to movie matine idol Dale Sword Perry King and then ends up losing her life due to his jealous and uncountable rage. Grimm is not at all that much of a villain in the film The Wild Party he's more a victim of his own spectacular success.Sweet and loving at first when he took Queenie off the street and gave her a place to stay in his mansion and put her in a number of his movies as well as taking care off all her needs Grimm also treated Queenie as an equal not as someone who's totally dependent on him. It was only when his career started to fall apart that Grimm became an abusive swine towards her as well as everyone else. With the party degenerating into an orgy free for all and Queenie leaving Grimm by going off with Dale Sword all by himself that the drinks and suspicions that were overwhelming his already fragile mind took control and Grimm lost it as well as lost what life and freedom that he still had left.".

When he realizes that he has no backers for his new film and his mistress Queenie has run off with Perry King he stands on the landing of his staircase and drunkenly berates the remaining guests at his party. The funny thing is that the camera never moves nor are there any cutaways from him. He just goes on and on when someone should have yelled cut. Raquel Welch's musical numbers were I suppose meant to entice lusty revelry among the guests but she's not that talented. Leave that sort of thing to Mae West.

James Coco plays a washedup silent movie comic who throws a wild party at his home thinking it will save his career but doesn't count on the extent of depravity of some of his guests. At times the film is highly realistic and makes you wonder about current Hollywood parties and what really goes on between costars. The film has a great 1920's look and the music also adds to the feel. The film is hard to define. It's sort of a historical drama crossed with black comedy but a pretty good one at that.".

More specifically it's based on a hideously maudlin poem by Joseph Moncure March published in 1928. The IvoryMerchant team so famous for its impeccable period detail in any number of films totally flops in capturing the 1929 Holly glam look. What they did capture is the 1975 look. James Coco stars as Jolly Grimm a washed up silent film comic hoping for a comeback in his latest and selfbacked film on the life of Brother Juniper. His livein girlfriend and former extra is played by Raquel Welch. She gets to sing and dance to one of the film's many horrid songs. Perry King plays a flashy new film star Tiffany Bolling plays his jaded party date Bobo Lewis plays the maid Royal Dano plays Tex the former stuntman David Dukes plays the guy who writes the poem. The majority of the cast is unrecognizable. The story hits of just about every stereotype. There's the Valentino type a vamp who's really a lesbian studio heads with thick Euro accents and worst of all is the little puke who'll do anything to get into the movies so she crashes the party and does an Isadora dance draped in dish towels.Everything is wrong although there could have been a decent movie with James Coco and none of the rest of the cast. The costumes are all wrong as is the women's hair and makeup. The several songs are the type that Paul Williams used to sing with that gagworthy diction of his. There are also lots of clips of Coco playing Brother Juniper in the silent movie. As the cannibals trap him and lead him to the giant cauldron Juniper says..... You can't boil me. I'm a friar!

It is especially sad to think that this was a big movie for James Coco. His true comedic talents were totally wasted in this mess of a film. The film is so unbelievably bad that I am surprised that it has not reached some sort of cult film status. It should be played at midnight at art house all over the US.

The film begins as a rather unfunny slapstick comedy Gassman falls down on the snow a lot  ha ha ha but after about 30 minutes the plot actually gets intriguing and almost dreamily weird. In the second half it becomes a slightly more serious spy comedy with lots of twists and turns.

	schema:reviewBody "Ladies and Gentlemen the best superhero movie of all time. Years and years ago an Ultraman named Belial attempted to gain access to the Plasma Spark the artificial sun which serves as the power source for the Ultraman homeworld known as The Land of Light. He failed and was banished but not before bonding with a powerful alien entity called Reiblood and then returning to attempt to steal the Plasma Spark he failed again and was this time imprisoned years have gone by and now Ultraman Belial is free he plans to steal the plasma spark destroy the land of light and gain access to the monster graveyard the interdimensional realm where the souls of all the monsters ever defeated go. Now bear in mind there have been over a dozen Ultraman shows and they all had weekly monster all those monster all in one place and all revived at the hands of one evil Ultraman This is as epic as it sounds. This movie gets everything right let me go through it Production design This film has some great sets flawlessly blending CGI and real sets I dare you to tell which is which in a lot of the bigger scenes the overall look is an easy aplus. Music The usual kickass battle music we've come to expect from this franchise but with gravitas in scenes where it's needed. Fight choreography Here is where the film easily shines over any western superhero film I mean yeah the fight scenes in the MCU movies have been able to blend CGI and live fighting almost flawlessly but here it's all wirework and martial arts with a little CGI for power attacks just enough to make it look good. The two best scenes are the attack on the land of the light and the showdown in the monster graveyard. The attack on the land of light is when Ultraman Belial attacks the land of light in order to seize the plasma spark but in order to get there he has to fight his way through a whole army of Ultramen. I love this scene for two reasons firstly the Ultramen included in the fighting firmly establish 'Ultraman The Legend Begins' 'Ultraman Beyond' and 'Ultraman Powered' all foreign crossovers as being in cannon clearly demonstrating that the creative team knew what they were doing and had a deep love of the Ultraman universe. The other thing I love is that all the Ultramen Belial has to fight through have each had whole TV series to build up their credibility each has had a whole series of us watching them fight monsters on a weekly basis sometimes battling more then one on occasion and some taking on evils that threaten the existence of the entire multiverse. And yet Ultraman Belial is able to fight his way through by fighting them three at a time This is the best way to establish how unstoppable the villain is and why to this day Ultraman Belial is one of my favourites villains of all time this and his design is appropriately hellish and the guy doing the voice sounds appropriately maniacal and gleeful. The other fight scene I like is the showdown in the Monster Graveyard this scene is almost a reverse of the assault on the land of light here the few Ultramen who survived the assault on their home face off against Ultraman Belial and a whole army of monsters it's urgent it's dynamic it is awesome. Acting the acting in this movie is great it's actually a bit more toned down then in other movies which people could accuse of being melodramatic making it a more accessible movie for others. Characters this movie is a grand anniversary and reunites over forty years worth of Ultramen though some get taken out early no one feels sidelined the only problem I have is that there is a crossover with another series about a group of humans flying around with a spaceship and one of them has a machine with which he can summon monsters but they don't take up too much screen time and their presence is explained so I don't mind them they also pick up Ultraman Dyna who's from the Ultraman Tiga universe but let's not get into that just to add one of the alternate universe Ultramen to this reunion. Story I am actually really impressed that this story works so well having to fit in so many characters and yet it manages to make them all fit the script could easily have felt like fan service designed to be the ultimate Ultraman crossover but it actually feels like a decent story. And so here it is my favourite Superhero film of all time serving as a great introduction to Ultraman a great tribute to years of Ultraman lore a great tokusatsu film and a kickass superhero film.".

	schema:headline " Hands down one of the best of the Ultraman Movies  Pure Eye Candy Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Sakamoto Koichi's crowdpleasing and ambitious film Daikaiju BattleUltra Ginga Densetsu The Movie AKA Great Monster Battle Ultra Galaxy The Movie is a nostalgic fun movie that is pure eye candy and primarily made for the benefit of fans of Tsuburaya Production's landmark Ultraman series of the late 60s and 70s. While children will love it on a strictly visual level their parents especially the Dads will probably get even more sentimental over all the classic Ultra heroes and monsters and marvel at this their best movie adventure to date.Ultra Galaxy The Movie is the theatrical film tiein to Tsuburaya's hit TV series of the same name which aired from February  December 2007. Based on Bandai Entertainment's arcadevideo combat simulation game Daikaiju Battle Ultra Monsters the story revolved around young hero Rei Minami Shota who was secretly an human hybrid of the Reiblood Alien Race and who had control over the Battle Nizer a control device in which he can take command over various kaiju monsters and use them in battle similar to the anime Pokemon series. Rei would use his Battle Nizer to control the likes of such fan favorite Ultra Monsters like Gomon from the Ultraman series or Litra from Ultra Q series and use them as allies in fighting a host of other recognizable Ultraman alien villains and kaiju. While short on story part of the fun of the series was in watching the various monsters duke it out in Battle Royale fashion against each other each week somewhat similar to Tsuburaya's failed old 70s series Ultra Fight. The series spawned a sequel called Ultra Galaxy Dai Kaiju Battle Never Ending Odyssey Dec. 2008  January 2009 which fleshed out more of Rei's past.Ultra Galaxy The Movie however does not focus just on the monsters but brings in the famed Ultraman Brothers back to the big screen as well. Director Sakamoto along with writers Kashaihara Tatsuro Kobayashi Yuji and Okabe Junya craft a very ambitious and thrilling story which truly makes this the greatest of the Ultraman stories to date.The story introduces audiences to the corrupt renegade Ultraman named Belialvoiced by 20th Century Boy's Miyasako Hiroyuki who has gained control of the Giga Battle Nizer a cosmic device in which he can control the spirits of 100 of the Ultraman Brother's greatest fallen opponents. Belial was imprisoned centuries ago by Ultra King voiced by former Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Jyunichi in a cubelike satellite orbiting the M78 AKA The Ultra HoshiStar home planet to the Ultra Brothers. Belial is released by the chameleon alien Zarab and uses his new found freedom to steal the Plasma Spark which is the life battery of M78 causing the planet to instantly freeze over. Original Ultraman Kurobe Susumu Ultra Seven Moritsugu Koji and Ultraman Mebius Igarashi Shunji survive the onslaught and go seek the help of Rei who as a Leonix having the DNA of the Reiblood is the only other alien who possesses a Battle Nizer and can control other Kaiju. With the aid of Rei's ZAP Spacy comrades the team are also joined by alternate time line hero Ultraman Dyna Tsuruno Takeshi and Ultra Seven's rebel son Ultraman Zero voiced by Miyano Mamoru who was under the training of Ultraman King Ultraman Leo and Astra.Like Toho's similar allstar hero spectacle Kamen Rider Decade All Rider vs. Dai Shocker which was released at about the same time Ultra Galaxy features cameos and appearances by virtually every single Ultraman hero. Granted while the main focus of the film was on Original Ultraman Seven Mebius Dyna and the new Zero other Ultraman heroes also got their spotlight including Jack Ace Taro Leo Astra Zoffy as well as lesser heroes Ultraman 80 Yurian Ultraman Great Ultraman Hikari and Ultraman Powered. It was also great fun to see some of the anime Ultraman in the flesh as well Ultraman USA Scott Beth Chuck The Ultraman and Ultraman Kids Unfortunately no Adromelos or Zearth.While Ultraman Belial is truly a menacing force he did seem a bit too powerful an opponent. His look reminds me a lot of Venom from SpiderMan 3 and his powers seem akin to Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare On Elm Street Movies not dream but matter manipulation. He didn't really seem that interesting a villain apart from him being the first true evil Ultraman not sure if Shadow or Agul count.The 100 Monster army of Belial was certainly a who's who of recognizable alien and monster opponents from all the various Ultraman series Baltan King Joe Black ZTon etc but they were pure cannon fodder for the heroes to slaughter through and didn't give much of any fight.While some of the CGI effects by Okabe Junya and Koyasu Hajime are indeed stellar and are perhaps the best seen to date on a Tokusatsu Movie they aren't quite matching the work of top SFX studios like Weta or Industrial Light and Magic although they are indeed top notch. Some of the design details seemed a bit too reminiscent to the Star Wars Prequels and Superman M78 looks very much like Krypton.The stunt work by action coordinator Noguchi Akihiro Power Rangers series definitely is inspired by Hong Kong wushu cinema and involved a lot of wirefu and martial arts combat. Ultra Galaxy is indeed a very slick looking film and seems very much crafted to appeal to jaded audiences abroad especially the in US. Sakamoto's previous experience with the Tokusatsu genre both in front of and behind the camera on shows such as The Power Rangers series has given him a very straighttothepunch style of directing and it does make Ultra Galaxy a tight and brisk moving film.I truly enjoyed this film and as a TokusatsuUltraman World fan was very impressed by Sakamoto's attention to detail and he really delivered a good looking and fun film.".

Nelson Eddy is as dashing and handsome as any leading man in the 21st century and Jeanette McDonald's beauty is unrivaled.

	schema:reviewBody "The New Moon and Naughty Marietta get understandably confused in the minds of some filmgoers. Both are set in New Orleans during the French colonial period both star Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy both begin with a ship crossing from France.But New Moon is set during the last days of Louis XVI while Naughty Marietta takes place during Louis XV's reign. This time it is Nelson who is the fugitive. He's a member of the aristocracy who's believing and preaching the ideals of the Revolution. He's slipped away as a bond servant sailing to New Orleans. In Naughty Marietta it's Jeanette who's disguised as a bondservant to escape an arranged marriage.Also both films have Nelson singing a rousing fight song for his followers in Naughty Marietta it's Tramp Tramp Tramp while in this film he exhorts and rallies his troops with Stouthearted Men.MGM did this film before with Lawrence Tibbett and Grace Moore at the beginning of the sound era. They made the mistake of changing the story line to fit the Russian Revolution. Here they wisely opted for the traditional locale.Jeanette and Nelson are in their traditional roles in the romance game. She with her kittenish ways him with his put downs of same.The plot here calls for the two of them after escaping from New Orleans on the ship the New Moon hence the title to drop anchor at an island where the former bondservants set about to create at Utopian society. A little bit like Pitcairn Island in Mutiny on the Bounty. It only lasts a short while until news of the revolution in France arrives.I've often wondered how portraying a Utopian socialist ideal must have sat with the very Republican Jeanette MacDonald. I'm guessing she would have been glad of rescue for more reasons than one would think.Of course it's the music and the voices that one sees this film and the Sigmund RombergOtto HarbachOscar Hammerstein II score was never better sung. The obligatory duet of Wanting You is heard and Jeanette is in particularly good voice in One Kiss. She also sings Lover Come Back to Me first alone and later with Nelson. That was the big hit of the score sung by artists that range from Rudy Vallee to Ella Fitzgerald.Personally speaking I'll listen to any kind of music as long as I can recognize the melody. This film will have melody lovers everywhere entranced.".

This movie is not edgy or raw it is just the opposite. Just a wonderful emotional experience.

I've been unable to get the music out of my head. It is romantic and gorgeous and unforgettable. The story is old fashioned and as different from today's movies as daylight is from night. This movie is not edgy or raw it is just the opposite. Just a wonderful emotional experience. At the crack of dawn my mother in law we are staying with them for the weekend dragged me out of bed and said that I had to see this movie and although we have little in common when it comes to taste in clothes and many other things she was entirely right about this movie. Thank you Gina.";

	schema:reviewBody "New Moon 1940 MGM starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is by far the best movie these two super star operetta singers provided for the USA and world public in the years before World War II during the Golden Age Of Hollywood.It is one of the last and best of the black and white movie costume musicals and is dazzling in every way. Every film buff should obtain and screen this incredible movie often.The two stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy appeared in two widely and justifiably honored movies before this one......Naughty Marietta 1935 MGM and also Rosemarie 1937 MGM and were incredible in both.They managed to turn the unusual trick of skillful acting combined with singing music in the range and with the obvious ability of true opera stars Nelson Eddy later provided wonderful singing of famous opera arias in The Whale Who Wanted To Sing At The Met sequence part of the Make Mine Music 1946 Disney animated cartoon show.In addition to wonderful singing MacDonald and Eddy provide actor performances comfortable and delightful to watch the kind of acting people from all backgrounds could feel comfortable with and enjoy. They were natural actors of high talents and also singers of unparalleled gifts. The entire history of world cinema never saw their equal before or since.The chemistry between MacDonald and Eddy is breathtaking....at times understated and amazingly carefree considering the pomp and glamor always part of their costumed and sumptuously decorated surroundings and at times intimate to a level of sexual believability almost x rated. but it never occurred to the censors to object to their movies or performances or for the public even the most conservative part of it to object to the acting and love duet singing these two super stars provided. They were in a class by themselves never to be forgotten always to be cherished probably never to be duplicated at any time in the future.....they were to musical performing arts what Shakespeare was to dramatic play writing....the best of the best.The camera work includes many night time scenes and moving scenes tracking marching men galloping horses and sumptuous dances and walks in formal gardens in New Orleans mansions part of it all. So too are wonderful special effects sequences showing a storm at sea which wrecks the large sailing ship which takes the main characters away from New Orleans deposits them on a lonely island and is wrecked by a storm which somehow does not drown or harm the endangered boat passengers.Somehow it is all believable and one can never take one's eyes off of the screen or stop being interested and believing in the story rooting for the main characters as they face and overcome one travail after the other.New Moon 1940 MGM starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is the sort of movie one knows will end happily from the start and no matter what the characters face the audience knows it will all come out all right in the end and a splendid and enjoyable story is always ahead well presented and scripted witty and charming wonderfully costumed supplied with one beautifully furnished and designed setting after another....the sort of movie which could and was only provided for American and world audiences during the fabled Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood in the years immediately before World War II perhaps the high water mark in movie history.See this movie and these two actors and the other two movies of fame they did before this....Naughty Marietta 1935 MGM and Rosemarie 1937 MGM.

	schema:headline " A different kind of twilight saga with music and stouthearted men";
	schema:reviewBody "Having performed in New Moon in summer stock I watched the 1940 version of this Sigmund Romberg operetta with great interest. I confess I don't remember any of the story since I was in it 35 years ago in the midst of many other summer stock productions. But what I do remember is that New Moon needs great voices and opulent production values. Our production values consisted of a bunch of men standing outside the entrance to the barn which was covered by a curtain and yelling to indicate the fight on board ship.The New Moon contains some of the most beautiful music ever written including Lover Come Back Wanting You One Kiss the rousing StoutHearted Men and my favorite Softly As in the Morning Sunrise. So who better to perform it than those songbirds of the silver screen Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald.The story has to do with dissidents from France in the days of the revolution who are sold as bond servants in Louisiana. They are led by Philippe Duc de Villiers Eddy who has planned their escape back to France via a ship the New Moon. Meanwhile he's fallen for Marianne Jeanette MacDonald and she for him. When the bond servants make their escape Marianne and her aunt Mary Boland accompany them back to France with women who are traveling to become brides. When the ship is attacked the dissidents and the women find themselves in a new world.In the film the characters of Alexander and Julie are reduced to bit parts though their song Gorgeous Alexander plays in the background. The roles of Robert and Philippe have been combined giving Eddy both the lead baritone song and the tenor song Softly. Several songs have been cut as well as dances.However the bestknown songs are present the songs cut with the exception with The Girl on the Prow are ditties. Eddy is in magnificent voice. I'm not a huge fan of MacDonald's singing  it's a thin voice  but she's beautiful a fine actress and great with Eddy.Someone mentioned that Eddy and MacDonald are more mature here  I actually didn't notice.Yes the dialogue is corny but these operettas were about the music. If you want to hear some beautiful songs in a film starring one of the classic teams of film history New Moon is for you.".

	schema:headline " Very watchable adaptation if the RombergHammerstein romance operetta sited in the Caribbean during the French Revolution";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent chance to experience the duo singing and acting of Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddy without the occasional included opera performance as in Maytime  and Rose Marie. In fact along with the very similar Naughty Marietta it's clearly my favorite of the 4 'classic' JM  NE films I have recently seen both in terms of the screenplay and the Sigmund Rombergcomposed songs. The main problem is that Jeanette plays a spoiled unsympathetic character unlikely for Eddy's character to fall in love with save for her singing.New Moon is both the name of the ship that the bondsmen capture a symbol for the new society Eddy establishes for his utopian colony and a symbol for his romantic relationship with Jeanette's character. As several reviewers have pointed out the screenplay which is relatively faithful to the original play bears many striking similarities to the earlier JM  NE film Naughty Marietta. In that film the two escape the encumbering Old World aristocracy by fleeing into the American wilderness from New Orleans. In this film they find a small unchartedunlikely Caribbean island where Eddy's character establishes a utopian society based on the principles of the French Revolution then taking place. But the screenplay also bears some striking resemblances to the earlier Warner film Captain Blood featuring another famous film romantic couple Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. In both films the male lead is an aristocratic political rebel who spends a period as the slave or indentured servant of the female lead in the Caribbean then later captures a ship becomes a pirate leader and captures a ship the female lead is on. In both films the male lead ends the film as the political leader of a Caribbean Island with the female lead who has vacillated in her loyalty to him as his wife or wifeapparent. The screenplay also has the commonality with the prior Jeanette  Allan Jones starring operetta The Firefly of Jeanette and the male star being on opposite sides of a historical struggle to overthrow an unpopular European regime and the announcement at the end that a French king or dictator has been deposed from Spain in the case of The Firefly. Very conveniently Eddy's pirated ship discovers and takes over a ship full of prospective brides bound for the Frenchcontrolled small sugar and coffee island of Martinique who become the brides of his band of bondsmen escapeessort of like in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers Coincidentally Eddy is surprised to find Jeanette on this ship on her way back to France. Very strange that these French girls were taken to N.O. first then back east to Martinique! Girls raised in N.O. were more likely to survive the various tropical diseases that killed so many new colonists.Eddy sings his bestremembered nonromanticthemed song in the rabblerousing Stouthearted Men functionally equivalent to Tramp Tramp Tramp in Naughty Marietta and The Mounties in Rose Marie. It helps Eddy's character rouse the bondsmen to join him in pirating the ship New Moon to escape to 'freedom'. Maytime lacked a functionally equivalent song because the screenplay didn't require one. However Eddy did lead a rousing male group sing in a tavern. Here Eddy also sings Shoes immediately followed by the brief Softly as a Morning Sunrise. Eddy also lead a group protest sing aboard the ship. Eddy seems unusually stiff until he breaks free of being a bondsman when the exchanges with Jeanette become classics. Jeanette's apparent conversion to the revolution at the end after learning it succeeded in France is a bit unconvincing.The 4 'classic' JM  NE films all ended with a reprisal duet of a memorable 'signature' love song. Here it's Wanting You which is blended with Stouthearted Men by a male chorus similar to the ending in Naughty Marietta However this film is unusual in that there are actually two such songsalso Lover Come Back to Me which are sung by one or both several times and the less memorableto me is the one sung at the ending.Unlike the previous film version of the Rombergscored Maytime operetta all of the most memorable songs from the original play were retained here and  with some alterations of the details the basic plot was retained. In addition 4 songs were newly composed by Romberg for the film. The most memorable of these are Stranger in Parisironically sung aboard the ship and Dance Your Cares Away...The African American spiritual Troubles of the World is also included in a night scene functioning like Ole Man River in ShowboatIncidentally historically Louisiana Territory including New Orleans was officially transferred from French to Spanish administration in 1763. Thus the governor should be Spanish but clearly is cast as French. Also French political prisoners were unlikely to be sent there as bondsmen during that period. Also historically the year before this story takes place most of New Orleans burned to the ground one of several devastating fires before much was rebuilt with brick.It's a shame that JM  NE never got to do another classic RombergHammersteinscored classic The Desert Song nor Kerns' classic Showboat. Jeanette's successor at MGM as an operatrained singer Kathryn Grayson would get to costar in both of these in the '50s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow...talk about the phrase either you love 'em or you hate 'em! Folks either adore the singing of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy or they wonder WHY anyone would want to see their films. I assume the latter is the vast majority but I have noticed that their fans are VERY vociferous in their support for the duo. In light of this I must admit up front that I never have been a fan of their filmsconsider this as you read my review.The plot is very unusual. It's set in the time period shortly before the French Revolution. Jeanette and Nelson are both on a ship bound for the colony in Louisiana. However she is traveling as a rich and pampered lady while Nelson is a prisoner who is being sent as a bond servant. He holds a secret though as he arranged to be arrested and deportedthough exactly why you'll need to wait and see.When the two meet on the ship she mistakenly thinks he's an officer on the ship and there is naturally some instant chemistry between them. Later when she is in her home in the colony he comes to her roomand she assumes it's because he's pretending to be a servant. However he really is a servant and it seems like their burgeoning love is not to be.As a servant Nelson is perfect. He makes the party Jeanette plans a fabulous eveningso perfect and wonderful that Jeanette is worriedas this makes her care all the more for him. The guests marvel at the party and its immaculate planningand apparently only one nobleman had ever thrown such a perfect party. Back in France the Duc de Villiers was apparently that man...and in reality Nelson IS this Duke! By the end of the evening Jeanette finds herself kissing her servantwhich simply is NOT donethough she doesn't realize that he is of very noble birth a Duke is second to a Prince in the line for succession. And before the romance can go any further another ship a ship of the Duke's arriveswith supplies for an uprising against royal authority. So it's time to put a hold on to the snoggingthough of course there IS time to sing some rousing songs!! Oddly later Jeanette is on a ship bound for France when it's captured by pirates led by...yup Nelson Eddy! However their excursion around the Caribbean is cut short when the pirate ship is caught in a storm and the boat wrecks next to an uncharted island. Will the two wouldbe lovers survive? Will they somehow find love on a Gilligan's Islandlike setting? Tune in and see for yourself.Overall it's a mixed bag. While I hated most of the songs sorry an operetta isn't my idea of fun the characters and plot were fun...trivial fun but fun nonetheless. I couldn't hate the filmthough I expected to. What makes this even more unusual is that the film was included in Harry Medved's book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Timea dubious distinction that it truly did not deserve. Sure the singing is old fashioned an hokey but Nelson and Jeanette make a nice couple and I was particularly impressed by Eddy's actinghe seemed to have a good role whereas Jeanette's often called for her to act petulant and moodynot an enviable part to say the least. According to the Duke she is ...a spoiled and foolish little aristocratas I said not a particularly enviable role for her as it was rather onedimensional.For lovers of the team the movie as all theirs is a 10. For teens and people who hate classic films a 2. For me who loves classic films but felt compelled to fastforward through some of the tedious songs I think a 5 is fair. Without the songs and a very slight rewrite on Jeanette's character it would have no doubt scored much higher.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow...talk about the phrase either you love 'em or you hate 'em! Folks either adore the singing of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy or they wonder WHY anyone would want to see their films. I assume the latter is the vast majority but I have noticed that their fans are VERY vociferous in their support for the duo. In light of this I must admit up front that I never have been a fan of their filmsconsider this as you read my review.The plot is very unusual. It's set in the time period shortly before the French Revolution. Jeanette and Nelson are both on a ship bound for the colony in Louisiana. However she is traveling as a rich and pampered lady while Nelson is a prisoner who is being sent as a bond servant. He holds a secret though as he arranged to be arrested and deportedthough exactly why you'll need to wait and see.When the two meet on the ship she mistakenly thinks he's an officer on the ship and there is naturally some instant chemistry between them. Later when she is in her home in the colony he comes to her roomand she assumes it's because he's pretending to be a servant. However he really is a servant and it seems like their burgeoning love is not to be.As a servant Nelson is perfect.

However the production values are a pleasure to look at New Moon is crisply shot and boasts beautiful costumes and sets. The score is whimsical and lush while the songs are just wonderful with marvellously witty lyrics. Standing out in particular are One Kiss Lover Come Back to Me StoutHearted Men and especially Wanting You. The songs are very nicely staged in the film StoutHearted Men are full of lively gusto that is immense fun to watch while Wanting You is kept simply and is both adorable and touching. New Moon is solidly directed and doesn't feel like a bore at all despite the script and the story not being the absolute best they could have been. The supporting cast are uniformly good but it is Nelson and Jeanette MacDonald that make the film so worthwhile. They work beautifully together and sing and act with great energy and appealing tones. MacDonald is always charming and has always been the better actress though Eddy is actually much more comfortable than he was in Naughty Mariettathe best I've seen him though is Chocolate Soldier with Rise Stevens. While both sound great Eddy is in particularly wonderful voice his rich warm masculine tones have always been more preferable to MacDonald's still sweet if slightly thin and trebly voice. Both have moments to shine they are great in their duets Wanting You and Lover Come Back to Me but MacDonald is very touching in One Kiss and Eddy literally goes for it attacking with such liveliness and gusto in StoutHearted Men. Overall a very nice film maybe not for all tastes but for EddyMacDonald fans it's a treat. 810 Bethany Cox".

Enter Donald Gray as the other part of the triangle and you have conflict amongst the natives.Linda Darnell every inch a movie star graced the screen with her alluring and dark looks. She never gives you the idea of anything else but what she is. True better films came her way but listen just watching the glamor of the star system was enough in those days. See her in LETTER TO THREE WIVES or UNFAITHFULLY YOURS ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM even that clinker FOREVER AMBER for more meaty roles. But sometimes it's refreshing to see that stars as themselves in romantic and sometimes far fetched plots. Remember in the 40s and 50s the studios ruled the films and the stars. It was their mission to expose their glamor and popularity. How many films did it take for Elizabeth Taylor to turn into a decent actress?Tab Hunter took a lot of slack for this film from the critics. But the studios had other thoughts in mind and thankfully they took him under their wings and turned him into a top teen aged heart throb. He too learned his craft along the way. Watch him in GUNMAN'S WALK BATTLE CRY THE AROUSERS and LUST IN THE DUST. He again was just a pleasure to watch on the screen with his blonde hair good looks and well toned physique.It was the time of the stars. It was their films their popularity and faithful fans that kept the movies alive in those days. Now days it's the violence and spectacle that hold court in films.

They bicker about his being too boyish a pride of the Marines and which of the two is top commander. She's a lieutenant. He's a corporal but pulls rank as the duo's captain. They find a skeleton on Saturday Island known in the US as Island of Desire and read the diary of Grimshaw In a flashback to 1930 John Laurie as Grimshaw loses native lover Sheila Chong as Tukua and is attacked by a sea serpentBack in the present Mr. Hunter finds himself increasingly aroused by his island mate but Ms. Darnell plays very hard to get.

	schema:reviewBody "Laugh Clown Laugh is a very sad movie much like He Who Gets Slapped only much more heartrending. There is no horror and the only special makeup is clown makeup. Lon Chaney finds an abandoned toddler naming her Simonetta to appease his partner Simon. The movie wastes no time into getting to the main plot involving a teenaged Simonetta played by a 15year old Loretta Young who the circus coordinator says should look like a woman in order to join Tito's and Simon's act. Tito Chaney has loved Simonetta from the time he finds her as a toddler. When he tells her she needs a rose in her hair Simonetta goes to the gardens of Count Ravelli Nils Asther where they grow. She scrapes her legs over the barbed wire fence and Count Ravelli sees her and takes her into his house to tend to her. He is a womanizer and immediately becomes infatuated with her. He verbalizes his love and says the prophetic What an alluring woman you could be. Maybe it encourages her even after she learns to her horror that he is a womanizer because later that day she is dressed like a woman and amazes Tito.Both men are now passionately in love with her and suffer uncontrollable emotions as a result the Count's is laughter and Tito's is crying. Three years later the two men meet at a neurologist's and decide to cure each other not yet knowing they are both in love with Simonetta.After they recover they learn. Count Ravelli gives Simonetta some pearls which Loretta and Lon Chaney initially rejectuntil they read the accompanying note. Then things get really complicated.Each performance is excellent throughout. Chaney gives an excellent performance though his quick transformation from a fatherly love to one that borders on incest. Tito is not the kind of man who is given to that kind of passion and he doesn't like it knowing it is wrong. Nils Asther is not dramatic or as convincing as Lon Chaney but then who can outshine Chaney? No one. Count Ravelli's transformation is more plausible because Loretta Young makes Simonetta innocent and pure who by her virtues slowly changes him from a reckless womanizer to a devoted lover. All three deserve praise and don't be surprised if you want to watch it more than once. It may be sad but it is also sweet.".

Of course he is best known for his work The Phantom of the Opera and The Hunchback of Notre Dame but his career was loaded with impressive performances of all kinds. Laugh Clown Laugh certainly showcases one of the many he did.Herbert Brenon known as a despotic director directs the film. It's a bittersweet romantic melodrama a film with a similar theme that Chaney did in 1924's He Who Gets Slapped. The fifteenyearold Loretta Young only 14 at the time of shooting is 45yearold Lon Chaney's leading lady. Young started in showbiz at the age of four as an extra but this was her first major role. The film proved to be popular MGM had it shot with an alternative happy ending to its sad ending and let the individual movie houses decide which version they wanted. No surviving copy of the happy ending seems to have survived. It's taken from a 1923 play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing based on the Italian play Ridi Pagliacci by Gausto Martino Elizabeth Meehan is the screenwriter. The play had a successful run in New York with Lionel Barrymore in the Chaney role. It was shot on location in Elysian Park a suburb of Los Angeles by the legendary cinematographer James Wong Howe.The film is simply about Tito Lon Chaney a clown in a traveling circus a performer who once drew in massive crowds with his skills. When he was younger he found himself in a most unusual situation however. He and his friend Simon discover an abandoned young girl who has no chance of survival on her own. Out of kindness the two take her in and she is raised on the road with the two performers. As time passes and the years roll on the girl blossoms into a beautiful young woman known as Simonetta Loretta Young. Tito's prime has passed which has him in a depressed state at the outset. He and the selfindulgent Count Luigi Ravelli Nils Asther learn to help each other with their problems but become romantic rivals when Simonetta falls for the rich count. Tito then falls into a spiral of sadness due his mixed emotions.Probably the first thing you'll notice about Laugh Clown Laugh is how little attempted dialogue there is. The title card is used infrequently. The vast majority of this movie is told in near pantomime gestures facial expressions and stage direction. It is also eloquently plotted so we understand the situations and dramatics instantly and inherently.Without Chaney though this film just would not work. It would seem forced or flashy almost hyperactive in some ways. Chaney is the anchor the solid center whose pure motives move quickly over to the mixed when he realizes the emotional bond between Simonette and himself is growing more physical. Without the seriousness the emotional concrete that Chaney provides to tie the movie to a core concept the flighty nature of Loretta Young or the overacting of Simon and Count Lavelli would forever damage the narrative. Chaney is the epitome of a clown laughing on the outside as he is dying on the inside and Laugh Clown Laugh is a classic film.".

I particularly enjoyed the conflict Chaney experiences between his role as a performer and his needs as a human being.  He displays a touching sense of obligation stoicism and vulnerability that only a master actor such as himself could manage.  The final scene where he has fallen is absolutely heart wrenching especially when he says I am an old man as if he only realizes it for the first time. Complete with a wonderful new score I would recommend this film for any fan of silent films or just great acting in general.  Long live Chaney!".

	schema:headline " Starring Lon Chaney as a less successful Woody Allen";
	schema:reviewBody "Lon Chaney is Tito Beppi an Italian clown better known to his audiences as Flik in this Herbert Brenon directed film. Tito and his partner Simon Bernard Siegel or Flok have a traveling twoman circus act. Tito finds an apparently abandoned young girl near a river and decides to adopt her. Simon objects but Tito butters him up slightly by announcing that he'll name her Simonetta.We quickly move forward in time and Simonetta is now a young woman played by Loretta Young who was only 14 at the time of shooting. She's now skilled at tightrope walking so Tito wants to work her into the act. On their promoter's advice they try to make Simonetta look womanlier. They fix her hair and she heads out to a wellknown spot where roses grow to acquire one as a coiffure accoutrement. It happens to be on Count Luigi Ravelli's Nils Asther property. The Count sees her and immediately falls in love. Tito has come to realize that he's in love with Simonetta too and thus the film is about the dilemmas of a morally and socially complex love triangle.Like many films from the earlier years of Hollywood Laugh Clown Laugh is an instantiation of a story that had a circuitous route to the silver screen. The script by Elizabeth Meehan with titles by Joseph Farnham was adapted from a 1923 play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing which was itself a version of an earlier 1919 Italian playRidi Pagliacciby Fausto Martini which was very loosely based on Ruggiero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. Films such as this are handy to keep in mind by the way whenever you want to counter someone complaining that only newer films rely so heavily on adapting stories from other media. Not that there is anything wrong with this despite some saying it shows a lack of originality or paucity of ideas fueled by them believing it's a new phenomenon. Laugh Clown Laugh has a nicely focused parablelike script that works well despite the fact that all we have available now is a version of the film with a section missing. In fact it's so well constructed that I couldn't even detect the missing sectionI wasn't aware of it until I listened to the DVD commentary by Lon Chaney biographer Michael F. Blake.This is the second time Chaney played a clown the first being He Who Gets Slapped 1924. We might have expected Chaney to tackle a clown even earlier in his career given his notoriety for transformative makeup designs. He does a fantastic job in the role as we'd expect. It's especially amazing to watch his ability to turn on a dime as he adjusts his depressive backstage persona especially in the later sections of the film to the happygolucky Flik for the benefit of the audience on the other side of the curtain.Laugh Clown Laugh incorporates compelling and even controversial themes subtexts and direct content. Two scenes are relatively racy for the late 1920s including one that builds up to a bit of foot fetish material and another containing a kiss with incestual subtextsit's important to remember that this was an era when some states would not even allow films that showed a woman's bare leg or shoulder. The ending is somewhat nihilistic and surprisingly tragic.On one level the film is largely about social and dramatic contrasts. Tito and Simon are successful and popular when they perform but they are almost gypsylike spartan itinerants. Like many comedians Tito's public persona is joyous and exuberant but behind the scenes he's not quite so happy. The love triangle involves both a man who is incredibly wealthy and in the upper niches of society and a man who is well liked but not wealthy and who is considered on lower or outside social rungs. There is a fabulous scene where both men head to a neurologist more a psychologist because one is suffering from mania characterized by uncontrollable laughter and the other is suffering from depression characterized by outbursts of cryingit's a personification of the comedytragedy masks. And of course the film itself appears to be a comedy for much of its length but ends up as a tragedy.At the same time Laugh Clown Laugh is a morality play. Tito ends up falling in love with his much younger functionally adopted daughter. That's controversial material for the erait's still controversial even now. Like many Chaney films the climax hinges on the moral quandaries suggested by this love triangle and Chaney's difficult decisions.While Laugh Clown Laugh is a quality film it wasn't a complete artistic success in my view. I watched it on Turner Classic Movies' Archives Lon Chaney Collection disc which also contains The Ace of Hearts 1921 which I just watched yesterday and preferred. The story here never quite captivated me in the way that Ace of Hearts did. The new score by H. Scott Salinas was also good although maybe a bit too literal to the action at times for my tastes but didn't match the sublime sustained beauty of Vivek Maddala's Ace of Hearts score. Laugh Clown Laugh is well loved by many Chaney fans though and by some accounts this was one of his favorite roles. Chaney's performance at least deserved a 10 even if the film overall wasn't up to the same degree of excellence.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a diehard Lonaholic since the early 70's but only managed to see this in a terrible 16MM bootleg print over 30 years ago and then a fragmentary view when it was shown on TCM. Watching this DVD now has given me a whole new perspective on how great a silent picture can be and on why I fell for Chaney as well. The story while it apparently bears the stamp postVictorian melodrama is also very complex and has sexual undercurrents that are surprisingly modern. It portrays emotions that are so primal and portrays them so well that its dated elements don't prevent it from feeling current and emotionally valid. The acting is top notch. The deep and conflicting feelings that are a component of any of the three sides of a love triangle are brilliantly subtly portrayed by all the principals. Fourteen yearold Loretta Young is perfectly cast as the girl who is becoming a woman with her experiences always ahead of her understanding.You can really see in LCL why Lon Chaney was considered the actor's actor of his day. He's superb his Tito Beppi is an irresistible combination of simplicity and depth. At first I thought Chaney was hamming a bit but ultimately it contributes to the impact of his portrayal of Tito's honest and profoundly compassionate character. The few seconds when Beppi realizes that his fatherly love for Simonettawhom he has raised since she was a childhas suddenly veered into desire ought to be taught in acting classes. That Chaney was capable of portraying so many strong and subtle deeply personal emotions without a single word goes a long way towards explaining the powerful grip his on screen charisma had on audiences of the Twenties. James Wong Howe's photography is stunning. He was famous for having been able to get Mary Miles Minter's pale blue eyes to register on orthochromatic film LCL shows how he brought that same testimonial to the richness of black and white to the more realistic palette of panchromatic stock.The DVD's presentation is excellent. The new musical score really enhances the film without calling attention to itself. Its quiet urgency contributes to the sense of inevitable tragedy without ever veering into clichd dramatics. I think this print of Laugh Clown Laugh is the only one surviving there are some small continuity hiccups from lost footage but it doesn't detract. Anyone who is or has been in love should see this film it's hard not to identify with elements of the plights of all three protagonists. Put this on a double bill with City Lights and it's liable to kill you. Regards Richard Day Gore".

	schema:reviewBody "Laugh Clown Laugh is another masterpiece from Lon Chaney. Although I didn't like it as much as some of his other work it is nevertheless considered as one of his best films. Tito Chaney and Simon Bernard Siegel are traveling clowns moving from town to town in Italy. One day Tito stumbles upon an abandoned little girl and rescues her. Despite protests from his partner he names her Simonetta to appease Simon and raises her as his own. The grown up Simonetta Loretta Young blossoms into a beautiful young lady. Tito and Simon meanwhile have become successful and now headline the grandest theaters in the land. One day Simonetta while out for a walk becomes entangled in a barb wire fence. She is rescued by Count Luigi Ravelli Nils Aster and taken to his home. There she learns that he is a womanizer and escapes. Tito suddenly discovers that he is in love with Simonetta when she appears before him in a stylish new dress. Three Years later Tito and Luigi meet while being treated by a doctor Emmett King for emotional problems. While in the office Simonetta meets up again with Luigi and after some reservations begin to see each other ultimately becoming engaged. Tito is devastated and becomes distraught. In his sorrow he must continue to make people laugh as the show must go on even though he is being torn apart inside. Finally Simonetta discovers that Tito is also in love with her. Now she must choose. Chaney returned to the eternal triangle theme time and time again in his films. He usually played the rejected lover and expressed such pathos that one could hardly help but feel pity for him. This film is no exception. The scenes where he must mask his sorrow and continue to play the clown are classic Chaney. Loretta Young who would go on to a successful career spanning many decades was but a sweet sixteen when this film was made. The vast difference between her age and Chaney's made Chaney's character all the more pitiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rather dated play by David Belasco serves as the basis for Laugh Clown Laugh which is saved today by Lon Chaney's incredible performance as a clown in love. Chaney brings some incredible pathos to the role of a performing clown who falls in love with a young girl he took in as an orphan. The child grows up to be Loretta Young who is given little to do but look pretty and fetching.Knowing that this was Belasco who wrote this and knowing the type of audience and era that he wrote for I was wondering if he might have gotten the inspiration for the story from Grover Cleveland and his wife Frances Folsom. Frances was around 10 years old when her father was killed in a carriage accident. Oscar Folsom's estate was handled by his law partner Cleveland and Grover helped raise the child and when she came of age married her. There were a few whispers about that back in the day. Of course it turns out better for them than it did for Chaney.Chaney and partner Bernard Siegel were a pair of itinerant traveling performer clowns when they take in this orphan girl. Loretta is an innocent and Chaney's kept her that way. But one day looking for a rose to put in her hair she gets caught on the barbed wire fence protecting the garden of count Nils Asther. I have to say when I first saw Asther with that rakish monocle I thought for sure we've got ourselves a Snidely Whiplash villain. However it turns out he's got more character than on first impression. But the film truly belongs to Chaney who even away from his horror films and through clown makeup can register so many emotions. Look at his eyes his closeups really tell all.The story is dated and old fashioned and hardly likely to be remade today. But it shouldn't no one could top Chaney and what he did here.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Laugh Clown Laugh' was Lon Chaney's favourite of his own films according to Robert Gordon Anderson's 1971 Chaney bio. As Tito Beppi an Italian clown who adopts a foundling Lon Chaney pulls the stops out playing a wide range of emotions even legitimately overacting as a circus clown. He also adds an elaborate Augustestyle clown whiteface to his gallery of 1000 faces. And it didn't hurt that 'Laugh Clown Laugh' had a hit song in 1928. Yes silent movies sometimes had hit songs published as song sheets to accompany the film these were performed by pit musicians in firstrun cinemas.I screened an acetate print of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' duplicated from a nitrate vault print missing Reel Four. This explains why Chaney's clown partner Bernard Siegel excellent! walks out of Chaney's life in Reel Three but is back for the climax their reconciliation is in Reel Four. Also missing is a sequence filmed but possibly never used in which teenage Loretta Young dons a pageboy's 'Buttons' uniform.In early scenes with the infant foundling Lon Chaney portrays a man younger than himself here his makeup softens his features his hair is dyed black and his bald spot is thatched over. The action jumps ahead about 15 years Chaney appropriately greys and thins his hair while adding wrinkles. The action moves ahead three more years Chaney ages more than that in the interim but his character is under great strain.I had mixed feelings about one sequence Chaney's character visits a doctor's surgery complaining of depression. The doctor tells him to attend a performance of the circus clown Flik whose sawdust antics can cure anyone's melancholy. Chaney sadly replies that this advice cannot help him he IS Flik! For me coming from a background of British and European showbiz this moment was unimpressive because I recognised its origin this story was first told about the English clown Joseph Grimaldi 17781837 and later told about Grock a Swiss clown who was still performing when 'Laugh Clown Laugh' was in production in 1928 Grock was the world's highestpaid circus performer. 'Laugh Clown Laugh' is apparently set in the contemporary present Loretta Young wears some cloche hats and other 1928 fashions and Nils Asther wears a wristwatch. These were considered effeminate until after World War One.Chaney often played madmen or characters beyond the brink of madness. In 'Laugh Clown Laugh' he plays a man who questions his own sanity yet he retains our sympathy. In one shot Chaney's face contorts into rage ... and for an instant I saw some of his earlier villainous roles. This is possibly Chaney's only misstep in an otherwise noteperfect role that deserved an Academy Award.Loretta Young barely over age 14 here is a seasoned pro winsome in her early scenes as a girl her own age then becoming a demure young lady in the scenes three years on. Several of Lon Chaney's MGM films 'The Big City' 'The Black Bird' and 'While the City Sleeps' cast him as a man with romantic designs on a girl young enough to be his daughter. Chaney had no such penchant in real life. Here he raises foundling Loretta from birth then finds himself wanting to pitch woo to her in her teen years ... but this time the girl by adoption really IS his daughter! This was the only aspect of Chaney's portrayal which I disliked.It's wellknown that some silentfilm actors' careers were ruined by the coming of sound. Less wellknown is that some directors' careers suffered as well. Herbert Brenon who reportedly bullied Young during this production was a major silentfilm director whose career plummeted rapidly in talkies. Brenon's films had a slight unreality about them which worked well in fantasies his bestknown film is 'Peter Pan' or in dramas with a theatrical background such as 'Laugh Clown Laugh'.The film benefits from MGM's top production values. Only two details rang false a nurse in Italy wears an American nurse's uniform and I have difficulty believing that even in 1928 before megatort lawsuits a tightrope performer would perform directly above his audience without a safety net.In 'The Black Bird' Lon Chaney who never visited Britain or Europe expertly depicted a thief from London's Limehouse district. Chaney employed the hand gestures and body language of an authentic London costermonger I don't know where he observed these gestures from an expat in Los Angeles? but his portrayal convinced me that he was a genuine Londoner. In 'Laugh Clown Laugh' playing an Italian peasant Chaney uses authentic Italian gestures and body language without going into 'mama mia!' exaggerations. Bravo Lon!SLIGHT SPOILERS. At the climax of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' there's a brilliantly lyrical image. On the stage of an empty theatre Chaney's demented clown hears the absent orchestra and the audience applauding. This being a silent film we SEE musicians' instruments and applauding hands superimposed over Chaney's whiteface Auguste makeup. This beautiful and evocative visual device would have worked just as well in a talkie film but I suspect that  if Chaney had lived long enough to film this story as a sound movie  the image would have been omitted in favour of a straightforward auditory hallucination on the soundtrack. Compare the very similar climactic sequence in 'Stage Door' 1937 where Andrea Leeds plays a deluded actress who imagines herself preparing to go onstage while she commits suicide in that film the delusion is confined to the soundtrack and it's not nearly so effective. As usual when a silent film and a talkie depict similar events the silent version does it better. Film is after all primarily a visual medium.Despite my nitpicks 'Laugh Clown Laugh' is a masterpiece which works even with a reel missing and Chaney's performance is a triumph possibly his greatest role surpassing even the Phantom of the Opera. My rating for 'Laugh Clown Laugh' a solid 10 out of 10.".

Years pass and this child Simonetta grows into a radiant teenager Loretta Young. Although Beppi is significantly older than her he is hopelessly in love with herso much so that he becomes depresseda serious problem for a professional clown! At the same time a handsome young playboy Count has contracted a strange disease that only occurs in movies. He finds himself laughing uncontrollably all the timesort of the opposite of Beppi who is always depressed and on the verge of tears.Beppi and the Count have never met but go to the exact same doctor one after the other. And this doctor appears to be a psychic or witchdoctor as he immediately pulls diagnoses out of his....hat. He tells Beppi that his depression is due to his suppressing himselfhe needs to open up and deal with the thing that is depressing him yet the doc just met him and somehow instantly knows this. The meeting with the doctor and the Count is very strange as the doctor tells the Count his laughing uncontrollably all the time is occurring because he needs to met a nice lady to marry and give up his wild lifestyle! Again the doctor just seemed to know thislike the guy was magic!! None of this made any sense and talk about contrived!! At the doctor's office Beppi and the Count meet and become friends. However eventually they both realize that the cause or solution to their problems is Simonetta. How will all this be worked out by the end of the film? Both men desperately want Simonetta yet unless they decide on a REALLY strange relationship and in 1928 this was NOT happening then at least one of the two men will be cursed to remain afflictedand miserable. Watch the film yourself to see how it all resolves itself.There are lots of positives about this film though clearly the plot makes very little senseespecially this visit to the bizarre doctor! It's obvious that MGM pulled out the stops for this film. The production values are very good the nation was blanketed with advertisements and promotional tieins I have a copy of the sheet music from the filmthe songs written for the film were quite the rage in 1928. Also some of the acting was fantastic. Lon Chaney was never better and Loretta Young was amazing considering she was only 14 when the movie was being made! Her being able to carry off her part without the film seeming creepy or hard to believe was quite an accomplishment.Overall the film looks great and there's a lot to enjoy. If only they'd eliminated the silly notion of a man with a laughing disease that can only be cured by marriage AND the doctor didn't magically have psychic insights into everyone's problemsthen it could have been an exceptional film.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of romantic rivalry in this Lon Chaney feature is one of the simplest and most common ideas to be found in the movies but the setting and characters make it interesting and Chaney himself gets an excellent role that allows him to demonstrate his wide variety of skills. Despite the familiarity of the idea it is hard not to be moved and saddened by the time that the movie ends.The movie starts with two professional clowns played by Chaney and Bernard Siegel bringing up a foundling while their act becomes more and more successful. When the young woman is a teenager Chaney's character and a dissolute count played by Nils Asther both fall deeply in love with her. The setup gives Chaney a wide range of dramatic material numerous opportunities for his skillful makeup and costumes and even the chance to do some comedy bits in the occasional scenes of his character performing.Loretta Young has a very good presence in her role for someone who was only 14 or 15 at the time it was filmed and she works well with both of the suitors establishing different and believable relationships with the older protective Tito and the young easygoing Luigi. Asther also does well in a role that is well suited to him.Chaney himself fills his character with depth and emotion and as the climax draws near it is almost impossible not to feel his inner distress as he agonizes over what to do making the finale quite effective. Certainly this lacks the complexity of many of Chaney's masterpieces but it succeeds well in what it sets out to do.".

Lon Chaney plays Tito also known as Flik the clown who finds an abandoned child takes her in and raises her as his own. When the child Simonetta played by Loretta Young reaches young womanhood Flik finds his fatherly love for the child transformed into romantic interest. Simonetta however is in love with a young baron who is also smitten with her. This triangle leads to the familiar story of the clown who can make others laugh while he is miserable.Though  a few key sequences are lost the restoration fills in the gaps by narrating the sequences on the commentary track. Though the acting style is of the dated silent film variety the story somehow seems fresh and though only 14 years old at the time Loretta Young looks grown up and believable as the object of desire for two men. Lon Chaney is outstanding as Tito. He is completely convincing. In one scene he goes to a therapist to help him with his ennui. The therapist suggests Tito sees Flik the clown saying the clown can make anyone laugh. When it's revealed that the patient is actually the entertainer it's heartbreaking. The ending which I won't reveal though opera fans everywhere already know it make this one a must see'".

They find an abandoned young girl and Tito Lon Chaney decides to raise her with the show.  Simonetta Loretta Young grows up and falls for a rich guys who helps her one day and they're married.  This saddens Tito who himself has fallen for Simonetta.  That's the part that disturbs me the most.  Not only is Tito 30 years older but he was the one who raised her.  It turned me off a bit.  Apparently there is an alternate ending that was filmed for this movie that no longer exists.  I heard that this was common and the theater could choose which ending to show it's patrons.  Based on the rest of the tone of this movie I think the current ending is the better one. There were a couple serious stunts in this movie and I'm not sure if Lon Chaney did his own stunts but I was impressed.  I was lucky to see this with the musical score composed by H. Scott Salinas in 2002.  It was excellent and matched the film well.  This may not be one of the great silent films but I am glad I was able to catch this rarely seen gem on TCM Turner Classic Movies. out of 4".

It starts out very sweetly with Lon Chaney Tito and pal Simon as traveling circus clowns in Italy. Chaney discovers an abandoned little girl and decides to raise her as his own daughter despite his partner's objections. To win Simon over he names the girl Simonetta.Years later Simonetta has grown into quite a beautiful young woman. After she gets dolled up to join the act as a tightrope walker Chaney feels something stirring inside that makes him feel rather uncomfortable. It made us feel uncomfortable too. Shades of Woody Allen! He's old and basically her father. Double ick factor.More times passes and Chaney falls into depression due to his unrequited love for Simonetta. He's the clown who cannot laugh. And then she gets involved with someone else  Luigi a rich count who can't stop laughing. On the one hand you want to feel for Chaney he was quite likable in the beginning but certainly not for his situation.Chaney gives an excellent performance and speaks volumes with his his face alone. He's much more understated here than films made just a few years earlier such as Phantom of the Opera. You also to see what he really looked like at the beginning anyway  his old age makeup is excellent. I certainly would have rated this film higher were it not for the double ick factor.The ending while semitragic seems to be missing something. There is a lost reel and I'm wondering if that's where it went. There's no followup with Simonetta.".

The best clown humor he could muster was to don a footlong dildonose and stroke a stuffed chicken a cock?. Maybe the studio should have hired a director who knew something about clowns or hired a clown coach to help Chaney come up with some funny bits. There needed to be some real humor to contrast with the tragic bits and there wasn't.The tragic love story part was ageold but fairly interesting in a pseudoincestuous kind of way. It reminded me a little of one of the installments of Kieslowski's Dekalog and also a little of Fellini's Variety Lights. Chaney was generally better when he was out of makeup. And Loretta YoungI can't believe she was 15 when this was filmed. Jeez talk about precocious. I feel dirty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five soldiers are sent to map out a Japanese held island during WWII. Friction erupts when it turns out that one of the men is blackThe years 1949 50  51 witnessed a spate of social conscience movies before the McCarthyiteHUAC purges put an end to them. Unfortunately this is one of the more obscure. So far as I know the movie's rarely been revived in fact I had to order a DVD decades after first viewing. Still the film's many moments of sheer rawness have stayed with me over time.In my book the 90minutes is not a complete success. I still have trouble with the psychiatrist's Corey facile analysis of Moss's Edwards problem following island combat. It's much too pat and selfassured to be convincing more like a happy ending contrivance. Yet this Hollywood moment is more than offset by the racially charged atmosphere of the remainder. Note for example how the three men react to Moss on his first arrival which sets the racial stage for what follows. Finch Bridges embraces his old friend Mingo Lovejoy is understandably dubious while racist TJ Brodie snubs the black man. Given Mingo's doubts understandable given the intimate nature of the mission that now includes a racial outsider it's really his ambivalence on which the plot pivots. Lovejoy's lowkey performance makes Mingo easy to overlook. Yet it's really Mingo's trajectory that delivers the movie's ultimate message. I'm with those who think Lovejoy steals the movie in his own mild way.But get a load of that jungle. It's creepy enough to suck the air out of a dirigible. Anyone like Finch who goes into that maw shouldn't expect to come out. At this point in his career Bridges was one of the most interesting actors around. Always virile and athletic he's a nice guy here. Yet catch him in the noir classic The Sound of Fury 1950. There he's egotistical and meanspirited in totally convincing fashion. Too bad the bulk of his later career following communist allegations was spent within the confines of serial TV.Of course the movie's mainly remembered for James Edwards' role as a young dignified black man. I think we'd have to go back to Paul Robeson in the 1930's to find a similar blackman persona. Unfortunately AfricanAmericans were consigned to buffoonish or menial roles during the period. But here Edwards presents a movie star appearance in a difficult role. His Peter Moss is proud and dignified one moment yet confused and vulnerable the next. All of which befits an educated outsider in uncertain surroundings. Clearly there's a laudable effort to deal with the effects racism has on a victim's internal dynamics. Thus the narrative was an unusual Hollywood attempt at racial honesty but one that was unfortunately cut short after all the US couldn't fight a cold war by airing its dirty linen to the world. Anyway thanks reviewer CeOTIS for filling in some facts about Edwards. Clearly he was suited for Poitier or Belafonte type roles but I guess his associations with lefties consigned him to the fringes. A genuine loss.The movie itself manages to rivet interest despite its stage origins. The few sets are confining. Still that has the effect of concentrating the drama. Plus the fact that we never see the enemy lends an even more unsettling atmosphere. The sudden use of the epithet 'nigger' is jolting to contemporary ears. And especially so when the easygoing Finch under pressure begins to mouth the word. Then we get an idea of how embedded skin color is in the general culture. Seems to me however some latitude should be granted to the lack of combat realism that other reviewers use to criticize. After all the movie's not really a war movie. Instead it's a social conscience film using wartime conditions to illuminate conditions at home. Note however that the script lays the blame for race prejudice on the individual that is unless I missed something. That way more explosive topics like politics or the economy are finessed.Anyway viewers who appreciate this film should catch up with other racial films of that pregnant period. Let me recommendIntruder in the Dust 1950 Lost Boundaries 1949 The Well 1951 No Way Out 1950 and Pinky 1949. Despite isolated exceptions like The Defiant Ones 1958 movies would have to wait another 20years before the issues would again be taken up in sustained fashion. Nonetheless the human drama here has lost little of its power over the intervening decades. A tribute I think to all those involved.".

Jeff Corey was the Doctor psychiatristwho helped James Edwards overcome the difficulties of war and of course of being black. Corey is recognized as one of the greatest character actors in the history of stage and screen. Check his filmography. It was a landmark scene and performance by both Corey and Edwards. In the 50s Corey was black balled by the House Unamerican Activities Commitee. HUAC. Because he would not name actors sympathetic to the Communists. Many actors did squeal to save there own careers but not Corey he laughed at them. Did not work in Hollywood for 12 or more years. He became an acting teacher for the likes of Jack Nicholson Barbara Streisand Cher and many others. Those three won academy awards. May he rest in peace he left us in 2002. Corey has an outstanding website check it out here is the URL address... jeffcorey.com..... James Edwards filmography is full of great performances down through the years.An outstanding filmography by a pioneering actor who never received the recognition he deserved. One year in the 70s I was involved with a cable TV station in San Diegowe produced the La Costa celebrity tennis tournament. Lloyd Bridges was there and I walked up to him and said Thank You for your performance in Home of The Brave he was so startled and said to me when did you see it? I replied when I was 11 years old my mother took me to see it. She said it was an important film and it was time to know about the freedom this movie is trying to portray. He said to me thank you very much you made my day in fact my whole month. Thank You. It is nice to know that these great actors who made this film a landmark in cinema were revered by so many. Most are gone now but their performances are preserved in the great history of film. See this movie buy the VHS on the internet show it to others and you become part of movie history too. Thank You.

Both quotes refer directly to the poem written by Mingo's wife in the first he makes an aside referring to his wife's love of repetition which refers to the repetition in the poem Mingo recited earlier the second quote made by Mingo is a direct quote from his wife's poem.

	schema:headline " Landmark film about military racism and redemption in World War II";
	schema:reviewBody "When this film was released in 1949 it was light years ahead of its time. In its depiction of racial prejudice and bigotry among American soldiers fighting in the South Pacific during World War II it pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. Most of the film is shown in flashback as a U.S. Army psychiatrist with the rank of CaptainJEFF COREY attempts to uncover the reason why a young soldier who volunteered for hazardous duty and suffered no physical wound returns from that mission unable to walk. The storyline concerns a group of four American soldiers who volunteer for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. Their mission is to scout a Japaneseheld island and draw maps of the terrain that would be needed for a future amphibious invasion. One of the soldiers is a Negro private named Peter MossJAMES EDWARDS. When he reports to the commanding officer a Major Robinson the Major is obviously taken aback at whom his superior sent him to be a part of the team. Robinson calls the Colonel thinking a mistake must have been made. He references Moss's color and the Colonel in effect tells Robinson in so many words that he doesn't care if Moss is purple with pink polka dots. He has a technical skill that's needed for the mission and he the Major is to utilize him accordingly. Moss joins the unit and upon meeting the other volunteers recognizes one as a former friend and fellow highschool basketball player from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania named FinchLLOYD BRIDGES. The other two team members are Corporal EverettSTEVE BRODIE and the noncommissioned officer in charge of the squad Sergeant MingoFRANK LOVEJOY. Cpl. Everett is a blatant out and out racist who doesn't hide his prejudice about Negroes. And when they land on the enemy island this leads to discord and conflict among the men in turn jeopardizing the integrity of the mission. They complete the mission however but not before Sgt. Mingo gets hit in the arm by a Japanese sniper. Moss shoots the sniper and the men head back to the beach where they hid their dinghy. Finch realizes he inadvertently left his map case back in the jungle and tells Moss he's going back for it. Moss knowing that the Japanese are closing in tries to talk Finch out of going back. Finch realizes the whole mission will be in vain if they don't get the map case back. When Moss tries to prevail further upon his friend Finch calls him a yellowbellied nr. Finch finds the map case and gets wounded by a Japanese sniper. Moss doesn't want to leave him but Finch tells him to get the maps back to headquarters. Moss abandons his buddy and rejoins the group on the beach. They sit helplessly as they hear Finch being tortured to death by the Japanese soldiers. Moss subsequently goes back for Finch and finds the mutilated body of his dead friend. He cradles Finch in his arms and Cpl. Everett comes up and tells Moss that the recovery vessel is coming to pick them up. Moss doesn't want to leave his friend. Everett orders him to move out and when Moss tries to get up he finds his legs paralyzed. Everett asks if he was shot and Moss replies no. Everett slings him over his shoulder and carries him back to the beach. As Moss relates what happened on the island under druginduced hypnosis the Captain a sensitive and intelligent manrealizes what Moss's problem is. Since there was no physical reason for Moss' paralysis the Doctor realized it had to be psychosomatic. He asks Moss what he felt when he saw his friend get shot and gets him to admit that he was glad it was Finch who got it and not him. This set up survivor's guilt. The Captain tells him that every soldier who sees a buddy get wounded or killed in combat feels the exact same way he's glad the other guy got it and not him.

This is a hardhitting film with excellent performances that dealt with a controversial topic in an intelligent and sensitive manner. I give it a 10 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "When this film was released in 1949 it was light years ahead of its time. In its depiction of racial prejudice and bigotry among American soldiers fighting in the South Pacific during World War II it pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. Most of the film is shown in flashback as a U.S. Army psychiatrist with the rank of CaptainJEFF COREY attempts to uncover the reason why a young soldier who volunteered for hazardous duty and suffered no physical wound returns from that mission unable to walk. The storyline concerns a group of four American soldiers who volunteer for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines. Their mission is to scout a Japaneseheld island and draw maps of the terrain that would be needed for a future amphibious invasion. One of the soldiers is a Negro private named Peter MossJAMES EDWARDS. When he reports to the commanding officer a Major Robinson the Major is obviously taken aback at whom his superior sent him to be a part of the team. Robinson calls the Colonel thinking a mistake must have been made. He references Moss's color and the Colonel in effect tells Robinson in so many words that he doesn't care if Moss is purple with pink polka dots. He has a technical skill that's needed for the mission and he the Major is to utilize him accordingly. Moss joins the unit and upon meeting the other volunteers recognizes one as a former friend and fellow highschool basketball player from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania named FinchLLOYD BRIDGES. The other two team members are Corporal EverettSTEVE BRODIE and the noncommissioned officer in charge of the squad Sergeant MingoFRANK LOVEJOY. Cpl. Everett is a blatant out and out racist who doesn't hide his prejudice about Negroes. And when they land on the enemy island this leads to discord and conflict among the men in turn jeopardizing the integrity of the mission. They complete the mission however but not before Sgt. Mingo gets hit in the arm by a Japanese sniper. Moss shoots the sniper and the men head back to the beach where they hid their dinghy. Finch realizes he inadvertently left his map case back in the jungle and tells Moss he's going back for it. Moss knowing that the Japanese are closing in tries to talk Finch out of going back. Finch realizes the whole mission will be in vain if they don't get the map case back. When Moss tries to prevail further upon his friend Finch calls him a yellowbellied nr. Finch finds the map case and gets wounded by a Japanese sniper. Moss doesn't want to leave him but Finch tells him to get the maps back to headquarters. Moss abandons his buddy and rejoins the group on the beach. They sit helplessly as they hear Finch being tortured to death by the Japanese soldiers. Moss subsequently goes back for Finch and finds the mutilated body of his dead friend. He cradles Finch in his arms and Cpl. Everett comes up and tells Moss that the recovery vessel is coming to pick them up. Moss doesn't want to leave his friend. Everett orders him to move out and when Moss tries to get up he finds his legs paralyzed. Everett asks if he was shot and Moss replies no. Everett slings him over his shoulder and carries him back to the beach. As Moss relates what happened on the island under druginduced hypnosis the Captain a sensitive and intelligent manrealizes what Moss's problem is. Since there was no physical reason for Moss' paralysis the Doctor realized it had to be psychosomatic. He asks Moss what he felt when he saw his friend get shot and gets him to admit that he was glad it was Finch who got it and not him. This set up survivor's guilt. The Captain tells him that every soldier who sees a buddy get wounded or killed in combat feels the exact same way he's glad the other guy got it and not him. He also tells Moss that if he couldn't walk then he couldn't leave his friend. And that his mind made it happen. His mind made it possible for him not to leave. Moss attempts to understand what the Doctor is telling him but it doesn't help when he tries to stand up and walk. The Doctor realizes he has to change his tack and adopts a more authoritarian tone with Moss ordering him to get up and walk. Moss tries but can't. The Doctor now realizes he has to go for Moss where he's the most vulnerable his sensitivity to prejudice and hatred. He moves back to put some distance between them and says something that brings Moss to his feet and propels him forward toward the Doctor. Moss realizes that he's walking and realizes what the Doctor did to get him to walk. He falls into the Captain's arms and they embrace. This is a hardhitting film with excellent performances that dealt with a controversial topic in an intelligent and sensitive manner. I give it a 10 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Home of the Brave was originally a play. And like usually happens the play is changed a bit for the movie. In this case the character of Private Moss was originally a Jew but for the film he was made into a black man. Why? Well the director Stanley Kramer was aware that a black guy would be a lot more obviously different. Additionally with the film Gentleman's Agreement already addressing antisemitism Kramer thought it would be more interesting and original to make the issue all about race instead.When the film begins a group of soldiers are recruited for a mission in the Pacific during WWII. Oddly one of the volunteers is a black man. I say oddly because blacks were still segregated from whites this didn't change until a presidential order in 1948. Regardless the story jumps from this scene to well after...when Private Moss James Edwards is in a psychiatrist's office. It seems that Moss cracked up during the mission and the Doctor is working to uncover it using hypnosis and drugs to work through the soldier's PTSD and conversion disorder. What is a conversion disorder and how does it all play into the film? See it and find out for yourself.It was interesting that before the film was shown on Turner Classic Movies that the host apologized for the language in the film. What this meant was the blunt racial epithets which were very necessary in order to address the racial bigotry in the plot. It's not a movie for the ultra politically correct...but thank goodness they haven't edited the film to make it more acceptable. Prejudice is ugly...and I like that it's presented in all its ugliness. A very good film...and a brave one for the time in which it was made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Home Of The Brave was one of the first films to tackle racism in the USA and it was released at a time when the nation's consciousness was changing direction. The film first and foremost spoke to the black American veterans who after fighting to liberate the world from Fascist tyranny were not about to accept second class citizenry any longer.But a lot of veterans were scarred by the war physically and mentally. One such was James Edwards who after a mission with a picked team to do reconnaissance on a Pacific island primed for invasion came back with hysterical paralysis. The story of what happened is told in flashback where army psychiatrist Jeff Corey pulls the truth from his mind.The bulk of the film is spent on Edwards's memories of the mission. The team is led by Major Douglas Dick who has a lot of self doubts about himself. Rumors have it he's too young for the rank. Dick will prove them wrong. The others besides Edwards are Lloyd Bridges Frank Lovejoy and Steve Brodie. Bridges is one whom he had known before the war both were in college and played basketball there.Edwards is a surveyorengineer and the essential man here. Remember the army was not integrated until after World War II so for a black man in this group it was unheard of. That should tell you how essential he was. Nevertheless the attitudes of those around him run the gamut of racial feelings in post World War II America. There's action in this film but it's a character study and was a play on Broadway that ran only 69 performances in 194546 Broadway. I will say the stage origin was for the most part masked over well.Home Of The Brave came to the attention of those guardians of our patriotic virtue at the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Writer Carl Foreman and Jeff Corey got themselves blacklisted. Corey's hopeful speech about better race relations in America coming must have gotten those old Southern rednecks' collars flaming.After almost 70 years Home Of The Brave is still an outstanding film with a great ensemble cast and a powerful message.".

	schema:reviewBody "The psychological issues of racism are felt from both sides with this magnificent issue drama from the golden age of Hollywood when films such as Gentlemen's Agreement Crossfire The Snake Pit The Lost Weekend and The Lady Gambles went deep into the issues of the human soul to explain to their audiences why people encounter such problems as racism addiction and mental illness while others do not. In the case of this World War II drama the story surrounds the four soldiers and young officer sent to a Pacific island on a secret mission to navigate an island where the Japanese have set up a secret base. One of the soldiers James Edwards happens to be black and this sets up racial tension as the remaining soldiers and officer are all white. Fortunately one of the other soldiers Lloyd Bridges is an old friend of Edwards from high school so he does have an instant ally. However tensions mount as the mission comes to a close. Revelations about everybody's own individual racisms including Edwards' is revealed leading to Edwards' own mental breakdown and psychiatrist Jeff Corey's efforts to help him break through the sudden inability to walk and to determine what caused the breakdown in the first place. Certainly the issues of racism is a tale as old as the first civilizations and this doesn't pretend to be an anecdote to the problem. But if the viewer can look within themselves to realize the issues behind their own feelings of racism then the film has accomplished its mission. It is pretty obvious that the racial tensions are two sided that some of the men including Edwards are torn between their longinstilled prejudices and what is right and wrong. Having been called a monkey as a kid when confronted on the school playground by white children Edwards has internalized his hatred towards whites even if he is outwardly polite and almost subservient. He also shows a longing for white acceptance as seen through the flashback of him and Bridges in school and his sudden decision not to attend a party of white kids that Bridges had invited him to. But in the case of officer Douglas Dick and fellow soldiers Frank Lovejoy and Steve Brodie he gets a mixed reaction although a certain level of camaraderie between all four soldiers does exist.The performance of James Edwards is the glue which holds this emotionally heartwrenching drama together. He is in one moment calm and dignified the next almost childlike and after that extremely angry although unlike the white soldiers he never becomes violent. When tragedy strikes his childlike fear comes out revealing all his insecurities and innermost struggles and desires. While he never made it onto the front lines of movie stardom like Sidney Poitier he still holds up in the handful of films I have seen him in being likable sincere intense and intelligent. Bridges too gives a topnotch performance so for all those who know him from the Airplane and Hot Shots comedies will be surprised to see him in such a dramatic role. But then again he also had major dramatic parts in many films and T.V. shows including High Noon and Roots and was also touchingly sincere as Harry Helmsley opposite Suzanne Pleshette as Leona in The Queen of Mean. Of the five remaining men Douglas Dick's captain is perhaps the least well defined. Frank Lovejoy is the older and wiser top sergeant who is perhaps the most open to changing his tune while Steve Brodie is a man filled with such inner hatreds that you can't help but realize his hatred towards blacks is more representational of his own insecurities than his feelings towards other races colors and creeds. Neither man is outwardly cruel to Edwards although references to negative black stereotypes does show its face in a passiveaggressive lighthearted manner that can be just as hateful as a slap in the face. You realize that the racism they feel is more from conditioning and that as individuals both Lovejoy and Brodie will learn something about humanity and thus themselves even if at least in Brodie's case he won't totally change his tune.The screenplay doesn't strive to sweeten the tension even going so far as to use the n word under several circumstances one accidentally coming from Bridges himself who in the midst of saying it suddenly changes the word to nitwit. Other derogatory terms describing both blacks and whites and the nearby Japanese are also used giving the film a very brave medal of honor for tackling one of the past centuries hot topics. Playwright Arthur Laurents would tackle similar issues in other plays even his musical book of West Side Story has like themes and Carl Foreman adapts the play into a 90 minute running time which never defuses the issues. As produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by Mark Robson two of the most influential filmmakers of the 1940's and 50's this is truly intense social drama. Society has demanded that the races come together to talk about ways of improving racial tensions and if this can help open up people's hearts to seeing this issue from a different angle then it does indeed remain a very important play and movie some 60 years later.".

His deeply troubled condition is made more complex because of his witnessing the death of his white high school friend Lloyd Bridges which he blames on himself.THE ARMY PSYCHIATRIST Jeff Cory is charged with helping the deeply emotionally scarred veteran to find his way back through the heavy feelings of guilt. In flashback the story is revealed to us the audience.IN SHORT THE afflicted soldier had been raised as one of the few Blacks in a small town.

The whole point and morale the story is the same that being religious racial or ethnic prejudice are wrong and harmful to both the victim and the offender.IN SHORT THIS is the story of one Private Peter Moss a Black Soldier James Edwards who requires psychiatric help following his service in World War II Pacific Theatre of Operations. His deeply troubled condition is made more complex because of his witnessing the death of his white high school friend Lloyd Bridges which he blames on himself.THE ARMY PSYCHIATRIST Jeff Cory is charged with helping the deeply emotionally scarred veteran to find his way back through the heavy feelings of guilt.

Not knowing anything of the film nor of the incident that led to the final atrocity I was kept riveted after the first half hour since the often chequered and frustrated direction of the account often leaves the conclusion in doubt and one hoping the worst will be thwarted at the last moment.When 32 of a company of marching German soldiers are wiped out by a small bunch of Italian underground in a wet deserted street which results in a furious local CommandantMcKern demanding immediate and exaggerated retaliation but is reminded by his subordinateR Burton that with the Americans beating at the city gates he lacked the proper authorityit being more politically prudent to go through channels. Burton has a tenuous understanding with a local priest Fr AntonelliMastroianniwho represents the large Christian population  the Vatican who gets personally involved in a struggle to cool what becomes a strategic battle between the various ranking officials who refuse permission or don't wish to know his pleading  reasoning with Burton as one born to obey orders and caught in the middle of a thankless and unwanted military situation is ordered to compile a reduced list of hostages and then arrange the execution squad. It is a matter of history that Pope Piusruler of the Vatican  representative of everything Catholicism stood for if not a collaborator with the Nazis was at least partisan so Fr Antonelli finding the hostage situation finally becoming a growing reality desperately seeks his intervention to prevent the accelerating executions only to be met with a polite  devious refusal. There are a few moments of amusement in watching the growing frustrating of McKern repeatedly defeated by ranking responses to his demands but the suspense is held until the point where Burton rigid to his code rebukes the inevitable damnation of his soul in openly defying Fr Antonelli  as a man out on his own stonefacedly proceeds with his final solution without official knowledge of the civil authority. How the final contrived business is planned with the utmost secrecy and perpetrated even to the extent of destroying all evidence of the atrocity and the grimdetails of every last moment takes a pretty strong stomach.....the notorious sequence from Kubrick's Paths of Glory springs to mind. One final nasty shock remains for Burton who has promised the priest he will fire the first shot. The whole business like Lidice is historical truth... Hitler clearly saw the assassination of one high ranking official significant enough to wipe out an entire village  its population the significance here was a mere 30 odd footsloggers of minor importance. One point did bother me about why these officials really cared about protocol and did not simply go out  seize the first unwitting hostages they found and not stand on ceremony about details. But this is a true story we are told.A few old faces like Anthony Steel  Peter Vaughan pop up briefly whilst the acting is generally quite acceptable with Burton almost as stone faced and cold as in Villain . What was his reason for taking so unsympathetic a part? Nevertheless as one reviewer has remarked it has the look of a cheap production and a good deal is shot in semidarkness. Definitely not for children under 14!The crumbs of comfort come with the closing credits when we are audibly reminded of the War Trials' sentences of death or imprisonment for these men Only Kesselring got off lightly as the top authority to issue the proper orders. Fr Antonelli finally demonstrated the bravery of Sidney Carton in his horror of this massacre in Rome.".

In a supporting role you can notice Mme. Sandrelli's daughter from Brass' THE KEY here 10 yrs before that role of cheated wife.Burton the jaded officer and Mastroianni the courageous priest have several scenes together. Some more knowledgeable say that the gloomy and bored morose Nazi is downplayed depicted as a nicer and more approachable guy than he ever really was while the priest is boosted.See the priest going into the clerical palaces of Vatican with their ostentatious display of luxe ....'You will be called to account before the tribunal of God.' Yet Burton was not easygoing with scripts he didn't like. On the other hand though during the '70s and of course also the '80s as long as he was alive his career reached an unconceivable degree of misery and deprecation Burton another of the humiliated great actors sort of like Harris O'Toole Finlay Stamp Rourke becoming a sort of B actor and he was unfortunately not the guy to rescue a movie or a script he mainly let it sink.An average WW 2 drama badly written rhetorical tendentious directed by a hack yet interesting MASSACRE IN ROME has the advantage of a firstclass cast. Go see Mastroianni in a frock and Burton in his Nazi outfit.I presume that so many asked so much from Pope Pius the 12th because so many were in fact expecting so much from the Christ' vicar this is the only way of making sense of so many exigencies.".

People reviewing it and commenting on it's 'speed' or 'dryness' have obviously not taken into consideration that this movie is by now 33 years old  an era wherein the fastflashingquicklychanging scenes run for victory. Phew! Everything coincided in this film. The matter was displayed in a pure and open way and it gives the viewer an upclose look at the then situation from both sides. It was heartbreaking realistic. No heroism. Not Hollywood. A plain great movie about the occupation of Rome.Another thing that struck me was the appearance of the personage of Kappler. Although played by two completely different people Kappler could be easily recognized. Played by Christopher Plummer in The Scarlet and the Black the figure of Kappler leaves a vivid memory in the mind after watching both movies. Where The Scarlet and the Black focused on position of the Vatican and it's priests this movie turns that around. Historically accurate incomprehensible when it comes to army hierarchies leaving the viewer behind with hisher thoughts thoughts about an episode of the second world war  when it's not being read.Burton performs sublime.".

People reviewing it and commenting on it's 'speed' or 'dryness' have obviously not taken into consideration that this movie is by now 33 years old  an era wherein the fastflashingquicklychanging scenes run for victory. Phew! Everything coincided in this film. The matter was displayed in a pure and open way and it gives the viewer an upclose look at the then situation from both sides. It was heartbreaking realistic. No heroism. Not Hollywood. A plain great movie about the occupation of Rome.Another thing that struck me was the appearance of the personage of Kappler. Although played by two completely different people Kappler could be easily recognized. Played by Christopher Plummer in The Scarlet and the Black the figure of Kappler leaves a vivid memory in the mind after watching both movies. Where The Scarlet and the Black focused on position of the Vatican and it's priests this movie turns that around. Historically accurate incomprehensible when it comes to army hierarchies leaving the viewer behind with hisher thoughts thoughts about an episode of the second world war  when it's not being read.Burton performs sublime.";

It has many assets. It is as I said an excellent movie.It is flawed in story telling though. It's difficult to watch without yawning. True Burton is a great actor but he excels in boredom. He could make Star Wars or Lord of the Rings a snoozefest. He would have been the greatest hypnotist of all time if he wanted to.But that's Burton. And I don't mean to put him down. It's his style. He portrays his characters perfectly perhaps too perfectly with all their boring attributes.The pace of the film is off. When it should be fast it lulls into Shakespearean style dialog. When it should slow down to let us know what is happening it blurts out with confusing cutaways that we cannot follow without a program.Still in the overall analysis the magnitude of the story including its factual nature far outweighs the nitpicks against it.This isn't an exciting movie and the director makes no attempt to make it exciting so you do have to trudge through it but it is very intelligent.

When a group of local partisans successfully manage to ambush a Nazi platoon and kill a number of soldiers the Nazi powers decide to retaliate by executing ten Italians for every soldier killed. It sounds like a powerful intriguing story and it is but I can't help wonder whether it would have worked better as a documentary.There's tension in the film but it's limited to brief interludes as we follow the resistance fighters planning to blow up the Nazi march. Unfortunately in between these affecting moments are lengthy dialogue sequences between the Nazi officials sequences which add little to the production. There's plenty of attempts to humanise the historical characters but I didn't care for any of the scenes involving Marcello Mastroianni's priest they just felt longwinded and selfconsciously arty. Similarly the climax showing the aftermath of the attack  and the Nazis' ultimate revenge  is hardhitting indeed but takes so long to come about that I didn't care much after all.The casting is fine the producers assembled numerous heavyweights to play the Nazi officers including Richard Burton Peter Vaughan and Leo McKern and as an Italian production this features many notable faces from Italian cinema such as John Steiner and Renzo Palmer. There's little to fault in the direction of George Pan Cosmatos either the director is best known for his later work in action cinema including RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART II and COBRA but he cut his teeth on work like this.

As a result the complicated politics and psychology engaging the Vatican and differing attitudes within the German highcommand which take up the body of the movie are all played out against what is already made clear to be a done deal. The hour or more of 'will they won't they' is therefore deprived of much of its potential drama and tension. You already know the outcome.Richard Burton is such a commanding screen presence that he deserves the best directors. Sometimes this doesn't happen and we are left with mediocrities like 'Bitter Victory'. Here he's under the dubious hand of Mr Comatose but still gives a compelling turn for the most part.He's a loyal German officer and will obey his orders. But he's also shrewd enough to realise that the massacre in reprisal against a partisan street bombing is going to be a serious mistake. Leo McKern plays his less eventempered superior. I'm a fan of McKern but find his performance here just a wee bit less than his usual gold standard. Still watchable though.There's a lot of needless detail and digression that seems to be included as packingout the feature length. That and the verbosity runs the risk of making the movie drag. However the lead performances keep the interest there. The script is decent but not clever locations are imaginative camerawork up to the task.It's not a movie I would particularly recommend but if you haven't seen it before and haven't heard about the massacre it's worth a look.".

The officer is played by Richard Burton a rather unlikely Nazi it has to be said but he acquits himself fairly well.

	schema:headline " SiegBoyo!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a retelling of the events leading up to the Ardeatine Massacre which took place just outside of Rome during World War Two and the attempts to prevent it happening by various people involved. The massacre was a direct response by the SS in retaliation for partisan bomb that was detonated in the middle of Rome while an SS company was marching through the city and the order to kill ten men for every German soldier killed came direct from Adolf Hitler himself. There's a lot of controversy regarding the Vatican's knowledge about the event too and the film does a good job of drawing attention to this without being completely accusatory. Richard Burton plays Col. Keppler a weary SS officer who loves Rome. Along with arrogant Prussian adjutant John Steiner he knows that the Third Reich is ending and his main concern is that his name is announced by the BBC on their war crimes list that is broadcast every night. Burton seems genuinely concerned for the people of Rome while Steiner just wants to save his arse. Marcello Mastroianni is the local priest involved in art restoration who strikes up an uneasy friendship with Burton although conversation usually devolves into the two throwing veiled insults at each other. The Italian fascists want to celebrate the anniversary of fascism openly but Burton suggests that they do it behind doors as Rome has become a bit of a ticking bomb politically. His commanding officer old school General Leo McKern plays down the possibility of an attack but then blames Burton when the entire company are blown away by partisans Giancarlo Prete and Renzo Palmer both of whom speak perfect English despite always being dubbed in any other film I've seen them in. The film then becomes a kind of reverse Schindler's List as Burton must find ten men for every soldier killed  320 in total. Burton at first adds all the political and condemned prisoners on the list then all the jews then anyone else he can find while both Steiner and Mastroianni separately contact the Vatican in order the step in and have the Pope try and prevent the massacre. Guess what happens there?Despite the avalanche of later Nazisplotation films Italy would dump on the world this one is played one hundred percent straight with no over the top violence and nudity just people acting their socks off. The most tense part of the film is when the partisans are waiting for the SS company to show up as Giancarlo Prete constantly chases off the locals while trying to hide a bomb in his dust cart. Burton plays the burnedout SS soldier in a sympathetic way but it's still hard to feel sorry for a guy who is basically preparing a list of people to be murdered. Steiner makes a mark as an officer who just oozes Prussian arrogance and it's nice to see him in something a bit more serious than usual.Of course the Italians would take a huge dump on the memories of everyone in the war and their own nefarious involvement in it by making such films as Achtung! The Desert Tigers Women's Camp 119 The Beast In Heat Nazi Love Camp 27 SS Experiment Love Camp Deported Women of the Special SS Section The Red Nights of the Gestapo The Gestapo's Last Orgy aka Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler SS Camp 5 Women's Hell and Hitler's Last Train.

The film then becomes a kind of reverse Schindler's List as Burton must find ten men for every soldier killed  320 in total. Burton at first adds all the political and condemned prisoners on the list then all the jews then anyone else he can find while both Steiner and Mastroianni separately contact the Vatican in order the step in and have the Pope try and prevent the massacre. Guess what happens there?Despite the avalanche of later Nazisplotation films Italy would dump on the world this one is played one hundred percent straight with no over the top violence and nudity just people acting their socks off. The most tense part of the film is when the partisans are waiting for the SS company to show up as Giancarlo Prete constantly chases off the locals while trying to hide a bomb in his dust cart. Burton plays the burnedout SS soldier in a sympathetic way but it's still hard to feel sorry for a guy who is basically preparing a list of people to be murdered. Steiner makes a mark as an officer who just oozes Prussian arrogance and it's nice to see him in something a bit more serious than usual.Of course the Italians would take a huge dump on the memories of everyone in the war and their own nefarious involvement in it by making such films as Achtung! The Desert Tigers Women's Camp 119 The Beast In Heat Nazi Love Camp 27 SS Experiment Love Camp Deported Women of the Special SS Section The Red Nights of the Gestapo The Gestapo's Last Orgy aka Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler SS Camp 5 Women's Hell and Hitler's Last Train.

	schema:headline " No heroes in this WWII tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Massacre in Rome is based on a 1967 book Death in Rome by Robert Katz who also worked on the screenplay. The book in turn is about true events. On March 24 1944 the Germans killed 335 men a few were boys under 19 in the Ardeatine Caves located outside of Rome to the southeast. The execution was a reprisal for a partisan group ambush of a German SS unit the day before. Initially 28 soldiers died but the number of dead would increase. The Germans determined that 10 Italians should die for each German soldier killed. Hitler approved of the plan and ordered the execution within 24 hours. By then 33 German soldiers had died so 330 Italians were to be killed. The number of German soldiers who died eventually reached 42.The SS commander in Rome Herbert Kappler was in charge of the execution. The 74 SS officers and men of his unit would do the killing  each one having to do four or five. They would use Luger pistols and shoot the victims in the back of their heads. They chose the Ardeatine Caves so that they could set off charges inside to collapse the caves and hide the corpses. Kappler ordered cases of cognac to be sent to the site for his men to drink. This was to steel them to the task at hand by numbing their consciences and sensitivity to the coldblooded killing they were to do. The partisan group was expecting that news of their ambush would spread. Then it would rouse the public for more resistance. The American Army was not far from Rome. But the Germans didn't publicize the partisan ambush. Nor did they make public their reprisal. There were no news reports on radio or in the newspapers. So the only people who knew first hand that the ambush had taken place were the partisans who carried it out the Germans and the few people who lived on the Via Rasella where it took place. And even fewer would know about the reprisal at the time.The Germans were carrying out the reprisal to their way of thinking under the terms of the Hague Convention of 1907. It prescribed rules and conduct concerning the military and civilians during war. But in reality with no one to know about either event  in the Italian public and German ranks this was little more than revenge to assuage the pride of some in the offended Nazi hierarchy. Yet it cost the lives of 335 men. The movie shows all of this. But there are some things it doesn't show. For instance three Italian bystanders were killed in the partisan ambush. Three dozen or more of those the Germans killed in the reprisal were Italian army officers not civilians. They probably were POWs since Italy had surrendered and sided with the Allies. And not all were Italians  some were Jews from other countries. Also most of the German soldiers killed were actually northern Italians with ethnic German or Austrian backgrounds. They had been Italian soldiers who chose to join the special Bozen unit in Rome. As the movie shows the Nazi leaders assumed their victims would be criminals already sentenced to death. But when there were so few all convicted prisoners were added and civilians from the ambush street were rounded up. Then 57 Jews who were in custody were added. By noon of that day Kappler had a list of 271 victims and the Italian police chief Pietro Caruso was to provide a list of 50 more Italians. When German soldiers emptied the Regina Coeli prison they had 335 men. The end credits of the movie include The list of men known to have died in the Ardeatine Caves. It shows 332 names with ages and occupations of most. The movie shows Father Pietro Antonelli played by Marcello Mastroianni as one of those killed  at the very end. The list doesn't include him so he likely was a fictitious character in the film. As the list runs on a narrator says that the Allies liberated Rome just 10 weeks later. He relates the outcome of the chief Axis leaders. The Italian chief of police Caruso was tried by an Italian court sentenced to death and executed. None of the others were executed although Luftwaffe Lt. Gen. Kurt Maelzer and Field Marshal Albert Kesselring were sentenced to death. Maelzer died in prison in 1952 and that same year Kesselring was released. There's some interesting background to this but not sufficient room here to go into it. Kappler was tried in 1948 and given a life sentence. The film has him still in the Gaeta Military Prison. But he later escaped a military hospital where he was being treated for cancer. His second wife Anneliese and her son helped Kappler escape on Aug. 15 1977. He made it to Soltau Germany where he died six months later.While the events and main characters here were real much of the dialog and some of the details are fiction. The authors weren't there to observe and listen to people and events. Most of the cast are very good. But I think the role of Gen. Maelzer is way overdone by Leo McKern. Especially his poor emotional display over my boys the killed German soldiers who were really northern Italians. And Richard Burton's portrayal of Kappler seems overly philosophical. For a more thorough and different look at the person of Herbert Kappler watch the movie The Scarlet and the Black. Christopher Plummer plays an excellent Kappler over a period of the war that covers almost two years. His nemesis was a real priest Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty in the Vatican played superbly by Gregory Peck.".

Instead it's a very talky very drawn out drama documenting a terrible Nazi atrocity towards random civilians of Rome at the end of the second world war. I myself knew very little of the terrible things that happened to the people of Rome before seeing this film so it did enlighten me which is something you don't often get with many films based on fact or otherwise. And as the film does go into a lot of detail regarding the events leading up to the massacre meaning you do feel that by the end most stones are left turned and there's not really anything left to say. The film is a bit too slow burn as at times the plot feels like it's really not getting anywhere but once it does heat up it shows how such an awful real life event could ever be orchestrated using nothing more than cold hearted controlled brutality.".

The only time we see the inside of a courtroom in this film is when Perry  Della get hitched and when she tries to have it annulled. CRAZY!! The other point of interest for me was actress Carol Hughes my favorite Dale Arden from 1940's FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE who is almost completely unrecognizable in here due to bright blonde hair and a southern accent.I love Warren William's Perry Mason I DO!

	schema:reviewBody "The Case of the Velvet Claws made in 1936 is a Perry Mason mystery that has Della and Perry as newlyweds starting off on their honeymoon. In the TV series and even more in the TV movies later on there was always that unspoken love between Della and Perry  and no one knew what went on after office hours.

The funny if you can call it that thing about all this is that Perry was in fact hired by Eva using a phony name to get George's sleazy exploitive rag Spicy Bit's to kill a story that it's about to publish. The story has her or the other woman having an illicit affair with happily married and straight as an arrow State Senator Peter Milnor Kenneth Harlan.Perry who at the beginning of the movie tied the knot with his long suffering in putting up with him and faithful private secretary Della Street Claire Dodd never got a chance to spend his wedding night together in blissful harmony when he was kidnapped by Eva Stuart really Eva Belter. Eva afraid of her lover Peter Milnor being exposed by her husbands who runs the paper from behind the scenes tabloid tries to get Perry to go see Spicy Bit's editor Frank Locke Madison Richards and talk him out of publishing the story. Perry finds out secondhand from Locke that Mr. Belter is the one bankrolling the paper and goes to see him at his mansion only to get himself kicked out by Digley Stuart Holmes the butler.It's a few minutes later after Perry was given the heave ho Eve shows up and after trying to get Belter to kill the story about her and Mr.Milnor ends up we don't really know for sure since it all happens off camera killing him with a single gunshot from her .32 pistol. Perry caught completely by surprise in Belter's murder and being the last person seen leaving his mansion before he was murdered is now the 1 suspect in his death! What makes things even worse for Perry is that he's been fingered by the person who not only was at the scene of Belter's murder but is his client as well Mrs. Eve Belter!Even though Perry looks and acts totally confused as well as having walking pneumonia he's given a break by the very favorable script at the end of the movie by solving Betler's murder by having it pinned on someone who had absolutely no reason for murdering him. SPOILER ALERTWith him Belter's killer knowing that he's instead of his cheating wife Eva to inherit all of his millions he suddenly pulls out a gun and plugs a shocked and surprised Betler not wanting to wait for the old man to die of natural causes! He just couldn't help himself!This brainless action on Belter's killers part opened him up to being blackmailed almost as soon as the gunsmoke even cleared by being spotted by Betler's maid Mrs. Veite Ruth Robinson. Here the killer murdered someone Geoge Betler who was only going to help him by leaving his estate over to him and on the other hand doesn't murder the one person Mrs. Veite who can implicate him in Betler's murder!With the guilty party taken away by the police Perry can now carry on with Della as man and wife but not after he gave everyone in the cast including Della a serious case influenza by sneezing his head off and in their faces all throughout the movie and not at all bothering to see a doctor to treat him!".

The bribe doesn't work but soon the woman's husband ends up dead and Mason is the suspect. This is a pretty good film that's nothing special but it makes for a quick 63minutes worth of entertainment. The best thing the film has going for it is the performance of William who also picks up after the previous film. He's full of charm and anger this time out and those are two things William can do with ease. Sadly Allen Jenkins isn't in this one. He's replaced with a new assistant played by Eddie Acuff and he's comedy just doesn't work. The case itself is pretty good as is the ending.".

Still seeing the same story done by another actor as Mason was interesting. And was it ever different.This one started with Warren William as Mason and Claire Dodd as Della Street invading Judge Clara Blandick's chambers and demanding to be married. The barest hint of a romance was present on the Mason television shows. But off Della and Perry go to the apartment and then the plan is for a honeymoon lodge in the country.All that gets interrupted by Wini Shaw toting a gun and demanding to retain Warren William in a blackmail scheme against the publisher of a Confidential type magazine called Spicy Bits. What she doesn't tell him is that her husband is the secret owner of the rag and she's been stepping out on him with a candidate for office.In a confrontation Shaw actually believes she shot her husband but as in television Perry Mason defends no guilty clients. That's a parameter not broken. And if you watched the series you know who did the crime.What was fascinating to me in The Case Of The Velvet Claws was how Paul Drake's character was changed from a professional well dressed William Hopper who owned his own agency to Eddie Acuff a rather seedy looking retainer who even got into a drag to tail someone.The Case Of The Red Velvet Claws has some nice sparkling urban Warner Brothers type dialog handled with aplomb by William. That was a guy who did all kinds of series Perry Mason Philo Vance and Michael Lanyard The Lone Wolf. And all sounded as urbane and sophisticated as Warren William was in real life.Definitely for fans of Warren William if not Erle Stanley Gardner's sleuth with a law degree.".

And if you watched the series you know who did the crime.What was fascinating to me in The Case Of The Velvet Claws was how Paul Drake's character was changed from a professional well dressed William Hopper who owned his own agency to Eddie Acuff a rather seedy looking retainer who even got into a drag to tail someone.The Case Of The Red Velvet Claws has some nice sparkling urban Warner Brothers type dialog handled with aplomb by William. That was a guy who did all kinds of series Perry Mason Philo Vance and Michael Lanyard The Lone Wolf. And all sounded as urbane and sophisticated as Warren William was in real life.Definitely for fans of Warren William if not Erle Stanley Gardner's sleuth with a law degree.";

One needs to pay attention to details throughout the film to follow the twists in the plot which in this movie is very complicated. The movies closely follow the Erle Stanley Gardner mystery novels on which they are based. The Case of the Velvet Claws holds one's interest from beginning to end as Perry Mason cleverly addresses the case of a murder he is accused of committing by the woman he has agreed to defend in the case. Warren William plays the role of Perry Mason with panache and wit and Clair Dodd is serviceable in the role of Della Street but plays the role unremarkably and without the flair one would hope for.

	schema:headline " Perry and Della tie the knot in this early Mason mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "After a couple of seasons of the Perry Mason TV series 1950s1960s viewers were waiting and watching for the episode in which Mason would finally marry his secretary Della Street. But the wait continued through more than two dozen TV movies in the 1980s and early 1990s. And Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale never did tie the knot. Actually that was true to the Mason story as written by Erle Stanley Gardner in some 82 novels. Gardner wrote his novels up until his death in 1970 two of which were published after his death. And while his readers knew that the criminal lawyer and his trusted righthand woman would never marry there was that hope among viewers that somehow the union would be made in one of the last films. The reason for that hope sprang no doubt to some extent from the earliest Perry Mason movies. Way back in 1936 Perry and Della did marry and it was in this the fourth film which was made in 1936. Warren William and Claire Dodd had the roles in a script that was built around the couple's marriage. Gardner may not have liked the way his hero was portrayed in the early films but William made an excellent Mason who was more sleuth and detective than lawyer. And the Warner Brothers team that wrote the marriage into this film made it work well. The mystery of the book is still in The Case of the Velvet Claws. But here it is cleverly developed around Perry and Della's marriage. And the marriage honeymoon night with many interruptions and periodic reunions of the newlyweds add wonderful humor to the story. This is a very enjoyable film start to finish. I especially enjoyed how Perry handles a doublecross. Not just once but twice. I think others will too. The only sad thing about this film was that it was to the be the last with Warren William in the lead role.".

She later kills her husband and blames Perry...which makes little sense since Della witnessed the armed Mrs. Belter kidnap him in the first place. When the police show up at Mason's apartment looking to arrest him his wife inexplicably says she has no idea where he is and acts as if he is a womanizer!! Does any of this makes sense? Not in the least.If this sort of stuff sounds nothing like the TV version of Perry Mason you're right. In many ways the Perry Mason movies with Warren William make the character more like the smarty pants rogue he generally played in other films. Plus unlike the TV Perry this one is a crime fighter versus a lawyer who spends all his time in court. Now this isn't to say the films are bad...though unfortunately The Case of the Velvet Claws IS....as it makes no sense at all and just frustrated me.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is not a Perry Mason movie really  it's Warren William playing yet another devilmaycare debonair witty character who is a lawyer but spends most of his time as a detective. The movie aims to be a comedy mystery and does pretty well with that but falls far short of The Case of the Lucky Legs. In part this is due to a rather bland supporting cast  Claire Dodd as Della Street and Eddie Acuff as the unfortunately named Spudsy Drake are both bland and unmemorable. Their predecessors in Lucky Legs Genevieve Tobin and Allen Jenkins were better served by the writers and gave sparkling performances. The acting highlight goes to Clara Blandick as Judge Mary F. O'Daugherty the judge who marries Della and Perry. Blandick is only in a couple of scenes but makes the most of them. She is probably best remembered for playing Auntie Em in The Wizard of Oz. The Velvet Claws plot is a bit convoluted with Eve Belter hiring Mason at the point of a gun to stop the local gossip rag from publishing a story that's both untrue and could ruin a politician's career. The rag's publisher is murdered Belter accuses Mason of the murder  even though this accusation is not true Belter thinks she actually committed the murder Mason is a very forgiving sort and continues to defender her. The humorous overtone in the movie is the fact Perry and Della get married and that their honeymoon keeps getting interrupted oh that and the fact that Perry has a bad cold he gives to everyone he meets. This is an entertaining little programmer with the always highly watchable Warren William. Not the best in the series but it's still recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I will just state a few things about the movie before I give my review and comments. Yes this is a continuation of sorts of the story started in Jisatsu saakuru Suicide Club. No this is not a horror film at least not in the modern sense. Yes as is stated this is a long movie and requires an open mind and patienceIt has been stated on several reviews of the first film that it meant to serve as a social commentary on the overly complacent stance taken by the general public in modern Japanese society. Whether that is true or not the first film had a perfect blend of twisted horror imagery with a stark use of satire. While the first one left many questions unanswered at the end this entry into the series not only answers some of those questions but opens new ones. Shion Sono shows one again that not conforming to any convention can be a refreshing thing. This time around he shows us a new story not focusing on characters living through the main events of the story but rather events taking place before during and after the events of the first film. This is all done with a much slower pace this time around and focuses more on emotions and thought of the characters rather than focusing on the events themselves. Most of the story itself is told though the narration of the four main characters as they share their perspective of the events they are seeing. This gives a very intimate feel though some may feel that the characters give a little too much detail. This film leaves the big events of the series and instead focuses on little moments moments that the characters share with others or with themselves. The fact that this movie focuses more on emotions is what makes this movie shine. The performances are simply amazing. Using mostly lesser known Japanese actors Sono has drawn out some of the most emotionally draining and shocking scenes in recent memory and by the end of the film it is hard to think that these actors aren't all seasoned professionals. The film feels very real and has a somewhat low budget home movie quality to it. This is the same quality that is given to many TV movies in japan. The effect is a movie that is stripped down to the basics and is at some points very intense and hard to watch. This is not Suicide Club 2. There are no pop songs or flashy Ziggy Stardusttype moments. at times this may feel like it is worlds away from the first film. For those that are looking for a good emotionally charged film that builds on conventions and storypieces that were started in the first film I would wholeheartedly suggest seeing this film. It is not for everyone and to some it may be frustrating. This is a movie for those that want to ponder a mystery much greater than any murder interfamily relationships.".

	onyx:emotionText "First I will just state a few things about the movie before I give my review and comments. Yes this is a continuation of sorts of the story started in Jisatsu saakuru Suicide Club. No this is not a horror film at least not in the modern sense. Yes as is stated this is a long movie and requires an open mind and patienceIt has been stated on several reviews of the first film that it meant to serve as a social commentary on the overly complacent stance taken by the general public in modern Japanese society. Whether that is true or not the first film had a perfect blend of twisted horror imagery with a stark use of satire.

	schema:reviewBody "A sequel to 2002's cultstatus film Suicide Club director Sion Sono's Noriko's Dinner Table tells the compelling and profound tale of the collapse and reconstruction of the family unit. The story follows Noriko Shimabara Kazue Fukiishi a seemingly unhappy teenager who lives with her mother father and younger sister. To escape reality Noriko begins to regularly visit the internet site Haikyo.com a BBS where she begins to chat with other girls just like her. One of the girls known only by the title Ueno54 persuades Noriko to runaway to Tokyo so they can meet in person. Noriko willingly accepts and escapes to Tokyo wherein she meets the real person behind the mysterious Ueno54 and learns her true nameKumiko Tsugumi. What Noriko soon discovers is that Kumiko operates a familycircle program which specializes in taking in young girls and giving them new personalities and families With the release of Suicide Club a film that explored the disastrous effects that an enigmatic cult had on an entire population of youth director Sion Sono not only created a memorable horror film but also provided some social commentary on Japanese youth. And while it was effective in what it was trying to convey many viewers considered it a gory albeit somewhat intelligent film. Sono decided to take a different route with Noriko's Dinner Table this time around taking out the unnecessary gore and replacing it with a more introspective stance. The film is split up into various chapters each dedicating ample time to the film's characters. While this might seem distracting for a film such as this it does the exact oppositethe firstperson narrative of the characters allow the viewer to understand some of the decisions they choose why they choose them and what they hope to arrive at after the decision has been made. It's through these narrative perspectives that provided the truly captivating moments throughout the film wanting to see the outcome of characters I have gotten to know.Probably one of the strongest elements of the film is the cast. Since Sono's attention to detail is so prevalent in this film the cast had to be right on the mark. And they do a remarkable job. The highlight of the film is Kazue Fukiishi. Her portrayal of Noriko is a sight to behold and her transformation from being a stubborn rebellious teen to an overzealous rather detached individual is masterfully done. Noriko's familyher father played by film veteran Ken Mitsuishi and younger sister played by Yuriko Yoshitakaare fantastic in their respectable roles as well. Actress Tsugumi in her portrayal as the chilling and austere Kumiko also brings to mind the exceptional acting talent so vividly on display here.While Suicide Club showcased a telescopic overview of the shadowy Suicide Circle cult which showed the cult's negative influence on numerous individuals Noriko's Dinner Table portrays rather successfully how the mysterious cult affects a single family. It's a film that touches upon various contemplative societal issues such as individualism family structure alienation and mind control on an enormous scale. With the release of Suicide Club a few years back director Sion Sono had something to say. With Noriko's Dinner Table he takes it a step further raising questions to issues that are relevant and meaningful today. A totally absorbing experience I highly recommend it.Please visit iSugoi.com for more reviews.".

But I don t begrudge the length unlike some movies where the coyote syndrome starts to cut in I didn't t feel like chewing off my leg once. The movie is a companion piece to the very excellent Suicide Circle But those expecting the same extraordinary images of the first film might be disappointed this is a mostly slow moving and introspective study of identity the roles that we play and that others and society impose upon us. 17 year old Noriko runs away from her seemingly loving family to Tokyo where she meets the chilling Kumiko a woman with no individual existence. What follows is profound and at times highly unnerving as the personalities of Noriko her younger sister Yuka and their family are all annihilated. The performances of all of the actors is outstandingly committed I cannot believe that the last set piece of this movie could have been shot in more than one take the strain on the actors must have been unimaginable. This is big grownup cinema don t expect explanations don t expect to understand all of what takes place I sure as hell don t. Do however expect to be awed by the sheer daring of this wonderful piece of work and the brave actors who are called upon to give performances of such extraordinary power.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Suicide Club I approached this film with some trepidation. However this is not Suicide Club 2. Its a story of two sisters Noriko and Yuka who live with their parents in Toyokawa a sleepy seaside town. Mousy Noriko is unhappy with this existence and runs away to Tokyo. There she meets Kumiko who runs a fantasy service in which young ladies act as daughters for lonely men amongst other things the family rental concept is a great idea for this film. Yuka eventually runs away also and does the same thing. Their father pieces together clues as to their whereabouts and doing and goes to Tokyo to find them. First of all the settings are excellent. Like New York City and London you see Tokyo in all its glory neon etc. The story itself is also great flowing  unfolding slowly until it reaches an explosive climax. However that would only make a good film if the acting was merely adequate. The acting is uniformly superb. Kasue Fukiishi plays Noriko so well you don't realize she's acting. Likewise Yuka Yuriko Yoshitaka and Kumiko Tsugumi also give great performances. This film is much more psychological than Suicide Club and for that it shines. I was almost breathless through parts of this and I watched it on DVD. Its only recommended you watch Suicide Club first buts it not essential to get the gist of this powerful film. Who expects any film that is labeled a sequel to be much better than the first? I so highly recommend this film. It is actually one of my favorites. I expect great things from the three young actresses in this film. Based on their performances in this film especially Ms. Fukiishi's I know I will not be disappointed.".

Each scene seems as if it were painstakingly and obsessively done paying attention to the tiniest of detail. As with all of Sono's films the camera angles and shots are unique and make you feel like you're a part of the story that's unfolding.Many people consider the length of the movie to be it's downfall and with good reason. 2 hours and 30 minutes is one long movie but it holds together very well. In the end you'll feel like you were a part of what was happening and it will affect you for better or worse.What many people are concerned about however is it's connection to Sion Sono's cult classic Suicide Club. There is a definite connection and it does explain a little of what happened throughout Suicide Club. But it still leaves some small questions unanswered. Nothing is left unanswered in Noriko's Dinner Table but there's still a little we don't understand from Suicide Club.This brings me to the meaning behind family in Noriko's Dinner Table. Sion Sono's ideas and meanings are portrayed and excellently through sometimes complex symbolism that may take a few watches to understand. The movie is separated into chapters and the story how it's told is broken into pieces and presented to you at little bits at a time. You wont get the full picture until the end of the movie.Noriko's Dinner Table is an amazing film.I ordered it from Japan for about 30someodd bucks and I can say it was worth the money and the two week wait to receive it in the mail. I've had it two days and already watched it three times. It's amazing not what I expected but amazing.A quick note do not expect what we saw in Suicide Club. A little of that same horroresquire feeling is there but it's really a drama at heart. An amazing drama.This is the mature grownup Suicide Club.Everyone should watch this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. I must say of all the films out there this one has a concept that has never been done before.When this film was released most of its recognition stemmed from it being the director's followup to his cult favorite Suicide Club 2002. In fact that is what sparked my interest as I am a diehard fan of Suicide Club. However after viewing this film I have to definitely recommend not going in and expecting a sequel. This film takes place in the same universe and its story may clear up a bit of the whys in Suicide Club but it has a different story completely. Different characters different timeframe different genre everything but standalone film or sequel  this is one of the best films I've seen.We pick up the story a bit of time before the events of Suicide Club 6 months prior to be exact. A 17 year old girl named Noriko Shimabara lives with her father Tetsu her mother Taeko and her sister Yuka. Utterly bored with life she spends hours contacting various teenage girls through the website haikyo.com present in the first film. Aching to leave home and meet those like her Noriko packs her bags and runs off to Tokyo. The very next morning she meets Kumiko  the founder of the website haikyo. But she is immediately swept into a bizarre game of acting as part of a family and getting paid for it. Eventually she contacts her sister Yuka who runs off to be with her sister. Their mother commits suicide and 6 months later their father hears about a suicide cult in Tokyo that caused 54 girls to jump in front of a train. Tetsu has a feeling that Noriko is involved so he starts a very long journey to get his daughters back. However by the time he reaches them 2 years have passed and they have become completely detached from reality and from themselves.This is where the movie reaches its climax and goes into the bizarre and gruesome territory that anyone familiar with the first film would be expecting. But this is NOT a horror movie in any sense of the word. It's almost pure drama. Even though it has a seemingly complicated plot at heart it is simply a story about a girl's journey to her own soul and to the heart of life. And what a dark journey it is.The ending is a bit like the first one's ending with a sense of accomplishment. It is quite the uplifting ending for an otherwise depressing film. But it gives no easy answers. I'll be looking forward to the third one where the events from this film and the last film are finally tied up.The symbolism and messages in this film are incredible and the plot was perfectly crafted to convey them all. I don't see how anybody could NOT like this movie. It is the perfect embodiment of all human emotion.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to think of myself as among other things a cinephile someone who had a taste for good cinema whose Favorite Movies list was topped by some little known films. But I had seen nothing until Noriko's Dinner Table. I haven't seen Suicide Club yet. I hope to see it soon but in truth it doesn't matter right now I consider Noriko's my new absolute best movie ever and that doesn't depend on what it's part of or what other films has ever directed its author.There are personal reasons behind that election of course but then isn't every election personal and what other meaning could hide behind the word My in My Favorite Movies?

The symbolisms were nicely presented and the metaphors were very tight to the storyline. The atmosphere is heavy dramatic and suits the movie's concept fantastically. While watching you feel like you are passing from reality to fantasy and back again up to the point you don't know whats real anymore. We have to thank the very well presented characters for this just enough info but not too much. This was a very very good movie. Long but good!".

Pretty standard stuff for this tradition and many of the ordinary girlsexangstparent dynamics are acted out some symbolically.

Imagine that the film is broken into a collection of first person narratives each reporting what they discover and one of these leverages the fact that the father is a reporter detective who discovers the gang and sets up the inverted acting gig.The gang incidentally is from a previous movie that is not particularly relevant except in that it occupies the same magical universe of lost girls.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

This film pretty much fills in all the holes and has so much more added on. This movie is almost three hours long and jam packed with dialog. But really good dialog. It almost had a poetic feel to it. This is called semisequel but actually it more or less takes place during the other movie. This film is listed as a horror film. But it is not the gore fest that The Suicide Club was. The movie had no scare factor at all. But mentally it was creepy. Two sisters run away from home and get into a business where others rent them to be part of their family. The creepy part is that they take on different names and personalities and they get so use it they become these alternate people. It really does give the movie a creepy warped feeling at parts. The sisters are played by Kazue Fukiishi who is a nerdy type girl who becomes more open with her other personality. Then you have Yuriko Yoshitaka who basically turns into someone else but mostly stays the same personality wise. The girl who runs the business is played by Tsugumi who has the most warped mind in the film. She loves role playing in these families because she never had one. She likes it so much it is like she is trying to find the perfect family to stay with. The movie does run a bit long but in some ways it is worth it because the words spoken and the meaning behind the movie are pretty powerful.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was quite entertaining but I have got one very major complain about this movie. This movie did not really show how the father was bad to his daughters. The father just cared about his work so when the daughter Noriko and her sister ran away did not bother him much. That showed how cruel Noriko's father is. The father even asked his wife to help him do his work so you can see how obsessed the father is at work. As mentioned towards the end of the show Noriko's father may even hit her if she asked him something. However the character development for Noriko's father to see how distant he is towards his daughter could have been made much better like the movie Click. I thought this movie should also focus more on the Problem rather than just the Solution.Click really shows that when when the main character was obsessed with his work and when his kids ask him a question he would scold them and shout at them loudly. The movie also shows how obsessed the main character was obsessed with his workwhen he got back home he just did and did his work without even caring about the kids. So you can see how distant their relationship is and feel touch for the characters. This movie did not really manage to make me feel touch because they focused too much on the solution rather than the problem. I did not really feel that the relationship of the daughter and father was very far unlike the movie CLICK. The first half an hour of this movie could have used to build up development instead of long boring dialogs. This movie still managed to be interesting though it managed to be touching at times especially when they are trying to solve the problem by doing some 'acting'. This movie is unique and entertaining. It is fun to watch due to its rather good storyline though poor character development. Furthermore the ending pratically spoiled the entire film. The ending was extremely aggravating and terrible. I thought the whole problem was solved. A lot of effort was put in to solve the problem. What wrong with Noriko's sister? Why did she do something so stupid? Why did she run away? This ending is just horrible and extremely aggravating. This film somehow did not impact me as much as suicide club. I preferred suicide club to this film. Though this film was still good because it was very very entertaining though not convincing enough for me. Score 710".

I read up on the film before seeking it out so I knew what I was in for in terms of style a slowpaced character driven arthouse flick that was very different from its predecessor. What I got was a boring movie that outstayed its welcome within the opening hour then dragged mercilessly for another hourandahalf.The plot is bland the acting is spotty and the primary psychological elements are unfocused and sloppy. They say a picture is worth a thousand words but this film abuses narration to such an extreme that massive amounts of superfluous verbiage are used when only a few mere images would suffice. What results is an unbearable series of events that seem to exist for no other reason than to show something during the unending narration. The dialogue is drawn out yet somehow empty  virtually nothing of interest is said. Even after 159 minutes of characters constantly yapping they literally cannot keep their mouths shut for more than 10 seconds at a time the viewer inexplicably comes away from this movie with almost no additional understanding of the primary themes behind Suicide Club a film that also suffered from meaningless psychobabble but overpowered its flaws with horrific imagery.Subsequent to my initial disappointment I attempted to rewatch Noriko's Dinner Table on two separate occasions but simply could not make it past the opening hour.

	schema:reviewBody "This Japanese film is my closing film for this year's SIFF. It tells of a compelling family story where safe is boring and a child is off looking for that spark in life to spice things up. Turning her back to her family Noriko makes her way to Tokyo to look up her internet friends friends she came to know through an online forum. At first everything seems puzzling until she realize that they are all actors folks providing rental family services to lonely people out there yearning to belong.It's ironic that Noriko had turned her back on her real family only to join a surrogate one pretending to be close knit to a lot of other strangers. She takes on her online persona and forgets about Noriko the life she left behind.

	onyx:emotionText "This Japanese film is my closing film for this year's SIFF. It tells of a compelling family story where safe is boring and a child is off looking for that spark in life to spice things up. Turning her back to her family Noriko makes her way to Tokyo to look up her internet friends friends she came to know through an online forum. At first everything seems puzzling until she realize that they are all actors folks providing rental family services to lonely people out there yearning to belong.It's ironic that Noriko had turned her back on her real family only to join a surrogate one pretending to be close knit to a lot of other strangers. She takes on her online persona and forgets about Noriko the life she left behind.

This movie however is more character based and involves the issue of roleplaying in societyrather than being merely a commentary on pop culture it's a discussion of the nature of being connected to oneself or really being who you are meant to be not who society wants you to be or even what you were born into being.A great way in which Sono pulls this off is to have multiple voiceover narrators engage in a confessional storytelling mode. Unfortunately for international viewers said voiceover often is delivered over dialog of the movie as well and the subtitles can tend to fall behind in many cases resulting in it being difficult from time to time to tell what all is being said. Can't fault the intentions but this movie is probably not nearly quite the experience it would be in its native language.It also commits the cardinal sin of an unjustified playlength. This movie ran about 2 12 hours long but ten minutes could have been shaved off of the end. Sono attempted to justify it with a repeated motif of running away this time with Yuka the younger sister but the movie had a much stronger ending on the Let's start over moment. Due to the introspective nature of the movie however it makes sense that sometimes the best ending doesn't necessarily end the idea.

At the party there is a lot of virtuosic hand held camera and wide angle point of view shots as the man slips in uncut sequence from intense gossip huddle to gossip huddle. These shots alone are remarkable. Acting the core of the film is the disintegrating relationship between the man and his alcoholic wife  it's like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff but with the added edge that every accusation she makes of him is overheard and potentially going to destroy them. It's very well acted.Music and sound typically of Czech films a minimalist modern score with a very skillful post dub sound edit and mixScript beautifully nuanced...maybe drags a little in the middle but it takes on a huge challenge and it does it very well".

	schema:reviewBody "Husband and wife stagger tired and tipsy through their house at night holding candelabras. Something's not quite right a basement door open ajar keys where they shouldn't be electricity and phone are out of order. A little earlier the movie opens with the couple back at their house after a 'party' gala. They fight and bicker on the pavement out of the car then inside the house like we're behind a closed door hearing echoes of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Flashbacks to the party earlier that night in subjective POV shots take us through a roomful of people dressed in suits holding up cocktail glasses ready to toast prominent Party figures faces peering intently into the camera huddling together to hide conspiratorial whispers or perhaps simple idle gossip. When the husband goes to the bathroom to freshen up an old woman shows up to offer him a towel in doing so she disappears in the background and stays there as though placed there to observe.This is a great movie about paranoia the fear of being watched and discussed and it's a half good movie when it stops being about paranoia because at some point we know the couple is being monitored by the Party and have had to live with bugs in their living room for years. In the famous finale of The Conversation a maddened Gene Hackman tears through his apartment looking for bugs. His nightmare echoes through the years of cinema because it's a nightmare left incomplete damnation through eternity. Here things become clear in the final act.This is ambiguous psychodrama for as long as it suits the movie then it becomes the political indictment it planned to be. It's stunning to me that a movie like this was allowed to be made in the Eastern Bloc of the 1970's. Usually filmmakers working in Soviet Union satellite republics spoke of Soviet tyranny indirectly. They used the Nazis to tell us about living through the oppression of a totalitarian regime. Here comrade Stalin is mentioned by name. As such this is a brave movie that attacks contemporary things of a contemporary society.The dimensions of this political thriller are most chilling for me in a particular scene the husband asks the wife to remember earlier at the party if one particular guest was friendly to her and addressed her by her first name. He reasons that if he did so if he recognized her in public in a friendly manner that the husband is not under political scrutiny by his higherups if that were the case everyone would keep their distance from even the wife. Social life in The Ear is not leisure time or exchange of ideas it's an arena of suspicion and conspiracy a chess game of ritualized behavior and expected moves.Back home behind closed doors The Ear never sleeps. Under its scrutiny married life becomes the forum of vented anger and frustration. As the married couple stagger through their household in the dark holding candelabras as though exploring the catacomb of a Gothic horror movie their exchanges become increasingly unpleasant and hostile. There's one very grueling scene in the bathroom where the wife berates her husband for the choices of a lifetime. Yet in the important moments of life and death when a man is about to take his own life or when they're coming to get him they're close together in defiance of everything.".

So the main hero is very nervous and he's sure his house is full of wiretaps. The main part of the film describes the tension between the husbands turning from love to hate and back... In the morning he's waiting for the secret police to arrest him but instead he receives a phone he becomes the new boss of the whole department.The story is very impressive  and due to the situation in early 70's the country was occupied by Soviets in 1968 it wasn't shown to public until the communist regime broke down. Everyone who had something to do with this film had big troubles later and had to 'prove' hisher loyalty to the regime.All in all a film that is definitely worth seeing probably the best psychological thriller in czech cinematography and a must for everyone interested in the inner functions of every totalitarian society.".

	schema:reviewBody "The acute paranoia of daily life behind the Iron Curtain haunts a petty bureaucrat after he overhears an indiscreet remark at a party and becomes convinced his house is under government surveillance. Not surprisingly the film spent over two decades in official limbo for daring to paint an unflattering portrait of Big Brother showing the unseen influence of the State in a society where privilege is bought at the cost of privacy. The story begins where Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation' left off with the anxious civil servant and his equally suspicious wife trapped in a claustrophobic dark comic nightmare of hidden microphones tapped telephones and invisible prying eyes all the time wondering why the axe of political expedience is aimed at their innocent necks. The scenario would be absurd if it weren't so unsettling and succeeds as both a disturbing parable of totalitarian oppression and a perversely entertaining black comedy.".

It's also something of a Long Night's Journey Into Day chronicling as it does the time that elapses between a government Minister arriving home late from a party to slowly realise that in the absence of himself and his wife their house has been bugged by his own Party and the next morning when his fears prove theoretically groundless as he learns he is to replace a Minister who has been deposed. Although on paper this makes for a sigh of relief in reality it just means he will have an even higher profile and be that much bigger a target for Party hit men. Shot in black and white the film mirrors a society that for us in the West is virtually impossible to imagine but even then the tension is liberally laced with humour.

Basically Ludvik Radoslav Brzobohat is a senior official of Prague's ruling Communist regime and his wife Anna Jirina Bohdalov is an alcoholic. They return home after spending the evening at a government function a political party dinner where Ludvik finds out several of his colleagues have been relieved of their responsibilities. Ludvik and Anna find that their home has been broken into they repair the damage but strange occurrences happen several times after including the disappearance of the spare house keys and dead phone lines. This leads the couple to believe they are under surveillance by their own government the house has been bugged and the ear of the government is listening. As the night progresses the couple are being extremely careful what they do and see at the same their personal and marital flaws are exposed until eventually they have had enough and they make an effort to find and destroy the bugs but there will be consequences whatever happens. Also starring Gustav Opocensk as Conrade Miroslav Holub as General Lubor Tokos as Minister Borivoj Navrtil as Cejnar and Jir Csler as Secret Agent Standa. It is a combination of politics and domestic drama the most memorable scenes are obviously of the bitter married couple at loggerheads it is a bit dated now and I can't really understand it being banned forever maybe for the invasion of the home and privacy element but it is interesting enough political thriller. Worth watching!".

I'm a fan of political cinema and think it's refreshing to see a movie condemning the Soviet Union.Ucho has a simple almost theatrical plot after a party a couple return home and begin suspecting that people were at their home while they were gone. This suspicion aggravated by the fact the husband is a Party officer and that he spent all night receiving innuendos about a purge within the Party that already cost the careers and lives? of several friends explodes into a series of recrimination between himself and his tipsy wife about their private life.The movie shows how easily the state could affect the private life in the Soviet Union how people were on edge and constantly paranoid and why they had good motives to be paranoid. In a scene that certainly inspired Francis Ford Coppola in The Conversation the couple goes around the house looking for bugs in every room. In The Conversation Harry Caul doesn't find any in Ucho there's one in every room so obscenely obvious it's like the secret police doesn't even care if the couple knows their existence. After all what could they do about it? Complain to the police? This movie is theatrical because it's concentrated inside a house in spite of some welltimed flashbacks to the party. But it's also theatrical because of its use of dialogue. This is one of those movies like Sleuth like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? where acting coupled with fierce witty dialogue carries the narrative along.It's fascinating to see Ludvik Radoslav Brzobohat and Anna Jirina Bohdalov torn each other apart in petty accusations with the fear of arrest looming over their heads. A movie like this would need two good performances to work and the actors although they're not famous are up to the task and provide the movie's emotional core.Karel Kachyna and screenwriter Jan Prochzka deserve praise for this study of life in the Soviet Union.".

Indeed the director has even produced a Lynch movie Mulholland Drive. The dreamy yet rocking score from Johnny Marr really gives life to the movie yet constantly sounds like lost tracks from Achtung Baby the U2 album. And then there's the story. I love the story but I loved it even better when it was a Wim Wenders movie called Until the End of the World.This movie is pure plagiarism right down to the soundtrack Johnny Marr what happened?! but it's excellently made. As an unauthorized and uncredited American remake of Wim Wenders' awesome 1991 movie there's both a lot to love and a lot to hate.Someone should be facing a lengthy legal battle right now and it's a shame because this movie is so well done.

	schema:reviewBody "A private detective Antonio Banderas is hired to find a missing stripper. A simple job turns complicated when everyone he questions ends up dead.I can imagine Antonio Banderas looking at this script and weighing in his mind if he wants it or not. Then he gets to the sex scene and he says I'm in. And I have been told he helped in casting Autumn Reeser so this makes it even more likely. The script is interesting sometimes a bit bizarre but for Banderas that is the clincher for sure. Other than that despite being the main character he is actually the least interesting part of the movie.The press release compares the film to Sin City and Big Lebowski. I can see Lebowski somewhat but agree completely with the Sin City comparison. That was actually the first thing I thought of after a few minutes of analyzing the style. The film uses odd angles sometimes to a dangerous extreme and saturated colors. I thought in many scenes the backgrounds were even more beautiful than the foregrounds or the people in them.What to say about the physics angle? I have seen many complaints online from people who say the plot was not about physics and that the same story could be told with a different topic. I raised this to director Tony Krantz and he made a clear argument that physics is not just central to the plot but the very plot itself. If you did not get this I recommend giving the film a second view.The Snoop Dogg claim was deeply philosophical but I feel it was not properly explored. Is sex with men just one after another with no real difference? And whether yes or no how does this fit into the film's overall message? I do not know but for whatever reason  perhaps my background in philosophy and women's studies  this line jumped out at me.The supporting cast is also impressive. I mean Sam Elliott and James VanDerBeek? Incredible. Autumn Reeser truly a joy. Elliott was actually a bit weaker than usual I think he works best when his role is minimized but I can never say no to him or his mustache.I do have to call out Banderas' accent. As one reviewer wrote Antonio Banderas's mumbling was mostly unintelligible. I would not be so harsh but the fact remains that I missed many of his lines because he could no deliver them. I can understand Puss in Boots from Shrek so I know he is capable of speaking clearly... this is my only real complaint.Pick this one up. Great film very good twists and turns with a blend of intrigue and sex that will grab your attention. The DVD and BluRay has a few features on it and if you are the type who loves audio commentaries I do director Krantz will provide you with more than a fair share of background...".

After a certain point the movie takes a few confusing turns where the viewer is wondering how the new direction is going to align with the plot that was woven earlier. The climax where the plot is revealed is surprisingly good. Though the ending where the two separate paths the movie had taken are brought together is in my opinion quite lame.The acting is good enough. Antonio Banderas and William Fichtner are good actors and they do a decent job. The rest of the cast doesn't fail either. In the end it is the script which is a let down. Maybe it seemed great on paper and lost its charm when brought alive on the screen.One more thing. The script somehow brings nuclear physics into play. Why or to what end is the question the viewer is likely to ask after the movie ends. When an element as strong as science mathematics or religion has to be brought in I believe making it central to the plot would pay off better dividends. For example Pi by Darren Aronofsky or Back to the Future movies.Overall it is an average thriller with bits of science thrown in. It is not exactly a waste of time if you happen to catch it on TV. Otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to buy or rent a DVD. You aren't missing anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is far from being perfect. It is also far from being one of the worst movies I have seen like some reviewers claim.The movie delivers quite nicely in several areas It kept me entertained throughout the full length of it. The cinematography is daring and plain beautiful. The acting is alright but nothing special. The combination of film noir with very modern imagery and dialogue was weird but interesting to see. The whole woven in metaphorical lines and puns look at some light effects in the bar! about particle physics were funny and entertaining to me but then again I am a physicist.... But they did not really help the plot or the characters and seemed a little unmotivated and far fetched.I have to admit though that the storyline of the movie seemed a little halfbaked. Take a cup of David Lynch weirdness a few spoons of sciency talk a bit of crime genre love story and a few twists and turns for the viewer. No this does not give you a good story if mixed together.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is far from being perfect. It is also far from being one of the worst movies I have seen like some reviewers claim.The movie delivers quite nicely in several areas It kept me entertained throughout the full length of it. The cinematography is daring and plain beautiful. The acting is alright but nothing special. The combination of film noir with very modern imagery and dialogue was weird but interesting to see. The whole woven in metaphorical lines and puns look at some light effects in the bar! about particle physics were funny and entertaining to me but then again I am a physicist.... But they did not really help the plot or the characters and seemed a little unmotivated and far fetched.I have to admit though that the storyline of the movie seemed a little halfbaked. Take a cup of David Lynch weirdness a few spoons of sciency talk a bit of crime genre love story and a few twists and turns for the viewer. No this does not give you a good story if mixed together. It gives you a strange movie unlike any other. And if it wasn't so well made this movie would really have sucked given those ingredients.Overall I can say that the movie was entertaining mainly for its stylish mood and look but nothing that I would recommend as a mustsee to my friends.";

	schema:reviewBody "Antonio Banderas stars as Ned a detective who has just acquired a new client. A giant man with anger issues who is looking for the love of his life a sexy woman whom he's never met. He was stuck in prison and she kept his hope alive by writing to him. Now he's out and is looking for her. Along the way Ned finds himself being followed and dead bodies turn up everywhere. Is there more to this case than meets the eye?The short answer is no. The Big Bang is a film that promises much and delivers little. I'm a lover of detective flicks. Film Noir is one of my favourite genres and this flick looked promising and at the very least visually pleasing. It succeeded on the latter portion since the film is drenched is vibrant colours that wouldn't exist in a normal realistic setting. Each room has it's own colour scheme we go from green to yellow to red to purple. All the colours of the spectrum are portrayed here and it's enough to grab your sense. The story on the other hand is enough to bore you out of the experience. We meet Ned in an interrogation room where three cops are questioning him about the events that lead up to his current situation. So a good portion of the film is told in flashbacks from Ned's perspective. His character is the classic film noir detective minus the outfit. The character himself has zero relateability and is not interesting enough for a lead. The case itself isn't interesting enough. We are on the quest to find a woman and at some points during the film we wonder is she even exists. A subplot to the story is Chris Elliott's character a billionaire reclusive who is looking for the God Particle. It's very science fiction in parts and his quest for such a thing leads the the inevitable climax which is right out of the film 2012. The sad part is that the film is not interesting enough to keep your attention. It might be pretty to look at but for a film that relies so heavily on the mystery of the film noir genre it fails to attract attention. There are parts of the film that I don't get because I think I started to day dream while it was on. I got the gist of it and the answers behind the questions regarding the missing girl are so uneventful that you wish you never began. The film comes off a w wacky out of this world depiction of the genre but it really isn't. The colours and one or two scenes are unique but the film as a whole is just a messy script with mediocre direction. As stated before the cinematography is the highlight.I can't recommend this flick it's not out there enough to please Lynch fans and it's not Film noir enough to please Chinatown fans. Instead it feels like a missed opportunity. A cool credit sequence might get you excited but the lack of direction in the story will leave you deflated.".

	onyx:emotionText "Antonio Banderas stars as Ned a detective who has just acquired a new client. A giant man with anger issues who is looking for the love of his life a sexy woman whom he's never met. He was stuck in prison and she kept his hope alive by writing to him. Now he's out and is looking for her. Along the way Ned finds himself being followed and dead bodies turn up everywhere. Is there more to this case than meets the eye?The short answer is no. The Big Bang is a film that promises much and delivers little. I'm a lover of detective flicks. Film Noir is one of my favourite genres and this flick looked promising and at the very least visually pleasing. It succeeded on the latter portion since the film is drenched is vibrant colours that wouldn't exist in a normal realistic setting. Each room has it's own colour scheme we go from green to yellow to red to purple. All the colours of the spectrum are portrayed here and it's enough to grab your sense. The story on the other hand is enough to bore you out of the experience.

I had no idea what it was about no idea when it was released or how well it did in the box office. I just figured that it couldn't be worse than Ecks vs. Sever.Ten minutes in I was hooked. I know some people won't like the extreme visual style hard juxtaposition and modern take on Nior style but I found it interesting. As for the plot it kept me guessing wrong to the very end.As far as the acting goes I thought it was good. Banderas I almost always like. Sienna Guillory I'd never heard of and Sam Elliot in a role I would have NEVER imagined him in. The movie is full of good supporting actors too. Thomas Kretschmann Bill Duke William Fichtner and move. Everyone does a good job.The stand out for me was the quirky character of Fay Neman played by Autumn Reeser. She and Banderas share the chattiest love scene ever and redefine physics geeks.I enjoyed this movie and I'll watch it again. It's strange but compelling and worth the hour and a half.".

It's a reasonably clever gimmick that's mostly pulled off well and at least ties in with the climactic denouement.

The 1970's 1980's and the early 1990's were the hay day for these kinds of films. Films such as Piranha and Piranha II Space Rage Moon 44 Rising Storm and the endless serial killerhorror movies to name a few. Things began to change in the mid 1990's and the invention of the DVD but I really believe it was the endless the many B movie companies and the Big ones seeing the chance to make money decided to get involved also which put more money and better stars into the movies. Stars like Eric Roberts Keith David Val Kilmer Michael Maidson Roy Schieder Samuel L. Jackson James Woods and above average to good films like End Game Unthinkable The Peacekeeper Chaos Executive Target Edison and Streets of Blood to name a few. Direct to DVD isn't a bad thing anymore and a quiet a few of them are as good if not better than films being release in theaters now which leads me to The Big Bang.The Big Bang is a suspensedramacomedy starring Antonio Banderas William Fichtner Sienna Guillory Thomas Kretschmann and Delroy Lindo. The plot follows Ned Cruz Antonio Banderas waking up in a police interrogation room with three police officers Detective Poley William Fichtner Detective Skeres Deloroy Lindo and Dectective Frizer Thomas Kretschmann. The three detectives begin to question Ned and Ned begins his story which he tells in the first person and narrates it. The story starts up when private detective Ned Cruz is finishing up a case for a high profile and eccentric actor Johnny Nova played well by James Van Der Beek. What ensues is funny as Johnny Nova's house blows up after Ned leaves with his payment nearly killing him. Ned is questioned by Det Frizer but let go. Ned returns to his office and about to head out when Anton Protopov Robert Maillet asks Ned to find a woman names Lexie Persimmon Sienna Guillory who had been writing him in prison. The thrilling suspensedrama ensues mixed beautifully with comedy.The acting was superb although Kretschmann Lindo and Fichtner don't have to do much in the film. That being said their still brought out their A games and made their characters interesting. Banderas was excellent in this film mixing a straight face with comedy wonderfully. In my opinion the minor actors steal the show. Sam Elliott Simon Kestral playing a recluse billionaire Robert Maillet who is a huge and scary man plays a very likable character. Jimmi Simpson Niels Geck who plays the lead scientist for Simon's experiment. Then there is Sienna Guillory the beautiful actress who by the end the movie has stole the show with her beauty and acting. There is even Snoop Dog who plays a porn director who did a good job and as always enjoyed his scenes.The action was few and far between but it works for this film. I find that most Hollywood films coming out now try to stuff action down our throats. I can understand why most Americans now don't have long attention spans so studios have to have explosion car chase or someone being killed every five minutes. I think that hurts films it takes away from the story the actors and characters which makes a good film into an average one or a bad film into an average one. The Big Bang doesn't try to stuff violence and action down your throats. It doesn't have to it has a great story with good acting and decent action.Overall this is a great film and better than many movies that have come out into the theaters recently. I gave this film 55 stars and recommend everyone see this. I don't think you'll be disappointed.".

That is just a plain true fact trust me...This is one of those films that add SO much style and imagination that if you are the kind of person like me who loves this kind of groovy stuff then this movie will strike you as totally unique and mind blowing. However... if you are also like a lot of other people and God bless 'em... who are not into these kinds of visual 'Artsy' UltraStylish Crime Thrillers then this movie will likely leave you flatter than Chaz Bono... Needless to say this is an EXTREMELY polarizing film and highly subjective in it's entertainment value depending on who's watching it. Let me put it this way. If you like visually stylized films that are clearly NOT 'Realistic' but almost have a more Adult Fairy Tale quality to them AND if you are into Physics or Science or even Metaphysics or Philosophy then I think you will find a lot to like here.I will admit that I am a TOTAL sucker for these kinds of films. But then again my imagination tends to burn in overdrive and I love just about ANYTHING that incorporates clever creativity Now although I DO love many of his films I am not quite talking about the cartoon extremes of Tim Burton here but films on a more serious Adult level Another clue as to why I like this film is that one of my VERY favourite directors is David Lynch. Now granted Lynch works more in the deep murky recesses of the Dark Unconscious but the level of creative imagination here is somewhat along these lines. I notice that even in 'Official' reviews that a number of reviewers who I normally read and check what they have to say about films quickly dismiss this movie as pretentious and of little substance but I absolutely disagree...Again this kind of film like any form of Art Poetry Music or Humour is HIGHLY subjective where many will appreciate and love it and equally many will find it leaves them cold. So it is a VERY hard film to review and give a balanced impression as to why I really liked it and yet in all fairness also warn those who's sense of 'Realism' believability or normalcy may seriously be put off by it. I'm not sure if the term 'Magic Realism' quite applies here but it kind of reminds me of other films which have been described that way.As far as the premise is concerned and others here have mentioned it it is very similar to 1944's 'MURDER MY SWEET' an excellent Film Noir starring Dick Powell and Claire Trevor. But take that film drop some high quality acid or some nice Shrooms modernize it and add what I personally felt were some intriguing thoughts about Science The Big Bang Theory thus the title and Physics and add some effective toughguy acting a Noirish mood excellent visuals and you pretty much end up with this movie.So the best I can say is that you absolutely HAVE to have a great imagination or at least appreciate really imaginative things you CAN'T be a hard core 'Realist' who likes there films to be very concrete and believable and 'Normal' and if you can appreciate some really nice atmospheric visuals and not to mention a truly BEAUTIFULLY rendered Bluray then there is a good chance that you might like this film...This is a rare case where I have rated this film more according to how I feel instead of more objectively as I normally do because of the special type of film. So an '8' to me maybe a 67 for others in general...".

A fitting Rock soundtrack with a spot on sensational look make this an entertaining diversion.The shortcomings are Banderas heavy accent that makes some of the narration and dialog a little hard to decipher but after awhile it doesn't seem so intrusive and the ending with the particle accelerator is a fizzle of a finale but the trip there is well worth the journey.".

A fitting Rock soundtrack with a spot on sensational look make this an entertaining diversion.The shortcomings are Banderas heavy accent that makes some of the narration and dialog a little hard to decipher but after awhile it doesn't seem so intrusive and the ending with the particle accelerator is a fizzle of a finale but the trip there is well worth the journey.";

The younger actor playing Piersall as a kid was no better than Perkins in this regard. Neither had a clue how to a throw a ball. It looks corny nowadays.Oh well.

I thought what I saw of it was great. But the whole time I kept thinking of Perkins as Norman Bates. After I saw the whole thing for the very first time I thought of Tony Perkins in a whole new way. The scenes of him losing it and the scene where he stands up to his father are great. Good baseball scenes too. Very very good acting by Perkins. Malden was good too as Jimmy Piersall's over demanding father. Norma Moore is good as Piersall's wife Mary. This movie has great music by Elmer Bernstein who's music is always great. The theme really sets the tone for a dramatic movie. This is a great sports movie biopic and drama. So be sure not to miss it. I recommend it to everyone. It shows that becoming a professional ball player or in this case an allstar outfielder for the Boston Red Sox doesn't come easy. My favorite part is where Piersall puts on his hat and walks out to go back to playing baseball for the first time after his recovery. That was a very inspiring scene. See this movie and you will love it. There is nothing to hate about it. Believe me you will not be disappointed".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't find movies about illnesses whether they are physical or mental real or fictitious to be entertaining maybe informative or educational so I am approaching my criticism of this movie from the baseball aspect. Jimmy Piersall was quite a character. He overcame a mental breakdown to become one of the greatest outfielders in baseball history. He was a real crowd pleaser with his fielding and antics but his hitting left a lot to be desired. He just about ruined his arm showing off how far and hard he could throw the ball. When he hit his 100th homerun he ran the bases backwards. Living near Boston I saw him play ball on many occasions and I met him in person at a First National Supermarket opening in Lawrence Mass. He signed a baseball and a photograph of himself for me but I had to buy two bags of potato chips Cains I think it was beforehand. As a kid I could barely afford it but more than fifty years later I still have the ball and photo. What a thrill it was! I remember him as being handsome and big and strong not a skinny guy like Anthony Perkins. As far as the movie goes it was good but not very accurate. Did you notice the obvious padding to Perkin's shoulders to make him look bulky? He looked like he never played baseball in real life he was so awkward. Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig and William Bendix as Babe Ruth also looked pretty bad in their baseball movies. Did you notice that the stock footage was of Fenway Park but whenever Perkins was playing they showed some minor league park? Just look at the outfield background that's not Fenway. What really bothers me is that they only mention one real life Red Sox person Joe Cronin and that was wrong it should have been Pinky Higgins. What happened to Ted Williams Jackie Jensen my all time favorite Red Sox player Dom Dimaggio Bobby Doerr Johnny Pesky and a bunch of others who played on the team with Piersall? Ted's career was actually extended because Piersall was so good as a fielder that he used to run from center to left to catch flyballs so that Williams didn't have to tire himself out trying to get to them. Piersall was eventually traded to another team so all his euphoria about playing for the Bosox didn't last. Still with all its' faults and disappointments this movie is well worth watching especially for baseball fans.".

The second half of the film deals with Piersalls mental breakdown and subsequent treatment and recovery.  While watching a ball game on TV he makes remarks that his doctor picks up on and uses to unlock the reason why he cracked up.    These same circumstances are no doubt still occurring today as many parents push their children relentlessly in everything from sports to academics to beauty pageants.

	schema:reviewBody "As a previous reviewer said Anthony Perkins did not exactly look like Frank Merriwell out on the field during the baseball scenes but the film is about the true story of Boston Red Sox centerfielder Jimmy Piersall who sustained a nervous breakdown and then came back to have a pretty respectable major league career.Showing the personal road Piersall took towards that breakdown is where Anthony Perkins gives one of his great film performances. This film is a lot like I'll Cry Tomorrow where Jo Van Fleet was pushing the career of her daughter Susan Hayward as Lillian Roth so she could have the success that her daughter had vicariously.That's where the other great performance in the film comes in. Karl Malden is the baseball father someone with the same dreams that his son become a major league ballplayer. Malden's success involved being on his factory team he wanted more and when he couldn't have it drove his son relentlessly to learn the skills and make the grade. But it was some price for Piersall to pay.I remember Jimmy Piersall as a player when I was a lad. He played for the Red Sox in the years of the Casey Stengel Yankee juggernaut. He was a good contact hitter didn't hit much for power but played a flawless centerfield. The Red Sox in the Fifties had little to cheer about. There was a pitching staff of Mel Parnell and a bunch of nobodies. There infield was from hunger with the exception of third baseman Frank Malzone who came up in 1956 the last year Parnell played. But the outfield gave New England something to cheer about with Piersall in center Jackie Jensen in right and Ted Williams playing with his back to the Green Monster in left. Piersall covered so much ground in center field he made it real easy on both Williams and Jensen. The Red Sox let him go to the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961 where he finished his career. Still he's a Red Sox legend.The story had been previously done on TV's Climax Theater with Tab Hunter as Piersall. In his recent memoirs Tab said that he had hoped to do the screen version. At the time he was involved in a relationship with Anthony Perkins. Unbeknownst to Hunter Perkins lobbied and got the part in the film. That sort of put a damper on the relationship.I also echo other reviewers in wishing that some of Piersall's teammates and others in the Red Sox organization had been portrayed. Only Joe Cronin who was the General Manager at the time is shown on the screen. Legendary owner Tom Yawkey is not portrayed and that is a pity.Interestingly enough Piersall may have gotten his chance with the Red Sox because of Joe Cronin's racist policies. The Red Sox were the last team in the major leagues to integrate. I remember that very well when Pumpsie Green became their first black player two years after Fear Strikes Out was released. Fear Strikes Out is unfortunately a two person show with Perkins and Malden the only really developed characters in the film. But those are two very talented persons indeed.".

	onyx:emotionText "As a previous reviewer said Anthony Perkins did not exactly look like Frank Merriwell out on the field during the baseball scenes but the film is about the true story of Boston Red Sox centerfielder Jimmy Piersall who sustained a nervous breakdown and then came back to have a pretty respectable major league career.Showing the personal road Piersall took towards that breakdown is where Anthony Perkins gives one of his great film performances. This film is a lot like I'll Cry Tomorrow where Jo Van Fleet was pushing the career of her daughter Susan Hayward as Lillian Roth so she could have the success that her daughter had vicariously.That's where the other great performance in the film comes in. Karl Malden is the baseball father someone with the same dreams that his son become a major league ballplayer. Malden's success involved being on his factory team he wanted more and when he couldn't have it drove his son relentlessly to learn the skills and make the grade. But it was some price for Piersall to pay.I remember Jimmy Piersall as a player when I was a lad. He played for the Red Sox in the years of the Casey Stengel Yankee juggernaut. He was a good contact hitter didn't hit much for power but played a flawless centerfield. The Red Sox in the Fifties had little to cheer about. There was a pitching staff of Mel Parnell and a bunch of nobodies. There infield was from hunger with the exception of third baseman Frank Malzone who came up in 1956 the last year Parnell played. But the outfield gave New England something to cheer about with Piersall in center Jackie Jensen in right and Ted Williams playing with his back to the Green Monster in left. Piersall covered so much ground in center field he made it real easy on both Williams and Jensen. The Red Sox let him go to the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961 where he finished his career. Still he's a Red Sox legend.The story had been previously done on TV's Climax Theater with Tab Hunter as Piersall. In his recent memoirs Tab said that he had hoped to do the screen version. At the time he was involved in a relationship with Anthony Perkins. Unbeknownst to Hunter Perkins lobbied and got the part in the film. That sort of put a damper on the relationship.I also echo other reviewers in wishing that some of Piersall's teammates and others in the Red Sox organization had been portrayed. Only Joe Cronin who was the General Manager at the time is shown on the screen. Legendary owner Tom Yawkey is not portrayed and that is a pity.Interestingly enough Piersall may have gotten his chance with the Red Sox because of Joe Cronin's racist policies. The Red Sox were the last team in the major leagues to integrate. I remember that very well when Pumpsie Green became their first black player two years after Fear Strikes Out was released. Fear Strikes Out is unfortunately a two person show with Perkins and Malden the only really developed characters in the film. But those are two very talented persons indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jimmy Piersall Anthony Perkins was a major league baseball player an exceptional outfielder and a lousy hitter. He had an overbearing perfectionist for a father Karl Malden was socially awkward suffered from severe bipolar disorder and paranoid delusions and fought with his teammates. That is pretty much where the similarities between Fear Strikes Out and reality end.The story takes place in the early 1950s. Little was known about mental illness and there were few if any psychiatric medications. There wasn't much beyond talk therapy and electroconvulsive therapy then known as electroshock treatment. Unfortunately Jim responded to neither. He spent most of his rookie year in a psych hospital.In one chilling although probably invented scene psychiatrist Dr. Brown asks if he wants to watch a ball game. Jim doesn't respond so the doctor flips on a game. A hitter doesn't extend a double into a triple a play which Jim comments that his father would never approved of. As the conversation moves from baseball to Jim's father Jim realizes If it wasn't for my father I wouldn't be where I am today! The film ended in typical Hollywood fashion with Piersall returning to the team in 1953. I thought the roll of his wife Mary played ably by Norma Moore was badly underwritten. There was no mention of the fact that his mother also suffered from mental illness.As a study of mental illness and its effects on a man his family his coworkers and his career Fear Strikes Out is a very good movie. Trouble is that it is so loaded with historical inaccuracies mistakes and dramatic license that the person upon whose experiences the story is based distanced himself from the movie.".

But for a film in the mid50s it provided quite a punch in conveying the agony of growing up with a loving but very demanding father. When I saw it in the theater I never questioned Anthony Perkins as a teenager in the first part today this is much more difficult to swallow. Even though dated somewhat the film is still worth a watch.Karl Malden is excellent as a father driven by his own sense of failure to attempt to live vicariously through his son.  As a result he literally orchestrates his son's life. Never accepting the glory' of the moment he places constant expectations and demands on his son. Possibly this is Malden's best role.Tony Perkins has some fine moments of anguish and neuroticism as the ball player Jimmy Piersall. One scene between his father and him after his breakdown is superbly acted with Perkins running through a panoply of emotions. That this emotional turmoil is somewhat subdued is to the credit of the film. Norma Moore gives a competent and rather understated performance as his wife. The doctor played by Adam Williams is appropriately comforting but he's not up to delivering the big line especially in his intense scene with Malden.  Regretfully Perry Wilson as Piersall's submissive mother didn't have more of a role.Some very nice photography using the angularity of steps and bleachers and railroad stations conveys the underlying jaggedness and tension of emotions. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is effective in supporting the mood of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though I have noted this to be a spoiler review I will mark the few spoilers within the comment.In reality Jimmy Piersall was a gifted outfielder who battled bipolar disorder throughout his life especially during his playing days in a time when lithium had not yet been discovered as a drug treatment for the disorder. If anyone wonders that treatment began in 1958. That's not the character the film portrays. Instead this Jim Piersall Who is oddly never called Jimmy considering that he is almost exclusively known as Jimmy in reality. is a kid presumably only 23 years old at the film's close based on his reallife history pushed too hard too far and too fast by his father resulting in a mental breakdown that requires him to face his true feelings about his father. However as long as one does not expect to see the lifelong bipolar disorder struggle portrayed this film does easily merit the viewing.The easiest part of the film to appreciate is the excellent acting especially by the alwaysexcellent Anthony Perkins. Perkins manages to convey such varying emotions and degrees of emotion that it boggles the mind. He ranges everywhere from an insane anger to a subtle feeling of pain hidden under a look of beaming happiness and does so with a dexterity rarely found in any actor. Karl Malden also deserves some credit for an excellent performance as the driving overbearingbutloving father. He never needs any dialogue to tell us how he feels about his son or why he pushes Jim the way he does because his face tells it all. No other characters in the film really gave the actor the opportunity to show tremendous ability.However the direction is also excellent. Robert Mulligan reinforces his film's themes with constant images showing Jim behind or between bars as though he is trapped in his path until of course the mental hospital where such visual entrapment never occurs. He even goes so far as to show John Piersall handing his son a letter saying that scouts from the Boston Red Sox are coming to town to see him a scene that would seem to bring the two together as they have nearly accomplished their shared goal with a fence separating them. The scene is one of the most poignant in all of film history. Even the ending of the film is shot with a particular eye to detail that rewards the careful viewer.Note This paragraph is about hints from close viewing so there are some small spoilers. None should hinder enjoyment of the film but one should be warned. There are also a number of subtle hints that seem to suggest that Piersall's problem is more than a temporary breakdown. First of all his father at one point tells his mother I don't want you going away again suggesting that perhaps she has the same issues Jim does. Secondly the conclusion of the film is ambiguous showing a beaming Jim Piersall headed onto the field of play bathed in a heroic heavenly bright overhead light but doing so from such a distance as to suggest that perhaps this ending isn't assured. These elements may have been to suggest the bipolar disorder from which Piersall actually suffered while presenting his case as it would have appeared at the time it occurred. The original Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appeared in 1952 so certainly bipolar disorder's existence was already established and the term was coined around the turn of the century by Emil Kreiplin if memory serves and could have been incorporated into the film. It's an interesting close viewing element of the film at least. Spoilers over Overall Fear Strikes Out may have been something of a distortion of reality and obviously Jimmy Piersall himself thought so and it probably oversimplifies Piersall's psychological problems but it does tell its own story beautifully and artfully with incredible performances and spoton direction. The only real issue I have with the film is the score which was so overdramatic as to undercut the real emotion of the film. It is definitely recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Astonishing how obsessive some people can get when it comes to their favourite sports. Thankfully in Europe baseball is hardly known which allows us to get beyond appearances and enjoy one of the most honest emotionally raw acting ever recorded on film. This is one of Anthony Perkins' best performances ever  the fact that it was only his third movie makes it even more amazing but obviously Academy voters in that year had too much baseball in their minds to appreciate such a wonderful unique actor. The first time I saw this film I was a 9 year old with some father issues. This film was a huge shock and got me interested in psychotherapy at a very early age. Many scenes stayed embedded in my mind for years Tony in the baseball field alone at night his breakdown in the field his fear of his father when he has an accident all his exchanges with his father.... It's not just a tremendous acting turn though. It's a beautiful mature realistic movie the kind they used to make at that time in Hollywood influenced by TV drama and Italian neorealism and they seemed to have forgotten how to make in this Lords of the Star Wars of Narnia age of childish entertainment. It could be used as an exhibit in the case for the regression to childhood of the American consciousness. I've read Tab Hunter's enormously entertaining book  which I recommend to any lover of Hollywood's golden age  and even he admits he couldn't have made a better job than Tony did. Once in a while the right part goes to the actor who deserves it most. Fear Strikes Out is a true classic and Anthony Perkins' acting is a masterclass of the first order with as much fire and urgency as anything by Brando and Dean. In fact as a film director I'm showing this film to the young leading man in my next movie as reference and inspiration. Wish me luck!".

	schema:reviewBody "A basedonfact story of Jimmy Piersall a major league player of the 1950s who suffered what looks like a major depression with some paranoid ideas. Not much could be done with major league mental illnesses at the time before the French accidentally discovered antipsychotic meds. The movie ends as all such movies do whenever possible on an upbeat note with Piersall Tony Perkins returning to the Red Sox after defeating his demons.I have no idea how closely the movie sticks to the real facts of Piersall's life but it certainly hews close to the formula line. Basically everything is blamed on Piersall's father Karl Malden who pushed the kid too hard brutally sometimes to excel. Nothing would do but that Piersall not only play for the Sox but that he play the OUTFIELD. Shortstop wasn't good enough. Poor kid. While still in the minors in Scranton he brags to his pop that he's the third highest hitter in the league. Malden smiles and says Well that's not first. Think about that next time your kid comes home with a B plus on his report card. You want to drive him nuts? I don't doubt that Piersall's father was pushy about his son's training and career. For all we know there may be as many sports fathers as there are stage mothers. But it seems a bit unfair to make him the sole heavy. It's not easy to drive someone crazy not as easy as it seems in the movies anyway. It helps a lot especially with major affective disorders if you bring something genetic to the party as numerous studies have shown. Not that genetics explains everything because one identical twin may get it while the other doesn't.Anyway the movie isn't very satisfying as a movie. The director Robert Mulligan has done better work elsewhere. And Tony Perkins gives a bythenumbers performance as a madman with his facial muscles trembling and his eyes bulging. How primitive can you get? He was a much better if entirely different kind of psychotic in Psycho. An improved script might have helped him. Malden is okay as the wellmeaning but destructive father whom Perkins finally tells off at the cathartic climax. Perkins' wife's role is underwritten and doesn't contribute much as Malden's potential rival.It would have been nice too if we'd seen a little more about baseball the sport and the career ladder and less of the formulaic material on having a breakdown. At least your performance on the baseball diamond is something you can do something about. In the grip of mental illness like Piersall's you're practically helpless and that's not too dramatic.".

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite series of baseball cards as a kid was the 1958 Topps set and I remember having a Jim Piersall in the mix. So that was two years after this film came out and I never knew about Piersall's struggle with mental illness until a little while ago prompting me to seek out this picture. Once the story gets under way it reveals a rather simplistic yet very real trauma in the life of young Piersall a domineering father vicariously living his dreams through the efforts and success of his son. Karl Malden and Anthony Perkins effectively portray their respective characters and the story pretty much seesaws it's way between Jimmy's attempts to live up to his father's expectations and generally failing to meet them. When Jimmy proudly declares he's third in the minor leagues in hitting Dad's response is Well that isn't first. There's only so much of that you can take.Interestingly there were understated references to the idea that mom Piersall Perry Wilson was also troubled with bouts of depression and mental illness. Her frequent absences from home and family was mentioned a couple times and I took that as a subtle hint that young Piersall might have been prone to his condition by virtue of heredity and reinforced by the demands of the father. Another reviewer mentions this and though I haven't verified it myself it was something that crossed my mind while watching the film.One thing that could have been handled better by the film makers would have been to put the story into a historical time line. As I mentioned earlier I can place Piersall in context playing baseball during my own youth but it would have been helpful if the movie offered places and dates with on screen graphics. For example Piersall reached the Majors in 1950 after signing on with the Red Sox organization a couple of years earlier. No mention of teammates or well known opposing players was ever mentioned thereby missing an opportunity to depict how others around him were reacting to his behavior. We did get that one fight near the dugout and the climb up the fencing to set up his hospitalization but a little more context would have been helpful.I thought Anthony Perkins was pretty effective in his portrayal here he gets those spooky eyes every now and then like the time he found himself alone at night in the empty stadium. I could see how it was the sort of thing that would recommend him for the role of stuffing birds in Hitchcock's Psycho. As for the real life Jimmy Piersall who's still alive he went on to a fairly successful big league career encompassing seventeen seasons. It was with a bit of whimsical insight that he wrote in his autobiography  Probably the best thing that ever happened to me was going nuts. Who ever heard of Jimmy Piersall until that happened?".

	schema:reviewBody "This story is about former Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jimmy Piersall and his bout with and conquest of mental illness. Before we get into the film we should look at the real man and his public life much of which was witnessed by us Chicago Baseball Aficianados. Bet you thought I' say 'Fans! Jimmy Piersall was an outfielder in the Major Leagues from his debut in 1950 to his last game in 1967. He retired from Baseball with a very respectable .272 Lifetime Batting Average and a phenomenal Lifetime Fielding Average of .998!! That's damn near perfect! Piersall played for The Boston Red Sox his local teamThe Cleavland Indians The Washington Senators and The Los AngelesCalifornia Angels.Jim never did play for one of our Chicago teams neither The Cubs nor my team The White Sox. He did make a good name with the fans here by way of becoming Baseball Broadcaster.He arrived on the scene in 1977 and was teamed with Harry Caray to do the White Sox games. The way that Mr. Caray and company operated then allowed announcers to split time between the tube and the radio.Their styles and personalities meshed perfectly and in the short 3 or so seasons they were together we were treated to really great TV and Radio. And that's not just in the area of Sports. It got to be that the CarayPiersall act was the greatest thing on TV period. They pulled no punches in their commentaries on the Televised Games a practice that did not go over in many circles other than the Public the Fans if you will. There I said it! Even though they were separated after not too longplayers owners and the League's Office did not have much of a sense of humor. Piersall lost his Color ManAnalyst job and Harry Caray defected choosing to go North to Wrigley Field and The Cubs. Jimmy had various Sports Talk Shows and continues to this day in being a Baseball Analyst for one Chicago Radio Station or another. He still resides in the Greater Metropolitan Chicagoland Area. The film is similar to a lot of other Hollywood Sports films which runs the gambit from PRIDE OF THE YANKEES 1942 to RUDY 1993. It does however turn very serious very quickly as the story shows a young boy Jimmy trying harder and harder to improve his Baseball skills to please his Father. The Father Karl Malden is characterized as being a sort of slav driver of a coach. Obviously living his vicariously through young Jimmy's talents and desire he over manages the boy to the point of doing all his dealings with coaches and eventually with the Manager and Front Office of the Red Sox.Coming up to start the new season with the Big League Club Jim is switched from being an Outfielder to Shortstop. He cracks under pressure and is hospitalized.The very sympathetic Physciatrist patiently works to build the young man's confidence. In one session after the Doctor questions him about his father's role. After becoming somewhat defensive Jim abruptly blurts out My Father is the reason that I'm where I am today! a profoundly truthful and revealing statement.Jim recovers Mr. Piersall apparently was counseled as he was more aware of his overbearing attitude. Jimmy returns to Baseball. Did they live happily ever after? Well there was no pretense of this because Piersall was still an active Major Leaguer at the time of the release of FEAR STRIKES OUT.Jim Piersall said many times that the story was highly embellished by Hollywood referring particularly to the scene where Anthony Perkins as Piersall snaps during a game and starts climbing a screen at Fenway Park. It never happened. He added that because of the payment by Paramount Pictures for the Screen Rights he and his family were able to really improve their lives financially.Once again you Parents of Little League Players Junior Football or whatever Sport be the kids Girls or Boys please watch this film and heed its lessons! PLEASE!! Jimmy Piersall never seemed to shy away from talking about his breakdown. He even said he capitalized on having reputation as a 'flake'his wordswhile an active player. When doing a White Sox telecast during a discussion Harry Caray slipped saying You're crazy Jimmy! To which he replied Yes I am Harry! And I've got the papers to prove it! It seems an awful lot of Cub Fans forget Harry's 12 seasons with the Sox not to mention 1 with Oakland A's and 20 some as voice of the St. Louis Caedinals where he started his Broadcast Career. Wow! Hows that for redundancy get it? Greater Chicagoland Metropolitan Area! Ha Ha.....!!".

When doing a White Sox telecast during a discussion Harry Caray slipped saying You're crazy Jimmy! To which he replied Yes I am Harry! And I've got the papers to prove it! It seems an awful lot of Cub Fans forget Harry's 12 seasons with the Sox not to mention 1 with Oakland A's and 20 some as voice of the St. Louis Caedinals where he started his Broadcast Career. Wow! Hows that for redundancy get it? Greater Chicagoland Metropolitan Area! Ha Ha.....!!";

What do Gary Cooper Dan Dailey Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Stewart have in common? Two things. First all were goodlooking virile screen presences and all appeared in some outstanding movies and gave outstanding performances. Second all starred in baseball movies portraying prominent reallife baseball stars and none of them exhibited the least bit of capability to throw or catch a baseball or swing a bat. If any of them had attended your family picnic not one of these guys except for his celebrity would have been better than a lateround choice in a chooseup softball game  even including a group with your fat Uncle Al elderly Aunt Edna etc.On the other hand Dennis Quaid Kevin Costner and some others  particularly Robert Redford  have appeared in baseball movies and given performances which make them appear capable of leaving the set and suitingup with the Dodgers Yankees or another major.However Perkins makes Cooper Reagan Dailey and Stewart all look like Albert Pujols or Pedro Martinez. If you gave a ball and gloves say to two Bulgarian 10yearold girls who had never seen either they could appear more adept at playing catch than Perkins and Karl Malden did in this flick.I lived in Chicago some years ago when Harry Caray announced the White Sox games in old Comiskey Park with Jimmy Piersall as his sidekick and color man. Piersall was thoroughly interesting and engaging in this position and entertainingly outspoken and still occasionally a bit over the edge. While not an alltime super star he was an excellent player and the latter portions of this film were a large part of the picture's focus displaying with the severe problems he had and subsequently overcame.But another aspect is that displaying his normal film persona Perkins was probably the one actor who could display even more neurotic tendencies angst and hyperoutrageous actions than Piersall did in his reallife trials.Still a good story and even more interesting now as something of a period piece both in terms of the time period shown and the film style when made.This is a film where they should have used actual footage or a standin at long range whenever possible instead of displaying Perkins' baseball ineptitude.p.s. If Tony Perkins had attended the family picnic for the softball game would have been best to let him perhaps keep score and make certain nobody tripped over the bats.".

I think every father with a son in sports should be required to see this filmespecially after what we've seen recently with regard to parents in fist fights at their sons' Little League games. If ever there was an overbearing driving patriarchal figure trying to live out his past inadequacies through his son in sports Jimmy Piersall's father was he. In fact I watch this movie not so much for the Jimmy Piersall story so much as to see Karl Malden's portrayal of John Piersall! Of course we don't know how much is embellished but if Mr. Piersall was even half of what is depicted in this movie it is little wonder that Jimmy Piersall once hit a home run and ran around the bases backwards...Could anyone play a more ironfisted character than Karl Malden? Watch PARRISH 1963 or BOMBERS B52 sometime to see the equal of Piersall's Dad in FEAR STRIKES OUT. And Piersall's mother? Again no one knows how accurate the depiction is but she is a ghost presence and if that is true it's just another nail in Piersall's psychological coffin.Even watching this movie as a kid I was uncomfortable seeing Piersall pounded cruelly again and again by his Dad to do better to go higher to do more. Once he's romanced by The Boston Red Sox Mr. Piersall becomes Jimmy's indispensable advisor. All of this grows until Jimmy can do nothing without consulting Dad. The result is his father's eternal presence between his ears and the classic breakdown scene at the park when Piersall climbs the fence an unforgettable moment especially if you see this as an adolescent.Reviews concerning Anthony Perkins'lack of athletic ability always come up when this movie is discussed. Actually this was characteristic of most sports movie bio's back in the 1940's and 1950's. Watch William Bendix as Babe Ruth Ronald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander or Dan Daily as Dizzy Dean. Routine throwing and catching resembles something you used to see a nerd do at school recess. And this movie quirk wasn't present in baseball films only.I've always wondered just who this movie is about Jimmy Piersall or his father? The scene in which the psychiatrist confronts Mr. Piersall at the sanitarium is painful and very sad. I've also always wondered just what Piersall's thoughts must have been when this movie hit the screens for his was still active in the major leagues. How many teams did Jimmy Piersall play for? How many fist fights? And his announcing career? Full of controversy. Maybe it would have all happened without John Piersall but it is doubtful. Next time a boy wishes his father was more into sports remind him of John Piersall.Exhibit 'A' for all fathers living vicariously through the sports achievements of their sons. Dennis Caracciolo".

Jimmy tried to please his Dad in his attempt to make the Major Leagues. When Jimmy finished third in a batting race in the minor leagues. Father Piersall took the wind out of Jimmie's sails by snubbing the effort which was the common theme in causing Jimmie's apparent metal breakdown. Both actors melded well against each other and I liked the stark expressions on Perkins face as the forceful Father picks at him time after time pushing Jimmy over the edge. Fine job of acting as well for the curious Psychiatrist Doctor Brown Adam Williams as a restrained Piersall in full straight jacket is fighting to get out for more physical violence. Dr. Brown just looks at the tragic ball player and say quite simply So your Jim Piersall! Mr. Piersall tries to undermine the Doctor by sneaking into the hospital against his orders of visiting his very disturbed son. All I can tell you is leave the flowers and candy at home. Perkins acting was adequate until he picked up a baseball. The real Jimmy Piersall was flabbergasted by seeing his self portrait destroyed on screen by a lanky doofus who throws a ball like a girl. Other goofs mare this sports drama as Jimmy seems to wear a different uniform from the rest of the team. The Physical aspects were overlooked by director Robert Mulligan as Anthony Perkins can stab a woman in a shower with vigor in Psycho but on a ball field his body language reminded me more of Tommy Tune or Richard Chamberlain. I grade this attempt four out of ten Red Sox tickets.".

Obviously the idea of writing a fulllength feature film still needed some work.  Characters are simply introduced doing things as though the viewer already knows them.  St. Peter steals the show in the last half.  He's got some great scenes.  An important film to watch for anyone who wants to see early breakthroughs in cinema.  It's also a good study of early Christianity in cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quo Vadis? 1913 was a landmark in early Italian historical epic films and certainly Herr Enrico Guazzoni's grand scale masterpiece laid the foundations for what genuine kolossal Italian spectacles should be. It had a great deal of influence on Herr Giovanni Pastrone's Cabiria 1914 and D.W. Griffith's Intolerance 1916.It is easy to see why Quo Vadis? shocked early silent audiences because even today to watch this astonishing oeuvre is like visiting an archaeological delicatessen and is a pleasure for silent fans. The film is a largerthanlife picture that was based on a Polish historical novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz. The book was adapted for the silent and talkie screen many times but the story is so complex that it is hard to summarize in film form. There are a lot of Romans an incendiary Caesar many Christians and a horde of extras. Sometimes this Herr Graf got a little confused trying to remember who loves who and who is conspiring against whom.Quo Vadis? is typical of Herr Guazzoni with his eye for details and his skill in using his big budget to maximum effect. The film is well paced and of course there are many great set pieces Rome in flames a chariot race and a coliseum full of gladiators helpless Christians and very hungry lions. Besides the grand spectacle the film includes also more prosaic subjects like morality and faith in reference to the early Christians and the struggle of this new religion and its human values in the face of Roman decadence and barbarism.In technical aspects Quo Vadis? is a surprising oeuvre for its detailed framing wherein the depth of field works very effectively in focusing the viewer' s attention right where it needs to be when some much is happening on screen.Unfortunately Quo Vadis? hasn't had the wellearned praise of other similar Italian historical epic films that's what usually happens with the pioneers. These early and innovative masters have their work copied by advanced pupils who end up with the fame and glory. As the German saying goes raise crows and they'll gouge out your eyes And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must throw some servants into the Schloss' Coliseum arena.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Astonishing masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the best film made to its date 'Quo Vadis?' is an astonishing masterpiece. At a time in which most movies comprised 2 reels running for about 2024 minutes this early feature was certainly the best epic film till 'Cabiria' 1914 was released. Based on the memorable novel written by Henryk Sienwiewicz this adaptation is more faithful to the book than the 1951 MGM version this version was called 'Quo Vadis' without the final ? for it was thought to be bad luck an interrogation mark at the end of a title. I haven't seen the 2001 polish version yet which was submitted to the Academy Awards but not nominated as Best Foreing Language Film but since it didn't get very positive reviews I'd dare say this 'Quo Vadis?' is the very best of them all.First of all 'Quo Vadis'? was originally released in 1912 not in 1913 it premiered all over the world in 1913 USA Spain Poland France... But the original Italian release was in 1912. Now over a year ago the existence of this film was unknown by many people who were asking over and over whether or not this one was available. There was only one review on the film here and the IMDb claimed it was a lost film so there was a lot of talk about it! Nothing further from the truth ever since I uploaded it on youtube doubts have been vanished.'Quo Vadis?' is a maserpiece for its date. The portrayal of Nero and all the characters is very accurate the epic scenes with Rome in the background or the circus extras dialogs... Everything is awesome! The dialogs especially are very accurate too saying as much as needed to make the complex story understandable not saying too much but not too little either just the right words. If you're into early film history this is certainly a mustsee!! If you like epic movies roman atmosphere this kind of literature or whatever topic related to this particular movie this is a mustsee. And if you aren't into silent films but you'd ever consider watching one this is a good choice. Though not as good as Caligari Potemkin or Nosferatu after all film techniques would evolve a lot within the next few years very worth watching either way.".

Things moved very far in a few short years.Oh yes the lions. Well NFT had got that story in the notes somewhere that they ate an extra on film so I kept an eye open. But you couldn't possibly tell one way or another. The scene is a bit shambolic  just as if you'd put a camera in the midst of lions in a circus and didn't know which the interesting bits were going to be. So no real closeups.

	schema:reviewBody "At the dawn of the cinema it was Italy where actually great spectacles were born. They had the locations at hand. Along the famous CABIRIA made a few years later which also celebrated its centenary QUO VADIS by Enrico Guazzoni based faithfully upon Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel not only stunned the audience of the time being played in many road theaters but also set the standards for the very genre as many reviewers have stated before me. More to say Sienkiewicz's novel became one of the top literary sources which inspired so many filmmakers to bring the first century Rome the decadence and fall of emperor Nero reigning 5468 A.D and the rise of Christianity in the center of the empire to screen. The most famous version enjoying the international renown to this day is of course Mervyn LeRoy's 1951. However great as the ultra popular QUO VADIS is this one appears to be more faithful to the novel but requires a very special perception. Allegedly Henryk Sienkiewicz himself saw this motion picture which we can see now after the restoration cofinanced by the Lumiere Project.Amleto Novelli Carlo Cattaneo Cesare Moltini Lea Giunchi Gustavo Serena...the cast of the time do not make any special impression on us these days. Similarly to stagy silent movies of the 1910s they may appear as 'phantoms' moving within the frame of the screen without desirable closeups that would instill some understanding of the characters' feelings. Yet that is not the strength of the movie.The major phenomenon of this silent QUO VADIS there was another silent version with Emil Jannings as Nero which occurred a flop are the moments of great aesthetic intensity. Mostly operatic in its feeling it supplies a viewer with an unbelievable 'image' of the novel's content. It is not the novel so to say 'filmed' or pictured but art of a new medium at the time which beautifully combines literature and cinema. With no words necessary the movie does not disturb imagination but rather inspires its unknown spheres. From the banquet at Nero's through the fire of Rome the shots of the arena and St Peter meeting Christ on the Appian Way the climax of the story here though not so historically chronological the scenes may still occur highly entertaining. We watch a distant past we have a glimpse of early cinema's vision and both the storytelling and the execution of the content become to us quite 'archaic.' That aspect appears as tremendously involving.There is not much to say about performances about music score about special effects. Yet there is something inspiring about depriving oneself of all the prefabricated expectations of an 'entertaining' movie about beating the 'cliches' of 'silent film equals to boring film' and allowing oneself to view it in a fresh manner as if it still had something to offer after more than a century. And believe me it does.".

I would gladly agree to call it a milestone  for Italian cinema in general for the epic genre specifically and most importantly for the art of the feature film worldwide. Although MGM's opulent 1951 Technicolor version is easily the most popular of the lot it is quite remarkable how the actors portraying Roman Consul Marcus Vinicius Senator Petronius and Emperor Nero here resembled the ones in Mervyn Le Roy's remake  namely Robert Taylor Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov respectively! Conversely while Patricia Laffan's sensuous Poppea left an indelible mark in the later Hollywood epic the frumpy actress playing her in the version under review is anything but memorable. The Greek slave who turns Vinicius' head and life upside down then is portrayed by an actress who it seemed to me was way too young for the role but while her giant servant lacked the magnetism of Buddy Baer acquitted himself reasonably well in the circumstances. The copy I acquired was clearly a batteredbutwatchable one of French origin accompanied by horrendous computergenerated English intertitles replete with spelling mistakes! As usual with early Silent movies the overtly theatrical mannerisms affected by the actors gives rise to some unintentionally risible moments the hottempered Vinicius forever on the verge of slapping his inferiors around is a particular liability in this regard. Still like any selfrespecting epic to which it paved the way the overall success of QUO VADIS? is ultimately measured by the spectacle or lack thereof on display during the several climaxes integrated into the narrative and incredibly enough for a movie that is almost a century old I can safely say that this version of QUO VADIS? does not disappoint Nero's lavish parties the burning of Rome gladiatorial combat in the arena lions feasting on Christian prisoners apparently an unlucky extra became an alltooreal meal for the bloodthirsty felines but mercifully the footage does not seem to have been incorporated into the finished film! and last but not least Jesus Christ's apparition to St. Peter on the Appian Way which meeting of course spawned the novel and film's very title.".

I wonder whether he is just truly selfish and exploited Ivan financially or he is closeted and decided to follow the social expectations.Being a niche film Permanent Residence also shatters taboos by incorporating funeral scenes.

Does anyone watching this film wonder how the Hong Kong tech geek morphs into an Australian filmmaker who is about to make Scud's next films  how's that for selfindulgent? More jarringly is there any psychology in Ivan's instant transformation from overachieving workaholic in denial to hedonistic selfaccepting out gay man? Did anyone else in the audience feel that all the female characters the granny the mother the lesbian pal Windson's mother walk on for their cameo but ultimately are missed opportunities in characterization? Don't get me wrong this film has a lot going for it. Windson's suppressed sexuality that lets him flash his bits around the gym sauna and be used naked in bed or in the shower without any ability to reciprocate emotion is more subtly drawn perhaps because he is unable to develop emotionally leaving his contradictions to express his frustrations. Ivan's morbid obsessions from childhood to the end of his own life are poignant. The film is beautifully shot even while it is being coy with shadows about its flaunting of gratuitous nudity.Flawed yes but moving and watchable nonetheless. Let's see what Scud does next.".

	schema:headline " One of the finest films Zanussi ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Krzyzstof Zanussi has made 75 distinguished films and is possibly the third best filmmaker from Polandnext only to Wajda and Kieslowskithe latter peaked towards the end of his career. I consider Persona non grata to be Zanussi's second best effortthe first being his German TV film Wege in der Nacht Ways in the night or Nightwatch made in 1979. Interestingly both films featured the brilliant music of Wojciech Kilar the actor Zbigniew Zapasiewicz and script of physicist turned philosophy student Krzyzstof Zanussi.At the elementary level the film is about diplomats and their lives. At a more complex level Zanussi explores the relationship between Poland and postGlasnost Russia and the denizens of both nations. At an even more complex level Zanussi introduces the subtle differences between the orthodox Christians and Catholicsa facet that I suspect interested both Zanussi and the late Kieslowski both close associates. There are more Catholics in Poland while Orthodox Christians dominate Russia. Zanussi differentiates the spirituality of the two in the rich verbal sparring that the film unfolds between a Polish and a Soviet diplomat. Finally Zanussi teases the film viewer by leading the audience to suspend disbelief in the main character. For a long while even an astute viewer is led astray. The viewer is reduced to the level of a persona non grata believing initially that the film is all about a diplomat about to lose his diplomatic powers at the embassy and become a persona non grata. This is superb cinema supported by Kilar's music of the spheres. The film offers rich humor and at times a biblical sermon on a New Testament passage from 2 Corinthians 117 Do I say yes when I mean no. But taking the context of diplomacy around which the film revolves the discussion takes on a different hue. But the clever Zanussi throws light and shadows on the subjects in the film the opening credits plays with light and shadows too.It is a story of love suspicion and principlesthat go beyond mere individuals. It is a story of reconciliation. It is a film that a filmmaker can make in the evening of his career. It reminds you works like Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala or Ermanno Olmi's Tree of Wooden Clogs. It is a work of maturity. Savor it like fine cognac!Just as it is major work of Zanussi I believe this to be a milestone for the music composer Kilar. Poland should be proud of Zanussi and Kilar. The film is a veritable feast for an intelligent viewer. Great performances from three great Polish actorsZbigniew Zapasiewicz Zanussi's favorite Jerzy Stuhr Kieslowski's favorite and Daniel Olbryschsky Wajda's favorite adorn the film but the most striking is the acting performance of Russian actordirector Nikita Mikhalkov who can do a great turn as a restrained comic for example his performance in his halfbrother Mikhalkov Konchalovsky's Siberiade. But in this film a dog plays a major actor's role within a web of friendship and distrust. So does a torn photographZanussi does not seem to believe that photographs can lie.Persona non grata could easily have been named Suspicion. The film is an ode to friendshipsfriends who remain loyal friends who are not recognized as friends at best of times but are recognized as friends when tragedy strikes and friends who dislike being insulted even by mistake. The film was screened during the ongoing 11th International Film Festival of Kerala India. What this film proves is that Polish cinema is alive and well! It also proves Zanussi is back at his best form.".

It's more consistent than Miike's previous samurai film 13 Assassins although that also means it lacks anything as great as that film's final battle. But what sets HaraKiri apart is its willingness to not just offer a pastiche of these films but genuinely question their values in a way that is still challenging to the contemporary viewer.Through a series of events told partially in flashbacks HaraKiri poses the question of how relevant our values are  whether they be highly codified values like honour or the more nebulous instincts that guide us today  in the face of human suffering. The ronin that we see humiliated and killed in the first act is not guilty of breaking some arcane samurai bylaw but of doing something most of us would find disgraceful. But as the film goes on it argues that we should hold compassion even for people such as this and that honour is ultimately irrelevant in the face of social suffering. In an age of recession and austerity where so many try to cling to their ideas of what they or other people deserve this is an important message.It's an easy film to appreciate and a difficult one to love  there's a kind of coldness to this set of Miike's movies that seems out of place with the gonzo enthusiasm of his earlier work.

It's one of the great pieces of not only Japanese cinema but also one of the best movies of the 20th century. While I'm disappointed the film was remade at all and surprised it came from Miike there are still good things to be found here. To my surprise for the most part this is a good movie and in very small quantities there are some true moments of greatness. Even if they are very short.A good deal of the original film's grit is lost for most of this go around. The cinematography is overlit and the pacing falls into lulls. But survive to the end and you will be rewarded as the final irony is quite powerful. I mean no spoilers from me but even with the cheesy fake snow I have to say Ebiz Ichikawa's powerful presence won me over and he truly wins the day when the time calls for it. I was never too crazy about all the Kurosawa remakes of the 60s and 70s. Fistful of Dollars always felt like a cheap knockoff because it is. The Magnificent Seven was sort of a tolerable chuckle. Kurosawa's films were so human almost populist because of their themes his work was ripe for remake reboot or even plagiarism. Only Star Wars seemed to get the joke and succeed in being something different than a pure Hidden Fortress copy. Kobayashi's Harakiri seemed to escape the trend for so long because of the subject matter  even the title! But here we are. There is still something not right about this remake but MIike gets it right in the end even if never needed to be done in the first place.".

Kurosawa's films were so human almost populist because of their themes his work was ripe for remake reboot or even plagiarism. Only Star Wars seemed to get the joke and succeed in being something different than a pure Hidden Fortress copy. Kobayashi's Harakiri seemed to escape the trend for so long because of the subject matter  even the title! But here we are. There is still something not right about this remake but MIike gets it right in the end even if never needed to be done in the first place.";

The story of that young man who shows up looking skinny timorous and pathetic to make his request is the story of an unsuspecting rube badly miscalculating the seriousness of the House of Ii's commitment to the samurai ideal notwithstanding that most of its younger warriors have never seen combat. When the retainers of Ii discover that the young ronin has brought only a bamboo practice sword with him they decide in rage to call his transparent bluff summoning out the whole house to witness his suicide and sternly demanding that he go through with it... using only that same bamboo sword.The youth's panic and seeming cowardice seem contemptible at first... but there is something just as twisted about the retainers' contempt when they discover he was just trying to get money to buy medicine for a sick wife and child. Finally seeing that there's no way out he does contrive to commit seppuku with the bamboo sword in a scene of surpassing drawnout agony and horror that will stay with you for days. His second assigned to behead him seems in particular to almost relish the young man's suffering refusing to end it until he's twisted the bamboo blade in his guts to the man's satisfaction. Back to the present and the senior retainer of Ii offering this latest ronin the chance to leave with no questions asked. And that's when we discover that the two ronins' stories are connected... and that there's a larger objective of retribution in the newcomer's actions.The drama that follows  which affords us a chance to see the two ronin in an entirely different light to discover their relationship and what brought them to their desperate pass and to question whether the suppression of humaneness and empathy in the samurai code of conduct really just isn't a form of empty madness  is deliberatelypaced intricately structured and moving. It is well worth seeing and indeed quite probably the best Japanese drama to be produced so far this century.".

These are interesting questions raised in director Takashi Miike's poignant remake of the 1962 classic Harakiri. This film may not satisfy the audience for slashing bodycount samurai movies because the emphasis is on mood and character but there are a number of things to recommend this film. HaraKiriDeath of a Samurai is beautifully photographed by Nobuyasu Kita and has laudable performances. Ebizo Ichikawa is Hanshiro a samurai with a young daughter of marriageable age. Hanshiro has adjusted to living in a time of peace. He isn't a wealthy man but seems happy and content making a living doing the odd job here and there. Ichikawa is wonderful in this role giving great weight and humanity to the character. He is a memorable samurai. Eita is Motome a young samurai who hasn't adjusted as well. He has been unable to find employment and so enters the house of a great lord asking for permission to commit harakiri in the courtyard and thus achieve an honorable death. Hikari Mitsushima is very affecting as Hanshiro's daughter Miho. When I approached the theater showing this film I noticed someone walking away with teary eyes. I can't recall the last time that happened but after seeing HaraKiriDeath of a Samurai I understood why someone would be so moved.".

Unfortunately I haven't seen the original yet and I understand how those people might not like this one. I don't know how I would feel about a seven samurai remake? I think this movie was well done.

I have not seen the original but this movie blown me away. As usual the story opens slow and hard to identify the situation of the story but at the right middle of the movie the flashback strikes with awesome drama about poverty and family sentiment. Once the flashback was told you will easily say where the movie is heading. The story was classic and the movie was presented with rich cinematography. The first digital 3D movie for Takashi Miike as well the first 3D movie to premier at 2011 Cannes film festival.You have to learn a word to understand the movie completely. 'Seppuku'  which means ritual suicide committed by a samurai. So that is why it's called 'Harakiri death of a samurai'. You must have patience during opening sequences without character and story development you will be in a tough position to understand about what's going on. While the story and character progress with the development you will start to get and you may fall for the emotion parts if you are a tenderhearted. And also you will be uncomfortable during 'seppuku' scene.Takashi Miike's career best this is what already everyone saying about it. But Its to hard to say which was his best I like many of his works. I might be overwhelmed by the watch but will be happy to recommend it to others. I was very little unhappy for the ending scene otherwise I could have said it is the best of Takashi's work.I am so curious about Takashi Miike's upcoming and Hollywood debutante project 'The outside' with Tom Hardy. Expecting it would be another 'The last samurai' I wish a good luck to the team.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone with a more than passing interest in Japanese movies ought to watch Kobayashi's 1962 version of Takaiguchi's novel that this also is based on and watch the intro by the Japanese film authority Donald Ritchie on the Criterion edition. Ritchie makes fully clear how Kobayashi here as in other films is talking through the historical tale about current issues he was passionate about in this case lingering postWWII authoritarianism in Japan and hollow bureaucracies in his day as in the time of the early Tokugawa government Miike doesn't seem to have anything particularly urgent to say. Look at what Ritchie points out that Kobayashi's version offers the script by ace screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto who wrote Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai the score by bold influential experimentalist Toru Takemitsu the strong and unifying symbolic use of empty samurai armor throughout the careerdefining lead performance by Tatsuya Nakadai and the elegantly austere use of black and white cinematography. Ironically Miike's film also carries over Kobayashi's one serious flaw   an overindulgence in sentimentality and pathos in the flashback love story.Miike apparently seeking 'respectability' after all his entertaining ultraviolence with this staid remakeadaptation also overdoes everything. He makes every scene too drawnout and talky. He further overdoes the sentimentality to the point that in his version becomes unbearably cloying virtually unwatchable. Once again 3D adds nothing black and white was just what was needed. Less was and is more. Whenever a filmmaker goes over familiar ground adapting a book that has been adapted and very well before he exposes himself to comparisons to the book and to the previous adaptation. Don't get me wrong. Miike has plenty of skill. It is not that his 'Hara Kiri' is a washout. It's just that Kobayashi's version is a true work of art a film classic in fact and in comparison Miike's is merely a competent effort and a pointless bid for respectability that was not needed. He is a master in his own realm. Surprisingly his last film before this the juicy actionhistorical blockbuster 13 Assassins which I thoroughly enjoyed also was an adaptation  of Eiichi Kudo's little known samurai film of the same name. Thanks to 'Wildgrounds' who compare the two Hara Kiri films for this info.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Takashi Miike has emerged and grown as an explosion of artistry in modern Japanese cinema from controversial past image from international notoriety for depicting shocking scenes of extreme violence. He became an auteur to write his mark in modern world cinema. With unmatched emotional intensity using silence as fierce force he got abilities of higher order. With incomparable emotional portrayal unmatched visual precision beauty and poetry he became a legend of modern cinema. His style is slow powerful intense beautiful and spiritual. With HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 Takashi Miike is ought to have great respect as much as akira kurosawa got. His style of making is like injecting venom directly into our nerves instantly it flows to our brain spreads all over the body to every cell of it and blocks all the movement of consciousness so potently instantly. We are not but to surrender to its emotional potency and masterful artistry. Suddenly we become helpless and merge into visuals of painful melancholy. We become helpless as the characters of his movie. In fact we are all same as human beings since the beginning of human race. Our inner emotions are same. Our instincts are same. But there is awaking in some souls. They struggle for truth. They need to fight with brutality of customs traditions and with ignorance of cultural madness. Characters of Takashi Miike's new movies are indeed spiritually awakened and able to understand the true values of life. They fight with traditional madness in the name of respectability and the honour. Ignorance is darker than darkness. It is the cause of all the misery of mankind. His characters have wisdom of life. They fight with ignorance.HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 is more matured than his magnum opus 13 Assassins2010. Those who liked 13 Assassins2010 for solely action sequences may not like HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 but who liked visual artistry of 13 Assassins2010 should not miss this movie. Final action sequence is unique and unforgettable. People who like gore may disappoint to watch it. But indeed it is a classic samurai sword fight we can't imagine to see on a screen since the birth of cinema for its classic nature and action choreography. I am sure no one ever composed such a sword fight in the history of cinema. One must prepare to see an epic about poverty and ignorance rather than to watch merely an action movie. It is very sensitive movie. Legendary music composer ryuichi sakamoto's mystical music made this move as sensitive as true to life like pure poetry to create a transcendental experience. Takashi Miike is not only master of swords indeed he is master in human expression. We can't see him in the shade of his past movies. Right now he is a master. No one can deny it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Takashi Miike has emerged and grown as an explosion of artistry in modern Japanese cinema from controversial past image from international notoriety for depicting shocking scenes of extreme violence. He became an auteur to write his mark in modern world cinema. With unmatched emotional intensity using silence as fierce force he got abilities of higher order. With incomparable emotional portrayal unmatched visual precision beauty and poetry he became a legend of modern cinema. His style is slow powerful intense beautiful and spiritual. With HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 Takashi Miike is ought to have great respect as much as akira kurosawa got. His style of making is like injecting venom directly into our nerves instantly it flows to our brain spreads all over the body to every cell of it and blocks all the movement of consciousness so potently instantly. We are not but to surrender to its emotional potency and masterful artistry. Suddenly we become helpless and merge into visuals of painful melancholy. We become helpless as the characters of his movie. In fact we are all same as human beings since the beginning of human race. Our inner emotions are same. Our instincts are same. But there is awaking in some souls. They struggle for truth. They need to fight with brutality of customs traditions and with ignorance of cultural madness. Characters of Takashi Miike's new movies are indeed spiritually awakened and able to understand the true values of life. They fight with traditional madness in the name of respectability and the honour. Ignorance is darker than darkness. It is the cause of all the misery of mankind. His characters have wisdom of life. They fight with ignorance.HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 is more matured than his magnum opus 13 Assassins2010. Those who liked 13 Assassins2010 for solely action sequences may not like HaraKiri Death of a Samurai2011 but who liked visual artistry of 13 Assassins2010 should not miss this movie. Final action sequence is unique and unforgettable. People who like gore may disappoint to watch it.

	schema:reviewBody "Compared to the original 1962 Masaki Kobayashi film this movie is shallow and meaningless. But even taken on its own merits it's still pretty flawed. An extremely powerful first act gives way to a ponderous middle where the Ryuichi Sakamoto score overdresses dreary longwinded sequences. Then it all culminates in a last act that is exciting both visually and intellectually... but completely unearned. Miike has rarely been able to close in on a theme in his work with much accuracy the two big exceptions that come to mind are Audition and Visitor Q respectively being powerful explorations of misogyny in Japanese society and the collapse of the Japanese family but when his films are crazed and breezy and fun that's rarely a criticism worth voicing. This time the subject matter demands something more and whatever Miike has to say about the Ruling Class or misplaced tradition or the role of the noble and ethical warrior in a time of peace comes out hopelessly convoluted. Also the 3D sucks and gives nothing to the experience except for muddling some gorgeous images with that dark uninspired light that those stupid glasses impose on even the best shot of 3D films. So what's good about it? Well the projected lighting issues aside it's a beautiful looking movie. Miike always knows where to place his camera is never afraid of silence sabotaged repeatedly by the uninspired score and the movie has a wonderful seasons motif. Some of the acting is wonderful to watch and when it's being a powerful act of filmmaking it's mighty powerful. But here Miike doesn't quite have the right touch and the lack of dedication to a deeper exploration of theme makes the film seem little more than a sequence of events with hardly any cohesion.".

	schema:reviewBody "HaraKiri Death of a Samurai is a remake or better yet an adaptation of the same novel of Masaki Kobayashi's 1962 masterpiece Harakiri. Does the story really need another adaptation? Of course not and once again it's proved that remakes can rarely catch up to the originals. The 2011 version was directed by Takashi Miike and is actually in 3D. If you watch the original film the last thing that'll come across your mind is I wonder how this would look in 3D because about 80 of the film is just people talking.These are the major differences the remake offers1 Motome's harakiri scene is longer and bloodier. Well it's Miike. What can you expect.2 The Iyi clan retainers are bigger bastards this time around. First this time Motome actually tells them he needs some time to take care of his family but they ignore him. Second the guy serving as Motome's second man during harakiri seemed unusually sadistic. Third the chief retainer is now more like a quirky supervillain has a white cat like Blofeld from the James Bond series white cats are actually a leitmotif in this movie it seems and walks with a limp which makes me snicker because this way he reminds me of herr Flick from the British sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!3 This time around it's immediately revealed that the three retainers Tsugumo chooses as his second men were killed by him by immediately revealed I mean 40 minutes in. This is just stupid because it makes for a considerably less suspenseful viewing than the original.4 Remember the battle in the grass field with the retainer in the '62 version? Well it isn't here anymore. In this film Tsugumo takes out all three retainers at once in a scene that's way too short to enjoy.5 The final battle of Tsugumo vs. the Iyi clan is a bit longer but two major things were changed first of all Tsugumo now sports a bamboo blade instead of a true katana during the fight. Secondly it snows all the time during the battle. Exactly why I'm not sure except for actually giving a reason for the film to be in 3D.6 In Kobayashi's film's ending Tsugumo is quickly shot down by the musketbearing retainers. In Miike's version he is killed by swordsmen but not before making a cheesy dramatic speech.The cinematography is great and stays true to Kobayashi's original visions. The geometrical positioning of the shots and character composition isn't copied from Kobayashi but gives it a new spin what with the colors and all. It's a very well made film from a technical aspect. Then again Miike is an experienced filmmaker so you can pretty much expect that to be true.The music is a major letdown. Kobayashi's movie has a tense soundtrack aperiodically played on strings which sounded weird to me at first but I quickly got used to it and I realized it's a very unique and memorable score. It does a great job of raising the tension. Miike's film's music is tremendously forgettable  it's just your typical silent orchestral soundtrack we're so accustomed to nowadays. It's not as daring as the original instead I can barely distinguish it from other similar soundtracks.Ebiz Ichikawa is a good replacement for Tatsuya Nakadai in his main role but overall I prefer Nakadai because he manages to pull off complex emotions just by speaking in the same tone during the entire film  and this is hard to explain but just by looking at him you really feel like everything that happened to Tsugumo also happened to Nakadai. Ichikawa is alright but is not as ragefilled and imposing as Nakadai. However the major reason why the remake fails is the way the story itself is told. Half of the movie is spent on endless flashbacks of Tsugumo's life which are a chore to watch and completely ruin the mood. The 1962 movie is highly unsettling the message is laid out clearly and it's unbelievably tense the entire time. The 2011 movie is anything but suspenseful clear or confrontational it's horribly bland and Miike fails to deliver the message as passionately as Kobayashi did.".

I saw it in Cannes 2011 so it was the first versions i am sure they will change it for the theatrical release if you have the choice between 3D and 2D versions don't hesitate a second and choose 2D.Better be aware  the storytelling is very simple and contrast a lot with the masterpiece of Kobayashi some who haven't seen the original said that was a problem and some others said it was the way to tell this screenplay but the original one have to be better constructed. I would said honestly that even as this version is 5O years younger than the original the filmaking is so simplified in this version that you couldn't tell which movie is the remake if you get rid of the technology differences one is in Black and white the other in 3D so...My advice is you need to see both beginning by Kobayashi one as any human being should experience this story one movie is a masterpiece of film making and give a great lesson to the viewer the other is a smart adaptation of the screenplay and gives a great lesson to the characters of the movies both are good to watch if you are a filmmaker a movie reviewer or a movie addict.EDIT  i saw it again in 2D in theatre last week IT IS FAR WORST than the original. no rhythm no conflict too much debriefing than a smart storytelling run away from this betrayal and watch kobayashi masterpiece ASAP. i can't believe i was too gentle with this one IT IS A DISGRACE ! miike remake of eichi kudo's was great but this is a slaughter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Miike remade 13 Assassins to take full advantage of technical advances since the original arrived in the early '60s. Thus it was more spectacular a great battle movie that put us in the heart of slashpiercehackcrunchandfilet combat.. Of its kind it was great and the update made sense. The same cannot be said for his remake of the Kobayashi masterpiece which was intimate a rumination on the cruelty and hypocrisy of bushido. A nutshell an impoverished older samurai comes to a great house seeking a place to commit harakiri he's told a young man tried the same trick earlier a bluff suicide hoping to get money or a job. But the House forced him to live up to his word even though he'd sold his swords thus he committed seppuku with wooden blades. It turns out that the older man is the younger's father in law he's come for vengeance on the house and spoiler after revealing he's defeated the young man's three primary adversaries in single combat he draws blade on the house and goes down in a bloody frenzy of vengeance. Great revenge movie but Miike rewires it. You'd expect him to lay on the gore as he did in 13 and many of his quickie yakuza films but instead he dials it way down keeps it somehow intellectual rather than visceral. Sorry but I'm shallow enough to be disappointed I wanted to see heads roll and arms chopped off. It's a SAMURAI movie right? He retains Kobayashi's deliberate almost ritual like pace and symmetrical compositions but the understated intensity SPOILER! the old man fights his last fight with the wooden sword so he is incapable of killing the Household guard of the climax lets the movie end without the emotional catharsis it demanded.

	onyx:emotionText "Miike remade 13 Assassins to take full advantage of technical advances since the original arrived in the early '60s. Thus it was more spectacular a great battle movie that put us in the heart of slashpiercehackcrunchandfilet combat.. Of its kind it was great and the update made sense. The same cannot be said for his remake of the Kobayashi masterpiece which was intimate a rumination on the cruelty and hypocrisy of bushido. A nutshell an impoverished older samurai comes to a great house seeking a place to commit harakiri he's told a young man tried the same trick earlier a bluff suicide hoping to get money or a job. But the House forced him to live up to his word even though he'd sold his swords thus he committed seppuku with wooden blades. It turns out that the older man is the younger's father in law he's come for vengeance on the house and spoiler after revealing he's defeated the young man's three primary adversaries in single combat he draws blade on the house and goes down in a bloody frenzy of vengeance. Great revenge movie but Miike rewires it. You'd expect him to lay on the gore as he did in 13 and many of his quickie yakuza films but instead he dials it way down keeps it somehow intellectual rather than visceral. Sorry but I'm shallow enough to be disappointed I wanted to see heads roll and arms chopped off. It's a SAMURAI movie right? He retains Kobayashi's deliberate almost ritual like pace and symmetrical compositions but the understated intensity SPOILER! the old man fights his last fight with the wooden sword so he is incapable of killing the Household guard of the climax lets the movie end without the emotional catharsis it demanded. A disappointing exercise.";

An older samurai Tsukumo Hanshiro Tatsuya Nakadai seeks admittance to the house of a lord to commit the HaraKiri or ritual suicide and thereby maintaining his honor. Then the samurai in charge recounts the story of Chijiiwa Motome who was also from his town. He was a young man who also asked for help to commit HaraKiri. Right before the ritual he asked for one more day and then 3 ryo to treat his sick wife and child. He was heartlessly denied. Motome had nothing but a bamboo blade after selling his sword and they forced him to perform the ritual with the dull blade.Of course this is a remake of the 1962 Japanese hit. Other than being in color I'm not sure if there are any improvements. I don't think it's any worst but I can't tell if anything is better. The big Harakiri scene is the big draw. I remember the original to be more compelling. Yet I don't know if that has more to do with the shock of seeing it for the first time. I remember they explained the roles better in the original especially about the second. The tension seemed to built up more. The original Motome seemed more scared. I can't be sure if it's a trick of memory to view the first with more admiration.".

It toned down criticism of authority that is the core of the original movie. The central story is overdrawn and it does not bring much new. What is new in this presentation is almost always at a loss spare a somewhat simpler structure. Acting is also better in the original. But what is most annoying is that some key subtle points are missing in this version almost as if they were not understood or worse yet almost if hypocrisy of the authorities is to be whitewashed. It is far less powerful rendering of the story it lacks authenticity that Kobayashi had with his then contemporary comments. By all means if you can see the original first. One of the least justified and worst remakes. However when the original is so great this lazy if not outright stupid remake still leaves us with a somewhat shabby but not too bad a movie. It is a disappointment coming from a director that had better days and especially from a cinematography that seems to have grown tired and has been surpassed by South Korea but also China to an extent.".

And the throwing away of the hair knots made me think of how low the country of Japan got with the lowest point for me being world war 2. It was a very strong movie with lots of satisfying shots.

There are instances of the auteur director's trademark brutality or fetish popping up in one or two scenes in 13 Assassins as well as in HaraKiri.But in the latter's case it's almost entirely appropriate as the camera lingers on the excruciating pain suffered by samurais committing seppuku the suicide ritual of regaining one's honour.I watched 13 Assassins first and had an uncomfortable premonition that Miike would shoot a movie with harakiri with its central theme as 13 Assassins was opened with a painful harakiri scene. I felt that Miike hasn't completely purged his inner demons yet with that short but deeply affecting scene.So now we have a wellmade remake with harakiri or seppuku as the movie's central narrative vehicle. I haven't actually watched the 1962 original but feels that Miike's version has little pay offs by the end of the story.Don't get me wrong it is a well told well acted piece of samurai drama with a strong message at the end of the movie  that by the time of the Edo period honour in the samurai caste is but a farce or of superficial value. Reading Japanese feudal history one would even assume that there was little honour to begin with when it came to the samurai caste of the past.I find that the situation that the poor samurai families had to go through during that time was presented with panache but I can't shake the feeling of fatality and hopelessness in Harakiri. I guess such feelings is to be expected of Miike's movies. His movies are rarely uplifting although I have to say that I was totally satisfied elevated even with the ending of 13 Assassins.Harakiri is bitter all the way through with very little sweetness. It reminds me of classical novels where all the main protagonists suffer through the story and all end up dying in horrible manners.I'm going to have to watch Samurai Fiction a couple of times to wash away the sadness that still lingers after watching Harakiri.".

	schema:reviewBody "In seventeenth Century Japan it is a time of relative peace and samurai who were in service to defeated warlords have fallen on hard times. One Hanshiro goes to the local castle asking if he me commit harakiri ritual suicide in the castle courtyard. Before granting permission he is told the story of Motome another poor samurai from the same clan as Hanshiro who made a similar request a year before. Several others had made similar requests but changed their minds when offered money suspecting Motome is another 'suicide bluffer' they decide to make an example of him and force him to go ahead with his suicide even after he begs for three ryo for his sick wife Miho and child not only that he must use his wooden bladed sword. This is slow and agonising. We then learn that Hanshiro not only knew Motome but is his father inlaw and now he wants revenge. In flashback we then see Hanshiro and Motome's past and how the latter became so desperate. We then return to Hanshiro's present for the inevitably tragic conclusion.I have yet to see the original film so can't say how this compares. Judging it on its own I can say I really enjoyed it even if it was far from the 'samurai action film' I'd expected. The scene where Motome is forced to disembowel himself with a wooden sword is painfully gruelling to watch as it goes on and on even though it doesn't dwell on the wounds inflicted it is a hard watch and rightly so. When we learn of his connection to Hanshiro that painful scene explains why he is so desperate to show how a real samurai lives and dies. The cast does a fine job most notably Ebiz Ichikawa Eita and Hikari Mitsushima as Hanshiro Motome and Miho respectively. Takashi Miike's direction is impressively subtle given his reputation overthetop violence. Overall I'd recommend this just don't expect lots of action this is about character.".

	schema:headline " Ritual Suicide as Committed By the Third Dimension";
	schema:reviewBody "True to current cinematic trends Takashi Miike's HaraKiri Death of a Samurai has been released in 3D. There's no real reason this process had to be applied to this particular film given the fact that it isn't a fantasy an animated family film an action extravaganza contrary to what the title suggests or part of any genre in which 3D would be accepted  or at the very least tolerated. The film is by and large a character study and a tragedy and as such the visuals rarely lend themselves to gimmicky shots of objects flying at the screen or even creating an immersive experience. Making matters worse is the issue of brightness. Much of the film is spent within a cramped dingy home in which sunlight almost never creeps in this means that we in the audience must endure a dim muddy picture of characters already immersed in shadow.My complaints about 3D notwithstanding I admittedly did appreciate this film more than Miike's previous import the overrated 13 Assassins which isn't directly related to this film but certainly acts as a sort of parallel story. I think what bothered me the most about 13 Assassins was that it was attempting to glamorize a life that on the basis of what's depicted in the film was anything but glamorous here were a group of men living by a barbaric code of conduct one that viewed ceaseless servitude and glorified suicide missions as honorable. Now we have a film that not only calls into question this lifestyle but also holds back on the gore and violence. There are two exceptions to the latter. One is a grotesque and needlessly protracted sequence in which a ronin attempts to commit seppuku with a wooden sword. The other is a final battle scene less bloody but again needlessly protracted.Taking place in 1600s Japan the film opens when a middle aged ronin named Hanshiro Tsugumo Ebizo Ichikawa enters the gates of samurai clan. Begging the audience with the lead retainer Kageyu Koji Yakusho he claims that he is a samurai without a master to serve and therefore wants die nobly by committing seppuku in his courtyard in full view of the other samurais. Kageyu isn't immediately willing to grant his request seeing as it's now common for men to enter clan compounds lie about their status as failed warriors and claim they want to commit suicide when what they really want is charity. He tells Hanshiro the story of a young man who did exactly that not too long ago his request was granted but he only ended up asking for an extra day and ultimately for money. An example was made of him of course and as painfully as possible he went through with the harakiri.In due time Hanshiro is kneeling on a mat in the clan's courtyard surrounded by wellclad wellarmed samurais. But before the suicide ritual can be completed Hanshiro reveals that what he really wants is vengeance for the young man's death. And with that he tells his own story which plays as an extended flashback sequence. We learn that the young man was named Motome Eita and that Hanshiro took him in as a boy and raised him as his own after his father grew ill and died. We watch as Motome and Hanshiro's daughter Miho Hikari Mitsushima grow up together fall in love and ultimately have a baby boy. We watch the entire family enduring more downs than ups as they are poverty stricken. Motome who took to reading and writing at an early age is forced to pawn off his beloved books just for two eggs  one of which inevitably falls and cracks.The film veers into melodramatic territory the instant Miho lets out a small cough and it only gets worse when her baby boy develops a fever. There are specific visuals related to both characters that could have easily been exploited for their ability to horrify an audience but mercifully Miike restrains himself he shows that which is absolutely necessary to get the point across and no more. Unlike 13 Assassins which had its serious moments but was much more action driven this movie is deliberately centered on its characters and the quieter moments they share. Although their desperate situation would fit right in with any presentday soap opera we at least are given the opportunity to know who they are. We're also made to feel what they feel unpleasant though it may be.The film like 13 Assassins is a remake of a 1960s Japanese samurai epic and as the tenor of my review makes abundantly clear I haven't seen the original version. No matter I suspect presentday audiences are much more likely to compare this film to 13 Assassins than to its cinematic source. At the risk of sounding like a broken record I'm strongly advising you to steer clear of a 3D presentation of HaraKiri Death of a Samurai. Short of a digital presentation or the celluloid being run through an IMAX 3D projector you will see only dark images that barely register as having any depth  save for a few brief scenes featuring falling snow which is far more noticeable than all the people and swords put together. It's disappointing that Miike felt the need to do as many directors do nowadays and sacrifice imagery for technology. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

He tells Hanshiro the story of a young man who did exactly that not too long ago his request was granted but he only ended up asking for an extra day and ultimately for money. An example was made of him of course and as painfully as possible he went through with the harakiri.In due time Hanshiro is kneeling on a mat in the clan's courtyard surrounded by wellclad wellarmed samurais. But before the suicide ritual can be completed Hanshiro reveals that what he really wants is vengeance for the young man's death. And with that he tells his own story which plays as an extended flashback sequence. We learn that the young man was named Motome Eita and that Hanshiro took him in as a boy and raised him as his own after his father grew ill and died. We watch as Motome and Hanshiro's daughter Miho Hikari Mitsushima grow up together fall in love and ultimately have a baby boy. We watch the entire family enduring more downs than ups as they are poverty stricken. Motome who took to reading and writing at an early age is forced to pawn off his beloved books just for two eggs  one of which inevitably falls and cracks.The film veers into melodramatic territory the instant Miho lets out a small cough and it only gets worse when her baby boy develops a fever. There are specific visuals related to both characters that could have easily been exploited for their ability to horrify an audience but mercifully Miike restrains himself he shows that which is absolutely necessary to get the point across and no more. Unlike 13 Assassins which had its serious moments but was much more action driven this movie is deliberately centered on its characters and the quieter moments they share. Although their desperate situation would fit right in with any presentday soap opera we at least are given the opportunity to know who they are. We're also made to feel what they feel unpleasant though it may be.The film like 13 Assassins is a remake of a 1960s Japanese samurai epic and as the tenor of my review makes abundantly clear I haven't seen the original version. No matter I suspect presentday audiences are much more likely to compare this film to 13 Assassins than to its cinematic source. At the risk of sounding like a broken record I'm strongly advising you to steer clear of a 3D presentation of HaraKiri Death of a Samurai. Short of a digital presentation or the celluloid being run through an IMAX 3D projector you will see only dark images that barely register as having any depth  save for a few brief scenes featuring falling snow which is far more noticeable than all the people and swords put together. It's disappointing that Miike felt the need to do as many directors do nowadays and sacrifice imagery for technology. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net";

	schema:headline " Not bad! Not as good as original.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my first Miike film as I am not a fan of the general themes and stories that he tells. Kobayashi's original with legendary actor Nakadai is a shining example of ironic storytelling in the jidaigeki essentially historical fiction mode. Jidaigeki where it uses swordplay is characterized by short flashes of action as opposed to chambara swordplay or samurai slasher flicks which are all about the action and blood usually copious amounts of it. I notice a number of the reviewers do not know or appreciate the distinction.The original's purposes were multiple but most critics center in on the irony of the red armor which to the casual observer would seem to show the dedication of the house of Ii to honor through the samurai arts. The film shows this to be an empty shell in many ways. It's the delightful sense of irony in all aspects of the storytelling that makes HaraKiri 1962 such a delicious film. Take for example the story of seppuku told by the high official to Hanshiro. In the original when the official tells the ronin of the wooden swords the ronin pulls out his own sword from its sheath briefly to show it is steel. This contrasts with his soninlaw's action but also with the house of Ii who talk a good game but when push comes to shove do not suit their words to action. Miike chooses to substitute a different irony by having Hanshiro use a wooden sword at the end. This leads to some interesting things. For instance the best swordsman of the house of Ii present is soundly beaten in his dual with a classic basic technique of a strike to the head in kendo men with a wooden sword. This in turn invokes the dual between Musashi Miyamoto and Sasaki wherein Musashi used a wooden sword and killed his opponent i.e. Hanshiro is a much better warrior skilled swordsman than the empty Ii but also better warrior honorable samurai. It's not that these new ironies are not fun but the original's use of timing and quick reveals e.g. the topnots does so both more efficiently than the gradual reveals of Miike here but more importantly gets Kobayashi's point across more effectively.Of course in 1962 the wonderful realism and nitty gritty of daily life made popular by Yamada's trilogy of adaptions of Fujisawa's written work Twilight Samurai The Hidden Blade Love and Honor hadn't happened yet and so Miike's adaption has something to offer the previous incarnation did not have but is that tradeoff worth the price in this case? Certainly the darker lighting and more muted colors in set design and costuming gave Miike a chance to be more artistic his shocking use of color in brief autumn scenes and the use of the white cat. Still his desire to create some sympathetic elements in the antagonists e.g. the official's giving 3 ryo and cutting off Motome's head himself needlessly waters down the problem with the house of Ii. Other reviews have said that Miike favors ambiguity but here it's not enough to really create sympathy for the noble house. He should have done either more in fleshing out the character of the head official or less and made the message clearer. It comes across as halfhearted here when the point is to show in both versions that the honor of the house is lacking.Don't get me wrong Miike has made a fine attempt in the new style of jidaigeki one that apparently contrasts with his usually more exploitational style it's just not as good as getting to its point as the original.".

'People of Rome' is at the heart of this movie. Movie doesn't have any official script or storyline. The director wants to show some sections of people of Rome and he does it rather honestly. As a cinematic experiment it is interesting. As the movie doesn't have a particular story or theme when you leave the cinema hall you are not sure how to feel and what to feel. The movie claims to be a reflection of people of Rome and their lives. The first half of the movie is quite light and funny. You get a humorous impression of Romans. But than the movie suddenly changes its mood. It becomes slower and sad.However movie is an honest account of several problems gripping Italian and even European society. It talks boldly about racism and racist attitude of some sections of the society. It talks about mixed feelings of the indigenous people towards immigrants. It also talks about economic stagnation and unemployment of people. It symbolically addresses the issue of homosexuality. And the part movie is most vocal about is the problem of senior citizens. European demography has changed a lot after the second world war. Now it's a society with lots of old people. However with family system fading away taking care of senior citizens is becoming a problem. There is a scene where a father and a son are talking over dinner at a restaurant. The old father is cribbing about everything. He is making fun of the waiter and people around. The son is not able to keep the father with him. And the father gives excellent expression of pleading. You can read in his eyes that he craves to be with his grandchildren.I think it's a movie where the director doesn't want to convey anything. He just wants to express some random thoughts about Rome. He is critical about the city but still you feel that he loves the city. Hence it turns out be an expression of a personal sentiment. But it may fail to appeal masses. If you want to see something different you can try this one. But don't expect to be entertained!!!".

	schema:headline " Roman Tour on digital photography.";
	schema:reviewBody "The three previous commentaries are very good and to the point. I agree with all of them in what they express. That's why I will make no comments of this film because everything has been said. I would only offer empty repetition. I just want to call attention to the way Rome is shown here. They start with a pitch black winter? break of dawn with people on public transportation most of them going to work humble kind of work no doubt if they go to it that early in the day.The photography is digital according to the credits so maybe on a big cinema screen this movie causes a very different impression since I saw it at home on a small flat screen I'm sure I lost plenty with the smallness of the screen size. Little by little the sky changes colors from very deep blues to very bright Mediterranean skies colors quite saturated at the beginning almost black with total absence of chroma start to be recognizable on their own shades. Midday comes along later the golden afternoon and finally night again. A whole day has been photographed through different Roman streets monuments fountains traffic... all of it with care love and a lingering camera quietly going throughout this marvelous city caressing a decaying pale pink wall here a bluegrey cobblestone street pattern there the wet pavement reflecting the thousand traffic lights in movement etc. Of course the movie fails to give us the full impact of the incomparable experience of being there in person but it gives food to the mind to rekindle memories Yes! I know that building! I've been through that street I recognize that monument! and maybe I identified those characters with so many others similar to them in real life! that sort of warm thinking is a delicate subconscious offering of this movie as an understructure for the multiple stories and characters. Nostalgic. Charming. Nice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wives and Lovers 1963Janet Leigh is great Van Johnson likable but a little over the top. Together they make a decent pair struggling with newfound wealth as he sells a big play and they move from the Upper West Side to Connecticut. In the process their marriage goes on the rocks and all the clichs of suburban life are played out. It's funny and warm and silly and a bit thin overall but not so bad as entertainment goes.Director John Rich is a television man which explains a lot. Picture the style of Gomer Pyle and Gunsmoke and Dick Van Dyke all part of his pedigree and you'll get something of the feel of this movie. The fact it rises above these trappings is pretty encouraging. Behind the scenes is Lucien Ballard the crack cinematographer who also did The Wild Bunch six years later among many others.You can't avoid thinking of other couples in suburban traps like Tracy and Hepburn or in a different and more contemporary sense Hudson and Day. There are good jokes and flat ones here amidst some pretty good dialog. There are sidekicks of note squandered perhaps mainly Shelly Winters and Ray Walston. One really funny moment occurs when Walston is playing with the stereo and these radio whiny noises come out exactly like My Favorite Martian which he is most famous for.Van Johnson is no Spencer Tracy for sure but that's okay. He's likable enough and natural enough to be a good struggling dad. The opening scenes look more like 1940s New York than 1963 but that's really the point because old New York gets left behind. Johnson is better in fact as a dad than as a successful playwright and for the second long half of the movie I just never believe him. Nor his supposed attraction to his agent with her horrid hair.But Janet Leigh? She's worth watching and holds the movie together. If you loved her in Psycho for the half hour she's alive in it you'll maybe see another fuller actress here. Her role as a struggling willing and then slightly rebellious housewife is not very attractive but she makes it attractive anyway and less a clich than many other actresses who might start to shriek or cry far too often and loud. Once you tune out the dreck you'll see a very good actress pulling off a difficult role and my appreciation of her rose a little.I guess when you'll hunting hard for pieces to like in a movie you know the whole is disappointing. But heads up about those pieces if you do give it a whirl.".

If you loved her in Psycho for the half hour she's alive in it you'll maybe see another fuller actress here. Her role as a struggling willing and then slightly rebellious housewife is not very attractive but she makes it attractive anyway and less a clich than many other actresses who might start to shriek or cry far too often and loud. Once you tune out the dreck you'll see a very good actress pulling off a difficult role and my appreciation of her rose a little.I guess when you'll hunting hard for pieces to like in a movie you know the whole is disappointing. But heads up about those pieces if you do give it a whirl.";

Other than that the details are surprisingly close to the actual trial and the downbeat ending chillingly mirrors reality. Warner Brothers known in the 1930s as the socially conscious studio had a message to flog and in this case it goes a bit overboard No character has more than one dimension and even that excellent actor Claude Rains as the DA snarls and rolls his eyes and gesticulates wildly overdoing the blind ambition bit.

	schema:reviewBody "One of Warner Brothers' hardhitting' social comment dramas of the 1930s They Won't Forget leaves viewers all riled up  though today maybe less at the judicial process in the Deep South than at Mervyn LeRoy's depiction of it in the movie.  Based not too loosely on the Mary Phagan murder case of 1913 it updates the events to the late Depression and also advances the victim's age Phagan was 13 here the victim  an unrecognizable Lana Turner in her debut  is a student at a small business college.It's Confederate Memorial Day April 26 and the college lets out early unexpectedly for instructor Edward Norris a Northerner.  But Turner returns for the vanity case she's left behind.  Hours later her body is discovered at the base of an elevator shaft.  The town prosecutor Claude Rains slinging a Southern drawl smells a political advantage that might propel him to the state senate an advantage of no use if the perpetrator is only the illiterate black janitor who found her.  Suspicion falls on Norris and soon the judicial establishment the press and the townspeople have turned against him.  Outside help  a detective and a defense attorney  prove of no avail.  Turner is convicted and sentenced to death when the governor commutes his sentence he's lynched as was Leo Frank in the original case. It's fast brutal and pretty unsentimental.LeRoy was known for his slambang takenoprisoners style but here he dawdles at first.  Under the credits is a medley of songs of the South bolstered by quotations from Lincoln and Robert E. Lee to soften up those touchy audiences in Dixie so they won't know what hit them.  When he gets up to speed however he doesn't slacken cutting quick to advance the action  his movie's an unstoppable steamroller just like the judicial railroading of the story the lynching itself expressed by a mailbag clipped off its hook by a passing train is especially and darkly adroit. But there's a nearfatal flaw in the story.  We're meant to harbor persuasive doubts as to Norris' guilt but the possibility of a suspect other than he is never more than fleetingly entertained.  The movie purports to document a miscarriage of justice but it fails to build an ironclad case.".

One look at gimleteyed Trevor Bardette with a voice from the grave is like seeing death incarnate and enough to freeze a platoon of marines in their tracks. Then there's hapless Clinton Rosemon his pleas for mercy so achingly real they echo across generations of tormented black souls. Also not to be overlooked is the bereaved Gloria Dickson. Her righteous anger at movie's end is so heartfelt I expect it probably was. Together with the wily District Attorney Claude Rains there's an uncommon authority to this searing drama of justice gone wrong. There's also an uncommon richness of detail. The script for all its sprawl remains tight and unrelenting a genuine testament to writers Rossen and Kandel. Then too producer Le Roy pulled out all the stops and the results show it. No one acts without apparent reason. Everyone has understandable motivations for doing what they do. That's why the upshot is so tragic. It's as though there's an onrushing train nobody can stop because the momentum is carried by an infernal logic greater than the demands of justice. Despite appearances it's not an antilynching film though it is that. Rather it's a down and dirty look at the cynical roots of injustice. From lowly pool hall to lofty city council no one wants to convict an innocent man but then no one much cares either. This movie stands as a fine example of why Warner Bros. was the studio of record during the stressedout 1930's. Anyway for guys who don't like the gloomy theme there's always the chance to catch Lana Turner as she juggles two balloons while sashaying up the sidewalk in the film's most famous scene. All in all a classic of 30's social realism with Hollywood at its unapologetic best.".

No what occurs seems real and ugly and the film is full of ugly people not sanitized ones. A gritty and compelling drama that is a mustsee for serious fans of Hollywood's Golden Age.For a similar film that is also worth seeing try watching FURY 1936 with Spencer Tracy.

Hale is arrested and tried but the antiNorthern sentiment running through the town guarantees his trial won't be fair.Great role for Claude Rains who owns every scene he's in as a remorseless politician out to further his career regardless of cost. Edward Norris Ann Sheridan's first husband has probably his biggest role as Robert Hale and does a fine job. Film debut of Allyn Joslyn who plays a slimy reporter colluding with Rains. Pretty Gloria Dickson plays Hale's wife. She has a potent speech at the end. First significant role for Lana Turner. Note the tight sweater which accentuates her...attributes. This is why she was dubbed the sweater girl early in her career. The rest of the cast is made up of familiar faces including Otto Kruger and Elisha Cook Jr. Loosely based on the real story of Leo Frank a Jewish man accused of murdering 13 yearold Mary Phagan in Georgia. He was lynched in 1915. The story here keeps antisemitism out of it instead making it more of a focus on the resentments and prejudices of the South towards the North. Having grown up in the South I know these sentiments were very real for many even decades after this movie was made. This is a film that examines everything from bigotry to mob mentality and the manipulation of the public by politicians and the media. Sociologically and historically relevant it's a powerful movie from Warner Bros. with a good cast.".

Another one of those was the Leo Frank case where a Jewish man and a northerner was tried and found guilty of the murder of Mary Phagan in Georgia. From that case the novel and the film They Won't Forget was constructed with the names and the religion of the defendant changed to protect God knows what.Even with the name changed to a white bread WASP name of Hale Warner Brothers was taking a chance on losing the southern market with the making of They Won't Forget. Edward Norris as the outsider teacher at a small business school in a southern town is a man totally caught in the regional prejudices of a section of the country that is still fighting the War between the states.Norris is accused of murdering young Lana Turner in her breakthrough role as an attractive and saucy young teenager. Though there is nothing but circumstantial evidence pointing to him and it could point to a few others he's the most convenient one to prosecute because he's not of the community. So reasons Claude Rains an ambitious prosecutor who figures that a conviction in a notorious case will propel his political career upward. Rains portrays a man of frightening ambition and a type we're all too familiar with in real life.Although the Leo Frank case took place in the teen years and this film is set in the contemporary Thirties things hadn't changed all that much in the south. Otto Kruger as Norris's defense attorney and Gloria Dickson as his stricken wife also giver noteworthy performances Trevor Bardette may have had a career role as Turner's father. He's a frightening man filled with anger and among the small parts he really stands out.Mervyn LeRoy got some truly great performances from his players. They Won't Forget is something you won't forget.".

Though there is nothing but circumstantial evidence pointing to him and it could point to a few others he's the most convenient one to prosecute because he's not of the community. So reasons Claude Rains an ambitious prosecutor who figures that a conviction in a notorious case will propel his political career upward. Rains portrays a man of frightening ambition and a type we're all too familiar with in real life.Although the Leo Frank case took place in the teen years and this film is set in the contemporary Thirties things hadn't changed all that much in the south. Otto Kruger as Norris's defense attorney and Gloria Dickson as his stricken wife also giver noteworthy performances Trevor Bardette may have had a career role as Turner's father. He's a frightening man filled with anger and among the small parts he really stands out.Mervyn LeRoy got some truly great performances from his players. They Won't Forget is something you won't forget.";

	schema:reviewBody "They Won't Forget released in 1937 is a hardhitting look at prejudice and North versus South politics. A young student in a business school Lana Turner in her first role is killed. Fingers soon point to her school teacher from up North Edward Norris. Whether or not he is guilty seems not to matter to the residents of this small southern town. Claude Rains has a stellar role here as the prosecutor you love to hate a man who has high political ambitions and wants to bring a conviction no matter who has to to hang for it. Clearly there is nothing but circumstantial evidence against the teacher something a lawyer Otto Kruger from New York points out. He comes to the southern town to defend the teacher as the case has received national attention. A sleazy newspaper guy who is in league with the prosecutor makes certain the case stays in the headlines leading to massive rumors and speculation about the man's guilt. This is not an uplifting movie and I found myself getting outraged while watching it. But this is what Warner Brothers often did in the 1930's  while MGM was focused on glitz and glamour Warner's was down in the streets and bringing us great social commentary films like this one. And I think it is quite daring by 1937 standards. The performances are good ones. Rains has a tough time hiding his British accent but he fascinates anyway. Norris is adequate as the school teacher although he never had much of a career. Lana Turner was probably all of 16 or 17 here and a real beauty and we can already see glimpses of why she became the star she did.".

I've been wanting to see this film for many years now after hearing so much about it and it certainly didn't let me down. I think the courtroom drama is probably my favorite genre and this here ranks with the very best out there. What really stands out are the performances which are all excellent. Norris doesn't stand out in the crowd but he delivers a very somber performance. The real standout is Gloria Dickson as his wife. The final speech she gives is quite chilling and very memorable. Rains also gives a great performance although I think he goes a bit over the top in a couple of the courtroom scenes. Lana Turner in her screen debut also comes off very memorable especially with her giggle as she walks down the street in that tight sweater. Mervyn LeRoy does a great job at building all the suspense and anger that surrounds the controversy of the case which is based on a true story. After watching this film as well as Mississippi Burning this year it's rather amazing to know this stuff happened within the last onehundred years.".

The movie also replaces Hale's or Leo Frank whom he's supposed to be ethnicity of being Jewish to being a northerner which is the real reason in the movie that the people of the small southern town of Flodden have such a bitter hatred for him.

The ambitious DA who nails him is Claude Raines. Defense is provided by Otto Krueger. There are other familiar faces in the film directed for Warner Brothers by Mervyn LeRoy.I wonder what the folklorist Claude LeviStrauss would make of this. He believed that people thought in categories that thought was like language. One word was never like another word. Things were either the same or not the same. Likewise this movie seems to have very little in between one thing and its opposite. LeviStrauss would probably have applauded.The movie gives us NorthSouth Memorial DayDecoration Day GuiltyInnocent LifeDeath ReasonEmotion and a host of other oppositions. It leaves out ChristianJewish from the original case of Leo Franks. The relatives of Mary Clay stop a train carrying the convicted suspect who is about to be pardoned by the governor and they hang him off screen. None of the townspeople seem to have any doubt about what's going to happen. And nobody seems to disapprove. They don't even mourn the victim Mary Clay. Their shock turns immediately to rage without any intervening period of grief. The opposite of rage seems not to be sorrow for the lost Mary but moral innocence. I didn't do it! all the possible suspects shout. I suspect in a way the movie misses the point. It presents the story as a simple miscarriage of justice prompted by the hostility of an insular community to an outsider. But in essence a lynching doesn't necessarily have to be the carrying out of some vernacular vision of justice. That's not the point. Nor is This'll teach 'em a lesson.One important point of a lynching perhaps the main point is that it expresses community allegiance. It's a rite of intensification whose real purpose is not that different from the Memorial Day parade with which the film starts. It's like the Fourth of July or Christmas. Photos of lynchings usually show some of the spectators grinning at the camera. All that's missing is the fireworks. The significance is that this is an important community event in which WE were brave enough to take part. Once the smoke of battle clears the prevalent emotion is not the residue of rage but pride.Some of the writing is pretty good. An example. During jury deliberations one man finds a note in his pocket Vote Guilty If You Feel Like Living. He's been holding out for the man's innocence. Now he tells the others angrily that he'll stick to his principles and not be swayed by threats. Another jurist an elderly and avuncular type explains to him that he's just worried about what people will say. It takes courage to disregard a death threat and vote guilty anyway. Nobody will think the worse of him if he votes along with the others. It's a smooth way of handling a truculent dissident. Vote guilty DESPITE the threat to kill you if you don't. That's the way a real man would do it. What a sales pitch and delivered with such quiet confidence. Raines' prosecutor is equally adroit. They say we're prejudiced against Yankees. Let's show them we're NOT prejudiced by hanging this guilty one and leaving the others alone! The acting is a little overwrought on everybody's part the direction is functional and the story though camouflaged states itself quickly and then ends without much wasted motion. Even a shot of a train rattling smokily over a bridge is under cranked so it appears in accelerated motion. The court and the press are both phony and should be jailed themselves but they're not. It's a rather bitter ending when Raines and a reporter are watching the murdered man's wife leave town and the reporter muses I wonder if he was really innocent and Raines dispassionately agrees that it's a good question. The justice system is certainly an efficient way of delivering pain to a lot of people.".

Nobody will think the worse of him if he votes along with the others. It's a smooth way of handling a truculent dissident. Vote guilty DESPITE the threat to kill you if you don't. That's the way a real man would do it. What a sales pitch and delivered with such quiet confidence. Raines' prosecutor is equally adroit. They say we're prejudiced against Yankees. Let's show them we're NOT prejudiced by hanging this guilty one and leaving the others alone! The acting is a little overwrought on everybody's part the direction is functional and the story though camouflaged states itself quickly and then ends without much wasted motion. Even a shot of a train rattling smokily over a bridge is under cranked so it appears in accelerated motion. The court and the press are both phony and should be jailed themselves but they're not. It's a rather bitter ending when Raines and a reporter are watching the murdered man's wife leave town and the reporter muses I wonder if he was really innocent and Raines dispassionately agrees that it's a good question. The justice system is certainly an efficient way of delivering pain to a lot of people.";

	schema:headline " Excellent film based on a true story although not Claude Rains at this best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a bit of an unusual film. First it's loosely based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank after the murder of Mary Phagan back in 1913. The film is really about prejudice. First prejudice against Blacks when the custodian of the school where the Mary Phagan character was murdered and raped?. Second against Jews when the teacher is instead accused tried and lynched.The cast is interesting. Claude Rains plays the district attorney and I am not impressed with his performance here. Ir's so unlike how we usually see Rains that it just doesn't work and I say that as a person who usually like Rains very much.Edward Norris plays the professor ultimately accused of the crime. He seems pretty good for the part. Norris didn't have a very prolific career but his performance here works quite well. They do a nice job here with the character who appears to be innocent but who says things and acts in little ways that would lead some people to think he is guilty.Otto Kruger as Michael Gleason Allyn Joslyn a character actor who usually did nicely in comedy is here as a reporter but I wasn't very impressed.Gloria Dickson who in real life died in a fire after a short career in films does reasonably nicely as the charged husband's wife.The murdered girl is played by none other than Lana Turner. Of course she doesn't last long but it was a decent start to her career.One of my favorite character actors  Otto Kruger  aptly plays the defense attorney.Elisha Cook has a small role and one that is rather different than his typical one. A nice contrast though not overly important to the film.Clinton Rosemond is excellent as the Negro janitor although the part he plays is very stereotypical in the way that it portrays Blacks of the era. Nevertheless it is an honorable acting performance.Elisabeth Risdon plays the convicted murderer's mother a very dependable and recognizable character actress.Aside from the murder case itself an important aspect of the film was that it took place in the South thus implying that Southerners were bigots no comment as to whether that's an appropriate observation you decide. Of course you have the 2 racial aspects a Black man and then a Jew  although the Jewish angle is not tackled here and then because the Jewish character in the real life case is an educated man from the North. This substitution of a White man from the North instead of a Jew is emphasized at the beginning of the film with the Confederate soldiers who would appear to play and important role in the film...but then do not at all. The wonderful Harry Davenport plays one of the old soldiers though it is a terribly small part. The other aspect of this film that is done quite nicely is the small town environment where rumors spread like wildfire which eventually lead to a lynching.An interesting footnote  at the beginning of the film there is a rather dramatically highlighted statement assuring viewers that the characters in the film do not represent any person living or deceased. While in reality of course they do.Keeping in mind that this film was made in 1937 there's not a lot wrong with this picture. A little oldfashioned to be sure. You'll laugh at how fast the train is moving in one scene but that's minor stuff. And some of the Southern accents here are rather questionable in fact that's probably the biggest problem with Claude Rains' performance. But don't let that stop you from watching this film.In my internal rating system a good film gets a 7. It takes a Gone With The Wind or Ben Hur film to get a 10 and something just a tad lighter to get a 9. So an 8 which I am giving this film is more than just a good film but a VERY good film. Recommended.".

I would like to add to all the other reviews just one important element the one related to the song that 'inspired' this film and that has encouraged a whole genre in the following years in Italy. The song 'Malafemmina' was written  and often sung  by Tot himself a 'Princely' poet as well. The term 'malafemmina' has many shades and does not necessarily have to be referred to a woman's moral habits but in this case it should be understood more as a 'cruelty of heart' attributed to women who does not care about the evil she can do to those who happen to be caught between their 'clutches' ... The film is the result of a perfect mix of situations that allow two great products from the Italian revue theater to express their full potential and in some cases genius. Genius manifests itself only when the conditions for its emergence are created and therefore everyone is deserving in this film because everyone contributed to the end result comical perfection! If something special about this movie has to remain in you that is just the song itself listen carefully to it and if you do not know the language then look for a translation on the web ... And an additional advice look for another poem of Tot's possibly in your own language 'a livella ie the bubble level ... It will help you understand why Tot also the 'Prince' ... of laughter was so great.P.S. For those who aren't acquainted with the subject it's useful to know that Tot was indeed entitled to 'princedom' in sheer terms of heraldry. That's the reason for so many allusions as of above.".

It will help you understand why Tot also the 'Prince' ... of laughter was so great.P.S. For those who aren't acquainted with the subject it's useful to know that Tot was indeed entitled to 'princedom' in sheer terms of heraldry. That's the reason for so many allusions as of above.";

She rises early to prepare everything for the day she toils all day long and she is often up also in the night doing some sewing to earn extra money for the household. In daytime she is supported by an old woman called Mads who was Victors' nanny when he was a child. Mads is filled with loathing for Victor's behavior towards his wife and calls him a brute. She understands that Ida is on the verge of a serious breakdown and persuades Ida's mother Mrs. Kryer to take Ida away. Mads will herself take care of the household and the children for a time. When Victor comes home and finds out that Ida is gone he gets angry. He asks his daughter Karen where her mother is but she refuses to tell him. She only says that her mother is very ill and that it will be his fault if she dies. The accusation strikes Victor in his heart and he sits down feeling dejected. Karen ...";

This is a film where you can find some gentle spirit lying beneath.  Some sort of quietness that fulfils the whole movie.  As in many other of his early movies Dreyer puts the spectator in a superior level.  We are given the opportunity to watch an everyday's scene a woman subjugated to a spoilt man's will.  We watch her wake up early in the morning wash dishes clean the whole house prepare her husband's breakfast and all she gets in exchange is bad manners and retreats from him. The complot that the nanny builds up to make the man feel guilty and so to make him behave unfolds in a subtle and sometimes funny way making the watching more enjoyable from the distance.It's hard to describe the perfect acting that the main characters bring to this beautiful film an acting full of details and emotion.Enjoyable form the first frame to the last one this film will work perfectly for Dreyer's fans as long as for those who ever thought this was a tough one.  It's probably the perfect bridge to approach to Dreyer's masterpieces such as Ordet and Gertrud.Hope you like it as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin I must confess that I am not eternally in awe at the genius of the director Dreyer. While he has an absolutely amazing reputation several of his more famous films have left me a bit flat. So it was a very welcome thing when I watched this more conventional and entertaining filmafter his vampire film and the other about Joan of Arc I was really really looking forward to something lighter in mood. This film was exactly what I had in mind. This is a pretty ordinary domestic comedy for Dreyer. I don't say ordinary in a bad sense but that the film felt more approachable and designed for the common person in the audience instead of being an obsessivelymade art film which he was famous for making. Okay now that I probably have insulted all the Dreyer fans out there I'll get on the heart of my review.This is the tale of an overworked and completely unappreciated housewife. In so many ways she tries so hard so be the perfect wife but the cad of a husband can do nothing but criticize and berate her as well as be harsh towards the kids. And the wife being a codependent a nice modern psychobabble word huh? she thinks all she needs to do is try even harder and she makes excuse after excuse for the jerk. This seems to be a problem without a solution until the husband's old nanny comes to the home and sees how frazzled the wife is and how the hubby is a selfish spoiled brat. Supernanny comes to the rescuegetting the wife out of the house and to a sanitarium for a rest. And with the nanny back in charge the spoiled guy slowly starts to realize just how good he had itas he no longer is allowed to bully and browbeat to get his way.The film is mildly funny but is meant more as social commentary. In some ways it's pretty effective but at times it is also kind of heavyhanded. Also the film says things like all men are that way and women do three times the work of men and so it seems like the profeminist message is just a little too much at times. Instead of presenting a balanced view and showing how both men and women work hard and deserve respect that men are like big babies and women are the backbone of every family. While this is definitely true of the family in this film the film is itself perpetuating a stereotype. This can easily be forgiven as in the 1920s women were so much more underappreciated so it isn't like it irritated meit just tended to occasionally use hyperbole and overstate things to drive the point homeagain and again and againmaking the film a tad heavyhanded. My advice is to ignore the excesses and just enjoy good filmmaking and entertainment.".

That's the timeless universality of film I suppose a Danish movie made over 80 years ago is still relevant today.This was my first Dreyer and it is quite a light offering considering the man's weighty reputation. It's a social drama with a patently feminist message delivered with a typically heavy hand by today's standards. Johannes Meyer is Viktor the decent man turned into a brute by the failure of his business who doesn't realise just how much he takes his longsuffering wife Ida Astrid Holm for granted. Fortunately for Ida Viktor's curmudgeonly former nanny Mathilde Neilsen takes control of the situation by packing the frazzled Ida off to a sanatorium so that she can sort Viktor out. The film drags for the first halfhour as the daily ritual of the Frandsen family is established. Let's face it there's little of interest in watching people polishing shoes and preparing breakfast but things get a little more interesting once Nanny takes charge. It's message is a bit too sweeping although all us men are probably guilty to some degree and a little too simplistic in its treatment and resolution but there's plenty on the screen to demonstrate Dreyer's talent as a director  although some symbolism caged birds for example must have been overused even by 1925. A decent enough film worth watching despite its mundane setting.".

	schema:headline " Dreyer the master";
	schema:reviewBody "Du skal re din hustru was restored last year by Palladium the original company that released it in 1925. It was also released on DVD along with the likewise newly restored Vredens Dag Ordet and Gertrud. These are actually the first ever releases on DVD by the Danes themselves of their most important films. It took some time but the result is splendid at least as far as Du skal re din hustru is concerned. The current version is free from scratches and dirt and comes with the original Danish intertitles. It runs for 107 minutes.Having seen the other early Dreyer films before Jeanne both long ago on the screen and on DVD relatively recent I must say that this remains for me without doubt the most interesting one. Indeed it is great! This is because its success is purely cinematographic Although based on the popular 1919 play The tyrant's fall it strikes me how little it resembles a stage performance how well the natural acting not in any way overacted is integrated in the two or three small rooms of the troubled family's apartment not least how excellently the scenes are constructed and especially the lightning which is never too bright yet bringing out every detail in the house. It is a joy to see this environment come alive a cross between a petit bourgeois and an upper working class world as well as to study the many objects appearing from another time The carefully hung pictures on the walls the alwaysburning oven it is winter with its place for the kettle and all the small oddities from a hundred years ago well almost. Indeed Dreyer himself paid utmost importance to it he constructed everything from scratch to look exactly like a Christianshavn apartment and he made sure that the camera always was positioned around the characters like it was another ghostly member of the family. We are drawn into the surroundings in a way that a theatre stage never could manage and the actors are shown in their best possible manner where only a small wink or a troubled gaze is enough to indicate what goes on inside them and how they interact with one another. This is a huge step forward from the previous films by Dreyer and indeed from most other films at the time. As the plot is well cared for by other posters I will not bother here with any details but must say that I find the relationship between husband and wife to be as realistic as could be hoped for in a 1925 movie Viktor may be a tyrant but only a household tyrant they can be bad enough. He is cross not violent. And Ida may be the typical suffering and underappreciated wife but she bares her lot with great dignity. She loves him and supports him because she understands that his loss of business gives him hard times he can barely support his family yet he must appear like a winner to the outside world. The children seem to understand this as well particularly the sympathetic and obedient Karen but also her younger brother Frederik who must nevertheless endure some humiliating punishment. They seem to know every possible little detail that Viktor craves and they try not to makes things worse for him. That leaves the rebel of the house Viktor's old nanny who provides both comical relief and some clever revenge structures. They all tell so much by playing so little it is as if the story could be told almost by their gestures alone without the need of the abundance of intertitles which to me are only stating the obvious. We can see what's going on every frame tells a story and every cut makes us notice how swiftly the action can change from the tense to the out of hand. Dreyer is really himself the master of the house as far as editing is concerned often creating fast moving scenes by making movement continue from one shot to another in a masterful way that was not common at that time. Today it easy to overlook such important details and consequently loose much of what makes this film special. When first released the film was an outstanding success both with the critics and with the audiences both in Denmark and abroad most notably in France where Le Temps saw its simplicity and attention to small details as a great example to be followed by French directors. In 1925 that included at least Jean Renoir whose first films were not free from stagey drama and overacting Nana.... The official Carl Th. Dreyer website provides both this review and others although you need to brush up your Danish to read them Well if James Joyce could do it... It seems that the Danish critics all agreed that this was the best Danish film yet. The site also provides the full manuscript with many scenes missing from the current print. I think I remember seeing a beautiful scene where Karen full of sisterly love washes the nude Frederik who is standing in a basin in the kitchen but it is now missing. It is however shown on a still photo that is both on the DVD and on the Dreyersite. Was it censored? Or is it just my dirty imagination? There are also some hilarious fantasy scenes in the manuscript including one where Viktor is horsewhipping the entire family who are pulling him around on a wagon that were either not filmed or cut somewhere along the way.Anyway the film as we have it in the current print remains one of the most moving of its era as good as the similar ones by Murnau and Pabst from around the same time say Tartuffe and Geheimnisse einer Seele and that for me is as good as domestic cinema ever got in the twenties.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of a spoilt husband  selfish irritable very illtempered and demanding as he rules the house while his patientdevoted wife gets up at the crack of dawn to start her drab day of tending to his constant needs and complaints. Even the kids have to perform tasks all day rather than play to satisfy their tyrant of a father  but he's NEVER satisfied nothing seems to be to his liking! Yeah you got it this guy is a serious jerk leaving me to wonder why the wife hasn't left him long ago. Luckily smart Nana hubby's childhood nursemaid steps up to the plate to help make some changes as she fetches the wife's mother and the two old women set out to straighten this guy out and teach him the lesson he so badly needs  to appreciate his wife. So the wife goes away for a rest well needed I should say leaving hardnosed Nana in charge of the brute!This film is adequately entertaining it is photographed in an interesting way but is somewhat slowmoving and drags a bit in places. I would say at least half an hour shorter would have made this a better film. The acting is quite well done by all players. The version as shown on TCM included a pleasant piano score that sometimes suits the plot  and sometimes doesn't. Worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Overlooked family feminist comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Carl Th. Dreyer is best known for his religious dramas like The Passion of Joan of Arc Day of Wrath and Ordet so that he made this little family comedy is quite a shock. Possessing no religious themes whatsoever Master of the House 1925 focuses its attention on the plight of women in the domestic sphere. The movie concerns a woman whose duties as wife and mother leave her exhausted due to her husband's nastiness and lack of understanding. She lets his behavior slide since she knows he has been stressed since he lost his high ranking position at work but this neglect of her own health leads to a nervous breakdown. Fed up with the injustice the elderly Nana has the wife go away for a few days so she can put the master of the house back in his place.While the film is comic it is not of the laugh out loud variety. It is a gentle comedy though it pulls no punches when it comes to calling out the undervaluing of domestic work. All the actors are restrained and portray family tensions and tenderness with great realism making the film feel more authentic. It's a shame it has been so overlooked a feminist gem silent film geeks shouldn't miss.".

	schema:headline " The Hidden Heroine";
	schema:reviewBody "The scene is set by the initial articulate titles  a spoilt husband a forgotten heroine and Nana the all wise one. John is the master of the house  a tyrant who complains from the time he opens his eyes in the morning  no spoons not enough butter shoes need mending coffee should be on the table before he sits down etc. Mary is the hidden heroine  the wife who is up before sunup attending to the house so it runs like clockwork even on the limited housekeeping budget she receives. Every morning there is a struggle to get all the tasks done on time before John returns for lunch. Nana an old nurse who looked after John when he was a child comes in the morning to do sewing  and she doesn't like what she sees although for Mary's sake she stays silent. She does fetch Mary's mother and then they are all a witness to one of John's tirades. Over the years he has become a bully but Mary feels it has become worse since he lost his business and she is now broken in mind and body.When demanding John returns from work he finds Mary has been whisked away by her mother and now Nana has taken her place. Life is very different for John now and within a month he finds himself once again a small boy terrified of his nurse's wrath  so the title says. He becomes closer to his young daughter and through her admissions he realises all the little sacrifices Mary made for his comfort  sewing far into the night to earn extra money for luxuries like meat and butter.It is the little scenes of home life that make this picture so perfect. The frugalities such as scraping butter from the children's bread so John will have plenty and scrimping and saving so there will be enough to have John's shoes repaired. I love the scene where Mary dashes to the cobblers to pick up John's repaired shoes before she goes on her holiday gives them to Nana who carefully locks them in the cupboard with a wry little smile!!! It is hard to say whether the actors are great they are just so real in their roles but in my opinion dominating the film is Mathilde Nielson as the all wise Nana  who never seems to sleep who sees everything that goes on and decides that the right time for Mary to come home is the time when John is made to stand in the corner!!!Highly Recommended.".

	schema:headline " OldFashioned Male Social Conduct";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been well known for centuries that aristocrats have among other virtues a spoiled and frivolous disposition but it is certainly very strange that such privileged characteristics are sometimes shared with certain commoners.And that's precisely what happens with Herr Viktor in the film Du Skal Aere Din Hustru  Master Of The House  a film directed by Herr Carl Theodor Dreyer in the silent year of 1925 in which is depicted the tyranny of Herr Viktor over his family the man is always in a bad humour and takes out his frustration on his wife Frau Ida and children  aristocrats correspondently are always in the same mood and do the same with their servants .Du Skal Aere Din Hustru is an unpleasant film the chronicle of an unhappy marriage constituted by a dutiful and selfsacrificing wife and her irascible and demanding husband. It is an excellent portrait of oldfashioned male social conduct that in other times was considered almost normal in many European societies the head of the household's supremacy and unquestioned rights which meant the psychological and physical maltreatment suffered by many women around the world even today.Such an embarrassing subject is treated with sensitivity by Herr Dreyer in what it is a detailed account of the tyranny of the husband over his family especially during the first part of the film where in a detailed way the whims continuous demands and bad behaviour of Herr Viktor achieves a vivid portrait of a disagreeable man.Most of the film is set indoors in the family apartment achieving in this way the feeling of a more oppressive atmosphere that is suffered by the wife and her children a cage where they live just like the canaries owned by Frau Ida.In such a claustrophobic atmosphere the wife dutifully and quietly goes about her daily work routine a sacrificing spouse and mother who puts the health of her body and soul at risk doing such labor for an ungrateful and contemptuous man. These sequences are realistic and without artifice ja wohl.During the second part of the film and thanks to the help of an old woman who was Viktor's nanny we will see the process of the reeducation of this illspirited man which brings him down to earth and out of his frustration and anger. This proves to be a long and complicated task that the old woman will do boldly and effectively.Herr Johannes Meyer who plays the husband does an excellent job as the tormented man who behaves improperly with his family although he isn't quite conscious of his tyranny. His attitude is caused by economic and work problems which lead him to take out his anger and frustration on the people around him the beloved ones who can't understand but suffer in silence such bad behaviour.Herr Meyer performs his character in a restrained way without overacting or extravagant gestures a fine depiction of an unfeeling man who can't express any emotion except anger. Frau Astrid Holm who plays the wife is equally convincing. Herr Dreyer's careful direction scrutinizes these scenes from a marriage and the unhappiness that results and must be dealt with. And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must reeducate himself about some aristocratic oldfashioned conduct.".

	schema:reviewBody "Master of the House 1925  out of 4An introduction that came with my viewing of this film had me learning that this here was the second and final comedy that director Carl Theodor Dreyer would make in his career and this here also turned out to be the only hit of his career. This comedy centers on an abusive husband Johannes Meyer who is constantly putting down his hardworking wife Astrid Holm which doesn't sit well with the man's former nanny Mathilde Nielsen who decides to send the wife away so that she can teach him a lesson. MASTER OF THE HOUSE is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen in my life. I say that because had I not read a few reviews or seen the introduction then never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that this here was a comedy. There's simply not a single laugh to be had anywhere and I really can't see where there was even much of an attempt for humor. With that said the film works well for several reasons but I think the biggest is that it's a pretty interesting look at the differences between men and women in these older days. The social message here is certainly something interesting to watch and especially when you consider how it shows the nonpaid work that a wife does and doesn't get credit for. The film also gets some very strong performances and especially by Meyer. I thought he was completely believable in the role of the abusive husband and even when the screenplay becomes predictable Meyer manages to make you believe everything you're watching. Carl Theodor Dreyer isn't one of my favorite directors and while this film is lacking his typical style I think it shows that the director could handle something more mainstream than what we normally saw from him.".

One that while easy to follow and reasonably well acted and edited a good halfhour or more of this movie could be cut and no one would be the wiser. In fact doing so would improve the production quite a bit. Second this is NOT a comedy by any known definition. Most of it is a stark depiction of a family suffering under the thumb of the cold insensitivity of the leading male character. One really feels for that character's wife and children who seem to accept his abuse as the price of living under his roof. This same plot line has turned up in many other movies  including 1932's Birthday Blues one of the very best of the Our Gang shorts. So who actually is the most interesting player here? Surprisingly it's the elderly former nanny  played by a woman whose body language and facial expressions are spoton in every scene. In the latter part of this movie the master comes to realize the enormous value of his wife's contribution to their home  and how it is she who is the glue holding their household together. That was true in many marriages in 1925 and remains so today  which makes the film's main point still relevant nearly a century later.".

	schema:headline " A Radical Feminist Film Way Ahead Of Its Time !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Carl Dreyer's Master Of The House 1925 is an antEstablishment film that is very radical for 1925. Being the first Dreyer film that I've ever watched I must say that it took me by complete surprise being very different from any other silent era European film that I've viewed. This is a film that was definitely ahead of its time.Master Of The House is definitely a feminist film decades before feminist both as a word  as an idea even existed.It highlights the dependence of the wife on the husband in the traditional nuclear family. In this film as in most families in the whole world in 1925 the wife did not hold a job outside the home. She was totally financially dependent on the husband. The husband was seen by his wife his children  indeed by the whole world as the supreme unquestioned authority figure in the home. His decisions were never questioned. The wife was to be the subservient ever obedient door mat who never dared to criticize or question her husband. His every whim  criticism was his command to her. The wife as is the wife in this film is very codependent inasmuch as she psychologically adjusts herself to believe that her husband can do no wrong regardless of how outrageous his behavior  criticisms are. Indeed her codependency convinces her to believe that she is deserving of her husband's bad behavior  that he would behave better if she could only do a better job as the ever faithful wife. As such this paragraph is a quick thematic sketch of the first half of Master Of The House.The most radical part of the film is the second half which dares to suggest that the wife need not tolerate her husband's bad behavior  indeed can do something to improve it. Because throughout this film right to the end the wife is the ever compliant door mat it is the intervention of interested third parties that causes a moral reform in the husband's domestic behavior. Thusly although it is a radical feminist film it stops short of actually inciting disgruntled wives in the audience to openly rebel against their authoritarian husbands although drawing such a conclusion wouldn't be difficult for any viewer. Most significantly this film has a happy ending thereby suggesting that attempts to reform boorish authoritarian husbands can actually lead to a happier marriage this is definitely a subtle prompt for wifely rebellion among females in the audience.This film is also a not so subtle indictment of the traditional patriarchal nuclear family. Basically it attempts to show that at least some aspects of the traditional nuclear family structure are not good. This is a very radical message to deliver in a 1925 film.Although this film is quite radical for its times subtly inciting rebellion among oppressed housewives  attacking the traditional cornerstone of the nuclear family the unchallenged moral authority of the male the husband  father who is the head of the family Dreyer did constrain his antEstablishmentism within certain limits. As already mentioned the wife in this subversive tale never actually becomes a true feminist. She is the compliant door mat from the start to the end  the feminist dirty work is delegated to wiser  older third parties who not coincidentally are women. This film shows no physical abuse in the home. This film shows no hint of adultery by either the husband or the wife. Although the wife does depart the household for a time she does in fact return as poorly as the husband is initially portrayed in this film the ultimate cohesion of the nuclear family is not questioned in this film.It is significant that the wife's mother to whom the wife retreats is show to have financial means. Her large home is much better furnished than her daughter's small apartment. The mother is even shown to have a maid. The mother can even afford to summon a physician to her home to examine her daughter the worn out wife. In the final scene the wife's mother is even shown giving her now reformed soninlaw a bank check for 10000 Danish dollars to start a new business in another province. So from all indications the wife's mom is loaded.Yet as financially well off as the wife's mother is in this film there is no suggestion by any character that the mother use her money to facilitate a permanent break up of her daughter's marriage. Surely if the wife's mother can give her soninlaw 10000 bucks to open a new business then she has the money to make her daughter similarly financially independent of her once abusive husband by facilitating a permanent break up of the marriage a divorce. But because this film is quite careful after all is said  done in affirming the unity  cohesion of the nuclear family such a consideration is never even entertained.So this is not only a thought provoking even radical antiEstablishment film but it is also a very well considered  well thought out film because it only goes so far in its revolutionary feminist trumpet call to the females in the viewing audience. Dreyer surely realized that he could only go so far with his revolutionary zeal  kept this film within certain boundaries.There is no doubt in my mind that this film was the cause of many domestic disputes in the 1920's. I am quite certain that word of this film spread among the female population  that many a wife dragged her husband to see this film  hoping that he could learn something about being a more considerate  appreciative husband. I am quite sure that this film caused many marital arguments  perhaps some divorces.".

	schema:reviewBody "Typical movie of Brass's last licentious period. For those who don't know Tinto Brass I'm talking of his third period from 'Cos fan tutte' to this repetitive 'Monamour'. Nothing comparable to his previous period from 1983 'La Chiave' to 1991 'Paprika'. Repetitive is the right attribute to this nasty movie that lost the originality of 'Capriccio' or 'Senso 45'. It is another movie full of Brass obsessions like hungry voluptuous women impatient to be sodomized to be unfaithful to go with everyone but not their husbands. Incredibly the sets are more or less the same of 'Senso '45' 'Fermo posta Tinto Brass' and 'Fallo!'. So the photography. Nothing new at all also some shots are the same. On the background anyway you can still find out the usual Brass' hymn to sensuality and lust.More interesting is on the DVD edition region 2 the making off that show us all the tricks used to film all the 'deep impact' explicit sex scenes i.e. fake penis fake prospectives etc. etc.. Anna Jimskaia is Ukraine just for your info and was chosen by director for her bottom As usual!SPOILERS follow.The plot is very easy. During 2005 Mantova Festival Letteratura edition  Marta the deluded wife of Dario a writer meet Leon and start the habitual Brass lustdriven adventure. If you already saw the last seven Tinto's movie you won't find anything new a part from the wonderful location I would say better than the Venice of 'La Chiave' or 'Senso '45'.My vote is 5 out of 10.".

If you already saw the last seven Tinto's movie you won't find anything new a part from the wonderful location I would say better than the Venice of 'La Chiave' or 'Senso '45'.My vote is 5 out of 10.";

And for those who take exception to the non PC and violent elements I guess if this is your first Tinto Brass movie you could be forgiven for being taken aback that this is not all silky hand upon silky thigh to the drone of some appalling musak. But come on everybody else this is Mr Brass this is Italian so we get gutsy action bottoms up bottoms open and even bottoms on the toilet. True we are given to understand that the leading lady is fantasizingdesiring all of this whereas it is of course Mr Brass who is in charge of the fantasies portrayed but then this is only a movie. Anna Jimskaia comes from Tashkent Uzbekistan and has been a circus performer and gymnast so no wonder she can bend that bottom high and so beautifully. Max Parodi is a little over the top as her failing husband but Riccardo Marino is suitably moody as her 'French' lover. This may be a bit vigorous for some lifelike prosthetic penises make you wonder why not the real thing but whilst perhaps not the ideal first date movie I reckon you get what's on the can".

She is a feast to watch especially when she appears sans clothes or is in revealing attire which she is a lot many times throughout the film. Some of the clothes she wears are so Tinto! It is a film a Bmovie to be specific its not a porn film with a story and a script.But it feels like a remix of the director's older movies. It tries to play out suggestive sexuality but in a way it stops short of it. The psychological surge of sensuality and kink that is a characteristic of Tinto is there but is not as strong in his other films like The Voyeur. That is why feels like there is nothing much in the way of the movie. The performances of the cast could have been stronger but it is the relative weakness of script has played its part in the notthatstrong characterization of the cast.It a turnyouon movie. Nothing much but I like it the way it is. Worth watching just for every scene of Anna Jimskaia and the camera that's on to her!".

At least I think they're prosthetic. I certainly hope so. One of them resembles something that should be found on a horse or maybe an elephant.The plot what there is of it is unremarkable. A young woman has been married for only six months to her publisher husband and already she's bored with his love making so she seeks stimulation elsewhere  in literature in fantasies in memories and finally in the person of Leon a tattooed French guy who turns out to be rough but satisfying trade.The young blond is Anna Jimskaia. Nobody else's name matters. She's the kind of caricature of desirable pulchritude that Anita Ekberg parodied in La Dolce Vita. She's attractive but in an entirely conventional way no quirks no individuality. And she's hefty all over. She doesn't merely walk. She minces and jiggles and bounces and sways her hips from side to side in a way that no man could possibly imitate.It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that she has her clothes off as often as she has them on so that we get to know pretty much every pore on her flamboyant body on a firstname basis.The movie isn't worth going on about but let me see there are scenes of not only nudity but urination douching over a bidet frottage cunnilingus fellatio anal intercourse regular intercourse threesomes lesbianism and  I'm trying to remember. No there were no animals.I guess this satisfies Tinto Brass's fantasies or more likely he believes he's found a winning formula for making movies and money at the same time. I can't really recommend it with any enthusiasm because it's not my fantasies which run more along the lines of giant tubs of Allegro marinade and upright alligators doing grotesque gavottes.Not that there's anything wrong with the fundamental template that the plot fills in. There can't be TOO much wrong with it since it's formed the basis of about ten million pornographic novels and movies. Bored wife lets stranger boff her in a toilet during a literary ball. Right. It happens to me all the time. But it can be done sloppily as here or done with a bit of pith and a touch of poetry as in Belle de Jour.".

However in the last 45 minutes or so the plot becomes convoluted and the film becomes less enjoyable. The musical numbers are good though with beautiful costumes and some impressive choreography.

Naseerudin Shah has also pulled off his part pretty nicely. Anupem Kher even though wasn't the one of main characters but stands out. Pooja Bhatt's acting was poorish. Some of the parts of Pooja Bhatt's were nicely pulled off but mostly she was pretty bad. She shouldn't have been chosen to do this movie. I would have recommended someone like Rani Mukherjee Juhi Chawla or maybe even Kajol. Here's how the story goes gotten directly from wikipedia Roop Rathore Shahrukh Khan is a singer in Bombay just like his father Anupam Kher who is now sick and needs immediate medical care. One day while he is singing at Ajay Narang's Naseeruddin Shah hotel Ajay's sister Reshma Ramya Krishnan falls in love with Roop. Reshma is a spoiled girl and Ajay looks through all of her wishes. Unfortunately Roop is in love with a doctor named Pooja Pooja Bhatt. Meanwhile Reshma is obsessed with Roop and asks her brother to call him again to sing in their hotel. But when she sees that all the girls are flattered over Roop she gets very angry and asks him to sing only for her now onwards. But Roop would rather work for rival Patel Shri Vallabh Vyas than take this offer. Ajay's obsession with keeping her sister happy at all costs comes into play and Patel is brutally beaten by him until he agrees to throw Roop out of his hotel. Desperately in need of money for his father's operation Roop has no option but to agree to Reshma. Roop breaks up with Pooja.The operation of his father is successful but his father is saddened by his situation and decides to leave Bombay. Roop later tries to leave Bombay himself along with his father and Pooja but his plans are interrupted when Reshma tries to commit suicide. Nevertheless Pooja and Roop get married. Frustrated with such turn of events Reshma and her brother Ajay devise many plans to make their life miserable. At the end of the movie Roop's father is killed by Ajay and when Roop tries to save Pooja he and Ajay get involved in a fight. Reshma threatens to kill Pooja if Roop won't stop fighting with her brother. When he stops Ajay tries to shoot Roop and Pooja but misses and hits Reshma instead.".

It is obviously one of Mahesh Bhatt's worst commercial films not because it is a very bad film but more because this director was responsible for some films which rank amongst the best of Hindi cinema and this one really pales in comparison which is inevitable. Anyway the film is pretty watchable much more when one does not tend to take it too seriously. For the most part the film flows very well and has its moments but it gradually goes down as the writing gets more exaggerated. The film stars Shahrukh Khan as Roop a guy who becomes the love interest of his cruel employer Ajay's young sister named Reshma. She gets completely obsessed with him while he plans to marry Pooja a simple nurse who looks after his ill father. The main problem is with Ajay who warns Roop that he will go to any extents to make his sister happy. Yeh quite a fairytale but it's not that bad. Shahrukh Khan is brilliant as Roop as he was in most of his films of that time. Pooja Bhatt is charming and cute Naseer is excellent as always in this ultranegative role and Ramya Krishna is absolutely beautiful and damn too hot to ignore. The music is nice and the title track Chaahat Na Hoti is very melodious. Chaahat must have had a wider message to it which for some reason I did not manage to understand or maybe I just did not try to but it was pretty engaging nonetheless. The last 15 minutes of the film with Khan going all mad and supernatural are ridiculous and plain embarrassing but let it be it is a nice Hindi entertainer and should provide a good timepass for Shahrukh fans.".

	schema:headline " Margaret Sullavan's premiere film a triumph!";
	schema:reviewBody "Only Yesterday was simply outstanding! One of the best precode movies ever made. Margaret Sullavan received the chance of a lifetime in this plum role as a simple trusting young girl who loves a soldier John Boles during World War One becomes pregnant by him during a one night stand and when he returns he doesn't recognize her or perhaps more cruelly pretends he doesn't. In disgrace she is sent to her independent minded aunt in New York City who gets her a job and helps her get on her feet again and raise her child. Billie Burke is absolutely delicious in the role and Reginald Denny charmingly plays the younger man who is in love with her and devoted to her. A delightful scene with them at the piano together had me grinning from ear to ear and saying Awww....that's so cute! How refreshing that Hollywood knew how to charm audiences in those days with extra little scenes like this as comic relief.The rest of the cast is stellar and boasts MANY fine actors in cameo appearances who were popular in the silent days of cinema. Just see how many you can recognize now in the sound era milling about in the suspenseful crowd scenes including Marie Prevost Jason Robards Sr. Louise Beavers Joyce Compton Ruth Clifford Walter Catlett Arthur Hoyt George Hackathorne King Baggot. Even Irene Dunne in a bit part. This must have been seen as a big production for this studio to have all these stars in one picture.Special mention also goes to child actor Jimmy Butler who played the young son. What an terrific natural actor he was! After seeing him in this I sought out other films he was in and discovered he was exceptional in those films too. Unfortunately he died as a soldier in Europe in the last year of World War Two dead way too soon for a young lad.This film has never been put on VHS or DVD. I was reduced to buying a bootleg of it which I hate to do but if these video and DVD companies refuse to spend the money to put these precode masterpieces out on the market that is what the old time film fan has to resort to in order to obtain a film they long to see. A shame.I gave this film a 10 out of 10.".

Margaret Sullavan received the chance of a lifetime in this plum role as a simple trusting young girl who loves a soldier John Boles during World War One becomes pregnant by him during a one night stand and when he returns he doesn't recognize her or perhaps more cruelly pretends he doesn't. In disgrace she is sent to her independent minded aunt in New York City who gets her a job and helps her get on her feet again and raise her child. Billie Burke is absolutely delicious in the role and Reginald Denny charmingly plays the younger man who is in love with her and devoted to her. A delightful scene with them at the piano together had me grinning from ear to ear and saying Awww....that's so cute! How refreshing that Hollywood knew how to charm audiences in those days with extra little scenes like this as comic relief.The rest of the cast is stellar and boasts MANY fine actors in cameo appearances who were popular in the silent days of cinema. Just see how many you can recognize now in the sound era milling about in the suspenseful crowd scenes including Marie Prevost Jason Robards Sr. Louise Beavers Joyce Compton Ruth Clifford Walter Catlett Arthur Hoyt George Hackathorne King Baggot. Even Irene Dunne in a bit part. This must have been seen as a big production for this studio to have all these stars in one picture.Special mention also goes to child actor Jimmy Butler who played the young son. What an terrific natural actor he was! After seeing him in this I sought out other films he was in and discovered he was exceptional in those films too. Unfortunately he died as a soldier in Europe in the last year of World War Two dead way too soon for a young lad.This film has never been put on VHS or DVD. I was reduced to buying a bootleg of it which I hate to do but if these video and DVD companies refuse to spend the money to put these precode masterpieces out on the market that is what the old time film fan has to resort to in order to obtain a film they long to see. A shame.I gave this film a 10 out of 10.";

In 1934 Universal and Stahl scored box office gold again with Imitation of Life starring Claudette Colbert and Warren William followed by the 1935 version to Magnificent Obsession with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor. With the exception Only Yesterday all the movies mentioned above remain memorable mainly because of its latter remakes for that Only Yesterday not only never got remade it's hardly ever reissued either television or revival theaters making this a real curio for classic movie lovers.The story opens during the stock market crash of October 1929 causing many stockholders to go penniless and to blink of suicide. James Stanton Emerson John Boles has become one of the victims of the crash. He returns home where his wife Phyllis Benita Hume is hosting a dinner party. Not wanting to tell the guests about the stock market James locks himself in the other room takes out his gun writes a suicide note to Phyllis informing her that he cannot live on. But as he is about to do himself in he notices a letter addressed to him left on his desk marked URGENT. After opening and reading the letter Jim thinks back twelve years ago when he was a young lieutenant who meets Mary Lane Margaret Sullavan in a party in Virginia. They dance leave and disappear into the night. Upon their return the couple find the party to be over. They bid each other goodnight and plan to see each other again. Later Jim receives orders to report to France with his troops. Afterwards Mary learns that she is pregnant and to avoid a possible scandal she leaves her family to go live with her Aunt Julia Billie Burke in New York City. After giving birth to a son the very day the World War ends Mary tries to locate Jim to tell him the news but when their paths cross again on two different occasions he fails to recognize her thus leaving Mary to go it alone and raise the boy herself. After finishing reading the letter Jim realizes there is something more important than himself to think about.The large cast listed in this photoplay include many familiar faces such as Reginald Denny as Bob Edna May Oliver mispelled Edna MAE Oliver in opening and closing credits as Leona Maynard Jimmy Butler as Jimmy Jr. Marie Prevost as Amy with Louise Beavers Franklin Pangborn and Berton Churchill. During the course of the story nostalgic tunes are heard featuring Shine On Harvest Moon sung by Billie Burke Remember by Irving Berlin played on piano by Reginald Denny and Tip Toe Through the Tulips sung by Billie Burke. Although Universal could have easily reunited Irene Dunne and John Boles stars of Back Street into this collaboration since many supporting players from that film were reunited here including George Meeker June Clyde Walter Catlett Robert McWade and Jane Darwell the introduction of the youthful Margaret Sullavan gives this story a whole new different outlook making this a worthy beginning to a fine actress in a very sensitive performance. Sullavan would star in other Universal dramas especially the 1941 remake to Back Street but she is best remembered for her numerous films produced at MGM particularly The Shop Around the Corner 1940 with James Stewart. While John Boles is usually works well in light musicals and comedies and often typecast as a neglected but caring husband or Mr. Nice Guy in other films through most of the 1930s it's sometimes hard to accept him playing a man of the world on furlough who seduces innocent young women and unintentionally forgetting about them a kind of movie role better suited for the Warren Williamtype of actor. After seeing this production in a very rare TV showing WNET Channel l3 New York City in 1983 two things come to mind The youthful Margaret Sullavan's unforgettable performance the other being the question as to why Only Yesterday remains to this day a very obscure film. 12".

My favorite line of the film was when the married Jim is trying to seduce Margaret on New Year's Eve and he takes her to his secret bachelor pad and tells Margaret that this is where he lives.  Margaret says something like Strange it doesn't have a woman's touch.'  And Jim replies that while he doesn't eat sleep or hang out with his family here this is where he LIVES.  Jim is just a pimp.

	schema:headline " Margaret Sullavan shines in this weepie melodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the first film of Margaret Sullavan then aged 24. As the story requires her to age by eleven years she does that very well in the film. She only had 26 more years to live as she died aged 50 in 1960 having made no more than 21 films. Despite this restricted ouevre her vivacity charm warmth and wonderful smile have rendered her memorable to all lovers of the history of the cinema. She was what is called today 'authentic' a real person rather than just a screen goddess. In 1931 she married Henry Fonda and was later married to William Wyler. But a series of family tragedies including the suicide of one of her children meant that she had a breakdown and an early death by 'accidental barbiturate poisoning'. She was the motherinlaw of Peter Duchin the pianist who is still very much around and it is difficult to find 'anyone who is anyone' in Manhattan who has not met him and been enchanted by his playing. Another soninlaw was Dennis Hopper who together with Peter Fonda revolutionised American films with the famous EASY RIDER in 1969. In this film directed by John M. Stahl Sullavan plays a romantic young girl who falls in love with John Boles in 1918 they intend to get married and have a night together and then he is sent off to war in Europe with only a few hours' notice so that the marriage is postponed indefinitely. Meanwhile she had become pregnant and has a son. The social disgrace is too great for her Southern family and she moves to New York where she lives from then on with her freewheeling and more broadminded aunt played by Billie Burke. Reginald Denny the British actor surprisingly appears in this film and plays Billie Burke's male friend whom she eventually marries. I never saw him do better with humour and comic banter than in his scenes with Burke which are very effective. John Boles is very good as the leading man who for so much of the film is absent. In the story he forgets about Sullavan and when she meets him after a victory parade through the streets of Manhattan he does not recognise her. He has no knowledge of her having had a son and she is so hurt by his not knowing her that she goes away. We then see a title which says 'Ten years later' and the story resumes. The ten yearold son is played excellently by Jimmy Butler who is a natural on screen and this was also his first film. But he was to have a tragic early death at the age of only 23 just before the end of World War Two as a soldier in France. The story of the film gets sadder and sadder and I do not wish to ruin any viewer's experience by commenting upon the events which follow. The film shows 'true love which lasts through the years' a theme largely forgotten today when partners and spouses are thrown away like rag dolls. Just think love did once exist before sex completely took over and love got pushed aside as no longer being relevant.".

Reginald Denny the British actor surprisingly appears in this film and plays Billie Burke's male friend whom she eventually marries. I never saw him do better with humour and comic banter than in his scenes with Burke which are very effective. John Boles is very good as the leading man who for so much of the film is absent. In the story he forgets about Sullavan and when she meets him after a victory parade through the streets of Manhattan he does not recognise her. He has no knowledge of her having had a son and she is so hurt by his not knowing her that she goes away. We then see a title which says 'Ten years later' and the story resumes. The ten yearold son is played excellently by Jimmy Butler who is a natural on screen and this was also his first film. But he was to have a tragic early death at the age of only 23 just before the end of World War Two as a soldier in France. The story of the film gets sadder and sadder and I do not wish to ruin any viewer's experience by commenting upon the events which follow. The film shows 'true love which lasts through the years' a theme largely forgotten today when partners and spouses are thrown away like rag dolls. Just think love did once exist before sex completely took over and love got pushed aside as no longer being relevant.";
