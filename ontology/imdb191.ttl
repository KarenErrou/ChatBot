The fact that most of these crimes are committed in a very defined area of Spain is something which suggests the sociologists should be working flat out in an attempt to inform the politicians why this is happening  not that our elected representatives are likely to do anything to remedy the situation. Already this year alone 66 Spanish women have been beaten and killed by their partners in life. The other day I read that a lady judge had quashed a case of wifebattering because 'it was only an isolated case without continuity' or words to that effect. A lady judge .........! Evidently our legal and social systems need a drastic overhaul. And that means trying to inject a goodly dosis of common sense in both systems. The Icar BollanSantiago Garca de Leniz tandem forming Iguana Films has clearly established that human contact stories are their main motivation as in 'Flores de Otro Mundo' qv and in 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' they do not simply follow the line but improve on it explosively. Somewhat akin to better known films by the British directors Ken Loach and David Lynch basically for the sociological aspects in themselves but clearly hallmarked as inherently Spanish in content and realisation as is the case with Fernando Len de Aranoa's 'Los Lunes al Sol' qv to name but one recent example of a film with a real human and sociological content 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' competes with the best of the genre. With this new film the 'Iguana' tandem fall back on Luis Tosar again and present us with Laia Marull. This actress had not come to my attention previously as she seems to have done things for film or TV mostly confined to her native Catalonia. A welcome presence is Rosa Mara Sard who has often pleased me with her interpretations in several productions. Why she has to make silly advertisements for TV is totally beyond me. To say that Laia Marull in this film is magnificent is somewhat understating the reality her performance is so close to absolute perfection pure real emotions that even the muscles in her cheeks and neck portray her feelings as you will rarely ever see in any actress anywhere however many Oscars they may have stacked away in their wardrobes exhibited in giltframed glass cabinets or just simply shoved in a corner behind the saltpot in the kitchen. Laia Marull carries out a 'tour de force' which leaves you openmouthed in admiration her reading of the part is superb such that the spectator is just simply left spellbound. I thought this kind of acting was only possible in the best Russian tradition or if you push me in some better British productions.And Luis Tosar is not far behind. Without overplaying his difficult role of a husband who is to say the least a bit off his rocker and has to mistreat his wife and at the same time maintain the explicit idea that he is just about as sane as you I or anybody else and thus is capable of tenderness might seem to be asking any actor to overstretch his possibilities. If Luis Tosar was good  very good  in 'Los Lunes al Sol' here in 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' he was even better. These two then worked to make this film evidencing good chemistry but especially with the film's director Icar Bollan. The result is electrifying passionate growling to the most abysmal depths but reaching great heights in building upon human emotions  real emotions and feelings not the canned readymade ephimeral substantiations served up as if for dinner in a fourstar restaurant.The film is architecturally built on a very serious tragic and dramatic situation however there are those lighter moments which can even produce a few tearyeyed guffaws. This is another point where the film scores highly the timing is absolutely brilliant. In the kids' birthday party there is a brief grim scene suddenly interrupted by the appearance of an aunt holding aloft the candled birthday cake with that typically silly smiling grin of any ordinary woman present at such festivities but with such perfect synchronisation that the audience barely staggers out of the charged tense atmosphere and into the more frivolous before being thrown back into the grimmer parts of the storyline which pervades the film.Because it is the stark reality of thousands of married women in Spain that is the basis of the film badly treated beaten and abused barely five per cent ever get to a policestation or to a court of law.

	schema:headline " A cinematic milestone of rare beauty and insight in dealing with the most unsavoury of topics";
	schema:reviewBody "Take My Eyes is about the love of one couple their attempts to rebuild their relationship and the struggles of each of them to deal with what comes to be seen as an illness of the husband  a tendency to violence that results in severe domestic abuse. The film is all the more powerful because the violence is never shown on screen  what we see is the fear shame and embarrassment of the wife Pilar the romantic dream she still cherishes the moments of poetic tenderness they share the humanising attempts of the husband Antonio to overcome his violent tendencies through therapy. The one scene of lovemaking is amongst the tenderest most beautiful and most realistic ever seen on film the expression of romantic positive emotion between them is something many couples would jump at the chance to regain. They let us see why it is hard for someone in her position to admit the man she loves is not only not perfect but a violent brute why it is embarrassing for her when her soontobemarried sister brings it up. The common conception of domestic violence rests too simplistically with the physical act  it fails to encompass the emotional violence and trauma the complexity of the situation when the woman is still deeply in love' and cherishes a hope that her partner will change'.At the UK premiere of this film in the Edinburgh Internal Film Festival WriterDirector Icar Bollan explained that it was her fascination with why so many women stay with abusive husbands the average is ten years that led her to research the subject. She found it was far more complex than expected. What makes Take My Eyes so valuable as a cinematic milestone is that it not only is a masterpiece of modern cinema but as a contribution to social awareness it conveys far more than any government leaflet could. Everyone at some point in their life if not directly involved in a situation of domestic abuse is likely to know somebody that is affected  but what can be done? Painting the scene in black and white and simply strongly telling the woman to leave is likely to evoke a very negative response  which happens to Pilar's sister  and not achieve the desired result. Through its heartbreakingly realistic and characters the film works through various options in an enlightening way but Take My Eyes never preaches. The fact that it is so in touch with its subject matter is cinematically merely icing on the cake  this is a drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout evoking a total audience commitment. Unlike most films dealing with abuse it is also most definitely not kitchen sink drama  so much so that when Antonio's temper flares ever so slightly we flinch  not just because we empathise with Pilar for whom a sudden movement brings terrifying paralysing echo of a possible beating but because it seems so intrusive so out of place in a film of such gentle wonder. But that great art can have such potential for social impact and change is something for cinema in this case to feel justly proud.Major plot spoilers follow  please read only after seeing the film to discuss analysis of the issues That Antonio is portrayed with understanding helps us to understand the complexity of the dilemma that Pilar faces  she appreciates his genuine efforts to change the exercises his therapist gives him. Most importantly it helps explain for us why she not only loves him but cherishes a hope that the tender love they have felt for each other will not only return but that the violent spells will cease. Of course they don't. Asked about the ending Icar Bollan explained that something that emerged from the research that went into making the film was that it is only when the woman gives up hope that the man will change that she can begin to rebuild her life. While a shred of hope remains she also remains locked in the relationship that is destroying her. In the movie Pilar learns that she has an ability to explain great paintings in the art gallery where she has obtained work as a volunteer cashier in a way that captures people's imagination  and is eventually offered a job. In a particularly humiliating scene that leaves no physical bruises Antonio ensures she is unable to get to the interview. He has broken the last thing within her a new spark of wellplaced faith in herself to do something nice. In that act he has broken everything inside her. She goes to the police station to report the attack but realises she has nothing that the police would be able to take seriously. She walks away  and also walks away from any hope that Antonio can change. She knows she does not love him any more and never will. She tells him calmly  it is simply a fact  even when he threatens and seems to attempt suicide to make her stay  and is finally able to leave him permanently.Even after seeing the film it is so easy to draw simplistic solutions to the problem of domestic abuse but the film invites us to consider them more fully from the full emotional perspective of the victim which also includes seeing things from the point of view of the perpetrator. The therapy seems to be patchwork at best. The woman has to decide to leave him. Once she has given up hope that he will change the other things in her life that seemed beyond hope often repair themselves. Of course if the woman can see the obsessive love' with associated violence early enough she can just walk at the first manifestation before she becomes more deeply entangled emotionally. And the abusers  is there no hope for them? In one sense perhaps we don't care  in another inasmuch as it is good to try and help such people stop being abusive the advice is that at the first sign of anger such a person should also walk  walk well away. It may be that a particular type of personality triggers the anger  if so it is not a sign of love but of a person that that person who is tempted to anger should avoid.

	onyx:emotionText "Take My Eyes is about the love of one couple their attempts to rebuild their relationship and the struggles of each of them to deal with what comes to be seen as an illness of the husband  a tendency to violence that results in severe domestic abuse. The film is all the more powerful because the violence is never shown on screen  what we see is the fear shame and embarrassment of the wife Pilar the romantic dream she still cherishes the moments of poetic tenderness they share the humanising attempts of the husband Antonio to overcome his violent tendencies through therapy. The one scene of lovemaking is amongst the tenderest most beautiful and most realistic ever seen on film the expression of romantic positive emotion between them is something many couples would jump at the chance to regain. They let us see why it is hard for someone in her position to admit the man she loves is not only not perfect but a violent brute why it is embarrassing for her when her soontobemarried sister brings it up. The common conception of domestic violence rests too simplistically with the physical act  it fails to encompass the emotional violence and trauma the complexity of the situation when the woman is still deeply in love' and cherishes a hope that her partner will change'.At the UK premiere of this film in the Edinburgh Internal Film Festival WriterDirector Icar Bollan explained that it was her fascination with why so many women stay with abusive husbands the average is ten years that led her to research the subject. She found it was far more complex than expected. What makes Take My Eyes so valuable as a cinematic milestone is that it not only is a masterpiece of modern cinema but as a contribution to social awareness it conveys far more than any government leaflet could. Everyone at some point in their life if not directly involved in a situation of domestic abuse is likely to know somebody that is affected  but what can be done? Painting the scene in black and white and simply strongly telling the woman to leave is likely to evoke a very negative response  which happens to Pilar's sister  and not achieve the desired result. Through its heartbreakingly realistic and characters the film works through various options in an enlightening way but Take My Eyes never preaches. The fact that it is so in touch with its subject matter is cinematically merely icing on the cake  this is a drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout evoking a total audience commitment. Unlike most films dealing with abuse it is also most definitely not kitchen sink drama  so much so that when Antonio's temper flares ever so slightly we flinch  not just because we empathise with Pilar for whom a sudden movement brings terrifying paralysing echo of a possible beating but because it seems so intrusive so out of place in a film of such gentle wonder. But that great art can have such potential for social impact and change is something for cinema in this case to feel justly proud.Major plot spoilers follow  please read only after seeing the film to discuss analysis of the issues That Antonio is portrayed with understanding helps us to understand the complexity of the dilemma that Pilar faces  she appreciates his genuine efforts to change the exercises his therapist gives him. Most importantly it helps explain for us why she not only loves him but cherishes a hope that the tender love they have felt for each other will not only return but that the violent spells will cease. Of course they don't. Asked about the ending Icar Bollan explained that something that emerged from the research that went into making the film was that it is only when the woman gives up hope that the man will change that she can begin to rebuild her life. While a shred of hope remains she also remains locked in the relationship that is destroying her. In the movie Pilar learns that she has an ability to explain great paintings in the art gallery where she has obtained work as a volunteer cashier in a way that captures people's imagination  and is eventually offered a job. In a particularly humiliating scene that leaves no physical bruises Antonio ensures she is unable to get to the interview. He has broken the last thing within her a new spark of wellplaced faith in herself to do something nice. In that act he has broken everything inside her. She goes to the police station to report the attack but realises she has nothing that the police would be able to take seriously. She walks away  and also walks away from any hope that Antonio can change. She knows she does not love him any more and never will. She tells him calmly  it is simply a fact  even when he threatens and seems to attempt suicide to make her stay  and is finally able to leave him permanently.Even after seeing the film it is so easy to draw simplistic solutions to the problem of domestic abuse but the film invites us to consider them more fully from the full emotional perspective of the victim which also includes seeing things from the point of view of the perpetrator. The therapy seems to be patchwork at best. The woman has to decide to leave him. Once she has given up hope that he will change the other things in her life that seemed beyond hope often repair themselves. Of course if the woman can see the obsessive love' with associated violence early enough she can just walk at the first manifestation before she becomes more deeply entangled emotionally. And the abusers  is there no hope for them? In one sense perhaps we don't care  in another inasmuch as it is good to try and help such people stop being abusive the advice is that at the first sign of anger such a person should also walk  walk well away. It may be that a particular type of personality triggers the anger  if so it is not a sign of love but of a person that that person who is tempted to anger should avoid. We can only give love in a relationship where it is possible to give and receive without overriding hurt.

Like Nora in The Doll's House Pilar has the guts to leave her husband her situation and her life as a bright future awaits her when she goes to Madrid.Iciar Bollain the talented director of this film shows she really understands what happens to a battered woman who is terrified to go to the authorities to report the abuse.

Ms. Marull's Pilar is typical of a woman whose life has been derailed by a bully who can only think of the sexual aspect of the relationship and never has a meaningful conversation with her.

Candela Pena makes a valuable contribution as Ana the sisters that dares to confront her sister and her mother.

	schema:reviewBody "I've already seen this film twice and the subsequent viewing has not diminished much director Iciar Bollain's powerful treatment of domestic violence. In fact I was actually reluctant to see it again because its potent portrayal of spousal abuse was too disturbing.There are two things notable about this film that make it stand out from other films on the same subject. One is that it features almost no violence. In fact there is only one fullblown case of abuse portrayed and it is less about physical abuse than it is humiliation and emotional abuse.Another is the nuanced portrayal of the abusive husband. For this credit must go to actor Luis Tosar who portrays Antonio. Although the film does its best to give a more balanced portrayal by showing that Antonio does go to therapy and makes some attempt to change his ways it is Tosar's performance that brings out his human side.It would have been easy for Tosar to have demonized Antonio particularly since the actor already a scary appearance what with his bushy eyebrows and deepset eyes. But Tosar chooses to take the high road in his performance focusing on Antonio's deepseated insecurity and inferiority complex which are the roots of his violence towards his wife.His most notable scene is the last one in the film when his wife finally leaves him. As she and her friends go around the apartment packing up her things the expression on his face is not one of anger but of incomprehension.But equal credit should be given to Laia Marull who portrays the wife Pilar. Because of her performance the filmmakers literally do not have to show much violence. The literally palpable fear she shows when Antonio is about to go into once of his rages makes that unnecessary.The film also shows the sexual bond between Pilar and Antonio in order to explain why she continues to return to him despite his abusive behavior through a frank sex scene that would be possible only in Europe since American movie makers seem averse to that kind of frankness.Te doy mis ojos is difficult to watch at times because of the intensity of its emotional violence. But it is ultimately rewarding for the insights it gives on spousal abuse and the relationship between abusive husband and abused wife.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take My Eyes Te doy mis ojos is a frank classy woman in jeopardyLifetime TV for Women film.A couple of elements raise it above Hollywood's unfortunately already tired treatment of abused wives in such films as Sleeping with the Enemy or Enough among many others.First is the superb acting by Laia Marull as Pilar. Her transformation from frightened mouse to tentative independent to an expressive person with a back bone is riveting. She does look distractingly like Annabella Sciorra but that means she is beautiful and very womanly.Second is the emphasis less on the physical violence by an abuser that American films revel in this film opens right after such an incident than on the psychological impact both on abuser and victim. Even amidst strife this is a passionate couple who were very much in love though we get hints from the beginning that he was controlling as in the conversations that include the titular phrase. Unlike Hollywood her final revenge is not violent but in how she uses those words back at him. Uniquely we see the husband Luis Tosar as Antonio looking distractingly like the Irish actor James Nesbitt as a 360 degree person with his own family stresses and not just as the usual evil incarnate. Though we don't see how he got into angermanagement therapy sessions for abusers that in the U.S. are usually only a result of a courtorder and I couldn't tell from the untranslated credits what experts were consulted for these recreations they are a fascinating look at an attempt to change abusive behaviors. The shrink finds he has to teach these guys even how to have a conversation with their wives to prevent triggers let alone what to do when rage starts filling their heads. Another difference is that while the husband jealously fixates on the possibility of her finding a new lover a sensitive new age guy character invariably appears in the Hollywood versions and it was entertainingly nonstereotypical that the Scottish brotherinlaw is held up as a prized alternative the threat to his marriage actually comes from her relationships with the women in her life from family to friends. Through them she becomes more attuned to humiliation as violence than even her hospital records filled with lied about fractures. It was a bit much symbolically to have her suddenly get into artistic presentations of ancient sexy myths though it was nice that the credits identified each of the paintings discussed.While sadly this is a familiar story in filmed outline the film is continually suspenseful and involving as to what they will do together and apart.".

This topic has been addressed before but this movie deals with the subject matter better than any other I can recall seeing.An effective performance by Luis Tosar as the abusive husband Antonio develops the layers of emotions in this imposing and frightening character in an effort to understand why this violence is occurring. While certainly not presenting an advocate's position to defend his cruel and vicious behavior the film also resists the temptation of exploiting the volatile outbreaks. The film shows degrading speech and physical battery to the wife while not going overboard with bloody gory attack just for their own sake. He attends support groups to discuss with a psychologist and other abusers the root causes of the action and makes a sincere effort to change his ways. Gradually the motivations for his irrational action although becoming clearly understood are still properly advanced as totally unacceptable.Laia Marull as the abused wife is not stereotyped either. She is shown as an intelligent and capable person making an honest effort to confront the situation while struggling with the conflict of somehow preserving the marriage. There are many artistic metaphors about the passion of their marriage reflecting the very problem they are dealing with. I also like the wife's museum tour presentations where she is clearly talking not only of the paintings but of her own aspirations. Both of the principals are splendid in their roles especially in their interaction with one another.Much could be written of the rich doublelayered symbolism of several other scenes. Suffice it to say this is a beautifully done movie with an ending that in all its simplicity took me by surprise. It was the proper ending too I think for reasons you will understand when you see the movie. Definitely worth viewing.".

	schema:headline " A poignant study of a devastatingly heartbreaking aspect of love and marriage by Spanish wd Iciar Bollan";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Iciar Bollan's film TAKE MY EYES Spain 2003 is full of boldness and nuance approaching 'full frontal' almost a pun here the delicate 'taboo' subject on spouse abuse in love and marriage. The exceptionally talented and selfless portrayal of the couple by Laia Marull as Pilar the young wifemother and Luis Tosa as Antonio the husbandabuser made their scenes together  both the tender moments and violent events convincing and complete. It's heartbreaking to see these two people who could be so in love felt through the intimate lovemaking scenes the calm moments they enjoy each other by the river yet juxtaposed by the traumatic turn of events seen through the 'explosive' frightful situations. Bollan with Marull and Tosa did not shy away from the volatile subject and key scenes  it is no doubt devastating to behold yet the impact of the situation is truly felt and may also leave us shaking. Kudos to such giving and fearless performances and production decisions.The Toledo Spain locales especially by the river and bridge seen in the film are as beautiful as I visited in Fall 2003. I remember the museum where Antonio waited outside for Pilar. He tried. He wanted to be a loving husband to her but he couldn't help himself. It almost seem like uncontrollable 'alcoholic dependency' his jealous rage generated from fear of losing Pilar whom he believes he loves in his own possessive ways. While Pilar also tries. She practically loses herself in trying to please Antonio and be 'blinded' by his waves of tenderness towards her. She's struggling to be a good wife and responsible mother to their little boy. She's also trying to find herself through the process.I recall the wisdom from poet Kahlil Gibran's book The Prophet on Marriage yes you shall be together forever more but there should be spaces in your togetherness. Give your hearts but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And on Love that it does not possesses Gibran said And think not you can direct the course of love for love if it finds you worthy directs your course. TAKE MY EYES gives us a rare chance to observe closely the various aspectsperspectives of a domestic violence situation and offering viable option on the part of the woman. It may not be an easy film to watch due to frank emotional depiction but it is superbly delivered by a fantastic cast besides Marull and Tosa. The script cowritten by Bollan and Alicia Luna contains supporting storyline including a wedding and Scottish bagpipes and kilts  cultural diversity girl talk men talk laughs and heartaches. Production is excellent in every respect cinematography editing art direction music score sound and all. Highly recommend this film with no hesitation.".

It should have won the main award in the San Sebastian film festival for the best film but unfortunately it did not win it. On the other hands the roles of Laia... and Luis Tosar are wonderful. They won their prizes for their excellent acting. Everybody should see this film specially men in order to know how to prevent attacks against women".

	schema:headline " Compelling Disturbing All too Real";
	schema:reviewBody "For me this film captured all too accurately why partners of domestic abuse stay and find it so hard to break free. It takes you through the very emotions and feelings which make domestic violence so complex. Through the interaction between Pilar and her husband Antonio the film shows us how slowly but surely her confidence has been eroded until she has become emotionally dependent on someone who is destroying her. Not just the bouts of violence but the everyday conversation where he belittles her at every turn. While the scenes of violence themselves are shocking so too is the way Antonio chips away at her confidence in an attempt to bolster his own. The scene where she gives herself to him I give you my eyes is heartbreaking it demonstrates his need to possess her but also her need at that moment to be possessed and give herself to him again even though she is terrified of him.The film is not black and white. It does not paint the violent husband as a monster without reason but gives us an insight as to his motivations. Antonio's lack of selfworth when he compares himself to his brother his admission that he has no dreams of his own. The only power he feels he can have is over his wife and he is caught between needing that power and yet understanding that he is destroying those he holds dear. In the end he cannot change and perhaps the reason he finally lets her go is because he recognises this for himself. The plot and writing are strong without 'preaching' to the audience and the acting is excellent. The looks on Pilar's face reflects exactly what it feels like to feel the fear of what is coming next in an abusive argument. I have seen his film twice now and I found it just as raw and compelling the second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most movies that tell stories about spousal abuse prefer to go the thriller route woman in danger leaving her violent husband to search for a new life finding that life under a new identity and the predictable element that he comes back to find her and will not stop until she is firmly planted within the cage that she's just escaped. Such is the opening scene of THE DOY MIS OJOS TAKE MY EYES that presents an act of desperation a young woman Pilar coming home to in a moments epiphany wake her sleeping son grab what she can run out into the night not sure where she is going at first and winding up at her sister Ana's house. In an unforgettable exchange Ana asks her What's the matter? Breaking down in a mess of tears Pilar babbles I just realized I'm in my slippers! Thus begins the movie proper. All seems to be heading towards Pilar beginning a new life without Antonio  and it's about time. Ana heads to Pilar's apartment to see it's been practically ripped to shreds. Antonio finally makes his appearance and indicates he's not going to go away so easily. This proves to be true since he insinuates himself into Pilar's life outside of Ana's house and tells her he will change. However Pilar decides not to come back... and here is when the real Antonio emerges a mass of sound and fury. Ana tries to help Pilar out but Pilar seems to be harboring feelings for Antonio and an ugly exchange between the sisters has Ana disclosing in front of their mother the real reason of Pilar's wounds.It seems Pilar will find success in picking up the pieces of her life. She's found work in a museum. It's possible she will even find a place to live she certainly has the support of Ana. However this isn't the typical wifeontherun drama female director Icar Bollin has gone the other way around bringing unto light an ugly reality that she first explored in AMORES QUE MATAN but taking it a step further. There are women so blinded by their codependency that they would rather stay in the hellish security of their home because they believe  or want to believe  that the abuse will stop that the husband will change that all will be as before when they were in love. Such is the case with Pilar who is allowing Antonio to worm his way ever so closer into her life by accepting gifts where he lets her know he's going into therapy to cure his problem.At this point the movie's sympathy  if it can be called that  subtly and uncomfortably shifts to Antonio as his own pathology gets explored. His sessions at a place where abusive husbands talk about why they hit their wives yields a sense of horror within himself he can't believe the type of stories he is privy to but he's as ugly as they are. At the same time Pilar begins to evolve as a person even when she makes the ultimate bad decision and moves back with Antonio much to Ana's horror. On her own and estranged from Ana Pilar begins an exploration of her own self through art. The paintings Bollin has chosen all depict women in a state of peril as a menacing male looms near. Antonio can't relate to art in any way and a promotion she receives is the crux that unleashes his rage in an uncontrollable flood.That a woman could delve into the female psyche and its dependency on criminally abusive males is remarkable. Even a quiet scene in which Antonio and Pilar engage in a give and take erotic exchange that culminates in Pilar telling Antonio to take her eyes is fraught with a sense of believable masochism it's as if under the character of Pilar Bollin were representing all women who have let a dominating male take control and render their will nil. She only gives one hint that could define as to why Pilar is so willing to be burned by Antonio and when she arrives there she is horrified... and so are we. Because abuse happens in cycles of repetition and moves from generation to generation.TAKE MY EYES is a powerful film that further denounces what AMORES QUE MATAN exposed. It won multiple Goyas in 2004 and justifiably so films that tackle this ugly part of society in a realistic way should be seen. Both Luis Tosar and Laia Marull are fantastic in bringing forth a marriage that plays a dangerous game of sadomasochism. As a side note it seems that this is an Almodovar reunion of sorts  Kiti Manver Rosa Maria Sard and Candela Pea all have strong supporting parts. Only that the deadpan serious desperation of one woman creates a sisterhood in others who are willing to intervene.".

Even when the story isn't as disturbing as 'Once Were Warriors 1994' the characters develop a three dimensional presence to the point of being as complex as a real couple in a selfdestructive relationship creating such a drama that tends to be more psychological than physical.And even when the conclusion does not represent a drastic overcome it stands as an example of courage and self determination that will in deed prevail in the mind of the viewer and even more in those who find themselves in the same situation as the protagonist. Kudos to Miss Bollain this is a good movie be sure not to miss it.".

Even when the story isn't as disturbing as 'Once Were Warriors 1994' the characters develop a three dimensional presence to the point of being as complex as a real couple in a selfdestructive relationship creating such a drama that tends to be more psychological than physical.And even when the conclusion does not represent a drastic overcome it stands as an example of courage and self determination that will in deed prevail in the mind of the viewer and even more in those who find themselves in the same situation as the protagonist. Kudos to Miss Bollain this is a good movie be sure not to miss it.";

It won many Goyas read Oscars in Spain and for good reason this is a powerful film about an indelicate subject from a country Spain not usually comfortable discussing much less film such issues.Pilar Laia Marull and her son Juan Nicols Fernndez Luna live in a small apartment with husbandfather Antonio Luis Tosar a small section of hell where daily Antonio abuses Pilar with an uncontrollable anger. Pilar and Juan leave one night to live with Pilar's soon to be married sister Ana Candela Pea and fianc a Scotsman John David Mooney. Ana encourages Pilar to divorce the abusive Antonio but Pilar is frightened fearing she has no means of support and admitting that there are parts of Antonio she still loves. Complicating Pilar's thinking is her mother Aurora the fine Rosa Maria Sard who tries to underplay the problem by insisting that all marriages have their little problems! Antonio stalks Pilar pleading for her to return but every encounter results in a flairup of Antonio's abusive behavior. Pilar finds a menial job at the museum in Toledo a position she loves and soon is training to become a guide loving speaking tot he public about art. Antonio agrees to seek help for his behavioral problems and enters group therapy and private therapy Sergi Calleja and begins bringing flowers and gifts and constant attention to Ana hoping to have her return home. And return Ana does with Juan and with some newfound sense of self worth form her position at the museum. But as soon as Ana is 'home' a horrifying incident occurs and she gathers the strength to see the relationship clearly and respond correctly.The cast of actors is brilliant the pacing of the film keeps the viewer on seat's edge the cinematography by Carles Gusi captures the magic of Toledo Spain the musical score by Alberto Iglesias is first rate classical writing and the amount of information about a little understood problem is an additional reward that accompanies this superb film. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles and the DVD adds a featurette that further examines a treatment center for abusive men feels like a much needed public service ploy. This is one of those films that would be easy to ignore because of the subject matter but that is a real reason to view it  in addition to the fact that it is such a fine work of art. Grady Harp".

It premiered in the Official Selection section at the 51st San Sebastin International Film Festival in 2003 was shot on location in Madrid Spain and is a Spanish production which was produced by producer Santiago Garzia De Leaniz. It tells the story about a woman named Pilar who one evening takes her son named Juan and leaves her husband named Antonio who she has been married to for nine years. Pilar moves in with her sister Ana whom is about to marry her boyfriend named John and gets a job at a church but it doesn't take long before Antonio contacts her promises that he will change and asks her to come home.Finely and subtly directed by Spanish filmmaker Icair Bollain this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the female protagonist's point of view draws a gripping portrayal of a Spanish woman's relationship with her abusive husband whom she decides to give a second chance after learning that he has begun taking therapy sessions. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions fine cinematography by cinematographer Charles Gusi and production design by production designer and art director Victor Molero this characterdriven and narrativedriven story about a woman whom is advised by her mother to return to her man and by her sister named Ana to get a divorce depicts two indepth studies of character and contains a good instrumental score by Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias.This at times atmospheric somewhat romantic and authentic lovestory from the early 2000s which is set in the city of Toledo Spain where a possessive and morbidly jealous man tries to understand and control his innate rage whilst doing everything in his power to prevent his wife from leaving him and a child becomes a helpless and involuntary bystander is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure subtle character development and continuity contrary and natural characters and the heartfelt and commendable acting performances by Spanish actress Laia Marull and Spanish actor Luis Tosar.

However little insight is provided as to why she behaves the way she does. Another problem is the onedimensional portrayal of the husband.

	schema:reviewBody "A fantastic drama that shows the difficulties and pure cruelty of domestic violence without ever becoming outlandish. Marull plays a woman that flees with her son from her marriage. The film is very clever in showing this act first. It leaves us as fascinated voyeurs and doesn't force us into feeling to much animosity towards the husband. This is key in allowing the film to explore its themes. Later we hear about visits to the hospital but we don't see this happen. In fact we see the husband trying to seek help before we see him do anything cruel. I loved this clever touch as our view of him wasn't tainted. This is probably how many family members saw him. Hearing about his exploits but is there a chance the wife is exaggerating? As the film progresses we see the husband as a tragic character. Tosar adds an infinite amount of layers but we finally see his anger as an uncontrollable destructive force. He sees himself as the victim and his wife as the enemy. In his mind he is being assaulted. As the film draws towards its climax there is a sense that they could work it all out and from that comes hope. The films greatest achievement is not being about the victims. It isn't sappy preachy or unbearable. It would have been easy to show Tosar beating Marull but the film's climax is even more disturbing due to all the misplaced anger. A great movie.".

There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead bc it was silly funny.Yeah its highly unrealistic but if you expected realism whats wrong with you? Sure Jennifer Anniston is the uglier chick which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money but she did a good job in the movie.The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!".

However if you like to go to the movies just to break the routine to have some laughs and to change your mind this is an excellent movie. Most highly critical people looking for perfection will give this movie a bad review no doubt. People who gave an 8 to True Grit will not appreciate this movie...Acting is excellent. Jennifer Aniston is perfect in that role this is her best performance in a movie so far except maybe for Marley and Me. Adam Sandler is much more natural than usual. He does not have to deliver all of the stupid jokes and has a to act his role during most of the movie. I would say this is an equivalent performance as in 50 First Dates or even better. He is very funny as usual but also compassionate and lovable. Nick Swardson is the clown of the movie which allows Sandler to act more and leave some of the funny stuff to others. Swardson made me and my whole family laugh out loud during many parts of the movie. In fact it had been a long time since I heard my two teenagers laugh so much and so loudly during a movie.The two kids are really good supporting actors. They bring a lot to the movie. They make the situation more complicated a few times in unexpected ways. Bailee Madison is very impressive. We will see her again and often.The normal cast of Happy Madisson movies are all there for their usual 2 minutes and all bring their own laugh. One of them made me swallow water in my lungs! He is good! I will let you guess which one.All and all we left very satisfied and happy we had this family night even the teenagers. No frustration like we had in True Grit and no disappointment like we had in Sanctum. This was better than expected and worth its money. Just sit down and Go with it!.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw at this an advanced screening in Huntington Beach. It was pretty damn good. I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21 I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam who has a good heart of course falls in love with the girl of his dreams who is younger and way better looking than him all formulated around a specific central premise i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies supported by extremely strong quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smartass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The setup for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew? The 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late like since Moulin Rouge but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 13 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.I can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success but this will top all of them at the box office.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adam Sandler is getting pretty solid at producing and acting in quasipoignant tales that get him somewhat further away  and ultimately closer to doesn't make sense I know  from his protoSandlerstyle of filmmaking that has his vaguely prototypical cast of characters  hapless hopeless geeks improbable ladies' man a nice guy that all the ladies want but still seem to settle on the douches. Sandler brings his crew together  formercurrent SNLers Allen Covert who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of and some heavyhitters occasionally. The Wedding Singer GrownUps and now Just Go With It all pander to this amiable style of filmmaking that is at times borderline grossout  but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatowslacker movie nor is attempting to be.Sandler is a plastic surgeon who long ago accidentally discovered he could play the my wife is a terrible person who abuses me card to score with hot chicks at the bar. Fact is he's not actually married  he andor his wife left him at the altar many years before when he discovered she really didn't like him  but he's become so comfortable with lying to score with the chicks he just doesn't care  or seem to. Jennifer Aniston is his office assistant a sweet single gal with 2 kids. She doesn't much care for how he deals with the ladies but she still likes him because she sees what a sweet guy he really is under the surface of his rather devious womanizing that all starts with a lie.Sandler meets the bounteous and beautiful  and very young  Brooklyn Decker at a party.

Sandler brings his crew together  formercurrent SNLers Allen Covert who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of and some heavyhitters occasionally. The Wedding Singer GrownUps and now Just Go With It all pander to this amiable style of filmmaking that is at times borderline grossout  but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatowslacker movie nor is attempting to be.Sandler is a plastic surgeon who long ago accidentally discovered he could play the my wife is a terrible person who abuses me card to score with hot chicks at the bar. Fact is he's not actually married  he andor his wife left him at the altar many years before when he discovered she really didn't like him  but he's become so comfortable with lying to score with the chicks he just doesn't care  or seem to. Jennifer Aniston is his office assistant a sweet single gal with 2 kids. She doesn't much care for how he deals with the ladies but she still likes him because she sees what a sweet guy he really is under the surface of his rather devious womanizing that all starts with a lie.Sandler meets the bounteous and beautiful  and very young  Brooklyn Decker at a party. They sleep together on the beach and in the morning Decker discovers he's married.

	schema:reviewBody "Just Go with It is a 5yearold comedy that got featured like most of Sandler's works at the Razzie Awards as well as several awards shows for younger audiences. It is the American approach to an originally Indian film. The director is Dennis Dugan and I cannot say I am too familiar with him. Same goes for all the writers working on this one. Always a bit disappointing if there are so many and the outcome is still a letdown. Sandler may not be the most talented actor but he does a decent job in picking roles and that's why the character here fits him nicely once again. Aniston also has more pros than cons. Sadly I cannot say the same about Brookly Decker who just is not a particularly gifted actress and at times it felt she was only in her to show us her great swimsuit body. At least the Andy Roddick cameo was funny at the end. And then there is Nicole Kidman who seems stupid and unlikeable for all her early scenes and then somehow out of nowhere gets some depth and emotion added to her character. That was embarrassing. It was so obvious that they only included her final scene because it was Nicole Kidman playing the character. Cringeworthy stuff. I would feel sorry for her because of how low she has sunk but then I remember she has won an Oscar and is a truly mediocre actress always has been and I don't feel sorry for her anymore.As so many other times in Sandler's films the problem is clearly the script. Yes there are a couple good moments but the whole story about who's getting together with whom is still very much uninspired and predictable. At least Decker's character did not fall for the weird crazy guy. That would have been too much for sure. A major problem with the story is that it is based on such a ridiculous beginning. A man carries a wedding ring around with him and talks about having a dozen kids adopted. What is going on??? And how are we supposed to believe that this is really a turnon for women. And why would Decker be constantly interested in spending time with her boyfriend's exwife. There is a lot in terms of the story here that doesn't make sense unfortunately. I think there are a few decent moments in terms of comedy and this actually could have been a solid film with less of the bad. But the writers clearly weren't gifted enough to make this a rewarding watch from start to finish. The maid also adds really nothing apart from failed attempts at getting laughs. The kids were soso I guess but these young artist nominations are certainly a bit too much. Overall I do not recommend this movie. Not Sandler's fault though as he is as usual one of the better aspects taking everything into account.".

I hate to be so hard on him because Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were gold. But this movie is just a major waist of time. Even the gratuitous shots of Any Roddick's wife weren't enough to carry even the slightest interest in the plot. Throw in the one dimensional Aniston and Dave Mathew's first acting appearance ever and you've got a sleeper.

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Carter wrote the following review which was published in an Italian newspaper in April 2011Two weeks ago and for the first time in six years April Fool's Day fell on a Friday. Of the seven days of the week there is something peculiar about Friday. Floating somewhere between old and new Friday is a culmination that allows recognition of the past week's accomplishments while providing optimism in anticipation for the stretch ahead a new beginning. It is due to this phenomenon specifically the financial vulnerability that accompanies this sort of liberal mindset that the American film industry since 1981 has chosen Friday as the nearly uncontested weekday for the release of Hollywood films.Thus for the American cinema Friday April 1st 2011 was not a childish holiday. Instead the date marked the Italian release of the new Adam Sandler film Just Go With It which sent Happy Gilmore fans like myself running to the box office. How ironic therefore that of the five April Fool's Days since 1981 that have fallen on a Friday and perhaps also the twenty five that have not Just Go With It has proved itself to be the greatest or worst joke of all.From director Dennis Dugan Just Go With It is a romantic comedy which follows the heartbroken plastic surgeon Danny Maccabee Adam Sandler who uses a fake wedding ring from an unhappy marriage as he searches local bars for deceitful sexual encounters. One night at a Los Angeles house party Danny's attitude suddenly changes when he meets the girl of his dreams in Palmer Brooklyn Decker. When Palmer discovers the wedding ring Danny sidesteps the situation claiming that he is getting a divorce. After Palmer demands to meet his wife Danny employs his office manager Katherine Murphy Jennifer Aniston to pose as his future ex.While he succeeds in convincing Palmer of his impending divorce Danny is blackmailed by Katherine's real son posing as his own and is forced to take his fake family along with Palmer to Hawaii for an impromptu vacation. Danny and Katherine become a sort of improvisational comedy troop struggling to keep up with the lies they have created as they grow closer and closer. Eventually Danny and Katherine slowly lose sight of Palmer as they fall instead for one another.In summarizing the plot of Just Go With It the mere amount of detail even main characters one is able to eliminate without altering the story is a testimony to the poor quality of screen writing exhibited by Allan Loeb. Lacking any clear form of the three act structure the characters indulge in irrelevant excursions such as a dance competition between Katherine and her college adversary an unexplained repeated mentioning of the boy band NSYNC and a strange dinner date that is interrupted in order to save a dying sheep.The written dialogue is generally boring containing monologues in which the characters simply tell the audience who they are notably Palmer's self introduction the first night at the beach. Danny's first encounter with Palmer is nothing more that visual attraction and lacks any effort in creating a believable chemistry. The story is generally illogical and lacks reason as the characters treat important institutions such as marriage with impulsiveness planning and cancelling weddings as if they were dentist appointments.One may argue that a film such as Just Go With It is not intended to be a logical and original treatment of believable relationships and therefore should not be criticized within these boundaries. Being a romantic comedy however the film does at least carry with it the expectation of being comic an expectation unfulfilled.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg has turned out a lot of films that range from the bizarre to the slightly less bizarre to the stupefying. I used to think that his update of The Fly was his masterwork as it certainly is an improvement over the original in every sense of the word. Videodrome however is entirely his idea and what an idea it is. Filmed at a time when VHS and Betamax were still at war for market share and television was still beholden to some standard of public service it is hard to imagine what the public of 1983 made of Videodrome. Twentythree years on it looks so prophetic that it is truly a wonder Sony or Toshiba are not employing Cronenberg to attempt to anticipate consumer reaction to their consumer format ideas. Shot in a Lynchian shootfirst workoutstorylater manner it is testament to Cronenberg's skills as a storyteller that the 'drome works as well as it does. It is also testament to the film's accuracy that in this era of socalled reality television nobody in a remakecrazed system is trying to remake Videodrome.Of course in a film with a theme as speculative as Videodrome one needs to have a reliable performer. Just like you cannot portray someone going mad with fear a la The Fly if your actor is not up to snuff one cannot portray a weird conspiracy without an actor of James Woods' calibre. Everything that occurs on the screen from about thirty minutes in is utterly unbelievable but we buy it because James is so good at selling it to us. His disbelief graduating into terror graduating into acceptance is the rock upon which Videodrome rests and the respect he gained from me in my recent viewing of Once Upon A Time In America went through the atmosphere during Videodrome. So many films are made with a singular star as its entire focus. Sylvester Stallone made a few but Woods demonstrates he is more than up to the challenge here. The James Woods of the 1980s and the James Woods post 1990 are really two different people or so one might think after seeing a film from both groups.The support cast are mostly adequate with Deborah Harry demonstrating she could have been an actor. Not that she does anything particularly brilliant here but she also manages to keep her part of the illusion solid. Sonja Smits helps twist the plot beyond its already unrecognisable shape as the daughter of one of the conspirators in the Videodrome experiment. While these two are secondary to Woods they also add so much to the story that its hard to imagine the film without them. The world was changing in ways none could have imagined at the time and as Harry's musical career was left in the cold as a result her image in this film is iconic of an era. Jack Creley is puzzling as a guru tied into the conspiracy who appears only in video. To cut a long story short Woods is a pinball while Harry Smits and Creley are the bumpers off which he bounces. In that task they do a brilliant job and they are far from the only ones. Videodrome contains a literal cavalcade of actors one wishes they could see more of just based on their moments here.The summary in a previous comment says it best I don't think I could provide spoilers if I wanted to. I could tell you everything that happens in Videodrome and it still will not even slightly prepare you for the utter bizarreness to be beheld. The imagery is both disgusting and strangely compelling the story is beyond odd and the references to the new flesh that pop up like skin cancer cells in the final reels are a mantra that will haunt the viewer long after the film is over. The constant images of videotapes and televisions flexing out to either imitate organic material or swallow the hero whole. It is the ultimate contradiction that I can find this film so utterly compelling yet so utterly repulsive. There is an unofficial motto among defense lawyers if you cannot convince them confuse them. Videodrome thanks to its surreal imagery and story that could only be inspired by divergent thought is both convincing and confusing. Such is the ultimate achievement in storytelling.Fortunately the question of whether one can separate their perception of reality from the fantasy they see depicted on a video source has been answered already. It isn't really even a question that needs asking here as it has long been answered by film. No Videodrome is about something more although exactly what that is could be anything David Cronenberg desires. I chose to see it as an example of one man getting so wrapped up in his ideas or fantasies that they utterly distort his reality an idea subtly hinted at when one character describes his hallucinations causing him a brain tumour rather than the other way around. The new flesh is the idea that drives a given machine always mutating and altering itself. However you choose to interpret the story of Videodrome I think the consensus we can all come to is that it is just plain odd. Most of us will never really see the things shown in Videodrome if we take a mix of heroin crack and LSD then wash it down with drain cleaner.It is mostly for these reasons that I gave Videodrome a ten out of ten. You have not stretched your imagination far enough if you are completely repulsed by its imagery. Do yourself a favour and see it now. Long live the new flesh.".

Back then we didn't have words like virtual reality and cyberspace at least not in every day usage but the concepts were beginning to filter in due the popularity of video games.But what we didn't know then and what we couldn't have guessed were the dangers in even the concept of a virtual reality.  Once one starts down that line of reasoning nothing can ever be taken for granted.  What Philip K. Dick warned us about in the 1960's was brought to the screen in the 1980's by David Cronenberg.When television prophet Dr. Brian Oblivion opines television is reality. And reality is less then television he is heralding in our current age where the line between fantasy and reality is almost fails to exist.Videodrome is the story of war for the mind.  On the one side representing control is Barry Convex who wishes to shape the world by controlling what people see.  Convex is a glasses salesmen who essentially tells us he is the Devil in using the words of Lorenzo de Medici love comes in at the eye and the eye is the window to the soul as his formula for control First you tempt with the forbidden fruit then when your victim has bitten you take their soul.  This is done via the organ of the eye because the mind will take as fact whatever the eye shows it.  This is why it is so essential today for the faculty of critical thinking to become damaged via such institutions as the public school system and television.Unfortunately the opposing side does not seem to offer freedom but some other sort of control.  A kind of confusing chaotic and recursive control. Dr. Brian Oblivion the inventor and first victim of Videodrome is murdered by Convex prior to the movie and now exists only in the virtual world of video tape.  For 1983 this was the best way to convey the virtual world as only kids played video games and most computers barely did 64K of memory. The bad thing about using videotape to represent the virtual world was that tape does not convey the fluidity of the convention.But I digress for Oblivion freedom seems to be some sort of unending recursive loop the kind you get when you hold two mirrors in front of each other. The Oblivion side does seem to be trying to help at least as the Doctor's daughter Bianca Oblivion runs the Cathode Ray Mission that tries to patch the indigent back into society by serving them a generous supply of orange juice along with their TV.One of the reasons it is difficult to tell who the good guys are or even if there are any good guys is that the story is told through the eyes of Max Renn and Max is cynical little man played expertly by James Woods whose only concern is taking his porn cable channel to the next level and maybe getting Nicki Brand into bed. Max allows himself to become a pawn in this war and by the end of the movie it becomes clear that Max has left his humanity behind.Sex and violence form the back drop of the movie especially perverted sex. At least twice Max is offered nice sex to show on his cable channel and both times he turns it down.  The importance of perverted sex and perverted violence as a plot point is that it opens certain neural receptors in the nervous system that allows the videodrome signal to get in. The bad guys in the movie Convex and Renn's video pirate Harlen both moralize against this perverted sex and use it as a hook to get Max infected with the videodrome signal.  Why would anybody watch such a thing one of the bad guys preaches to Max. This was particularly effective when I first saw the movie at the age of eighteen.  I wondered if the videodrome signal was encoded in the movie.I believe Videodrome will go down in history as the first of virtual reality movies and is still one of the best.  It not only predicted the chaos of our current time but also the lone nut assassin epidemic that happens with increasing frequency but as the model for Dr. Oblivion Marshall McLuhan said  ESP is old hat when effect precedes cause.Videodrome remains one of the best offerings from Cronenberg but is not for everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well Mr. Convex too bad for you... Videodrome David Cronenberg's first masterpiece tells the tale of one Max Renn. Played with expert sleaziness by James Woods Renn oversees a lowrent exploitative cable network which specializes in showing increasingly violent and pornographic shows. When he stumbles upon the satellite transmission of Videodrome  a realistic SMTorture show from Pittsburgh  Renn believes that he's discovered the next wave. Then come the hallucinations... maybe dead bodies cancer guns stomachvulvas etc. Reality bends and perhaps Videodrome has taken over...In every respect Videodrome is a great film managing to repulse and intrigue simultaneously. It is horrific and contains numerous sciencefiction motifs but unlike the horror and special effects driven pictures of today Videodrome to quote the film has a philosophy. Videodrome is not about mindcontrolling cable shows it is about our unhealthy consumption of visual media. I may not agree with Cronenberg's vision of our relationship with TV but it is never less than interesting. It's refreshing to see a movie about more than itself it seems that since the 1980s these types of films have become increasingly rare and that's a shame. Maybe it's only nostalgia but the era when films like Videodrome and Dawn of the Dead were being made by major studios and released to huge audiences seems like a Golden Age to my mind.Here's to hoping those days will return. What's truly brilliant about Videodrome beyond its decision to base itself upon an idea is its seamless blending of the characters' realities and their hallucinations. After the fortyfive minute mark what actually happens becomes lost as we enter deeper and deeper in the the tortured psyche of Max Renn. It is impossible by the end of the movie to know what actually happened. Unlike a movie like Donnie Darko which left me puzzled and irritable I accept the puzzlement of Videodrome because an explanation would have lessened the film's visceral impact. The openendedness of the narrative melds perfectly with a film that revels in the hallucinationreality divide. If the characters cannot comprehend what is actually happening why should we?As mentioned every element of this film works. There are amazing setpieces throbbing televisions and gurgling video cassettes and moments of beautiful photography the shots of Renn approaching the harbor for instance. The acting even by Debbie Harry in her first starring role is excellent. James Woods in particular excels. He has always been one of my favorite actors and brings to Renn a level of sleaziness that perhaps could have been achieved by only him or Harry Dean Stanton. This is Cronenberg's first masterpiece sorry I'm not too keen on his earlier work as it doesn't meld his ideas and venerealtechnological horror as well and started a string of absolutely brilliant films. For me it's also his greatest masterpiece it's forgive me for using this word postmodern vision is spellbinding and the story is I think his most imaginative to date. As his career went forward Cronenberg became more and more respectable and I think that hurt his work slightly. In Videodrome he is at the top of his form and working with his most amazing cast. The movie is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone but I highly recommend it and think you should all watch it with an open mind.".

When he stumbles upon the satellite transmission of Videodrome  a realistic SMTorture show from Pittsburgh  Renn believes that he's discovered the next wave. Then come the hallucinations... maybe dead bodies cancer guns stomachvulvas etc. Reality bends and perhaps Videodrome has taken over...In every respect Videodrome is a great film managing to repulse and intrigue simultaneously. It is horrific and contains numerous sciencefiction motifs but unlike the horror and special effects driven pictures of today Videodrome to quote the film has a philosophy. Videodrome is not about mindcontrolling cable shows it is about our unhealthy consumption of visual media. I may not agree with Cronenberg's vision of our relationship with TV but it is never less than interesting. It's refreshing to see a movie about more than itself it seems that since the 1980s these types of films have become increasingly rare and that's a shame. Maybe it's only nostalgia but the era when films like Videodrome and Dawn of the Dead were being made by major studios and released to huge audiences seems like a Golden Age to my mind.Here's to hoping those days will return. What's truly brilliant about Videodrome beyond its decision to base itself upon an idea is its seamless blending of the characters' realities and their hallucinations. After the fortyfive minute mark what actually happens becomes lost as we enter deeper and deeper in the the tortured psyche of Max Renn. It is impossible by the end of the movie to know what actually happened. Unlike a movie like Donnie Darko which left me puzzled and irritable I accept the puzzlement of Videodrome because an explanation would have lessened the film's visceral impact. The openendedness of the narrative melds perfectly with a film that revels in the hallucinationreality divide. If the characters cannot comprehend what is actually happening why should we?As mentioned every element of this film works. There are amazing setpieces throbbing televisions and gurgling video cassettes and moments of beautiful photography the shots of Renn approaching the harbor for instance. The acting even by Debbie Harry in her first starring role is excellent. James Woods in particular excels. He has always been one of my favorite actors and brings to Renn a level of sleaziness that perhaps could have been achieved by only him or Harry Dean Stanton. This is Cronenberg's first masterpiece sorry I'm not too keen on his earlier work as it doesn't meld his ideas and venerealtechnological horror as well and started a string of absolutely brilliant films. For me it's also his greatest masterpiece it's forgive me for using this word postmodern vision is spellbinding and the story is I think his most imaginative to date. As his career went forward Cronenberg became more and more respectable and I think that hurt his work slightly. In Videodrome he is at the top of his form and working with his most amazing cast. The movie is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone but I highly recommend it and think you should all watch it with an open mind.";

I forgot to add in his 1983 horror movie Videodrome and there is a reason for that which I'll talk about later. His works provoke intelligent thought and terrify those who can't comprehend it. His films stimulate offend and move those who care to watch them with an open mind.Allow me to try explain. I won't bother to go into detail about the plot. A sleazy lowlife TV producer named Max Renn James Woods rapidly becomes obsessed with an unusual television signal which in turn begins to warp his perceptions of reality. Get it? Nah of course you don't. You're not going to let a onesentence plot description and if you own the Criterion Collection DVD the three essays included deter you from watching it are you?You're also not going to let scenes of grisly torture unspeakable violence murder flesh guns human VCRs exploding cancerdeaths poor Leslie Carlson as Barry Convex pulsating video cassettes Deborah Harry in SM and morphing televisions turn you away are you? What's more you're not going to let Woods's effectively wooden performance here his sticking his face into a living television turn you away either?I won't even try to pretend I understood what was going through Cronenberg's mind when he wrote and directed this picture. I also won't pretend I understood the essays included with the DVD and I don't think the writers did either. It's warped it's perverted it's depraved and it's insanely intriguing and fascinating. The masses are frightened by Videodrome and with good reason. Videodrome is Cronenberg's dastardly take on massmedia consumption during a time when television was afraid... afraid to be real. Media violence had not yet become a major issue in America and hypocritical politicians weren't condemning it. But keep in mind this film was made in '83 years before the mindblowing realitymorphing of The Matrix 1999.There's a little more that I think I can get away with in describing the plot and Renn eventually traces the signal to Pittsburgh and is introduced to the station's enigmatic programmer Brian O'Blivion Jack Creley and his daughter Bianca Sonja Smits. He learns of the bizarre nature surrounding Videodrome and the fate of those of who watch it. As he becomes more and more obsessed he finds it nearly impossible to turn it off or turn away. Then those mutations and hallucinations Cronenberg is famous for start happening and when that does things become nasty and the queasy may want to keep a finger on the fastforward button. It's no secret Cronenberg loves torturing his protagonists and here the new flesh wants to live long and Woods has the nice warm body perfect for it  he becomes a literal media assassin with a vaginal slit in his stomach that doubles as a programmable VCR and also has a handgun fused to his wrist  he's a virtual slave to Videodrome.Lastly the eerie driving score by Howard Shore swells up during the film's most intense and surreal moments the most lovely being Woods's lovemaking with his television. I always watch Cronenberg films at least partially for Shore's music. Now I know why Cronenberg selects him for his soundtracks.Videodrome I think has a lot more relevance today than it did 22 years ago. It's more visceral than gross is quite brilliant and doesn't spare us graphic violence and gore. It's alive it's Videodrome.810".

Intrigued and convinced he has seen the future for his network Max tracks down the signal to be coming from Pittsburgh and does some digging to find out who is responsible for it. However as his fascination becomes an obsession his hallucinations start to get more real and more extreme.Although it is pretty hard to get inside and to understand much of it does not make a lot of sense Videodrome is probably more relevant today than it was in the early eighties if only because the issue of the effects of sexual andor violent entertainment continues to be debated and explored. This theme is explored with a certain amount of graphic disgust from Cronenberg as he takes Max exposes him to graphic television violence and sees the affect it has on his mind and his body. As a commentary on the social impact of mass media it is hardly the clearest or most accessible of things but it is interesting and engaging nonetheless. As writer he could have made his message clearer and a lot less convoluted but I suppose he should be commended for delivering this in his own unique style but the downside is that the mass audience will feel excluded from the story.As director though he makes it quite engrossing even if it isn't clear what the message is. The imaginative body horror stuff is very well done and the effects as impressive as the twisted creative forces behind it. The cast also buy into it well even if the show does mainly belong to Woods. He is totally convincing which is a feat you need to believe is very hard to pull off in this sort of film! The rest of the cast are more in the world of the film as opposed to drawn into it and the result is that their performances tend to be more out and out weird  point in case Harry who is disturbingly vapid as the hollow SM thrill seeker of the piece. Likewise Smits Carlson Creley and others are more about the world than giving performances socalled.Overall though this is an interesting and imaginative film. It doesn't make a lot of sense but it is enjoyable to try and apply what is happening to work out a meaning within it while watching it. The effects are good although the horror might have meant more to me if I understand all of it better but regardless it is certainly an experience that is worth having at some point.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the bad luck to watch eXistenZ well before i set my eyes upon this work of director David Cronenberg. Bad luck as eXistenZ basically consists of the same ingredients as Videodrome and kind of spoils the subliminal story line of Videodrome. I guess it's impossible to see Videodrome and eXistenZ as separate movies as they both handle a subject that obviously intrigues David Cronenburg. Where eXistenZ had so much more to it for Videodrome the subject is really the only good thing about it.To me it seems Videodrome suffers from a lack of enthusiasm from both director and actors. The flat acting of pretty much everybody but especially James Woods turn the characters from potentially mysterious into plain geeks. There's Deborah Harry who moans herself halfway through this movie be it in bed or in the torture room as a kinky radiopresenter and there's a strange TVprogram saleswoman dressed like a Bulgarian fortune teller. Also a number of outbursts of violence in this movie are either witnessed by zombielike bystanders or are just ways to force the movie through some big holes in the script. With these facts the unexpected plot twists become highly incredible.Maybe Videodrome made some impact in the time it was released but nowadays the idea that a videotape embodies evil is somewhat outdated. Cronenberg was a bit smarter when adapting the story for eXistenZ can't help but mentioning it as it tells of an electronic device which may just as well never be invented and therefore will give the movie more longevity than Videodrome.Videodrome would be a mustsee for Cronenberg diehards as it shows him making an early attempt at making a movie that shows a world switching between reality and hallucination on the brink of revolution. He finally succeeded in this with eXistenZ which is a much better attempt in telling the Videodrome story.".

Starting as a satire on man's fascination and obsession with television it evolves rapidly into a hallucinogenic mindwarp that left me scratching my head more often then picking my brain. Cronenberg trademarks like phallic and vaginal imagery kinky heroines and sleazy heroes are all here in graphic display but their portrayal alternates between oddly beautiful to fetishistic and obscene. Obviously this is all part of the plan and like I said before I admire much of it.

The Daily Mail and other right wing tabloids would be concerned about the moral health of Great Britain and nothing disgusted the rags more than the advent of the video recorder . Every murder and violent crime committed in the last quarter of the 20th Century was souly caused by people watching video nasties . Interesting to remember that two of the most popular shows on British television in the 1980s were JIM'LL FIX IT and THAT'S LIFE when both Jimmy Savile and Esther Rantzen were great role models to the great British publicVIDEODROME captures the spirit of these times . For many years people would debate if there was even such a thing as a  snuff movie  but with the advent of the internet the urban myth of the snuff movie has been dispelled . Jihadist scum proudly post videos of violent murders of both infidels and heretics alike and if we're talking moral corruption both worthless nobodies and big name celebrities happily download images and videos of children being  raped  abused and mutilated for their own sexual enjoyment In other words this makes VIDEODROME a rather dated film but one that remains prophetic . It is in effect a film that predates the likes of THE LAWNMOWER MAN  TOTAL RECALL  INCEPTION and all these other mind bending thrillers featuring virtual reality but with a much smaller budget than the films that followed it Cronenberg makes up for the lack of budget by concentrating on performances and a brooding atmosphere . The criminally underrated James Woods is an actor you'll either love or hate and gives his usual intense over caffinated edgy performance and if he read out his shopping list I'd still find it a compelling experience . He has a great sexual chemistry with Debbie Harry but how difficult is it not to have sexual chemistry with the lead singer of Blondie ? It says a lot about a film when you have no idea what is going on and can't explain the plot but you're still hypnotised by it . Even more so this is the antithesis of the feel good movie . Sadomasochism features as does self mutilation  psychosis and murder and the film ends bleakly with the suicide of the antihero . It's this shocking  depressing nihilism that makes VIDEODROME so memorable. The Cronenberg remake of THE FLY might be his most enjoyable film but perhaps VIDEODROME is his best movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Videodrome has a lot of small elements with potential but it never develops any of them into a worthwhile payoff. Some viewers might be dazzled if it's their first time ever seeing a movie that isn't 100 Hollywood clichs but if you want a memorable story good characters or a powerful experience Videodrome will be a waste of time. Even if we set aside characters  story this film simply fails to be exciting or fun unless you are very easily impressed. Given this flick's overblown reputation I guess there are a lot of easilyimpressed people out there.Many people consider this film shocking and dark but it simply isn't! All the gory or twisted scenes are either lightweight or silly looking. James Woods discovers a secret TV broadcast of torture scenes called Videodrome. The characters never shut up about how twisted  violent these scenes are but they look like every amateur torture scene from a zerobudget movie. It's just some guy lightly smacking a toy whip against a woman's ribs  then she vaguely flinches in the wrong direction. There are also some incredibly boring SM scenes which had me laughing because they were so dull  tame yet Cronenberg gave them huge dramatic emphasis like they were totally edgy.People also LOVE to call this film prescient but the social commentary just amounts to clichs about how TV controls people  can be a propaganda tool. These ideas had already been around for decades. If anything the film's themes are downright conservative especially with its almost 1950sesque fear of sex  violence!Sure the film belabors some creepy imagery but all of this is frankly cartoonish  wacky instead of disturbing. You'll find more disturbing imagery in an episode of Ren  Stimpy.Returning to plot and characters This movie halfway develops LOTS of ideas then just fails to deliver on anything. The plot starts off as social commentary then forgets about this completely. James Woods has a friend named Masha who gets just enough screen time to feel tedious then abruptly disappears from the story. The film heads in a surreal otherworldly direction then has a clichd third act where James Woods just has to kill some paperthin bad guy who wants to rule the world.James Woods as Max Renn does an OK job in the lead role but his character never develops calling him 2dimensional feels like an overstatement. Max' buddy Harlan is quirky but the actor fails ridiculously any time he has to emote. The women in the film are HORRIBLY directed every single one of them is stilted  unnatural. Sonja Smitts and Debbie Harry share the gimmick of talking... really... REALLLLLY... slowly because Cronenberg thought this sounded dramatic. It doesn't. Neither of them ever emote unless you count the same exact headbobbling movement Cronenberg that creative genius had them do. This is a huge problem when they both have such important characters with heavy screen time!The film has a villain who is never threatening compelling or interesting. He is supposed to be a powerful corporate executive but he has NONE of the strength or charisma such a man would need. He acts more like a manager at a shoe store or something. This is also a problem since we're supposed to take him seriously as a threat.And then there are minor characters like Masha played by Lynne Gorman. Gorman talks and talks for way too long and she never acts. She just says her lines in a ridiculous vaguely foreigny accent. This might have sounded cool and dramatic in the '50s but in the '80s it's just plain stupid and laughable.When I saw all these shoddy details piling up I only hoped that Videodrome would end on a comedic note with a selfaware punchline recognizing how stupid it was. Perhaps the whole thing would be a satire on the scifi trends of the '80s! But no the film ends with no irony no energy nothing to make its 90minute runtime worthwhile to anyone who isn't easilyimpressed.".

Neither of them ever emote unless you count the same exact headbobbling movement Cronenberg that creative genius had them do. This is a huge problem when they both have such important characters with heavy screen time!The film has a villain who is never threatening compelling or interesting. He is supposed to be a powerful corporate executive but he has NONE of the strength or charisma such a man would need. He acts more like a manager at a shoe store or something. This is also a problem since we're supposed to take him seriously as a threat.And then there are minor characters like Masha played by Lynne Gorman. Gorman talks and talks for way too long and she never acts. She just says her lines in a ridiculous vaguely foreigny accent. This might have sounded cool and dramatic in the '50s but in the '80s it's just plain stupid and laughable.When I saw all these shoddy details piling up I only hoped that Videodrome would end on a comedic note with a selfaware punchline recognizing how stupid it was. Perhaps the whole thing would be a satire on the scifi trends of the '80s! But no the film ends with no irony no energy nothing to make its 90minute runtime worthwhile to anyone who isn't easilyimpressed.";

When his employee Harlan Peter Dvorsky decodes a pirate video broadcast showing torture murder and mutilation called Videodrome Max becomes obsessed to get these movies for his channel. He contacts his supplier Masha Lynne Gorman and asks her to find the responsible for the transmission. A couple of days later Masha tells that Videodrome is real actually snuff movies. Max's sadomasochist girlfriend Nicki Brand Deborah Harry decides to travel to Pittsburgh to have an audition to the show. Max investigates further and through a video of the expert Professor Brian O'Blivion Jack Creley he learns that that TV screen would be the retina of the mind's eye being part of the brain and Videodrome transmission creates a brain tumor in the viewer changing the reality in video hallucination.Videodrome in my point of view is a prophetic movie of David Cronenberg. The first time I saw this movie was in 1985 or 1986 when videoclubs where novelty in Brazil and the local price of a videocassette was more than US 650.00. In that occasion I recall that I was visually impressed with this gore weird and bizarre movie. Twentythree years later I have just seen it on DVD and I realize the vision of this great director. He was able to foresee the importance of television for mankind influencing people with sublimated messages manipulating audiences and becoming very powerful and how violence on screen can generate violence. I particularly like the following quotes The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye and Television is reality and reality is less than television. Last but not the least Brazil is not located in Central America but in South America. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Videodrome  A Sndrome do Vdeo Videodrome  The Syndrome of the Video".

The plot seems to exist only to get Renn from one hallucination to the next.Fans of the surreal and horror will enjoy this movie for the hallucination scenes.

We enjoyed the spectacular dancing the vibrant colors of clothes and sets and the marvelous Gershwin music.  We both swore that someday we would get to Paris.Sadly it was not to be for us as my husband Thanos  died 24 years later having been sick for many years.  The following year an old friend invited me to visit him while he was on sabbatical from school.  He had spent many years in Paris teaching English there and rented a little house in Neuilly.  I said no but all my friends said GO! It's the opportunity of a lifetime.  So I did and fell in love with that glorious old city.I cried because Thanos was not with me and yet I felt he knew I had come here for both of us and was glad for me.  I have since visited the City of Light 5 times and love it so very much. I am now too old and too disabled to do any more world traveling but that city of romance is something that will always remind me of Thanos. That's why I still love to see the youthful Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron falling in love as WE were once young and in love  and the glorious city of Paris  the most beautiful place in the world!".

	schema:headline " Experiencing Paris With Gershwin";
	schema:reviewBody "Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM. Here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the Arthur Freed musical unit. Hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris that the players never left the back lot at MGM. The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed blended with some background establishing shots. The idea of the film originated with Kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris. It sounded good to Arthur Freed who approached Ira Gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other Gershwin material.Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got. Not one note of nonGershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me which are not real musical numbers.Another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics Alan Jay Lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one. All about an exGI played by Gene Kelly who after World War II never left France just settled into an apartment on the Left Bank and proceeded to become a starving artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy. Two women are interested in him. Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters. But Kelly falls for a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her film debut. Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here.Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris happens to be the first film I ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip I ever took. I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport seeing Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm. My favorite number in the film however is TraLaLa which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.In a book about Arthur Freed I read a quote where he said in the American in Paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the French impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot. So it happened that way. Kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in Words and Music The Pirate and On the Town. But this one topped them all. Still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later films.In a surprise upset at the Oscars An American In Paris was chosen best picture for 1951 beating out the heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire. I guess fantasy trumped realism that year. Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated.".

Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself... The whole movie brings a touch of French elegance where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism...The first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of Leslie Caron in her screen debut... She is like a diamond a touch of class... George Guetary describes his fiance ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy vivacious and modern graceful and awesome... The number leads to an unpretentious bistro where Kelly and his very good friends in Paris share a gentle parody of Viennese waltzes... Later Kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him 'I Got Rhythm' and at the massive jazz nightclub Kelly spots the girl of his dreams... He is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull Lize onto the dance floor and sing to her It's very clear Our love is here to stay.To the joyful 'TraLaLa' Kelly provides humor wit and talent all around Oscar Levant's room and even on the top of his brown piano... When he meets his pretty Cinderella along the Seine river Kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with Caron... He expresses all his emotions with 'Our Love Is Here to Stay.' The piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft blue smoky light... They start an enchanting danceduet juxtaposing differing elements... Caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way... They move backward away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug...The film's weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story... In one Georges Guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage... In another Oscar Levant imagines himself conducting a concert and playing not only a piano recital but the other instruments as well... He even applauds to himself as members of the audience...The extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design... It is a blaze of love fury and vividness... It is Kelly's major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about Paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of France's most Impressionist painters...The number starts at the Beaux Arts Ball after Kelly finds himself separated from Lise and begins a sketch with a black crayon... It gathers the important parts of the film's story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the painters who have influenced Jerry... The tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the Place De la Concorde Fountain the Madeleine flower market the Place De l'Opra to his RendezVous at Montmartre with the cancan dancers in a representation of Lautrec's Moulin Rouge...Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self... Caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place...Nina Foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her oneshouldered white gown...

	schema:headline " A trailblazing musical";
	schema:reviewBody "An American in Paris was in many ways the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the height of MGM's powers as a musical powerhouse the film features memorable music from the Gershwins who rightly have been called the 20th Century's equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warmup for his best work in Singin' in the Rain 1952. The two films are actually closely linked. Aside from the Arthur Freed connection the Broadway Melody segment in Rain owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film. This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And it deserved to be as it showcases Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.The film's cast is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron incredibly making her film debut shows a maturity that makes you think she'd been making films for years. Her introductory dance sequence and later her work on the Ballet provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse's work in Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly's stoic pal who gets two of the film's best moments during the end party sequence which I will not give away for anyone who hasn't seen the film and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with stateoftheart for the time special effects.Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly's romantic rival though he does get a few musical highlights and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron's romantic rival. The MayDecember relationship between Kelly's character and Nina's reminded me of the same kept man relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's.There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin' in the Rain. The Ballet though lavish and wellproduced doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. Without giving away the plot the Ballet just happens with no real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence it really doesn't have anything to do with the plot  and in the best musicals the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre. Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the ending shouldn't be a surprise this IS an MGM musical after all I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended. It's as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn't follow the Ballet with anything else. The film literally left me in the lurch.That negative aside An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood's musicals. It doesn't quite reach the heights of Singin' in the Rain but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.".

Watching Kelly dance anything from the tap on the sidewalks to the full blown ballet at the end is still very much a marvel to behold. But the story? Ehhhh... not so much.Granted plots in MGM musicals are pretty thin affairs anyway little more than slight variations on their Broadway cousins who at the time weren't anywhere near Shakespeare themselves! stock formulae that involved a boy and a girl and a happy ending. But in American IN Paris we're to somehow believe that Gene and Leslie are a perfect couple from their very first glance even though it means trampling all over the feelings of the two people genuinely in love with these two and Lord only knows why. Poor Nina Foch gets the worst of it her storyline doesn't even get a proper resolution... and I'm not quite sure I hold to the idea that she wanted to make Kelly a kept man instead she comes across as a woman who falls in love way too easily and has the cash on hand to help her man of the moment realize his own dream with little thought of her own. Certainly she gets twisted in all directions from the moment Kelly spurned by Caron shows up at her apartment seemingly ready to accept her a real woman... only to discover that she's just a rebound relationship  and we all know how well those work out right? Meanwhile the guy who's kept Caron's body and soul together comes across as the kind of nice guy that would do anything to keep his wife happy... even if it means giving her up for some schmuck he and she! barely knows. Again we're looking at someone with a fierce sense of devotion and the means to create a perfect world for his intended... only to find out that she never really loved him like she said she did. I have little doubt that when his act finally did tour the States it was a huge disaster because it's difficult to sing something about a stairway to Paradise through a layer of bitter cynicism.It's interesting that we have these parallel relationships both set up along the same dynamics of one person totally in love and happy to lay out anything hisher partner wants no matter the cost  and that in both cases the wealthy one despite the integrity of hisher feelings get dumped for a somewhat duplicious deceitful little affair. Maybe in some alternate MGM universe these two unfortunate people found each other and got their own happy ending. I sure hope so.".

I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since both in the cinema and on TV.     It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century George Gershwin and features the greatest male Gene Kelly and female Leslie Caron dancers in Hollywood history.   The supporting cast of Oscar Levant as quirky as ever Georges Guetary why didn't he make more movies ? and Nina Foch brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form.     The closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and postimpressionist artists.     All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are It's Very Clear Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine and I Got Rhythm the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in Une Chanson Americaine.    If you love Paris see this movie.    If you've never been to Paris in your life see it. But see it !".

When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin panorama film he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of For Me and My Gal. Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in Paris based on the story of Pal Joey. This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway even though Warners had outbid MGM for the rights to Pal Joey. In my opinion the WB film Pal Joey is a wreck though Sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction. You complain that Kelly's pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point. But you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the storycharacters. The pictures are so bad the audience knows that Kelly isn't ready for an exhibition. Even he knows it though Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her. But it's important that the audience not be sitting there saying but he's a great artist if he only had the chance!. You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story. He refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows he's not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as Joey's enthusiasm to start a nightclub. But it serves the same function in the plot. Remember it's essential in Pal Joey the play that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn't deserve it. Same with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point. Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no chemistry. I guess it's in the eye of the beholder. I agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine. Compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in The Pride and the Passion. When you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you haven't dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone. The movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian Art and also a separate phase of their relationships. If you didn't' see that it's not the movie's fault. It's certainly not a load of crap. ".

He needs to because she seems to have a... problem with emoting. The most accomplished and technically aweinspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16minute ballet towards the end of the film. It's stunningly filmed and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favourite number would have to be Kelly's character singing 'I Got Rhythm' with a bunch of French schoolchildren then breaking into an array of American dances. It just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real talent.Not on the 'classics' level with 'Singin' In The Rain' but pretty high up there nonetheless.

The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have had a better gift for melody. I very much enjoy Gershwin's music. It is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a highly entertaining film.".

Not Leslie Caron who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me.No it would definitely be Gene Kelly. There's something about his screen persona that's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in Paris content to put off facing the critics indefinitely frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets. That's what made him so effective in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and other movies where he played ambitious focused characters. Jerry Mulligan is in some ways a cousin to Tommy Albright in BRIGADOON another Lerner story with Kelly miscast as an American at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque European place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues.Except that Jerry isn't as likeable as even poor dazed Tommy. That's another galling thing about this film. Jerry is sometimes a cad to Milo and even worse to Lise. When he first sees the latter at a club he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him. When she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number. When he calls her the next day she hangs up on him which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace. And throughout all this it's obvious she wants NOTHING to do with him. When she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop it's about as believable as Milo's interest in his paintings. Sure he's goodlooking and playful but why should that sway her when she's got Henri who seems like a gentleman to boot?Admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress. If a role like Lise was played by say Judy Garland she would shower Jerry with indignant insults and glares. If she was played by Cyd Charisse one would admire his guts. But when she's played by firsttimer Leslie Caron she looks and acts like a shy vulnerable teenager and as a result Jerry just seems like a creep. And why DID they choose these other actors though personally I'd rather they'd solved things by changing the lead when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people? Not only is Gene Kelly a few years above Guetary and Foch he's old enough to be Caron's father.In short I think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedicrelief type dancer as Jerry the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles...e.g. Ray MacDonald in GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van in SMALL TOWN GIRL. Maybe not them necessarily but someone LIKE them. Someone who could have chased Lise and made it seem harmlessly playful someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that Chaplinesque holeinthewall someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with Oscar Levant's sarcastic grumpiness. It probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous. And it might have provided a voice that could sing Gershwin better.All this may give the impression that I don't like Gene Kelly. I do like him. He was terrific in most of his films just not this one well and a few others. I don't despise AAIP itself either it has good points like the art direction. And Leslie Caron who despite her inexperience is rather charming and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting. Georges Guetary does a fine job and his Stairway to Paradise is my favorite number in the movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with SOMEBODY. But not Jerry Mulligan. I wouldn't wish that on her.".

In the case of An American in Paris you have a film which for me falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But looked at coldly and in retrospect it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous overconfident and heavily madeup you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron when she finally turns up looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together technically but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else.The music despite such great numbers seems to have been shoehorned into the narrative and often doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed for instance has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does however provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes.It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later in 1955 and yet seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing the story works well the casting is faultless the choreography  apart from the disappointing dream sequence  is sublime. But above all the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'.

	schema:reviewBody "There's no other way to say it I am disappointed. After absolutely falling in love with 'Singin' in the Rain 1952'  a film that singlehandedly ignited my newfound passion for musicals  I perhaps unreasonably expected to enjoy Vincente Minnelli's 'An American in Paris 1951' just as much. Gene Kelly? Music by George Gershwin? Winner of six Oscars including Best Picture? A clear homerun or so I'd thought. For almost two hours I waited patiently for the film to hit its stride but the moment never came and I finished the film completely unsatisfied feeling as though somehow it was my fault rather than the picture's. That there's merit in many of the film's musical numbers is undeniable but for some reason all the pieces never quite came together for me and the love story at the film's centre struck me as being rather generic and uninspired. Gene Kelly of course brings an incredible energy to his role as always and his character exhibits a likable arrogance that gives way to unabashed exuberance once the music starts playing.As is unfortunately the case in many musicals the filmmakers seem to have dedicated all their efforts towards the extravagant musical sequences and forgotten that there is ultimately a story to be told. The romance between Jerry Mulligan and Lise Bouvier Leslie Caron is one that we've seen many times before and its mundaneness is amplified by the fact that nineteenyearold Lise is neither as beautiful nor as charming as the film's characters appear to find her though in Caron's defence this was the French actress' debut performance and she may be acting in a language with which she was uncomfortable. The awkward threeway relationship between Jerry Lise and the charming Frenchman Hank Baurel Georges Gutary could easily have been played for enormous laughs but the opportunity is abandoned after just two brief chuckles with Oscar Levant the passive onlooker clumsily spluttering drink all over his shirt. Such contempt is apparently shown for the story that entire subplots are shamelessly disregarded at the film's end  does Jerry achieve success with his exhibition? Does Adam Cook ever achieve his dream of performing at a concert?This brings us to the musical numbers which are thankfully the film's saving grace. Though none of the sequences begin to approach the timelessness of Singin' in the Rain Make 'Em Laugh or Good Morning they are obviously wellwritten and performed with bravura by the film's stars. My favourite number was probably Kelly's catchy rendition of Got Rhythm with the French street kids which had a good beat and was fun to sing. This film's most ambitious sequence is undoubtedly a wordless seventeenminute ballet set to Gershwin's An American in Paris. Costing a staggering 500000 the extended dance number is audacious elaborate and extravagant effectively earning my admiration despite my inclination towards singing over dance I typically prefer being able to sing along when I'm watching musicals which is impossible when they are performing a ballet. Displaying Technicolor in all its flamboyant brilliance it's no surprise that the film won Oscars for its cinematography set decoration and costume design. Had it possessed a decent story 'An American in Paris' might have been a terrific musical but as it stands I'll continue to regard it as a disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK there is no doubt that Gene Kelly can dance and he can even sing and act passably well.  But never have I seen him play a less appealing character than in An American in Paris.  It's one thing to be a lovable rogue so long as you retain a basic humanity and don't go out of your way to insult the viewer's decency.  In some ways An American in Paris is Kelly's Pal Joey except Frank Sinatra managed to carry off that film by dint of his acting skills.Part of the plot revolves around his being a painter whose talent has been discovered by wealthy patroness Milo the lovely Nina Foch in an unsympathetic role.  Unfortunately for the credibility of the plot Kelly's paintings are are motel art at its worst.  For anyone who questions my credibility I'm a professional artist and am quite familiar with the School of the City of Paris style his paintings ape  And what does Kellywho supposedly wants to have a solo show more than anything on earthdo when it is dropped into his lap by Milo?  He promptly does everything to sabotage her interest.Kelly's interest in Leslie Caron couldn't be more superficial and unbelievable.  Despite what others have written here the scene with Kelly and Caron on the banks of the Seine Our Love is Here to Stay is like the rest of their relationship stiff perfunctory and unconvincing.The story bogs down considerably halfway through and finally any semblance of plot or character development is thrown out the window. It's as if director Minelli said hey we've got a bunch of great Gershwin Brothers music.  Let's stage a big dance finale that is set in Old Paris but has nothing to do with anything else in this film and leaves every story element unresolved.  Then for no reason at all we'll resolve the plot. What a load of crap.There is plenty that is visually and audibly appealing in An American in Paris.  The sets and costuming are good the music is with few exceptions excellent.  Oscar Levant gives a great supporting performance.  But if you want to see Gene Kelly at his best I recommend watching Invitation to the Dance instead where his considerable dancing skills and charm are unhindered by the very things that cause An American in Paris to fail.".

Some say her acting is amateurish but I disagree  it is perfect for the role of the sheltered girl she plays.

But he is smitten with Caron's character he pursues her she apparently shares the affection they meet often by the bridge at night they get to know each other. But she was orphaned in the war and a French entertainer helped raise her and now that she is an adult plans to marry him. I owe him everything for what he has done for me after my parents died.Near the end at a party she tells him she is to marry the next day and travel to America with her new husband. But the French entertainer having a smoke by a column overhears the conversation then we see them getting into a taxi and driving away.For 16 minutes while they are in the taxi Kelly's character has a fantasy dream sequence a series of big dance production numbers featuring kelly and Caron plus dozens of other dancers. When he comes out of it the taxi shows up apparently her beau frees her to go with Kelly and the film ends both of them with big grins.

It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay.  The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big.  Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy.  Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel Leslie Caron.  His main dancing partner and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise.  Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings too.  So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant's nimble piano fingers the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 810".

It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay.  The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big.  Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy.  Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel Leslie Caron.  His main dancing partner and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise.  Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings too.  So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant's nimble piano fingers the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Vincente Minnelli's An American In Paris is routinely hailed as one of the greatest musicals ever made. While it is wonderful to watch I hardly think this is the greatest musical ever made or even Minnelli or Kelly's best musical. For my money Minnelli's best musical remains The Bandwagon with Fred Astaire released in 1953. Kelly's best musical for me is Singin In the Rain released after American. I think one of the problems with American is the final 20 minute ballet. While it may have been breathtaking in 1951 today it sparkles at times but becomes rather tedious after a while. It could easily take a few cuts without any damage. Still Minnelli and Kelly get points for even attempting such a feat.Another problem is the screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner which seems to be just one circumstance on top of another in place of a solid story and likable characters. Even the usually likable Kelly is rather abrasive here.Yet another problem is Leslie Caron who is terrible in her acting debut. She had yet to develop as an actress her later films include Gigi and The LShaped Room much better performances but her dancing is great and that is enough for now.But there are several good things about An American in Paris. One thing is the wonderful Gershwin songs. With songs like  S'Wonderful Our Love Is Here To Stay and the final ballet you would have to have a heart of stone NOT to love these. Another plus is the casting of pianist Oscar Levant who steals every scene he appears in. He just brings the movie to life and it's a shame they didn't build the movie around him.Even though it won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1951 An American in Paris feels like a minor work in a minor key compared to other musicals that won the prize such as Gigi My Fair Lady The Sound of Music and Oliver!. But still we sit back and enjoy what we see despite our shortcomings. There have been worse musicals to grace the screen. out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "As a lifelong Singin' in the Rain fan I was really quite disappointed by An American in Paris the first time I saw it. After seeing it a few more times I certainly love the Gershwin score and the ballet at the end but those are the main redeeming features. Aside from the fact that it's way too long 114 minutes it has a cast of forgettable characters and a creaky plot that was sprouting white hair even by 1951's standards. It's hard to believe that this won the Best Picture Academy Award over Streetcar Named Desire and The African Queen. There isn't much to say about the plot Struggling artist Jerry Mulligan Gene Kelly is sponsored by love and leave 'em Milo Roberts Nina Foch. However Jerry is in love with nubile young Parisian Lise Leslie Caron who's engaged to Jerry's friend Henri Georges Guetary. Then there's cranky aging child prodigy Adam Oscar Levant who acts as the story's. actually I don't know why he's there. An American in Paris isn't terrible per se it's just that it plays the notes of a movie musical but not the music. Even when you don't compare it to Singin' in the Rain it just feels like there's something lacking. It has plenty going for it and you desperately want to love it but it just falls short. Plus I really found Jerry insufferable. He's just an opportunistic lecher who takes advantage of Milo who he obviously dislikes and relentlessly chases the much younger Lise who initially dislikes him. Kelly seemed to enjoy playing decidedly unpleasant characters but here he seems to play him a bit too well. Nina Foch does her best with a thankless part. Reserved and coldly beautiful how did Hitchcock miss this woman?? she does a good job playing the icy older woman Kelly was older by nearly a decade but suspend your disbelief. Now about Leslie Caron she's received heaps of criticism for her extremely unsophisticated debut performance. I say give the poor girl a break. Only 19 when handpicked by Gene Kelly Caron was a ballerina for a French company and not even interested in acting she's said she only took the part to satisfy her mother. Also the part of Lise is so insipid and underwritten Barbara Stanwyck or Bette Davis couldn't make it more interesting much less a young novice. She was a splendid dancer and Lise's introduction scenes to the song Embraceable You are among the film's most charming sequences. Minnelli should have fired the makeup artist for shellacking Caron's lips with shiny red lipstick and accentuating her overbite. Caron did have lovely features such as her beautiful eyes and flawless complexion but the makeup artist doesn't highlight them at all. Caron eventually blossomed into a fine actress in later years check her out in Lili Gigi and The LShaped Room if you don't believe me. The musical numbers really save the film from becoming too tepid. I don't care how you feel about the JerryLise romance Love is Here to Stay is still one of the most romantic scenes ever caught on film. And that ballet at the end!! Kelly at least deserved that special Oscar for conceiving and choreographing this epic number that pays tribute to French painters and it demonstrates how tirelessly creative Gene Kelly was. For lovely musical numbers only check out An American in Paris. For the whole bag of tricks songs plots great characters Singin' in the Rain can't be beat.".

For some reason probably best left not understood the makers of this film decided their audience would really benefit from a scene in which all Caron does is stare like a cow into the camera while she poses in a thousand positions somewhat reminiscent of the Kama Sutra. What's worse is I couldn't even like Gene Kelly in this film! I just found his character repetitive uninteresting crabby and a little creepy to be honest. I mean would you go through all that to date Leslie Caron? Let's also not forget the outofwork musician character who failed to be funny or entertaining on every level. Did that guy even have a point in the story other than to annoy?An American In Paris might be worth checking out for two reasons 1 Kelly's song and dance number with the little Parisian kids and 2 the final flourishing dance sequence which nicely encapsulates everything the movie had been trying to say up to that point but in less time. The brass section is phenomenal. I really wish I had more good to say but the film unfortunately falls flat in a lot of critical areas. It beats me how this won the Oscar for Best Picture then again a lot of sub par work has won Oscars. This is certainly a disappointment when compared to the awesome extravaganza of Singin' In the Rain.".

In an afterscreening interview he commented that age makes one want to look more at the better side of things.  Because this is still very much a Peter Greenaway film the ways in which emotions such as filial love are going to be explored are going to be very quirky indeed but to interpret the film's taboo scene as intended to shock is a disservice to the film the director's intentions and his ability to truly shock when he wants to  check The Baby of Macon and your own enjoyment.8 12 Women is full of odd little moments and one SPECTACULARLY odd image which I won't spoil much except to mention that it involves a pig a Japanese Noh performer and a stunning Swiss villa and offbeat humour and it is about male bonding and male delusions about women.  I can see how many people have taken the facile route of viewing it as misogynistic these people have obviously not seen the same film as I have which is all about control from behind the scenes strategy and the presentation of male supremacy for what it is  a fallacy.8 12 Women was badly received at Cannes got a tremendous backlash against it and died a death commercially.  All of which is very unfair. If you like eccentric humour give this film a chance.  It's a little Wonderland of sorts and in its own peculiar way far more heartwarming than the average plastic Hollywood tearjerker.".

	schema:headline " Greenaway's awfulness is his brilliance";
	schema:reviewBody "I've heard and read much criticism about Greenaway's homage to Fellini 8 12 Women and have found it both predictable and amusing.  Every Greenaway film evokes raw often disturbing emotions in the viewer this is nothing new yet is treated like a revelation with every new release.  And some fans and critics of Greenaway seem to be keeping a running score of his visualemotional offenses even tending to get irate when he fails to shock or disturb on the level of his other films.  But again this is nothing new.So I'm humored at the reaction to 8 12 Women for it is as visually stunningarousingdisturbing as many of its predecessors while it is actually quite tame by Greenaway's standards for one the cannibalismmutilation theme is missing.  Yet we have those who are disappointed at the lack of shock or those who are too easily shocked and Greenaway has long proven that you can't make everyone happy in filmmaking and honestly he really doesn't care what you think.  You only have to watch.He is really very similar to Fellini in this way as he is in so many others. I'm no great fan of Fellini's not as much as I am of his successors anyway but the parallels are apparent.  Fellini worked in absurdities the way Greenaway works in the dire or some artists work in oils.  He made the most ridiculous scenarios seem beautiful artful... even sexy.  He imprinted upon film as art and future filmmakers that strange and disjointed often equals desirable and Greenaway clearly took this to heart.  But like Fellini Greenaway films come with an automatic caveat  You will see things that we are taught to abhor and despise in our society you will have to think about things from which humans naturally shrink away and you will bear witness to the possibility that great beauty can be found in the mire if you can manage to look long enough.  Greenaway's awfulness and attempt to disgust you is his medium and his brilliance and his great joke on you and if this doesn't sit well with you then you shouldn't watch Greenaway. It's as simple as that.So that being said  8 12 Women.  Not Greenaway's best but certainly not his worst.  Again we get to share in his great love of the human form in all its beauty and imperfection both of body and of character.  But this is his most lighthearted attempt and is thoroughly enjoyable for that alone. The relationship between the widower Philip Emmenthal and his earthshakingly prattish son Storey is genuinely touching as are their relationships with the various women they bring into their lives to replace their lost wifelovermother.  Equally moving is the fact that these women become much more than mere objects or possessions in their house but rather individual character studies on the strength of femininity and the power that women have over men.  While Fellini's 8 12 may have been semiautobiographical here Greenaway seems to have tapped into the fantasies and realities of the relationships between men and women everywhere focusing on the fact that neither are as simple as they seem. And that while mere sex will inevitably falter in the face of deeper love such meaningful relationships are elusive and fleeting.  He doesn't tap very far through which is this film's only failing the relationships and characters some of whom are downright silly are often taken at surface value and the themes especially regarding sexual dynamics are nothing new to cinema.Nevertheless 8 12 Women is a lovely surprisingly sincere and often humorous account of men women family selfidentity and the rewards of living out your fantasies along with their tempering costs.  Highly recommended for anyone who has been scared away by Greenaway's other films or for anyone else who truly enjoys the beauty found in strong women and faltering men.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being hissed at Cannes this film is still well worth seeing. I purchased the DVD and the more I watch it the better I like it. For a start as with all Greenaway's work since The Falls the photography is ravishing. I don't think anyone makes films which look better.What few have picked up on is that as well as an attempt to pick up Fellini's 8 12ball and run with it this is almost a remake of A Zed and Two Noughts. Both films study bizarre responses to bereavement. both films play on doubling in this case a father and son rather than two brothers. Both films touch on bestiality with animals called Hortense! gynecology sex with amputees a menagerie in this case of women rather than animals prostitution uses of light storytelling and the colours black and white.Where that film referenced painting this references performance in many guises  cinema kabuki crossdressing opera television prostitution as well as painting.Contrary to at least one other user comment there is no sexual intercourse shown in the film although there is a quantity of nudity. It's very odd if perhaps unsurprising that this film has been sold as a sexy movie. SexIST? Well confusing an ironic depiction of men's sexual fantasies with a reduction of women to the level of fantasy is 'politically correct' laziness at best. And as with most of Greenaway's films the women are the winners in the end.One reason this is harder work than the earlier film is the lack of Michael Nyman's ravishing music. I'm not sure why Greenaway stopped working with Nyman possibly he felt he was stuck in a rut  perhaps he was nettled by charges that any old footage looked like Greenaway if you played Nyman's music behind it. Either way he's yet to arrive at a truly satisfactory alternative. Here we have Slow Boat to China sung a capella by the two leads rather after the manner of Morecambe and Wise. It's quite funny but it's not the marriage of sound and image of earlier films.The extent to which Philip Emmenthal represents Greenaway himself is perhaps worth considering. A character makes reference to Fellini having Mastroianni make love to all the women Fellini couldn't and asks whether all directors make films to fulfil their own sexual fantasies. Emmenthal is notably the same age as Greenaway.He may not be sweeping the arthouse scene before him these days in fact there's not much of an arthouse scene left these days but in the end even belowpar Greenaway is better than 99 of directors can even aspire to.".

If you step into that universe and not like it you will most likely walk out never to return. But for us that love Greenaway's universe we will stay and make ourselves a pot of the strangest tea and drink it greedily.The plot revolves around an older man who had just lost his wife of many years and his son. They watch Fellini and decide to capture some woman to make a harem of their desires. Some women come there to satisfy a debt another comes of her own free will as long as they pay her 75000 a year. Each woman has an interesting back story. One is addicted to gambling one loves her horse one loves to have babies one is a nun one is a martyring maid one is in a wheelchair. Each of these woman could be a character from a Fellini film.The movie is filled with a lot of wit and irony once the women come to the house. The women start making demands and by the end the movie is dropped into a metaphoric and Shakespearian tragic end. I won't give any more details than that.The lighting mood and story of this movie is completely original. Some viewers might not like the frankness of the dialog andor the nudity of both sexes but I feel it ranks right up there with Greenway's other films like Tulse Luper Suitcases The Falls Zoo Drowning by Numbers etc. I heard it was a sexist movie but I have seen more sexism in slapstick comedies and films like In The Company of Men. I usually look for a good story and interesting characters be they flawed or not and 8 !2 Women delivers both. I wasn't bored for a second watching this.The director makes his own little world. It's an odd world and has different moral standards but that is part of its charm viewers tend to miss.".

And this is a film about women not sex which will frustrate others.Here is his most characterdriven film. At last he works on closeups and some character definition. The primary ordering of the film is by basic archetypes of women particularly archetypes drawn by men. This is supposed to be his most painterly film the representative women are to be presented in scenes that reference famous paintings. Greenaway has stated that painting cuts to the basic drivers in cultural revolution and the representations of women therein are tokens for everything conceived. Women thus are both humans and basic tokens in the redefinition of life.Such a rich conception is thoroughly Greenawayan and might have formed the skeleton for another masterpiece. Along the way we have by now familiar devices. Numbers random as in pachinko rather than ordered. Contrasts between Eastern here just Japanese and Western management of concept and image. Some slight use of layered images here in the selfreference of displaying the screenplay.My complaints are two. I consider them fatal but still celebrate Greenaway.The notion of archetype depends on clarity a natural orthogonality and completeness of classes. Here we have the nun whore Chinadoll servant cripple childbearer fetishist butch and spontaneous addict. Time is invested in defining these.

This film is supposed to reference the feminine archetype not as defined by popular culture but by the history of painting. My knowledge of the art is poor so I cannot attest to how deep the annotations are here. Little use is made here of the layered image and narrative comment.

	schema:reviewBody "Frederico Fellini's 8 12 is a movie this one is theoretically inspired by. There are consistent references to it in this film some subtle and some glaringly obvious. One should take this into account so that it will not hamper one's voluntary suspension of disbelief though this movie definitely stands on its own if the viewer has never seen 8 12.Voluntary is perhaps an inappropriate word. This movie takes disbelief which should certainly be present and suspends it for you in a most amusing way. The film may well attempt to say something deep about human nature and the interaction between a fickle heart which has lots of love to give and a bored brain with so many thoughts  but it doesn't say it so loud that you can't just sit back and enjoy the picture. Some scenes are funny to all some scenes may cause you to be the only hysterical person in the theater. In any case it's well worth the ticket or rental cost. Some male nudity is present though no more than the average British movie containing male nudity. No sex scenes are overly graphic though one should definitely have an open mind going into the movie in order to enjoy it. If you didn't feel a significant need to leave the theater during Gouttes d'eau sur pierres brlantes which I was last week you should be able to thoroughly enjoy this film.Lighting designers watch for the Kabuki scene it won awards in Europe and definitely looks very cool.".

	onyx:emotionText "Frederico Fellini's 8 12 is a movie this one is theoretically inspired by. There are consistent references to it in this film some subtle and some glaringly obvious. One should take this into account so that it will not hamper one's voluntary suspension of disbelief though this movie definitely stands on its own if the viewer has never seen 8 12.Voluntary is perhaps an inappropriate word. This movie takes disbelief which should certainly be present and suspends it for you in a most amusing way. The film may well attempt to say something deep about human nature and the interaction between a fickle heart which has lots of love to give and a bored brain with so many thoughts  but it doesn't say it so loud that you can't just sit back and enjoy the picture. Some scenes are funny to all some scenes may cause you to be the only hysterical person in the theater. In any case it's well worth the ticket or rental cost. Some male nudity is present though no more than the average British movie containing male nudity. No sex scenes are overly graphic though one should definitely have an open mind going into the movie in order to enjoy it. If you didn't feel a significant need to leave the theater during Gouttes d'eau sur pierres brlantes which I was last week you should be able to thoroughly enjoy this film.Lighting designers watch for the Kabuki scene it won awards in Europe and definitely looks very cool.";

With the exception of a couple of scenes the visual style of this film is stark and simple much like Drowning... and relied heavily on smart dialogue which at times got a bit over the top intellectually speaking but kept the film going.  I never got bored with it I never got too disgusted and even if I can't recommend it to most of the people I know I still feel it's a strong feature.Now even though this is Greenaway Lite it still isn't for people who didn't like any of his earlier films.

The characters are indeed to unnatural to empathize with and the movie will certainly stimulate your mind more than it will entertain you.....or arouse you sexually. The characters find themselves in a loosely connected stream of little scenes. Rather than making normal conversation everyone seems to say what they think in this stream of subconsciousness.Mr. Greenaway plays with all aspects of sex and connects these often in a disturbing manner with death religion procreation and age and gender roles. He jumps across the cultures and taboos of this globe. Of course you might be offended by the candid way in which these ideas are treated. However explicit scenes aren't shown.

Another one keeps getting pregnant. One falls off her horse. One has a huge pet pig. Storey and especially Philip have both found a new lease of life. There are plenty of nude bodies on show although hardly any sex. The two men continually talk about penises. Greenaway seems to have indulged himself in this film with sexual wallowing with plenty of talk about sex and nude bodies. But the film is not all that bad.

The end product feels more like someone who's got too much time on his hands and creates movies from whatever pops in his head than something that comes from the heart or mind. Few of the characters are interesting as people or as subjects for a movie.

The effect reminds me of nothing more than the collages of Tom Wesselman and to some extent the paintings of Sigmar Polke.  The interactions of the many layers is quite masterful  I especially like the way that everything including actors dialogue and plot are treated equally as texture.Each section of the film begins with a text overlay of the scene description from the script.  The full text is never on screen long enough to be read in its entirety.  This reinforces the sense of story and dialogue as texture... of text as texture.The 2nd third of the film moves away from the visual overload mode as the theme of collecting sexual fantasies represented by the women in the harem built by the Father and Son comes into focus.  It reminds me a bit of the collagenovels of Max Ernst in that it hangs a string of reveries on the framework of linear narrative... but the narrative is really just an excuse for manipulating images.The 3rd third becomes a bit turgid probably because the pattern of collecting women 12345678... has become obvious by this time.  In fact the film shows itself for what it really is.... a catalogue of desires. It is not particularly erotic though it represents a list of fantasies... whatever the subject is it still retains the character of a list.  This has the effect normalizing the erotic.  One no longer questions whether the pleasures depicted are normal or perverse... they all become equal... a decorative pattern.... in much the same way that the dialogue resembles a complex pattern more than it does naturalistic speech. In many ways it reminds me of De Sade's 120 days of Sodom an old Surrealist favorite which I also find to be as unerotic as a list.  As one of the characters in the film states it simply follows the fantasies to their logical conclusion.  It seems to be more of an intellectual exercise aimed at unshackling desire... it does not seem to be aimed at provoking desire in the viewer.There are however many poetic passages. During a scene in which one of the women is shaved bald the father and son pick up clumps of hair and attempt to describe the smellit smells like canaries...'like brown sugar taken out of a damp paper bag...  tc.The images are also poetic.  My favorite is a japanese woman clad in a very red kimono singing nasally in front of a very blue door  next to a very pink pig.The sons apparent ability to invoke earthquakes orgasms? is also an interesting poetic touch.".

Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of filmmaking the frame composition use of midshot the static camera. It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. Perhaps like that other innovator TS Eliot he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.Yet Greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor which is poised and logical so the joke is dead before it's delivered. The result is tedium if it's not funny it has failed ask a standup comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the wellread director could learn something from Freud on humor.Finally like Woody Allen Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. They speak the lines with a bored smug air like narcissistic adolescents.This film despite its design and lighting is meretricious.".

It's kind of a God I'm bored and I've got so much money and what the heck let's turn the Geneva mansion into a bordello a different woman in every room and Dad and I will have lots of fun and bond thing. I mean mom's gone now Dad and you never really got out and now it's time to live. So father and son go naked a lot with lots of babes who are also naked a lot.Matthew Delamere Storey is the son and John Standing Philip is the father. It's a bit creepy seeing them sharing the same bed naked. In fact it's a bit creepy seeing John Standing naked period. But that's part of the Greenaway intent. Let's shock the bourgeoisie. It's such fun to do stuff that will make them squirm.They hissed at Cannes when this was shown I understand I wasn't there. It was first released in the Czech Republic which says something but I'm not sure what. It was banned in Malaysiabut that's pretty standard. The women are bizarre but to be honest intriguing. The story isn't much of a story. The rationale for suddenly taking on the life of the libertine is slight Philip's wife dies and a bit late in the coming. And no pun intended.The story starts in Tokyo with Storey helping Simato a pachinko addict played by Annie Shizuka Inoh avoid financial trouble in exchange for sexual favors. But never mind. As I said the story doesn't matter. What matters is the outrageousness of the events mostly sexual and the beautiful sets. That's it. Most interesting thing in the film is Polly Walker who has both sex appeal and charisma. Most grotesque is that pig with its pinkish white skin so very human lookingand of course that was a sight joke and a comment upon humanity. But again never mind.By the way the 8 12 in the title is because Fellini's famous film somehow inspired Storey and Philip toward their debauchery.".

For the most part the reaction was positive and the jokes that failed miserably will probably get edited out by the time the movie officially opens.The movie was pretty sportscomedy formulaic with the downandout lovable losers getting a big chance then introducing a new character who will inspire them and a few montages later the big finale. The Rrating was used mainly on adding in lots of cusswords with mixed humorous results. There was a really funny joke about masturbation. I was hoping for a little more basketball craziness but oh well. The highlight of course was Will Ferrel meeting the 70s. I myself was not alive in the 70s so I only know about the culture through the discofunk lens of caricature cinema. Ferrel is one funky mofo so he thrives. I would say this was one of his better efforts topping Taladega nights Elf and the ice skating one. It's not as good as Anchorman mainly because it's just not as quotable. In short if you like Will Ferrel or 70s funk the soundtrack is hella dope see this movie.".

Other than a brief and nonnude sex scene there's nothing else at all that would've warranted its R rating. Maybe it was a marketing move thinking an R would get them more in the box office after all the hate for PG13  or maybe it's just annoying writing by Scot Armstrong whose only PG13 films School for Scoundrels and Starsky and Hutch are pretty awful.

	schema:reviewBody "SemiPro takes place in the 1970s and is all about a small time basketball team named the Flint Michigan Tropics. The head coach owner and promoter is Jackie Moon Will Ferrell and he and his team dream of expanding to be part of the big time NBA. However Jackie is told that in order to actually have a chance at getting into the NBA the Tropics have to get at least 2000 fans in their stadium by deadlines. The problem is that the Tropics do a little more dancing fighting and flailing around the court than actually playing the game. So Jackie hires a new team player named Monix Woody Harrelson who actually used to play for the NBA. From there on in it's up to Jackie Monix and the whole team to fire up some wild and crazy events for the crowd and actually learn to play the sport properly for once in order to reach their dreams.Will Ferrell has made a bunch of funny movies already. Whether it be Anchorman Talladega Nights Blades of Glory and Old School. I haven't seen all of them but I heard they were all funny mostly because of Will Ferrell's comedic brilliance. SemiPro is a funny film but it's really only semifunny whereas the rest of Ferrell's movies were hilarious romps. SemiPro seems undercooked in the hilarious gag department offering a few very funny moments but the rest of the movie only has little jokes that usually only offer giggles. My favorite moment in SemiPro is when Jackie Moon gets called on a foul by the ref Also the church priest and Jackie yells in his face an obscenity and I'll kill your family! Another scene that will end up a Will Ferrell classic is when he wrestles a bear and it ends up attacking him and then getting loose in the stadium.The music in SemiPro is awesome with its funky 70s soundtrack. There's also a song played through the movie sung by Jackie Moon called Love Me Sexy and it is as funny a song as Will Ferrell can bring. The rest of the cast includes Outkast's talented Andre Benjamin Maura Tierney and Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as two hilarious TV show hosts and broadcasters for the Tropics. Woody Harrelson does a fine job in SemiPro but he's never funny all because the script makes his character Monix serious instead of funny. Maura Tierney really just sits around without much to really do and even Andre Benjamin's character is made too serious to give us any laughs. I just don't understand why so many of the characters in SemiPro were so serious. This is a Will Ferrell comedy everyone should have some funny moments. This problem is what makes SemiPro a mixed bag because only half the movie is really very funny the rest of the movie is pulled down by far too much seriousness.Will Ferrell and the musical soundtrack are what elevate SemiPro to the point where I can recommend it. Will Ferrell is still a very funny guy and I'm sure he has a lot more hilarious comedies on the way in the mere future. But SemiPro pretty much gives Ferrell all the funny moments when his other movies like Anchorman gave the other characters classic moments as well. I give SemiPro a 2.5 out of 4 and a recommendation. It has its moments but is dragged down by far too many unfunny characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always find that Will Ferrell's films can be a little hit and miss. He's either funny or he tries a little too hard to be funny. Luckily in the case of 'SemiPro' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon  the owner coach and player of a low league basketball team who are about to get disbanded unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.For a start you don't have to know or like basketball. I know nothing about it but I enjoyed the film anyway. Yes Ferrell is a little over the top here and there but his performance never really borders on 'annoying.' It's not a long film only an hour and a half and most of it is packed with gags all pretty adult in nature and the majority of those work.There are minor plot lines but they're all secondary to Ferrell. Most other characters are only there to tee up Ferrell for him to deliver the punch line. Woody Harrelson is about the second most important character and he has a little more screen time. He's totally functional too but SemiPro is still Ferrell's baby.Basically SemiPro won't win any awards. It's daft loud and dumb but ultimately very watchable if you're in the mood for a film like that.Just beware of escaped bears!".

We go to see Ferrel display his antics after all. The best display of this is when Jackie Moon and some of his friends are playing a poker game. It has some of the fun ad libbed dialogue Ferrel's movies are known for and is one of those scenes you know will have outtakes on the DVD.The film's failure is it's plot. In a Will Ferrel movie Ferrel should be the center of attention yet as the plot moves forward that honor seems to pass to Woody Harrleson who's good in his role but doesn't supply the necessary humor the film needs. Meanwhile Ferrel is left with little to do except for some of the wacky bits like Ferrel wrestling a bear.So as the film progresses there is a feeling of the usual basketball film where the rag tag team tries their best to be successful. In all this the humor seems to be dissipating and the Ferrel machine seems to be running out of gas. Really a shame because the promotional materials for this movie were hilarious.".

About 10 mins in and I was the only one there. Awesome. Sadly about 5mins later two losers with no friends walked in making it a cosy cinema of 3.The film starts with a pregame intro of the Flint Tropics a struggling team in the former ABA basketball league. We learn from the get go that Jackie Moon Ferrell in a role not much of a stretch for him is the team owner promoter coach as well as a player. Jackie brought the team on the back of his onehit wonder Love Me Sexy and is in it just for the fame and fun. Before too long Jackie finds out his team will absorbed by the ABANBA merger...unless he can get them in the Top 4 teams. Jackie goes out and signs from a trade for a washing machine Monix played by formerly good actor Woody Harrelson in a minor attempt to tun things around. Soon he makes some other changes such as agreeing to let Monix become coach to get his team into the NBA. Will it work......? See it to find out.There's some more good quirky Ferrell humour but this isn't a classic. The story had a lot more potential but in some circumstances went too oddball and weird and missed some good opportunities probably largely due to the extra screen time given to Ferrell. Give him a few better support comedians and this could have been a classic. They missed some great opportunities with the basketball action too. One of the early scenes was gold.....but then after that very little was paid attention to.".

I'm very much not kidding this movie the theater was about 75 full and there was only two people who laughed even that was just a chuckle. I don't get what is so funny about making Will Ferrell puke in fact let's play on that joke quite a bit so it becomes more awkward. Let's also put in jokes that refer to the future since it's set in the 70's that'll be a blast. And also let's put in some extremely uncomfortable shots of Will Ferrell's crotch yeah that was so funny that I wanted to puke.Jackie Moon is a one hit wonder in the 70's but with the money he made off that he buys the Flint Tropical's a team that once was great but now stink. They have an opportunity though to go to the NBA if they can be one of the top four teams to win the games. With the help of a former champion basketball player Monix who has lost it basically they'll try to achieve the best by getting fourth place. Jackie comes up with some stupid publicity stunts to get an audience as well.SemiPro is seriously just stupid I'm not saying that because of Will Ferrell I just mean this film is very unfunny and the only part that made me laugh was the bear attacking Will Ferrell sad huh? I'm really not trying to be a hater on this film but how do people laugh at this junk? Will Ferrell plays the same character in each of his films doesn't anyone catch on?

	schema:reviewBody "In the opening of Director Kent Alterman's SemiPro Will Ferrell as 70's One Hit Wonder Jackie Moon provides his musical stylings of his song Do Me Sexy. Will Ferrell sings his disco song straight up in character and is hysterical. Although given the promising start Alterman and Writer Scot Armstrong's movie really falls flat despite some big laughs. I particularly cracked up at the halftime bit where Jackie dressed as 'Mr. Sun' and the rest of his Tropics teammates are dressed as sea creatures. Some of the supporting performances are pretty good including Woody Harrelson playing a quasirealistic Monix and Andre Benjamin as Tropics leading scorer Clarence Black. Will Ferrell is at his best playing obtuse lovable and arrogant Jackie. However the problem with SemiPro over the long haul all 90 minutes is that it is not smart stupidit is stupid stupid. I was really a fan of Blades of Glory and Talladega Nights. SemiPro is not nearly as funny as either. Understandably if you are not a fan of Big Will then disregard the previous and pretty much most of this comment. The ending of SemiPro is incongruously bittersweet. This seems so out of place. Then again arguing for context in SemiPro is futile.The premise of SemiPro is actually funny. Realize I am referring to the premise only. 70's disco star Jackie Moon Ferrell scores with his number one smash Do Me Sexy. He parlays his new found wealth by buying ABA Basketball Teamthe Flint Tropics. This vanity project also includes Jackie being the Tropics PlayerCoach. Having no basketball acumen as player or coach the Tropics reign the cellar of the division. Then the ABA Commissioner funny David Koechner announces that 4 ABA teams would merge with the NBA. Unfortunately that does not include the Tropics. However natural promoter Jackie convinces the ABA Commission that the 4 teams with the best records should be allowed to merge. Still the Tropics are not among the top 4 teams yet. In an edgy move Jackie trades the Team's ice machine for retired NBA player Monix solid Woody Harrelson. Monix had won an NBA Championship with the Celtics although he spent his time on the bench during the playoff run. Minor detail. All the narrative elements are poised. However SemiPro misfires on all cylinders. Granted there is a hilarious gag that runs a little long with Jackie wrestling a bear. One hysterical bit has Jackie conflicted as his Tropics lead an opponent however if they score more than 125 points it's free corn dog night. And Jackie doesn't have the corn dogs.It's too bad that SemiPro is not completely hysterical. Perhaps the Will Ferrell sports' farces have run their course. Maybe next time Will fares better with XGames or Extreme Fighting? Maybe.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a student I have always enjoyed Will Ferrell films. In fact I have walked out of some films still in stitches. I have really enjoyed Old School Anchorman and Kicking and Screaming as well as his Saturday Night Live DVDs. He does tend to play either the arrogant tool Ron Burgundy or the angry idiot Frank The Tank and he has done this well. I also enjoyed his other cameo roles in Zoolander and Wedding Crashers. However it seems that he is getting more disappointing nowadays which is a shame Talladega Nights a prime example.I watched SemiPro on a plane and I have to say it was funny I remember waking up four people laughing at the puke scene so much but I struggled to find any storyline to it. However I have never required a storyline with a Ferrell movie before.Set in the 70s Ferrell plays Jackie Moon a cross between Burgundy and Frank the Tank although not brilliant. He takes control of the Flint Tropics an allshow basketball team. He becomes coach owner choreographer and powerforward for his own team! When he discovers that only 4 teams will be merged into the NBA he decides that he is going to try and improve his teams fortunes to ensure they get into the NBA. Moon's only talent is promoting as seen by his corn dog night and when he wrestles a bear to increase struggling ticket prices. To get his team to the NBA from bottom of the ABA he enlists Ed Monix Woody Harrelson who tries to give some structure back to his team while rekindling an old flame.That is pretty much the story it doesn't really move as a plot but it is simply hilarious in parts. The funny parts include when Jackie Moon wrestles a bear an impromptu poker game between Jackie and his friends irrelevent to the plot but still funny! and plenty of decent oneliners.The main comic attraction is not Ferrell's anger or arrogance in character Like in previous movies but in the commentators of the game where Lou Redwood Will Arnett and Dick Pepperfield Andrew Daly are simply hilarious as a satire of sports commentators Redwood being the colourful claimshewasinVietnam tyro with lines such as I like to smoke when I drink after Pepperfield asks him if he wouldn't mind putting his cigarette out while supposedly commentating on a game. Pepperfield is the oldschool reassuring nice guy of commentating and nearly all the funny jokes are about his wife! Harrelson is good in his role of resurgent former great and brings a good edge to the film and Andre Benjamin is good as Clarence the only decent player for the Tropics. He is funny in places too.To summarise SemiPro is very funny in certain places vaguely interesting at points but is quite crude nonpurposeful nor thoughtprovoking. But I really enjoyed it it brightened my flight anyways! It is a shame that the only thing I can say about this is that it is funny and entertaining but I have come to expect that except for Blades of Glory this is the latest in a less enjoyable category of Ferrell films. I hope he creates something very good in the future but I wouldn't bet on it.If you like Will Ferrell you will like this if not make sure you have your pillow ready and are seated comfortably  It's going to be a long flight.".

	schema:headline " Just Another Sports Comedy with Too Little of Will Ferrell";
	schema:reviewBody "Will Ferrell's fourth and latest sports spoof comedy SemiPro 12 stars out of  is semidelusional. For the record it's not in the same league with his NASCAR comedy Talladega Nights. The former Saturday Night Live comedian stars here as oneshot disco music singer Jackie Moon who bought his hometown basketball team with the bucks that he earned from his Barry Whitestyle one hit wonder charttopping single Love Me Sexy. Not only does Jackie own the Tropics of Flint Michigan but he also plays on coaches and promotes the team! SemiPro takes place in the nonconformist 1970s and the fictional Tropics compete in the former reallife American Baseball Association 19671976 with its trademark red white  blue basketball and its 3point shot. Clearly this nostalgic occasionally amusing basketball farce aspired to be for hoops movies what the legendary Paul Newman classic Slapshot was for ice hockey and the Tom Berenger farce Major League was for baseball. Mind you the pranks the pratfalls and the humor are quintessential Will Ferrell when he is front and center but Ferrell isn't always front and center and the movie lacks the nonstop overthetop comic buffoonery of Talladega Nights. SemiPro devotes more time to sincerity than frivolity. Half of this dribbling comedy focuses on straight man Woody Harrelson. An aged NBA Boston Celtics champ Monix Woody Harrelson of White Men Can't Jump joins the team after Jackie trades the Tropics' ailing washing machine for him. As it turns out the ABA is tottering on its last legs and ABA Commissioner David Koechner of the far funnier sports spoof The Comebacks and the other team owners have struck a lucrative deal to have four of their teams absorbed into the NBA. The remaining teams including Jackie's Tropics are scheduled to disband. Jackie goes ballistic at this dire prospect. Somehow our hero with an Afro hairstyle convinces his fellow owners that only the best four teams should be absorbed. Actually this happened in reallife. Unfortunately Jackie later learns that each team must attract at least two thousand spectators for each home game. In an effort to improve the Tropics Jackie trades for Monix. Monix spent his championship season with the Celtics but he warmed the bench more often than shot hoops. Nevertheless Monix sincerely wants to turn the Tropics around and make them into winners. Anybody remember the warmhearting Gene Hackman movie The Hoosiers? Ultimately this last hurrah for the underdogs that must win a championship game is standard secondrate stuff that has been done too many times. Indeed SemiPro surpasses Kicking and Screaming Melinda and Melinda and Bewitched but that provides little consolation.An executive producer on Balls of Fury and Mr. Woodcock freshman director Ken Alterman and Old School scenarist Scot Armstrong slum for laughs in their raunchy foulmouthed Rrated 93 minute boysnightout bash. They have intrepid Jackie Moon pulling an idiotic Evel Knievelstyle ramp jump with roller skaters over his team's foxy string of cheerleaders strung out headtotoe on their backs across the court. Since the players cannot fight on the court during the game Jackie has his guys slug it out with the other team during commercial breaks. At one point Jackie promises to feed everybody at a home game a Corndog if the Tropics score over 125 points. They do and Jackie bails. Ultimately in an effort to sell out his stadium Jackie wrestles with a brown bear. Although the bear escapes the woodland beast becomes SemiPro's best running joke as it strikes without warning.Sadly Alterman and Armstrong treat Ferrell as if he were a guest star. SemiPro relies more on halfhearted sight gags and the suspenseful but formulaic biggametowin showdown than the inspired lunacy that is Will Ferrell. Unfortunately Ferrell shares the spotlight with Harrelson and Harrelson gets a subplot with an old girlfriend and a romance. Surprisingly SemiPro doesn't stoop to the standard kick in the groin for chuckles or any examples of juvenile bowel humor. The dumbest scene has Monix teaching the Tropics how to run a play until they puke. Incredibly Jackie has never puked in his entire life. Monix punches him in the belly and Jackie chucks everything but not on camera. Altogether this lukewarm sports comedy scores more chuckles than sensational sidesplitting laughs. Sure you'll smile and sputter but you won't be roaring at anything fresh or original.".

Big time producer first time director Kent Alterman and Old School writer Scot Anderson team up with Ferrell and for some reason play it safe. Very safe. So safe that there are only a few chuckles here and not a single laugh out loud moment.This movie is just not funny. And it has nothing to do with Ferrell going for another sportbased flick. The ABA and the 70's offer a vast array of topics and targets. Sadly most of those are ignored here. As Jackie Moon the one hit wonder from the music biz Ferrell acts as the owner coach player ringleader and promotional face of the Flint Tropics ... the worst team in the ABA. Sadly none of this matters because there are just no funny bits here.Andre Benjamin Woody Harrelson Maura Tierney and David Koechner all go through the motions of their lame dialogue. Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as the team radio announcers had my hopes up initially but alas turned out to be another onetrick pony. I felt most sorry for Patti LaBelle and Jackie Earle Haley who had to be humiliated to even read their lines.Nothing is more difficult than comedy and nothing is more pathetic than an unfunny comedy. The weak attempts at drama are always overshadowed by an over the top moment that falls flat ... a bear loose in the arena a tantrum in the league office disco dancing team dancers etc. The best two moments are the throwaway line about Henry Ford and the introduction of the Alley Oop ... straight from heaven.As if all this wasn't distressing enough before the film started we were treated to the trailer of Ferrell's next movie ... a reteaming with John C. Riley. When a comedy trailer has no laughs the hopes for the movie are extremely low. Maybe it is time for Ferrell to grow up and play other people's stuff ... he was great in Stranger Than Fiction. The money train is tough to jump from but one's dignity has to be worth something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Jackie Moon Will Ferrell is the owner promoter coach and star player of the Flint Michigan Tropics of the American Basketball Association ABA. In 1976 before the ABA collapses the National Basketball Association NBA plans to merge with the best teams of the ABA at the end of the season. Only the top four teams will make the move and the worst teams will fold. The Tropics are the worst team in the league and if they want to make it to the NBA Jackie Moon must rally his team and start winning. The only problem with that scenario is the fact that Jackie Moon is not really the coach and star basketball player he thinks he is. He was able to buy the Tropics franchise with proceeds that he had earned from his hit song Love Me Sexy. To keep his team from oblivion and leave his mark in the city Jackie Moon must inspire his team to win fourth place in the playoffs. Jackie trades a washing machine to another team for a former NBA benchwarmer Monix Woody Harrelson to reach his goal. This was Monix's last season before he retires and he wants to go out in a blaze of glory.My Comment The premise of this sportscomedy movie is loosely based on spoofing the old ABA basketball league. The story tells how the worst team in the ABA with a bench of down and out losers is given a second chance at winning the big game. Will Ferrell's character is the one who must inspire the team to reach inside themselves and go for the gold with the help of Woody Harrelson. Now this is the only part of the movie that tried to be above all the craziness and silliness of the rest of the movie. I knew from the movie trailers that this movie was not going to tax my brain and I was right. You will find yourself laughing at a number of comedy sightgag skits. There is a scene at the poker table where someone is called Jive Turkey and a gun it passed around and it's so funny because you just know that someone must dodge a bullet. Then there's the basketball court brawl during the TV commercial which is hilarious because it ends when they came back on the air! Don't go into the theater thinking you will see a great comedy because it is not but it is entertaining and that is all. There are some scenes that were put in for shock value that really didn't add anything and didn't need to be there. If you like Will Ferrell then it is OK to go see this movie if not see something else. New Line Cinema Run Time 130 Rated R310".

Dealing with an apathetic father who appears to have given up and a hostile sister who's not mature enough to be without guidance she finds a way to come to terms with the family tragedy and her own sense of loss and finds her strength and in doing so provides a focus for healing. The director's creativity was constrained by the industry to produce a film of 50 minutes and did a remarkable job of exploring the circumstances and personalities involved with surprising depth. All the actors did a great job of portraying their characters they were believable and it was possible to be empathetic even if they weren't the most likable groups of people you could meet. I rated it a 5 out of 5 in the audience survey and look forward to seeing it again.".

It was convincing and engaging from start to finish and managed which I was worried about to round itself off very well by the end.I watched it because of Emily Browning whose ethereal looks are just amazing. I'm sure she has a fabulous career ahead of her. In this film I thought she would be playing the lead character Claudia. After all Browning is 17 as Claudia seems to be. But Browning was the little sister Penny looking no older than 14 at most. After my initial disappointment at this I accepted Emma Lung's character and performance as very captivating and touching.It's basically a story about Australian white trash a poor family with depressed parents of which the mother killed herself a year earlier. So the father and his two teenage daughters try to get by all the while shouting at each other and being in a lot of emotional pain. Some local Christian dogooders want to relieve the father and help take care of the girls but they are politely told off hell they would have creeped me out too!  until another couple of young kids are parked in the family by a mother that can'twon't take care of them. These accidentally kill a beloved canary and so are promptly sent packing with the Christians which makes for an extremely funny scene. A while later they come back to perform Christian songs like trained monkeys...Of course that's just one subplot of several. I'm amazed how much ground was covered in less than an hour several times I thought the movie would have some kind of open ending that didn't actually finish the story. But it did come to a satisfying end where the father pulled himself together and starting to get things under control. I feel this film could easily be expanded to a feature length movie.For what it was  a slice of life tale from a tragedystruck dysfunctional family  Stranded was very well made. Kudos to all involved.8 out of 10.".

It has a really good story solid but it seems like its not going anywhere. Emma is Claudia the protagonist and she is the character we like and support the most. She is possibly the most sane actually doing something with her life. Emily is Penny her psychotic younger sister who needs to develop a brain.Emily looked really young in the film which I didn't like especially teamed with her smoking. I know she was messed up because of her mum but it seemed cheap.

Everyone smokes to seem hardcore but I thought it was just inappropriate.Really Aussie but if you like great thinking films or the gorgeous Emma Lung you'll love this!";

	schema:reviewBody "New Orleans started out as an Orson Welles project at RKO  a Louis Armstrong biopic with Armstrong playing himself  and it morphed through several different incarnations including a version by writer Valentine Davies that ultimately got filmed as Syncopation in 1942 before ending up with producer Jules Levey as the film we have. There's certainly a sense of mighthavebeen about this movie that was only accentuated in the early 1980's when an independent jazz reissue label called Legends released the surviving prerecordings made by Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday in October 1946 for use in the film  including a treasure trove of music that hadn't made it anywhere near the final cut  and the idea of basing a film about the history of jazz around a set of boring white characters and reducing the AfricanAmericans to extras in their own story is all too familiar in Hollywood's treatment of just about any story involving Africanbased politics or culture.Now for the good news within the horrible limits of the concept the script is relatively well constructed and Arthur Lubin's direction shows some visual imagination  notably in the opening tracking shot through the streets of backlot New Orleans before the camera enters Arturo de Cordova's cabaretcasino and discovers Louis Armstrong and his band playing West End Blues inexplicably renamed NameYourPoison Blues in the film. In her autobiography Lady Sings the Blues Billie Holiday vividly registered her disgust at being cast as a maid and in the scenes with Dorothy Patrick she's visibly stiff barely able to get the servile dialogue out of her mouth  but when she shows up at the cabaret set and gets to sing with Armstrong's band she visibly loosens up and becomes a relaxed and quite effective screen presence. My partner noted the similarities between New Orleans and the 1936 MGM film San Francisco  both are about gamblers who own night clubs and opera singers who climb down from their pedestals to perform popular music and the real closure of New Orleans' Storyville redlight district in 1917 fulfills the same climactic story function as the 1906 earthquake and fire did in San Francisco.The first time I saw any part of New Orleans was at a screening of jazz movies in 1970 at which the host presented three numbers from the film Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans? Where the Blues Were Born in New Orleans and Farewell to Storyville that had been blown up from 8 mm sound prints released for home sales in France. The host said that the rest of the film had been lost so it was quite surprising to me when I got to see the complete version twice in 1973 on an independent local TV station in the San Francisco Bay Area. Then I didn't see the film again until Kino released it on DVD and having got over my disappointment at what it could have been this time I could appreciate it for what it is a flawed movie with an almost unbearably pretentious ending but still a quite entertaining film as well as a chance to see Armstrong and Holiday at the peak of their powers. Woody Herman is hardly showcased to good effect even though he was leading perhaps the best band of his career the First Herd at the time. And I'm surprised the other commentator mentioning the greatest jazz movies left out my alltime favorite Clint Eastwood's Bird.".

The story and its treatment are reminiscent of the straight bits in Marx Brothers films the ones that had straight bits that is. But instead of Groucho and Harpo Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday do their stuff and bring the film to life.Plus points for jazz fans are that several of the numbers are seen and heard complete rather than faded out both Billie and Louis were still near their best the other musicians including Kid Ory and Barney Bigard get to solo and you hear  and see   an early version of the Armstrong AllStars really swinging. There's also a rare sight of the great and now disappeared Lucky Thompson behind Louis in one sequence.A personal note one of my very first records 78 rpm early 1950s was Louis' Where the Blues Was Born. I guess I had the studio not the soundtrack version but both are terrific.  It was amazing to SEE that longtreasured performance.New Orleans would not go down well with latterday jazz musicians because Billie's shown as a maid and Woody Herman white comes into the story for no earthly reason beyond the fact that he was a big name in 1947. But if you can see and hear past all that the music makes it worthwhile.OK it's not a good film.  But how many jazz films are? Jammin' the Blues Pete Kelly's Blues Sven Klang's Combo Round Midnight and that's it. Only three of those are featurelength and two are European.  For anyone who loves the music New Orleans is well worth viewing.".

However Nick Larocca and The original Dixieland Jazz Band actually preceded Armstrong's band but the great popularity of Dixieland music can arguably be credited to Armstrong and the musicians around him. Armstrong 46 is featured prominently here as both an actor and as a musician. The musical part of the story highlights the conflict between the old music and this new form Jazz that some many felt threatened by.The movie is set in 1917 right about the time that the 20year experiment of Storyville with its casinos and houses of prostitution came to an end as directed by the government. In this movie they even have a funeraltype Jazz parade as the Storyville residents move out. Just after that 1919 through 1922 is when the young Louis Armstrong began making his own mark in New Orleans and later in Chicago.All this history is the setting for a love story. Dorothy Patrick 25 plays Miralee Smith a soprano who moves with her mother to New Orleans from Maryland. She meets and falls for Nick Duquesne Arturo de Crdova 38 who was known as the King of Basin Street. Mother does not approve has other plans for her daughter. Nick leaves New Orleans goes to Chicago and eventually makes a name for himself running a coast to coast entertainment enterprise. Meanwhile Miralee is successfully touring the USA and Europe as a singer. And the Armstrong band is touring all over the world also.The movie has a happy ending as Miralee and Nick find each other again and musicians like Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman are winning over the crowds with this music.".

Seeing Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong on the screen together must have made it worth the price of admission for audiences at the time. Reviewers are right that most of the acting is on the bland side and there's a weird time warp with musicians playing their 30yearsyounger selves. It's like Paul McCartney in 1998 playing himself during his Beatles days. But the film has a surprising amount of atmosphere and some enjoyable surprises There are no villains for one thing All of the characters are surprisingly likable. For another all of the women are strongwilled decisive characters who know what they wanteven the cuddly blonde who plays the female lead. Considering the era when Rosie the Riveter was relentlessly being herded back to hearth and home and told to be a good little housewife and when almost the only strong female characters in American films were the evil seductresses of film noir it's nice to see a nice girl who has a career makes her own choices and makes the first move when she's interested in a man. Also while it may be sad to see Billie Holliday in a maid's uniform it's good to be able to see her at all and it's very good that those white characters attracted to Dixieland treat the black characters with respect. I also liked the scene where the heroine sang a Dixieland encore at a classical concert. Some of the audience walked out and some stayed to enjoy and applauda realistic and unshowy way to stage the scene.But it's the music of course that you'll remember from this film. There are some great numbers and they are given their full deserved attention without silly distractions.".

It surely is worth the time just to revel in the 1947 jazz. Bad acting doesn't destroy the movie. Wonder what happened to all those actors. It must have been the directing for all to be so bland. I think the attempt is to make this an epic picture showing the intrusion of jazz into classical music. The voice sync with the singer is also poor enough to be disturbing to the viewer. Dorothy Patrick is lovely but apparently not a singer. It's fun to see many old character actors that I knew by looks but couldn't remember their names.

	schema:reviewBody "Do not watch this movie in real time. Rather tape it or get the DVD so you can fast forward through every scene with just white people in it. That will leave you with about 15 minutes or so of performances by Louis Armstrong and his combo and Billie Holiday. Although heavily lipsynched they are still worth watching at least for historical interest especially the scenes with Billie and Louie performing together. Also Louie's personality and joy of performance still shine through and are genuine pleasures. The only other point of interest is Billie Holiday's 'performance' to be generous as an obsequious maid! It is the saddest spectacle ever offered up by American popular culture!!! True many great black performers had to humble themselves to get into the movies but Billie didn't need the movies and she was otherwise quite vocal about being nobody's fool except tragically her own. Watching her in these scenes I couldn't help but think about her criticism of Louie Armstrong Louie 'Tom's from the heart. Sad sad sad.

That will leave you with about 15 minutes or so of performances by Louis Armstrong and his combo and Billie Holiday. Although heavily lipsynched they are still worth watching at least for historical interest especially the scenes with Billie and Louie performing together. Also Louie's personality and joy of performance still shine through and are genuine pleasures. The only other point of interest is Billie Holiday's 'performance' to be generous as an obsequious maid! It is the saddest spectacle ever offered up by American popular culture!!! True many great black performers had to humble themselves to get into the movies but Billie didn't need the movies and she was otherwise quite vocal about being nobody's fool except tragically her own. Watching her in these scenes I couldn't help but think about her criticism of Louie Armstrong Louie 'Tom's from the heart. Sad sad sad.

We see him trying to outwit a gopher in the garden who in turn outwits Jerry trying to unplug the kitchen sink cope with too many family members in the bathroom and deal with an unattentive babysitter.  This is middleaged Jerry still zany but a responsible parent earning a good wage. Think Tim Allen on Home Improvement.  His wife is both beautiful and smart bringing the art of the housewife's budget duties to almost Wall Street levels.  A visit to his doctor reveals he is dying from heart problems. Jerry tells his wife and she suggests that he pretend to abandon the family and use his credit cards to travel around the world.  She assures him that his 150000 life insurance payoff to her would be protected because she can't be held for her husband's debt if he abandon's his family.  In addition she has put in ad in the paper stating she would no longer be liable for his debts and the doctor would testify that a dying man would be too distressed to make rational decisions.  Though the audience is signaled that the wife and doctor are scamming poor Jerry there is no ground work to suggest there was anything wrong with the marriage to warrant such evil action from his wife.  I was a little lost for words until I got used to the situation change.  I suppose modern audiences weaned on Pulp Fiction and Fargo would find this an asset.  After I accepted the new premise I enjoyed the rest of the film especially a fairly clever last twenty minutes.  Jerry Lewis'  performance is quite good balancing between drama and comedy.  The plot twists are just right to keep the audience interested. NonLewis fans might be surprised.".

The gallery is filled with interested witnesses.And then the patient is asked what happened. We don't see precisely what happened to him until much later but I will say the procedure is related to fishing hence the film's title.In flashbacks the story is told. Peter Ingersoll is an insurance agent who joins an emotionless dedicated group marching into work as if part of a military unit at precisely 9 AM. He has a Leave It to Beaver family living in a Leave It to Beaver house. Well not exactly. His kids treat him like a moron. Certainly not the impression one had of Ward.Peter does some work around the house and gets into the usual Jerry Lewis type messesa rodent in the garden a stopped up sink this gag is really funny. One gets the impression though that he's not really happy. For example though this film has a G rating we do get to see that Peter and Nancy have some ... trouble in the bedroom. Unlike Ward and June we can imagine where this couple's kids came from.Peter's good friend Scott is also his doctor. Scott tells Peter he has some sort of incurable condition that will give him only months to live though there are no obvious symptoms. Peter decides to enjoy what life he has left. And being an insurance man he has a great policy that will leave his wife secure after he dies. So Peter decides to run up 150000 in debt on a lavish roundtheworld fishing vacation figuring the creditors will not go after a grieving widow.There is a problem though which gives the film most of its comedy potential. I shouldn't give that away.Anyone looking for the zany Jerry Lewis style might be disappointed. The two gags early in the movie and a limbo dance in the Caribbean are about all the examples of the classic Lewis style until the movie's second half. Lewis does get to display more of his trademark behavior pretending to be Fred Dobbs in Europe. Still this is an entertaining and funny movie.Peter Lawford is very good. The other leading actors do a good job and there are some really silly scenes in Europe.The film got a G rating though it should be mentioned a couple is apparently naked in a hotel with the appropriate parts covered. But this could mean anythingright? Something similar happens with Peter and his wife. And of course there is slapstick violence. But nothing really makes this film out of bounds for most kids.I had a good time.".

His friend the doctor tells him he's dying of a heart defect and has only weeks to live. What does Jerry do? He agrees with his weeping wife that he'll live his last days to their fullest going on a solo fishing trip and living the good life until the inevitable end. He finances this last vacation with his wallet full of credit cards and why not? He won't be around when the bills arrive! This might be the film's one sly comment on the age of plastic debt and consumerist wet dreams. Maybe I'm being generous...Anyway Jerry eventually discovers his doctor pal was lying about the heart condition so he could get Jerry out of the picture and go after Jerry's wife. Did I mention said wife is conveniently secretly and implausibly in love and in league with said doctor? She is and if you're not laughing by now we've at least got one thing in common.I find Jerry Lewis' career ironic... or maybe infuriating. He endeared himself to the audience with a moronic persona and then revealed himself to be the most pretentious arrogant selfimportant artiste ever to grace the stage.Temporary rage aside I am a Jerry Lewis fan who could not find one great Jerry Lewis moment in this movie. Hook Line  Sinker stands as a bitter indictment of marriage and suburbia without any tensionrelieving laughs... it's a black comedy without the comedy. Jerry could do better and so can you. Pass and seek out his earlier funnier films The Bellboy The Errand Boy etc!GRADE C".

The fact that the scenario is routine stuff is just one problem but the screenwriter Rod Amateau and director George Marshall don't develop things in any truly interesting or funny ways and the whole story is mostly uninspired. There are some solid laughs at the outset as well as a pretty amusing punchline at the end but overall this is far from Jerry's best.Jerry gives it a reasonably good performance falling back on some classic Jerry zaniness. His heart attack is hilariously stupid and when he's required to play the role of an Australian character it's real eyerolling stuff. He gets decent support from Lawford and the gorgeous Anne Francis as Peters' homemaker wife. Jennifer Edwards daughter of filmmaker Blake Edwards and Jimmy Miller play Peters' kids and there is a brief role for Jerry's longtime repertory player Kathleen Freeman as an inattentive babysitter.This delivers some laughs and has a fairly bright wrapup but there are no genuine comedy fireworks to speak of.Five out of 10.".

The film became a huge hit at Sundance and is now widely and justly considered one of the best independent movies of all time.The plot is quite easy to sum up nothing happens. It's just a regular day in the lives of a few people working in or outside a Quick Stop convenience store. The fun starts immediately as Dante Hicks Brian O'Halloran is asked to replace a sick colleague. This upsets him a lot since it's supposed to be his day off You know what the worst part is? I'm not even supposed to BE here today!. So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves Jeff Anderson who works in the video store next to Quick Stop. Together they discuss things like hermaphroditic porn or Tarantinostyle which Star Wars sequel is better Jedi or Empire? and also try to find ways of not working or at least make the day less boring as Randal puts itThis job would be great if it wasn't for the fking customers. Between these discussions they also interact with Dante's present girlfriend Veronica whose sex life causes heated debates and ex Caitlin who's apparently engaged to some Asian design major. And let's not forget Jay Jason Mewes and Silent Bob Smith himself two drug dealers consistently located outside the store.Smith uses these characters to reference his favorite movies the previously mentioned Star Wars as well as Jaws and Indiana Jones and talk about any subject in the filthiest way imaginable. Some incredibly outrageous stuff is mentioned jizz moppers necrophilia snowballing but unlike John Waters he never shows the events discussed by Dante Randal et al. Everything occurs or has occurred offscreen so all we get to do is have a good laugh because no matter how crude it gets the film is rated R for Extensive Use Of Extremely Explicit SexRelated Dialogue Smith's writing remains genuinely funny. Randal in particular steals every scene with his existential musings I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule. or very politically incorrect antics the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby.If you haven't seen it yet do it and fast Clerks fully deserves its cult status.

	schema:headline " An honest and humorous film";
	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen American Pie and think of it as being honest and real about sex and the way kids talk then Clerks is right up your alley.  I don't think a movie has pleasantly shocked me more than this one has.  And make no mistake about it this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.By now we've all heard the story of how Kevin Smith somehow scrounged up 27000 to piece this rag tag film together.  It was at a film festival and some film executive saw it and offered him a generous amount of money. They fixed it up and before you know it we have the best indie film ever made. Kevin Smith is now a recognizable name in Hollywood and that alone should make you want to see this film.Dante and Randal are best friends.  They work at a small convenience store and a crappy little video store respectively.  As a matter a fact the video store is so inept that Randall actually goes to one of the bigger video stores in town to rent his movies.  Anyway Dante is obsessed with his exgirlfriend that cheated on him and he has a present girlfriend that is wonderful to him.  That is the basic premise for the movie.  And that is all you need to know about the plot.  Because what the film is really about is how these characters really talk to each other.  It is a bunch of clever anecdotes pieced together hilariously to form a movie.  But some of the scenes are just so damn funny that Clerks stays with you for a long long time.Take for instance a scene where Dante and his girlfriend are discussing the various responsibilities of a man and a woman in sex.  Each has an obvious gender biased view of the act but listen to how honest it is written it gives meaning and much hilarity to the scene.  From here the two end up discussing how many people the other has slept with.  And we all know that is an absolute no no in relationships.  Because no matter how many or how little the number is it is too much.  But that would be too easy for Smith to end it at that.  No he takes it a step further.  From here Veronica  the girlfriend  explains that she has only slept with X amount of guys but she has gone down on 36 others.  Dante is mortified.  How can she do that? And she explains that when she does it it means more than when she goes down and that is supposed to make him feel better.  It of course doesn't and the pay off in the scene is brilliant as Veronica is walking back to her car.  And that is just one of the scenes that makes the film work.  There are dozens of other scenes similar in nature that are so humourous yet painfully honest that you laugh but when the giggles subside you realize that it is so true.The obvious strength of this film is the writing.  But beyond that Smith establishes himself as a director that can get a performance out of his actors.  Almost every major character in here is so well done that you think they had 20 attempts to get it perfect instead of the 3 or 4 that the budget would allow.  Dante is well played by O'Halloran but it is Anderson as Randle that I think steels the picture.  He is so honest and natural in every scene that he is in that it actually bothers me that he has not established himself in the game.  Is it because no one wants to give him a role or is it that he has no interest in movies?  I don't know I just wish he was around again because he is electric.Jay and Silent Bob are funny as well and Bob provides the film with one of the funnier moments as he dances out of nowhere and then he shocks us with his only line of the film.  And what he says may as well be Socrates talking and not a simple street hood.  It really works.I love Clerks.  It is such a fun movie and if you haven't seen this gem check it out.  Like it for the funny film that it is but love it for whats behind it.This film has heart.  And Smith is an inspiration to anyone that wants to do what he did.  After all he proves that nothing is impossible.  He is living proof of that.".

It's poorly done it's monochromatic which actually works to its advantage it's cheap but it's funny and that's all that really counts. The story is more than I thought it would be and it's continuously funny throughout the whole short runtime.

His friend Randal Jeff Anderson works next door at a video store but sporadically closes it to hang out at the Quick Stop. Throughout the day various things occur such as a gum representative trying to get people to stop smoking and chew his gum a rabbi using the employee's bathroom with an unexpected twist at the end disrupting a wake and the nowclassic scene at the video store with Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.This movie has nonstop humor going for it. Whether it's Dante's or Randal's confrontations with the unruly customers who seem overthetop yet regular their conversations about nothing especially Star Wars or their departures from their respective stores to play hockey or whatnot. I can see that Clerks. is to minimum wage earners as Office Space is to office workers. Dante's always a little timid when it comes to dealing with the unruly customers but when Randal takes the stage it's a lot funnier.Although the parts about Veronica Marilyn Ghigliotti and Cairlin Lisa Spoonhauer weren't that interesting except for the 36...make that 37 people they were necessary and seemed to create a plot out of this basically sketch comedy. It succeeded and turned it into a great all around film. Most of these people had never acted before and although it does seem like they're just reciting their lines there's almost no break in between the dialogue they do a good job at it. Sometimes it seems a little too scripted for voice and diction etc. but for a bunch of firsttimers it's not bad at all.Considering the rest of the series besides Mallrats which I haven't seen I'd say Clerks. is close with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back for the funniest Kevin Smith movie. They're also the two crudest and the first and last in the series respectively. But Clerks. will always stay as it was when it was released 10 years agorevolutionary. It showed that money and action aren't important to make a movie funny.My rating 810Rated R for extensive use of extremely explicit sexrelated dialogue.".

The motifs and character development were both wonderfully crafted. Kevin Smith showed no signs of struggle in his directorial debut. Fittingly he was also able to deliver one of the best lines of the film they are a lot of beautiful girls out there dude but not all of them bring you lasagna most of them just cheat on you. It was Silent Bob's only line of the movie and it was a doozy. It caused Dante to have a revelation at least he thought that he did I thought that it was only momentary likely to fade quickly.Although the movie itself was saturated in comedy it held a semiserious tone throughout. Both of the clerks are intelligent and seemingly capable of holding far more prestigious jobs. Dante is frustrated by his place and life but places the blame on anyone but himself refusing to accept responsibility for his problems. Randal has underachieved not because he blames other but because he is easily content. He would rather hold a job with no responsibility than assume a hapless position in which he is ruled by a condescending and controlling boss.Smith introduces an interesting take on the different personalities that lead the 2 friends to similar places in life. Randal has a more enlightened perspective on life that allows him to be happy and it is his insight that eventually helps Dante see things more clearly. The final conversation indicates that both friends are capable of achieving higher in life and they can help each other to do so.".

The dialogue was delivered so mechanical most times it seemed like the actors were reading directly from cue cards.Secondly this movie had no direction. Where was this movie going? Again maybe I missed the intent but was it just to capture the dull and pathetic life of a clerk and those around him? I don't expect every movie to have a mighty and life altering message but at least have a loftier aim than go to work have a screwed up day and go home.Finally there was entirely too much profanity. It was to the degree that it had no more impact. If vulgarity is going to be used then using it sparingly can make it funnier and have more of an impact on the script. The flagrant use of profanity in this movie just made the movie juvenile and childish.Overall the movie just didn't move me. I laughed very little there was nothing to think about and there were no magnificent or even decent performances. I did like one scene though and that was the different take on The Return of the Jedi. I thought that was an interesting and funny take on the movie but I also think thatthat could have been done in a short film. Cut this movie down to a five minute short film about the innocent independent contractors on the Death Star and the movie is a lot better in my opinion.".

However when you see his later films you can't help but notice that he got better as he went on.  The basics are all there  the pop culture dialogue the quick rude wit the movie obsession etc. however he lacks a certain structure and he hasn't yet realised the strength of his other characters.The lack of structure is OK since this is an indie movie  but watching it now I wanted less crudity and more humour.  I also wanted more of Jay and Bob but only because of how they were used in other films.  It's unfair to judge this by later standards.  I first saw this in 95 in the cinema and laughed to death but seeing it 7 years on it was not quite as funny.However the film is still very good and the weaknesses can all be explained by the budget.  The whole thing is shot at night due to the shop being open during the day but the external shots and the explanation of the shutters make it unnoticeable.  The weakness in the cast is understandable but it tends to make the dialogue slightly more believable.  Fans of Jay and Bob will be disappointed with their input if you're watching this after watching Smith's other films.Overall this is very crude and very funny.  The weaknesses can be put down to the budget but this should be enjoyed as Smith marking out his territory and moving from nothing into the big time.".

Seriously if this film is entertaining to you all I can say is you have had the bar set so low in your life that it is unlikely anything good will ever come out of it save being really good at Limbo. I have read here many people praise this film for its brilliant script. All I can say about that is Don't Bogart that joint my friend! To the sober minded the script is simply stupid. In one scene dope dealer Jay sets clerk Dante straight with a diatribe about how selling soda for 78 cents more than a supermarket is tantamount to pushing drugs. Excellent point ... DUDE WHO SMOKED THE LAST OF MY 'METH?! If this script speaks to you all I can say is stay away from neighborhood dogs.Forget the horrendous acting forget the crappy camera work the unintelligible dialogue the murky sound work the fact that it didn't really have a plot of any kind forget even that all of this is agreed upon by even the fans of this film in other words forget the fact that this is a crappy film can anyone quote me any memorable lines that a person over the age of 12 would find interesting let alone brilliant? The script is pedestrian at best. Some have praised this film as being one of the funniest of the 90's. I suppose if you consider predictable bathroom humor and dick jokes delivered with the finesse of an drunk uncle funny then this is a masterpiece. I found it pathetic. I don't mind crude comedy if it is done well as in Animal House Caddyshack Bevis and Butthead et. al. this film has none of that. It is hack. Bevis and Butthead mocked the idiots they portrayed this film celebrates them. The slight very slight I never laughed once amount of comedy provided by Jay and Silent Bob and sometimes Randal are never enough to save the movie let alone their scenes and even these are presented with such stumbling insecurity it feels like watching a really bad stand up on amateur night at The Apollo. In that regard one might say a joke or two were kind of funny but how could you say that amateur had one of the best sets you have ever seen? Looking over the user comments here on the IMDb it appears many of the fans of this film do not have the capacity to do anything other than presume those who didn't like the film just didn't get it. I got it you are the one who does not get it. Unfortunately by the time you realize that you will be sucked so far into the vortex of the downward spiral you call your life you will be doomed to emulate the losers of this film. From the generation that made popular Jerry Springer eating vomitous putrefactions for a prize and wearing pants around your thighs comes the hallmark movie for losers Clerks.

But the fact of the matter is that it all looks really quite foolish if this movie hadn't been hyped so much it would be the flick that if Smith showed it to his friends they'd point and laugh AT it instead of with it. Nothing here works right. Several attempts at romantic subplots just don't seem convincing because they don't sound real at all. Smith apparently has some philosophy that apparently all women are sluts or sexually maladjusted. The nonstory isn't very compelling because Dante and Randal our resident leads repeat what has happened over and over and over again just in case we might have missed the nothing we've been watching. Another way Smith shows arrested development is that frankly the guy has some weird animal views a cat is shown in a litter box for absolutely no reason aside from pleasing the stoners and a dog is shown drinking from a toilet. This sort of scatology made me want to stop the tape twice but I was sure with the reputation this has something smart has to happen. I have heard so much about this movie's intelligent dialogue. I'm sorry I've read wittier stuff in bathroom stalls. It isn't very natural sounding when characters break out in prepared monologues and how several characters speak exactly the same.

Clerks is not worth the hype it receives but it most certainly deserves everyone's respect.After hearing for ages that Clerks is an amazing movie and it's one of the funniest movies out there and with the recent release of Clerks II I decided to check Clerks out. I was let down to say the least. It was slow moving even boring in parts. I didn't find it nearly as funny as I heard it was. There were only three points in the movie where I laughed hard. Through the rest of the movie I just kind of chuckled. I chuckled because the entire concept of the movie was amusing. Two clerks that talk and act like the smartest people in the world when really why are they working at a convenience store? The reason I said you need to respect this movie is because Kevin Smith and all the people involved are nobodies just a bunch of friends who got together with 20800 and a camera and shot a cheap movie that became a cult classic.Clerks wasn't the great film I heard it was but it certainly shot Kevin Smith into super stardom and the New Jersey films he's made since have gotten better due to this experience. Clerks got a few chuckles out of me and it had some classic dialogue but overall it was a little dull. I recommend that anyone who likes the other New Jersey films views this one first.6.510".

He constantly second guesses himself and compares himself to the ever popular Cassidy at every turn. As you can imagine he grudgingly gains the respect of the team while making these life or death decisions.The support cast is reliable  even talented. Unavoidably for the genre we have the guy from Brooklyn  in this case Canarsie  played believably for a change by Harvey Lembeck. Not once did I hear him say the word goil. Dana Andrews plays a veteran CPO who identifies too well with his crew and resents the skipper. Gary Merrill does a very credible job as the captain of the transport ship that delivers the UDT crew to their targets.A couple of things caught my attention. Although this movie was produced in 1951 it depicts what amounts to an experimental unit developed in WW2. I couldn't help but notice how primitive the operations were back then. No underwater breathing gear no communications once they were in the water simple slates and pencils to record the details of their mission. As a launch brought them into target range they would jump into a rubber boat then roll off into the water. Worse yet at their pick up point they had to tread water raise their hand and wait like sitting ducks to be pulled back into the rubber boat at speed.This is not a silly movie. It celebrates the courage of men doing a very dangerous job under impossible conditions. There are a few clichs here but nothing we can't overlook. A good action adventure flick well worth watching.".

What you get is I'm guessing a pretty accurate representation of naval special forces in WWII and it is quite interesting to watch how a team would covertly get in and out of shallow water near a beach to plant explosives and do recon while being heavily shelled often with nothing on them besides swim trunks flippers and goggles! There are also a few very good tense scenes. the scene where their explosives expert has to disarm a torpedo with a tongue depressor is particularly nice expresses all the emotion and tension of such a moment without forcing it with a dramatic score.Recommended to anyone interested in war history or who enjoys a nicely crafted war movie.".

The supporting cast is led by Gary Merrill acting as more or less the voice of conscience and Jeffrey Hunter as a brash young member of the team also appearing in unbilled roles are subsequent favorite character actors James Gregory and Jack Warden.";

	schema:headline " Decent naval procedural with familiar faces.";
	schema:reviewBody "What was probably a rather revelatory naval film in 1951 is a bit ordinary by today's standards though it is still worth a viewing especially for fans of Widmark. Here he plays the newlyassigned commander of an underwater diving team during WWII who is charged with the demolition of a Pacific island's shore defenses. Widmark is not popular among his men because he's replacing a beloved but now deceased predecessor. He loses even more points when he neglects to take time to memorialize even more recently killed seamen. Andrews is his chief antagonist while Merrill is the evenkeeled voice of reason advising Widmark through the choppy waters of command. There are many shots filmed underwater in what was then quite a novelty. Today this footage looks pretty murky though it's not altogether terrible. A few tense situations unfold as Widmark and his frogmen dive and plant explosives etc... One neat aspect is the showing of how the UDT now morphed into Navy Seals disembark and reboard the boats that transport them. Splitsecond timing was required. Widmark or more likely his stunt double does have the unfortunate distinction of being pulled back onto the craft at high speed and having his white jock dart out from the underside of the black trunks he is wearing! Not a particularly dignified reentry but at least he was saved. Widmark always an intriguing screen presence does a nice job in the film balancing toughness with sensitivity. Andrews is less impressive seemingly walking through the thing at times. Merrill is pretty inactive always sitting lying down or smoking an everpresent pipe but he lends solid support. One real asset is the appealing and attractive Hunter who is especially sympathetic during the climax when he is threatened with drowning or worse. The cast is filled with thenupandcoming actors who would later gain somewhat greater fame. Stevens Lembeck Gregory and Warden all have at least one moment to register. Fans of sixthbilled Wagner however will be greatly greatly disappointed. He's barely visible at all and has one line Aye aye sir. The later Creature From the Black Lagoon would up the ante on underwater cinematography in 3D no less! along with other subsequent films but this one was one of the earliest.".

This film has a lot to say about dedication and hard work learning the art of war. As John Wayne once said in Sands of Iwo Jima about the learning of the proper procedures of how to fight a war because if we don't do it right a whole lot of men don't walk away from it forevermore they don't. As has been said this is the precursor to the modern day Seals. Sure I know they are tougher men today but in my estimation not any more honorable and dedicated than the men portrayed in this great film.The acting is outstanding and very real especially to be so good that an old man like myself remembers how I felt all the times I saw the film. If a film and the men involved in telling the tale of The Frogmen left that much impression and remembered to this day then it had to be great acting direction and favorably produced. There was no outlandish computer graphic techniques of today nor scenes of blowing up the world that come so common place in todays action genra films but a reason and purpose for the gritty life and death struggle each man faced to become a frogman in the U. S. Navy or UDT Underwater Demolition Teams as they were and are called.This black and white picture was dominated by the snarling Richard Widmark in perhaps his best performance in his career. I know many remember him for other films but to me he made this film and was the quintessential commander training his men to do a very difficult job with nothing more than shear strength of character and leadership. They did not have the high tech apparatus of todays Seals but for what they lacked in equipment they more than made up for in guts and glory beneath the waters.The rest of the cast Dana Andrews Gary Merrill Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner just to name a few seemed to be portraying what is best in the Navy and men of war. Several more gave memorable performances in telling the tale of The Frogmen and the U. S. Navy's dedication to the finest in warfare.The standard war movie is one thing but this is a classic not seen much today and one in which many that followed learned by this tale of the U. S. Navy.".

That meant going in ahead of the Marines as the Frogmen point out. Today that function is now that of the Navy Seals.The plot is similar to Flying Leathernecks. Richard Widmark is the new commanding officer of the team assigned to Gary Merrill's ship and he's taking the place of a popular commander who was recently killed. He meets with a lot of resentment from the men some of that resentment fueled by Dana Andrews who is the CPO of the team and very popular also with the crew. How Widmark and Andrews deal with their personal issues as well as get the job done is the basis of the film.Nice underwater photography highlights the dangerous mission of these men. Both Widmark and Andrews despite their differences do get their assignments accomplished not always in the most expeditious manner. These guys and their team are professionals in the real and the cinematic sense.War films usually aren't chick flicks but I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of female fans saw this one for a glimpse of some 20th Century Fox's top young talent topless like Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter.

How dangerous it was and how they actually performed it was truly interesting for history buffs like myself. Seeing them often diving with no real equipment such as snorkels or tanks these were only used late in the film and simply freediving to set demolition charges is pretty amazing. What was more amazing was seeing how they picked up these guys on the fly so to speak.Apart from the technical aspects of the film the plot itself is somewhat formulaic but interesting. Richard Widmark plays the typical hardasnails commanding officer and naturally the men miss their old C.O. since he was one of the boys see THE FLYING LEATHERNECKS and TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH and you'll see what I mean. The whole loneliness at the top angle has been done many times before though this one was played a bit better. Having such pros as Dana Andrews Jeffrey Hunter and Gary Merrill on hand sure didn't hurt! What did hurt however with the formula was that at times it made the men seem like whiners.Overall rather exciting and well worth seeing despite its roots in Hollywood formula and a fitting tribute to some incredibly brave men.".

Also the story is simply not interesting though it has a few intriguing moments and the climax is sleepy and trite. On top of that the underwater sequences are not impressive. But the biggest disgrace in this movie is the publicity stunt that was pulled for Robert Wagner. In the opening credits of this movie Wagner is billed fifth with his name in huge letters but he appears literally in no more than five seconds of the movie has no lines and can only be seen at a distance. Apparently when this movie was made he was nothing but by the time it was released he attained some popularity so the company pulled a fast one on the young girls who hoped to see him in this movie. Years ago I noticed that a similar stunt was pulled for Wagner for the 1950 film Halls of Montezuma but to a lesser extent.".

Plot finds Widmark as a strict disciplinarian who takes command of the Navy Underwater Demolition Team and quickly upsets the men with his forceful ways. With the team building up to a crucial mission the question is if the men and commander can find an accord for the war effort?Like the men at the film's heart this is a sturdy war film that's for those who don't mind the focus being more on characterisations than action.

Plot finds Widmark as a strict disciplinarian who takes command of the Navy Underwater Demolition Team and quickly upsets the men with his forceful ways. With the team building up to a crucial mission the question is if the men and commander can find an accord for the war effort?Like the men at the film's heart this is a sturdy war film that's for those who don't mind the focus being more on characterisations than action. The sets and construction of certain scenes show their age but the underwater filming is neat and the strong cast keep the viewer engaged enough till the big mission arrives.

	schema:reviewBody "This Second World War drama follows a US Navy Underwater Demolition Team as it takes part in preparations for the invasion of Japanese occupied islands and comes to terms with the replacement of a popular leader who was killed in action. Form the way they talk it is clear that there former CO was very much one of the men but his replacement Lt. Cmdr. John Lawrence is very much a by the book officer. The men's opinion of him gets even worse when he orders his boat back to the ship after their second boat is destroyed leaving the survivors to wait for the rescue boat is reasoning may have been militarily correct but it was unpopular enough to have three men request a transfer. It isn't long before everyman in the team wants out. Luckily for him an opportunity arises for him to demonstrate his courage and win the respect of his men before he must lead them on a top secret mission to attack Japanese submarine pens.This is a solid film with decent action a good cast and an interesting story to tell. It may be a fictional story but it nicely demonstrates the sort of work the Underwater Demolition Teams would have done without being gungho about it. The cast did a fin job most notably Richard Widmark who put in a nicely understated performance as Lt. Cmdr. Lawrence a character who wanted to do the right thing and respected his men even when he knew they didn't have such an opinion of him. The action looked believable the underwater scenes especially so. The fact that it was filmed in black and white somehow gives it a more realistic feel... presumably because the vast majority of archive footage of the war was in black and white! The tension in the unit was there to add to the drama and it did so in a believable way the men might not have liked Lawrence but they didn't do anything unrealistic about it just griped a bit and got on with the job. We don't see much of the Japanese but when we do it was refreshing to see them depicted as ordinary soldiers sharing a cigarette rather than as 'the evil enemy'. If you enjoy films about the second World War I'd certainly recommend this as it shows the sort of operations not usually depicted in films in a fascinating way.".

SCUBA gear was still a novelty at the time. The production had the cooperation of the U. S. Navy and why not? It's basically a promotional film. The large ship on which the team is berthed in an APD a fast transport. Proper protocol is usually followed. When a man receives an order on the radio he doesn't say Roger. Over and out.

	schema:reviewBody "Billed as 'the untold story of Uncle Sam's underwater commandos' Action in the North Atlantic director Lloyd Bacon's The Frogmen concerns the daring exploits of the U.S. Navy's Underwater Demolition Team U.D.T. during the twilight of World War II. This thoroughly routine secret mission fodder casts Richard Widmark as Lieutenant Commander John Lawrence the new kid commander on the block and depicts his efforts to win the respect of his fellow frogmen. If you've seen another Twentieth Century Fox classic Twelve O'Clock High The Frogmen is somewhat reminiscent of it as well as The Flying Leathernecks. It seems that the guys revered their former commander Mr. Cassidy who died in the line of duty and have a difficult time accepting Lawrence as his replacement. Cassidy was a favorite about the men but Lawrence does nothing but antagonize them. At one point everybody on the UDT team requests a transfer out. For the record The Frogmen is a movie for guys because there are no women in cast and virtually all the action happens at sea.The action transpires for the most part aboard a navy ship as our heroes are called upon to survey beachheads for future assaults and later blowup a Japanese submarine pen. Bacon and So Dear to My Heart scenarist John Tucker Battle don't exactly have much to work with here and there is only the barest reference to the time frame during which these adventures occur. Presumably since they mention Iwo Jima everything in The Frogmen takes place afterward as America considered invading Japan. The ship's captain Lieutenant Commander Pete Vincent Gary Merrill of Twelve O'Clock High offers the green skipper advice such as holding a funeral service after several men in his command die when their boat receives a direct hit. Lawrence has to contend with thickskulled personnel  like Chief Jake Flannigan Dana Andrews of The OxBow Incident and Pappy Jeffrey Hunter of The Searchers when they jeopardize their lives playing a prank to get back at the Marines. Pappy has a 50 dollar bet that the Marines will wade ashore and see a banner that Flannigan and he stake out on the beach welcoming the jarheads. On the way back Pappy catches a couple of bullets near the spine and has to be laid up in traction. Of course the team will eventually accept Lawrence as one of their own but not under this 96minute black  white epic is almost finished. One scene that generates some suspense occurs when a Japanese torpedo penetrates the hull of Vincent's ship and Lawrence has to disarm it. Complicating matters considerably is the presence of the torpedo in the same room where Pappy is strung up with counterweights until they can reach the surgeons at Pearl Harbor. Lawrence has the task of disarming the torpedo. The grand finale at a Japanese submarine pen is the only time that we see the soldiers of the Rising Sun. There is a brief underwater struggle with Japanese divers before everything goes up. Nothing disparaging is ever mentioned about the Japanese enemy and they seem largely benign and pose little threat. Essentially this is a traditional World War II opus where the men change their haughty attitude of dislike for their commander into one of adulation. However at no time do they advocate killing him. The underwater photography looks good but the suspense comes up short. Mind you Bacon and company don't spout the war clich that on the basis of a single mission hangs the fate of the war. Altogether The Frogmen qualifies as tolerable.".

What a spoilsport! No fun that guy so they collectively ask for transfer. In the middle of a war? These guys sure have their priorities mixed up. It might have made more sense to have had Dana Andrews and Richard Widmark switch roles. Why use a volatile actor like Widmark and a laconic performer like Andrews and not let them play to their strengths? To see Widmark do one of his famous tantrums would have made it worth watching now it's just a waste of time and talent.".

What a spoilsport! No fun that guy so they collectively ask for transfer. In the middle of a war? These guys sure have their priorities mixed up. It might have made more sense to have had Dana Andrews and Richard Widmark switch roles. Why use a volatile actor like Widmark and a laconic performer like Andrews and not let them play to their strengths? To see Widmark do one of his famous tantrums would have made it worth watching now it's just a waste of time and talent.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone one theme that crops up again and again is a strong antiwar sentiment and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and despite coming before what is considered his classic period it is one of his best.In contrast to his previous picture The Killing a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick's other war film Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers' headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The prerecorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou there isn't a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving and the final moments in the soldier's bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions.".

By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavilyfortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general played by George Macready believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their courtmartial.The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.Looking at this film in perspective it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the illfated charge. Ralph Meeker Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film 'The Shining' playing the bartender.You can take your pick 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all or one of the great antiwar films or as one of Kubrick's best.

The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer antiwar film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the real enemy. Therefore the significance of the film lay not so much in its antiwar message but in its brilliant expose of the monsters within the general staff superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films whether they glorify or condemn the carnage there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly one of my all time favourite movies.".

After the French army stopped the German offensive at the Battle of the Marne the French and British armies faced the Germans in a line of trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland. About a quarter of France was occupied for four years in that time. The casualties ran into the millions in that stalemate that gains were only measured in meters.It was always just one more offensive over the top charging into automatic weapon fire that would break the other guy. Just such an offensive was planned one day in 1916 against a German stronghold dubbed the ant hill. General George MacReady promised a promotion by his superior Adolphe Menjou orders a beaten and tired battalion to charge the ant hill. The attack flops and MacReady looks for scapegoats. He decides after coming down from shooting 100 men to a selected three drawn by lot. The unlucky three are Joseph Turkel Ralph Meeker and Timothy Carey.The commander of the three Kirk Douglas asks to serve as their counsel and he makes a good show of it at the kangaroo court martial they have. But the fix is definitely in.Except for Spartacus Kirk Douglas rarely plays straight up heroic types in film. Even his good guys have an edge to them a dark side. But as Colonel Dax Douglas is at his most heroic. He may be one dimensional here but he's great. Especially in that last scene with Adolphe Menjou when he tells the man off in no uncertain terms mainly because Menjou has misread Douglas's motives. Menjou and Macready portray two different military types. The arrogant MacReady as versus the very sly Menjou. Not very admirable either of them. Menjou was not very popular at this time in Hollywood because of the blacklist. He favored it very much his politics were of the extreme right wing. Nevertheless he was a brilliant actor and never better than in this film one of his last.The enlisted men are a good bunch also. They're kind of like the posse in The Oxbow Incident just an ordinary group who become ennobled in martyrdom as they go to the firing squad for the sake of politics.Paths of Glory is one of the best antiwar films ever made. It ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front which showed the war from the German point of view. Both will be classics 200 300 a thousand years from now.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that Stanley Kubrick is the greatest of all film directors and in my opinion Paths of Glory is Kubrick's best film because1.  It is FAR AND AWAY the most realistic most emotionally draining and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I which has to be considered to be one of the significant episodes in all of human history.    The story is fiction but the events are patterned after some actual mutinies in the French army that took place in 1917.2.  I first saw this film 46 years ago and it not only made me an avid Kubrick fan for the rest of my life it made me want to watch it over and over again  more than 250 times over the years and every time I see it I cry at the end when Kubrick's future wife and the only woman in the film sings The Faithful Hussar causing the audience of French soldiers to change from a jeering crowd to a hushed tearyeyed group of lonely men.3.  Everything about the movie is PERFECT!!  There are no flaws in the acting the pace of the movie the photography the dialogue etc.  Scene after scene is more powerful and ironic than the preceding one building to a shattering climax.  It is simply a gem.4.  Try as I might to think of actors that could have been substituted in their places I think the casting for each and every part in the movie really could not have been any better.   No one could have been better in their respective roles than George Macready Adolphe Menjou Kirk Douglas Ralph Meeker and all of the others.   Many of these actors appear in Kubrick's other films.5.  Has there ever been a better scene than the one in which one of the condemned soldiers Ralph Meeker stares at this cockroach and cries that tomorrow that bug will still be alive and he will be dead.  Whereupon one of the other condemned men the fatalistic Timothy Carey squashes the cockroach and says Now you got the edge on him.6. You could probably change a few things in most of Kubrick's other masterpieces to slightly improve them but I DEFY anyone to single out anything in Paths of Glory that could be improved upon.  I could go on and on raving about the beauty and pathos of this film but I think I will stop here.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think that Stanley Kubrick is the greatest of all film directors and in my opinion Paths of Glory is Kubrick's best film because1.  It is FAR AND AWAY the most realistic most emotionally draining and most beautifully photographed movie ever made about trench warfare in WW I which has to be considered to be one of the significant episodes in all of human history.    The story is fiction but the events are patterned after some actual mutinies in the French army that took place in 1917.2.  I first saw this film 46 years ago and it not only made me an avid Kubrick fan for the rest of my life it made me want to watch it over and over again  more than 250 times over the years and every time I see it I cry at the end when Kubrick's future wife and the only woman in the film sings The Faithful Hussar causing the audience of French soldiers to change from a jeering crowd to a hushed tearyeyed group of lonely men.3.  Everything about the movie is PERFECT!!  There are no flaws in the acting the pace of the movie the photography the dialogue etc.  Scene after scene is more powerful and ironic than the preceding one building to a shattering climax.  It is simply a gem.4.  Try as I might to think of actors that could have been substituted in their places I think the casting for each and every part in the movie really could not have been any better.   No one could have been better in their respective roles than George Macready Adolphe Menjou Kirk Douglas Ralph Meeker and all of the others.   Many of these actors appear in Kubrick's other films.5.  Has there ever been a better scene than the one in which one of the condemned soldiers Ralph Meeker stares at this cockroach and cries that tomorrow that bug will still be alive and he will be dead.  Whereupon one of the other condemned men the fatalistic Timothy Carey squashes the cockroach and says Now you got the edge on him.6. You could probably change a few things in most of Kubrick's other masterpieces to slightly improve them but I DEFY anyone to single out anything in Paths of Glory that could be improved upon.  I could go on and on raving about the beauty and pathos of this film but I think I will stop here.";

	schema:headline " Kubrik's First Masterwork";
	schema:reviewBody "Paths of Glory 1957 and this is personal opinion of course is Stanley Kubrick's first real masterpiece in what would be a long line of subsequent masterpieces.  I know that Kubrick had a reputation for making cold unemotional films which is a false impression but that's the subject for another essay but I don't believe there are many people who can deny how powerful this film is.  Through the editing camera movement incredibly realistic dialogue and a now more fully realized use of irony Kubrick creates an unforgettable antiwar parable.  I realize that my love for this film is incredibly obvious but I'll try to focus on an analysis of the film rather than a review but the movie is just so good!       Francois Truffaut once said that there is no such thing as a true antiwar film because the battle scenes make the war look exiting.  Paths of Glory's scenes of battle are certainly gripping but gripping in the way that a nightmare is gripping.  There is no way a person can see these scenes and wish they were participating like the action scenes in say The Dirty Dozen.  I vividly recall the scene where three men try to sneak behind enemy lines in the middle of the night.  The battlefield is cloaked in darkness.  Someone shoots a flare.  Silently a brief burst of light illuminates the field revealing several corpses strewn over the ground. Darkness quickly covers them up again.  Kubrick uses silence and sparse sound effects in this scene like a musical score.  Any actual music would be intrusive and rob from the moment a flaw found in too many otherwise good films of the nineteen fifties personal opinion of course.      Point of view is used very well in the film to illustrate the inner concerns of the major characters.  We see General Mireau's Point of view when he looks through the binoculars at the anthill he wants his men to take.  When he hands over the binoculars to Colonel Dax we don't see his view of the anthill.  Later however when Dax walks through the trenches before the big battle we do see his point of view looking at his men.  This contrasts with an earlier scene when Mireau walked through the trenches and we did not see his point of view.  This clearly illustrates what is important to each man.  For Mireau it is victory at all costs for Dax it is the welfare of his soldiers.       For me one of the most impressive things about Paths of Glory was it's realistic yet still poetic and sometimes even chilling dialogue. This is in sharp contrast to the clever yet purposefuly stagy dialogue of The Killing.       One scene sticks out my mind where a soldier is nervously rambling about what it would be like to get shot Most guys say that if they got shot they'd want to die quick.  So what does that tell you?  It means there not afraid of getting killed they're afraid of getting hurt.  I think if you're gonna get shot and live it's best to get shot in the rear than in the head.  Why?  Because in the rear its just meat but the head that's pure bone.  Can you imagine what it's like for a bullet to rip through pure bone?   When I first saw this film in a theater there was some nervous laughter in the audience during this scene.  It's true the scene's dark humour helps illustrate the insanity of the situation.      In my introduction I stated that there was great use of irony in the film.  Perhaps the greatest irony is the title.  In the end no one finds glory.  Dax although he nobly fights to defend his men wrongly accused of treason loses the fight.  Even though he is later offered a promotion he turns it down because of his disgust for the army.  Mireau is found out to be the cad that he is for ordering his own troops slaughter and is court marshalled.  The film successfully states that in a war even the supposed victors lose something as well.".

No offense to everybody but I've never regarded this movie as an antiwar movie or something like that. The fact that my interpretation is not corresponding with most of the others lies in the simple truth that 50 of work is done by the author and the rest is done by the audience.Kubrick used his films as little pieces of the great image of mankind. In all his movies one can see one or multiple depictions of individuals or groups and their feelings and actions which are not only typical for the protagonists and antagonists but also for the viewer.In the Paths Of Glory this special feeling is perhaps the most ordinary of all hope. From the beginning there is no hope in this movie. The battle is lost before it even started. Those three poor creatures are sentenced to death before even the trial had started. And still the audience hopes for a happy end that the general may stop the execution in the last second. But nothing happens. At this point the viewer is as hopeless as the figures in the movie. The following breakfast scene leaves everybody in a state of paralization nothing changes.And then at the end. this helpless and beautiful girl begins to sing a German folk song which none of the present soldiers knows what it's all about. But the mood of the mob changes away from hate and anger and they all begin to cry like babies. In this very moment hope is reborn and comes back to the battlefield of feelings as the glorious winner. This is when we regain our hope.Many people wrote that the last scene didn't fit in the film at all. I would say that without this scene the movie would have never become the classic it is now. Of course the filming and actor performances are brilliant but this specialty of the last scene makes this movie unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "What to say that hasn't already been said. This astonishing cinematic work of art no kidding unquestionably is the GREATEST FILM EVER  bar none.  I deeply and passionately LOVE this brilliant early Kubrick production. Congratulations to expert screenwriters and unique pulp writers of the 5O's Calder Willingham who also penned his own excellent adaptation of The Strange One highly recommended and Jim Thompson The Grifters The Killer Inside Me which strongly influenced Tarantino who both present a superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true.  If only we had more real writers and scripts like this remarkable achievement we'd be writing far more favorable reviews. Paths of Glory alone would serve as anyone's lifetime achievement award. I don't care how much you HATE BW films  put this one on your MUSTSEE. Compelling cinemaverite photography creates astounding visuals from a varity of incisive angles like the famous mobile wideangle tracking shot of Dax probably Kirk Douglas's most stirring and important performance moving through the squalid and horrifying trenches as the battle begins with explosions breaking out all over.  The suspense and tension is frightening but almost beautifully eerie in the most compelling ways as Kubrick takes us through the deadly limbo of noman's land  the 'paths of glory' which finally leads to the grave.  The action skillfully combined with powerful moral and existential themes are amazingly conveyed through the bleak yet articulately stunning visuals.  THIS IS A FILMMAKER'S FILM! The moral outrage of the sadistic injustice of the military courtmartial never fails to make my blood fully boil.  The hypocrisy and corruption is degradingly infuriating.  If anything will make a cynic out of you it's this appropriately pessimistic and depressing cinema chronical based on a true stupid incident in WWI.  What's even worse is how POG in many perceptive ways serves as an allegory for all the B.S. in real life Pigheaded leadership in the parasitic hands of the superior greed freaks twofaced deceptive manipulations doublestandards backstabbings social bigotry armchair warriors egotism corrupt politics the militaries's abuse of too much power  and it's destructive desire at satisfying it's lust for vainglory sounds a little like Hollywood  Did I leave anything out?  You name it POG has it  and I'm not being sarcastic. The entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention to George Macready as the utterly pompous powermad gloryseeking soldier General Mireuo who thinks nothing about ordering his troops to open fire on his own men for not charging out of the trenches and dying for his country which smells a bit like ME ME ME.  Don't worry you'll throughly hate his guts. It truly is true method acting.  Again kudos to Macready  a fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians. Incidently this was a favorite film of a young 195O's Marlon Brando and old salty Winston Churchill who praised Kubrick's incisive authenticity in the exciting battle scene which does resemble news footage. Timothy Carey also ultraoffbeatcool in Kubrick's other exceptional early flick The Killing is morbidly humorous and gutwrenching as one of the poor fools coldly picked to be executed all in the ruthless 'patriotic' name and amoral game of 'glory'. ARE ANY OF OUR LEADERS LISTENING?  Too bad that Carey's memorable talents were so underused by Hollywood but that always seems to be the unfortunate norm.  A little like what ironically happens to him in this intriguing but downbeat story. Ralph Meeker who was also memorable as the brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer in the 5O's cult gem Kiss Me Deadly  a complete opposite role that shows a true range of his acting abilities delivers another wretching performance as the true brave soldier unjustly sentenced for Cowardice in the Face of the Enemy.  Maybe he should have turned 'about face' but it would have still been 'damned if he did and damned if he didn't'  another grim moral theme here.  His breakdown scene right before he is to be taken out and shot is terribly heartbreaking for I felt so wanting but helplessly unable to come to his help. Take my word for it everyone else is awesome a true actor's dramatic show with dark satirical overtones.  POG goes beyond the mere preaching antiwar diatribe though it does convey that almost naturally like going without having to say.  It's a great classic morality play that will really make you stop many many times and truly make you think many many times. Airheads not allowed.  Moreover this haunting and disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment something too many art films aren't.      It will really make you question things about our troubled convoluted world and how things are to often immorally and inhumanly run all in the sick name of greed and destructive power. Not too lovely for the director pulls no punches.  This film really has grown more profound and currently pertinent since its initial release.  Also the editing is taut and concise there isn't a single wasted moment.  Count the number of films on one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat that most critics and user commentators are always rightfully harking on.  I'll shut up now.  Go see this oneofakind film then see it again  and again etc.  ".

Colonel Dax a former lawyer defends his men in the unfair trial. Yesterday I watched this outstanding masterpiece for the first time and certainly it is among the best movies of the cinema history. The disgusting story shows the insanity of a war where men are treated like numbers and not as human beings. The reality of the battles scenes is amazing. The cast has a stunning performance highlighting the trio George Macready Adolphe Menjou and Kirk Douglas. The lack of sensibility and respect for the human life and the cynicism in the dialogs of the two generals are fantastic. Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A mustsee movie! My vote is ten.Title Brazil Glria Feita de Sangue' Glory Made of Blood'".

Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A mustsee movie! My vote is ten.Title Brazil Glria Feita de Sangue' Glory Made of Blood'";

This is just one of his many masterpieces but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick's other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life many great ones. Honestly this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn't expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film however it blew me away constantly and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made not only one of the greatest black  white films ever made it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none. The film screams integrity in each and every way. This film is a joy to watch and in my estimation Paths Of Glory will remain forever as one of cinemas greatest accomplishments.1010".

On the other hand the movie is not really about war but about the soldiers kind of like Full Metal Jacket. It is structured almost exactly the opposite with the first half of the film taking place on the battlefield and the second half off. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax whose platoon is ordered to take a hill called the Anthill against staggering odds almost surely a suicide mission.As the men rush out of the trenches in an attempt to complete the mission I was reminded of Gallipoli as they were all mowed down within feet of exiting the trenches. It becomes clear that the mission is ahem impossible and is abandoned. Where the movie is truly great is in its characterizations and the complexity of their relationships with one another. Watch for example the roles that certain characters play at the beginning and where they end up near the end of the film such as the General who ordered soldiers to fire on their own men and the man who abandons two of his men on a watch resulting in one of their deaths and the subsequent court martial and trial of the other. The situations that they end up in are what make the movie powerful.Clearly the accepted forms of punishment for failing to accomplish a mission are frightening. I have no idea how accurate they are as to French military practices at the time but for three soldiers to be taken at random and tried and sentenced to death because their entire platoon failed in an impossible mission is scary indeed. I wonder how they would have handled a few soldiers who refused to go on a mission to deliver contaminated gasoline because the vehicles had almost no armor on them whatsoever.What is truly amazing to me is that Kubrick was able to make a movie about massive military injustice and still make the audience laugh at certain times. The cockroach scene for example is wonderful comic relief. You get a good laugh without losing sight of the drama and the importance of the rest of the film.It is not uncommon to read that this is the greatest antiwar film of all time and while there are other antiwar films that I think rank right up there with Paths of Glory this certainly is one of the greatest ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "In an attempt to enhance his own reputation General Mireau George MacReady orders his troops to advance and seize the heavily fortified Ant Hill' from the German army. Despite realising the hazardous nature of the order Colonel Dax Kirk Douglas reluctantly agrees to lead the charge. As expected the attack goes badly and many French troops lose their lives which results in a large number of men refusing to leave their trenches. General Mireau sees this from his safe position and refusing to admit that the attack was suicide from the outset blames the cowardice of those who refused to fight for the devastating outcome of the battle. As a result Mireau demands that three soldiers from the regiment be held accountable and face an immediate court martial followed by death by firing squad. Dax seeks for the French military hierarchy to admit the truth.This dramatic condemnation of the politicsoverpeople attitude of military forces during World War I is an all too accurate portrayal of how the conflict resulted in one of the largest and most pointless losses of life in all known history. Taking place in the trenches amidst the height of the futile conflict between France and Germany director Stanley Kubrick in only his second feature film seeks to press home a fiercely antiwar statement backed up by actual historical facts rather than the typical embellishment that can be found in more modern war films. While the story itself is somewhat fanciful the portrayal of the morally corrupt military leaders that sent hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths for no more reason than to satisfy their own expanded egos and enhance their perfidious reputations is unfortunately all too accurate and a powerful indictment of not just the French army but all those who participated in one of the most bloody conflicts in human history. What makes the film so stinging in its approach is the flat out lies told by protagonist Mireau who claims that one man's life is worth more to him than a reputation yet when presented with the opportunity for political acclaim and honours is all too willing to send troops to battle when freely admitting that four thousand will probably perish in no man's land. A quick glance through history proves such onscreen bald faced lies to be inherently and tragically true offscreen even in relation to Britain's very own Field Marshall Hague. The French government found the representation of their military too close to fact and banned Paths of Glory' eventually lifting the ban in 1970.The film does not stand out in mere message alone. For those familiar with Kubrick's later work such as 2001 A Space Odyssey' 1968 A Clockwork Orange' 1971 and Full Metal Jacket' 1987 the director's soontobe trademarks can easily be spotted. As with many Kubrick films there is a remarkable ability to portray to the viewer what is not seen on the screen. The full carnage of the war is displayed in a darkly amusing yet chilling scene where one soldier questions another on whether he is scared of death or merely getting hurt. As this precedes the actual battle scenes by a matter of minutes the viewer becomes rapidly acquainted with the carnage fear and suffering these men faced despite a distinct lack of onscreen bloodshed. One could argue that the short virtually bloodless battle scene in Paths of Glory' is even more powerful than the bloody disturbing and prolonged beach scenes from Saving Private Ryan' 1998. Kubrick wonderfully crafts this movie around the composition of the filming rather than relying on any sort of special effects or visual trickery. Throughout the movie particularly during the battle scenes the viewer is given a third person perspective of the struggles of men to come to terms with life and death under such harsh conditions. Incredible acting performances from Kirk Douglas George MacReady and Adolphe Menjou attract the viewer's attention and become the central focus in a war film with scarce amounts of action. Kubrick condemns the politics of war through the use of the politics that control war.It is very difficult to write about this film and fully do it justice. The preVietnam antiwar sentiment is easily the main focus of the movie and it is through competent acting that the movie is made great. It becomes somewhat irrelevant that the movie is set in WWI as the same message applies to every major war particularly the following decades Vietnam War. It wasn't until Oliver Stone's Platoon' 1986 that viewers were again treated to an historically based condemnation of war that focused less on heroes and more on the way things really were in battle. Wisely the movie opens with a narrated epilogue which informs the viewer of the absurdity of WWI and then ends with a melodramatic and almost tearinspiring scene which although not in place when compared to the sombre and melancholy feel of the previous eighty minutes ends the film in such a way that the film itself must be contemplated. Paths of Glory' is easily one of the most powerful films of all time and a pejorative antiwar statement where the only real failing is the short length of the movie and occasional poor performances from the supporting cast. My rating for Paths of Glory'  710.".

Intelligent screenplay based on a Humphrey's Cobb's novel has been well adapted by Stanley Kubrick and Jim Thompson . It depicts a brooding study about futility and insanity of war  making a shattering accusation against the military ruling staff who cares on promotions more than the soldiers . Kirk Douglas is very good as compassionate French Colonel who commands his troops in some spectacular scenes on the trenches . Stunning support cast beautifully performed by notorious secondaries as Emily Meyer as the priest  Wayne Morris as the lieutenant  Richard Anderson as the Major prosecutor  Ralph Meeker  Timothy Carey and Suzanne Christian  Kubrick's wife . Special mention to the two selfish Generals exceptionally performed by George Macready and Adolph Menjou . Excellent cinematography in black and white by George Krause filmed on location in Schleissheim Palace Munich and Bavaria Film studios Geiselgasteig Grnwald Bavaria Germany studio. The motion picture is wonderfully realized by the maestro Stanley Kubrick and lavishly produced by James B. Harris  his usual producer by that time . This magnificent film along with  All quiet on the Western front   Westfront 1918   Captain Conan   and King and country result to be the best films about powerful antiwar theme . Time hasn't dimmed its power  or its poignancy a bit and remains untouchable the critique to the military hypocrisy in an ultralucid exposition .

I work at a video store and some of my customers that watch numerous classic movies like I do said that they thought this was Kirk Douglas' finest hour and 26 minutes. They were right.

	schema:reviewBody "All Stanley's life he said 'Never ever go near power. Don't become friends with anyone who has real power.'  Christiane KubrickPaths of Glory begins with the playing of the French nation anthem  an ironic touch  and then quickly introduces us to its key players Colonel Dax a well intentioned military man and General's Broulard and Mireau two elderly careerists who treat the soldier's under their command with callous indifference.As the film progresses director Stanley Kubrick will use two recurring visual motifs  men in trenches and men affixed like mere pawns to a chessboard  to hammer his dour view. The film's soldiers are always trapped not only constrained by duty class and national responsibility but by physical political and cosmic forces. When they try to rise above or beyond the filth they're promptly shot down. Dax the film's hero is himself ultimately impotent. All his protests mean nothing. Whether he leads his men to success or failure they still lose. The end of the film has Dax standing helplessly on the sidelines watching as his men are executed for failing to take an insignificant Ant Hill. This is WW1 in microcosm aristocrats monarchs and burgeoning democracies risking lower class limbs for land and hoping desperately to cling onto whatever power is available come the 20th century's new order.Even as far back as Paths of Glory Kubrick's form reflects content. Plot and character coalesce into a very concrete very formal image of the world. In Killer's Kiss and The Killing this was strictly a generic world but Paths of Glory launches itself in a different field that of history warfare and army politics. The film's subject is unambiguously visualised in its main setting a huge chteau converted to an army command post. Because the decor becomes the story Kubrick's actual story is not simply told but barely told. Given a narrative context that is so simple characters are also defined in very basic ways. The pawns live in the mud the kings in the ornate chteau. The kings scapegoat and shift responsibility the drones take the blame and bullets. Everything else becomes a manifestations of decor or camera movement. Characters are imprisoned parodied paired off and squared away. The prime examples are the generals Broulard and Mireau lookalikes in uniform two ruthless men who toy with each another and who lead each other on in the guise of concern for their troops. Luis Bunuel himself fond of satirising the ruling elite would adore the film.Whilst discussing taking the Ant Hill a series of brief tracks follow our players as they pace marble floors. Each character pursues a different path but they all arrive at the same end. Broulard proves to spin the more effective web because he is the more clearsightedly cynical. Mireau in the end becomes a zealot of selfdeception. Dax is the liberalhumanitarian shuttlecock passing between them he has no double but is himself doubled negotiating his superiors' ambitions first as a commander on the battlefield then as a lawyer in the courtroom.Dax as officer and battlefield soldier is also a hero of two worlds the chteau and the trenches. As hero his function is to serve as the meeting point of two perspectives the objective vista of history and the subjective confusion and terror of trench warfare. Significantly Dax is Kubrick's only conventional hero outside of Spartacus also starring Douglas. Kubrick's later films would abandon conventional protagonistantagonist dualities.Camera movements are clear but subtle. When Mireau inspects the troops in an early scene Kubrick's camera tracks backwards before him down an interminable trench. When Dax later tours the trench the same objective track is intercut with one from his point of view as he passes through the ranks. Kubrick's point is clear. Dax sees outward and is aware of or empathises with the men around him. Mireau sees inward fixated on himself and his own goals. Later he will fire upon his own ants.This interplay reaches its zenith with the execution of three soldiers. Here the anguished perspectives of the victims one of whom is played by the always brilliant Timothy Carey are intercut with a tracking shot which itself seems to shift in intensities as it passes in front of a hierarchy of observers from the indifferent troops to the press corps to Dax and the guilty corporals. Kubrick's extended tracking shots have usually been put down to the influence of Ophuls to whose death Kubrick dedicates one scene in Paths of Glory to but the articulation of point of view through tracking  an emotional montage  is closer to Hitchcock. This form of emotional dialectics is present throughout the film. Watch how the generals play number games tabulating the statistics of probable causalities before battle bargaining over how many examples should be shot whilst the men below them cry in the trenches and prison houses vividly aware of their own fickle lives. Unlike Kubrick's later works Glory is resolutely unambiguous. His dialogue is caustic blunt and his images likewise impeccably composed with stark lines and fluid but muscular tracking shots. Elsewhere the film is almost robotic marching towards its climax like a relentless machine. Glory was also the first feature to utilise an all percussion soundtrack a fact which lends Kubrick's imagery an even greater sense of foreboding.1010  Masterpiece.".

After PATHS OF GLORY he would make all types of films but he would basically make them as he wanted to although when working with his star here Kirk Douglas on SPARTACUS he would have such friction with Douglas that they never made any other films together afterward. So if it had not been for PATHS OF GLORY there would not have been LOLITA DR. STRANGELOVE 2001 BARRY LYNDON and the other films. The Kubrick stamp of film artistry was born here.The plot of the story is simple. Due to the system of trenches on the Western Front that have France and Britain on one side and Germany on the other the war has bogged down to a mutual bloodletting. It shouldn't been this way but nobody that was sent to the Western Front through 1917 was a good commander. Von Falkenheyn the German Commander at Verdun was unable to hold onto early gains in that long long battle. The best French General was Joseph Gallieni who won the First Battle of the Marne by commissioning the famous taxicab army that drove the French troops to the front. But he retired. The actual Commander Papa Joffre was popular with the men but had a tendency of falling asleep at military strategy sessions. As for the British Douglas Haig was saddled with planning global strategy for British forces in Africa the Middle East and India. His acceptance of the stalemate on the Western Front bordered on the criminal  he reduced the monstrous casualty rate to a simple war of attrition. With Commanders like Von Falkenheyn Haig and Joffre the war was hopeless. The suggestion of one more push over the top was repeated endlessly  and bloodily. In 1917 units of the French Army had enough. The French Mutinies were long known because of the trials and executions of hundreds of mutineers. One good result was the arrival at headquarters of General Henri Petain. His reputation is besmirched by his treason in leading the Vichy Government in World War II but Petain was a senile old man when made a figurehead a fact his old friend General Charles DeGaulle knew so that he reduced the death sentence against the old man to life imprisonment. One generation earlier Petain saved the army and France  a debt that really should not be forgotten. Yes he tried the ringleaders but he also improved the lot of the poilu common soldiers so that they were not living like moles or rats all the time. The regeneration of the French armies that Ferdinand Foch would lead with Haig and Pershing and their men to eventual victory began when Petain took charge.SPOILERS AHEADPATHS OF GLORY looks at the situation that led to those mutinies and to one of the drumhead courts. Adolph Menjou is a leading general who realizes that a victory is required for appearance sake i.e. the politicians are breathing down the back of the French High Command. He invites his old friend George Macready to lunch and drops a hint that if they could find a nice victory Macready may get promoted Menjou says this very carefully  no fool he if he has to deny it. Macready can just taste the promotion. He promises the men will do the job.They don't. The job is to capture a well protected salient called the ant hill because whenever men are fighting over it they look like ants fighting each other from a distance. The leader of the men who are to charge is Kirk Douglas. In peacetime he is an attorney so he has enough brains to question the intelligence of the socalled army brains.Macready is watching the attack from a bomb shelter and notices the men will not leave the trench. He orders an artillery barrage on his own men forcing them to face the Germans. This will turn out to be a disastrous mistake on his part. After the disaster Macready picks three soldiers to be representative of the troops. One of them is selected by a Sergeant who is a real coward and who is aware the enlisted man knows he is a coward. Douglas defends them but the court is controlled by Macready and his flacks. The three are convicted. We watch their last night  with one Timothy Carey certain that a pardon will come for him at least. Another gets badly injured in a mishap. When the time for the three to be shot occurs they are set up like Christ and the two robbers at Calvary the wounded man is slapped out of unconsciousness to see the firing squad getting ready to fire.Douglas has been discovering what Macready did  and reveals this to Menjou. He hopes to do this to force Menjou to overturn the death sentences. But Menjou holds back and lets the executions go on. We see him dancing at a dinner party while this is going on. The next day when Macready is having breakfast with Menjou and Douglas shows up Menjou brings up the illegal act of firing on his own men. Instead of a promotion Macready is being thrown out of his command and probably prevented from getting further ones. Pulling his shredded dignity together as best he could he pointedly states that at least he was a soldier unlike the courtier  general Menjou. After he leaves Menjou offers Macready's command to Douglas. And Douglas tells him off very memorably.PATHS OF GLORY is a fantastically good look at military incompetence corruption and those shafts of decency that the common soldiers and Douglas represent. Although set in time and place in 1917 France it's message is universal. It is a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very disappointed by this film given the accolades it generally receives.It's not a terrible film but it seems to me that it probably gained its reputation by dint of the fact that it had an original and very daring take on the military for its day. Obviously it is a matter of personal taste but for me I think it wrong to call a film great when its greatness is closely tied to the particular period in which it was first released. Some films are very much of their time and Paths of Glory seems to me to be one of them. In this day and age a movie that basically says war is hell and many of the men involved in making war are immoral and commit evil acts for selfish reasons these men appear particularly awful when compared with those courageous men who behave nobly in the face of war doesn't have the shock value that it did 50 years ago.Given the lesser impact of this larger message it is easier to see the seams and flaws in other aspects of the film. To a great extent the story seems simplistic. The villains are terribly villainous and the victims are terribly noble. We know from the first 2 or 3 scenes everything we are every going to know about the nature of the primary characters. No one really grows or changes. Instead the story plays out mechanically. The acting is not bad but it's a bit oldfashioned and stagey. Similarly the technical aspects of the trench and battle scenes while very good for the time have a dated quality that undercuts the viewer's involvement in the film. Even for a kangaroo court the trial scene is silly in the grandest tradition of bad illogical Hollywood trial scenes. For example the defendants are being tried for retreating in defiance of their orders. Yet when one defendant mentions that he retreated because he was ordered to no one not even the noble Colonel trying to defend him picks up on that fact i.e. that he was in fact OBEYING orders. In the final scene a captured German girl is paraded and sexually demeaned on stage in front of a group of rowdy soldiers who seem likely to jump her instead she's asked to sing a song and the soldiers begin to cry and hum along like the nuns backing up Maria in The Sound of Music. I recognize that this is a movie and that perhaps it was a more innocent time but in a movie that purports to show us the nasty reality of war I found it more silly than affecting for Kubrick to suggest that this scenario would end in choral tears rather than assault.I'm not taking issue with the themes of this film which are as relevant today as they ever were. Nor am I saying the movie is worthless today. But I am simply unsure that it deserves an ongoing reputation as a GREAT film. Some films are born great and stay great other become great over time. But some films may be born great and then gently fade away  like old soldiers.".

Obviously it is a matter of personal taste but for me I think it wrong to call a film great when its greatness is closely tied to the particular period in which it was first released. Some films are very much of their time and Paths of Glory seems to me to be one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "www. ourfilmreviews.comWith classics like Dr. Strangelove 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange Stanley Kubrick was long ago canonized as a filmmaker of the highest skill and intelligence. One of his greatest skills is not allowing his films to be watched passively. He forces his viewers to respond both emotionally and intellectually. Dr. Strangelove does so with its black disturbing humor and its comical treatment of one of modern man's most penetrating fears nuclear warfare. 2001 does so by immersing us in its sweeping visuals as it follows mankind from the dawn of time to a place beyond time. A Clockwork Orange does so by forcing us to confront the inescapable violence and evil inherent in human nature and society's casual indifference and at times subtle encouragement of such. Paths of Glory is Kubrick's first masterpiece and while it is often forgotten in comparison to the three films mentioned above it is just as compelling as any film he or anyone else has ever made.The film's running time is only 87 minutes yet it is deeper artistically than most films that carry on past the 120minute mark. The reason for this shows Kubrick's superiority as a filmmaker. Every scene and piece of dialog is instrumental in forming the film as whole. Nothing is wasted. Every aspect of the film coalesces with every other aspect. This is seen in the coming together of the overall narrative of the French army's suicidal mission and the storyline of two individual soldiers within the army. Before the failed attack on Anthill three men embark on a reconnaissance mission to scope out the territory. The subordinate officer Paris witnesses his commanding officer Lt Roget accidentally kill the other soldier. After the failed attack on Anthill when the commanding officers are forced to pick one man from their troop to be tried at the tribunal Lt. Roget chooses Paris in an attempt at silencing the one man who knows his secret. But after Paris along with the two other soldiers are condemned to be shot guess who Col Dax assigns to lead the execution? Roget.Roget cannot hide from his guilt. He is forced to face it. When he asks Paris if he wants a blindfold for the execution he cannot look him in the eye and asks for forgiveness. It is a powerful moment. This smaller narrative of Roget and Paris is interwoven then with the greater narrative. A lesser filmmaker might have had the Roget and Paris subplot remain a subplot with its own separate conclusion. The Kubrick the conclusion of Paris and Roget is wedded to and made more powerful by the larger narrative.Roget needs to be forgiven by the only one who knows his secret. His guilt is genuine and his desire for redemption private. Roget's private guilt is contrasted by General Broulard's complete obliviousness to the blame he deserves taking the Anthill was his idea to begin with and his desire to set things right only in the eyes of the public. He does so by telling General Mireau that he will be investigated for misconduct. After Dax tells Broulard of Mireau's order to fire on the battalion Broulard must investigate Mireau not out of any sense of justice but because Dax threatens to go public with the information. Boulard offers Dax Mireau's position implying that Dax revealed Mireau's misconduct only to further his own career. Dax is outraged that Broulard is incapable of comprehending the injustice and his indignation. Thus the one who is most responsible for the failed attack and the numerous deaths is also the one who has the power to blame and punish others for his failure.The scene of Dax's indignant outburst against Broulard shows the nature of true evil. Mireau may have ordered his own army to shoot at the battalion and he may have vehemently argued for the battalion's execution but he was acting on a set of principles albeit a very twisted set or principles but principles non the less. Broulard has no principles only a desire to elude blame and preserve his own appearance and position of power and respect. This is the truer more subtle evil.Kubrick's screenplay and direction and Douglas's perfect performance make Dax's indignation our own. The injustice is painfully felt. We understand so clearly that these soldiers would have died if they left the trenches and are condemned to die for not leaving them. As we see the three condemned soldiers walk to their execution in a wonderful and classically Kubrickian tracking shot we realize that the only two options these soldiers had were to die by the bullets of their enemies or by the bullets of their own countrymen. Either way bullets will pierce their flesh. The nature of war makes living impossibleThe movie ends with one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in any film. In a tavern full of rowdy French soldiers a German girl is brought on stage to be mocked for the entertainment of the soldiers. She is ridiculed because of her sex and nationality. Terrified she begins to quietly sing a song in German. The whistling and hollering of the soldiers slowly abates and we see in their faces a look of such anguish regret and sadness. A few of them wipe tears off their faces. Not knowing the words or the language they begin to hum the song with the German girl. They are reminded of their humanity and it hurts. After showing us the darkest side of humanity Kubrick ends his film with this scene of hope. Even in the midst of a war these soldiers are capable of overcoming their brutishness and acknowledging their own humanity and that of the opposing nation. Kubrick allows us to see the entire range of what humanity is capable of from the cruelest of injustices to the most beautiful of moments".

The same thing happened in 1996 following the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM a smug reworking of genre clichs which allowed 'sophisticated' multiplex audiences to indulge an attitude of superiority over those 'crappy' old horror flicks and the 'unsophisticated' viewers who once supported them. The subsequent wave of teenage horror pics were flashy sexy and ramped to the max and  true to form  virtually all of them were ho hum trashed by critics and horror fans alike. And yet most of them made a profit perhaps BECAUSE they were flashier and sexier than those earlier pictures and because they were designed for a wider demographic than 'mere' horror fans.Jamie Blanks' URBAN LEGEND is a case in point Most reviews ran the gamut from harsh dismissal to faint praise yet the movie is a visual treat as creepy and atmospheric as any of the films which inspired it. Furthermore Silvio Horta's unassuming screenplay confounds expectations with its solid narrative arc recognizable characters and dynamic setpieces not to mention a climactic 'reveal' which offers a robust motive for the killer's devastating onslaught. There are a few embarrassing lapses along the way such as the murder which takes place in full view of heroine Alicia Witt which she ignores because she thinks it's a couple having sex! and Horta can't resist a handful of copout contrivances eg. the killer slashes the wrists of a girl known for her depressive tendencies causing authorities to dismiss her death as suicide though a routine forensic examination would have revealed the cuts were administered post mortem AFTER she was strangled to death! but these occasional blunders are redeemed by the movie's fastpaced editing neoGothic visual scheme and clever plot developments. Blanks orchestrates proceedings with consummate skill but he refuses to indulge the kind of transgressive gore that once distinguished this downmarket subgenre where's Tom Savini when you really need him?!.As expected the talented young cast  including Jared Leto Rebecca Gayheart and Tara Reid  is pleasingly photogenic and there are lengthy appearances by TV favorites Michael Rosenbaum Smallville and Joshua Jackson watch out for the terrific Dawson's Creek gag!. Major costars include Robert Englund Freddy Krueger himself! John Neville and an uncredited Brad Dourif who features heavily in a powerful opening sequence where Blanks and Horta pull a major switcheroo on the audience I'll say no more. Loretta Devine is amusing as the campus security guard who views herself as a modernday CoffyPam Grier her fantasy is rudely curtailed by a climactic encounter with the rampaging maniac and there's a brief appearance by Danielle Harris the former child star of HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS 1988 and HALLOWEEN 5 1989 playing an adult character FAR removed from the angelic poppet of those earlier pictures! Beautiful fairytale score by Christopher Young. Followed by the largely unrelated URBAN LEGENDS FINAL CUT 2000.".

	schema:headline " If you liked the Scream and Last Summer movies make sure you don't miss this atmospheric thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "A local college is being terrorized by brutal murders. The mysterious killer targets a certain group of friends who initially do not realize or even ignore the upcoming danger and fall prey to   his clutches. They leave their rooms unlocked or go alone in the forest at night. The killer's main victim seems to be Natalie Alicia Witt a very typical gal at least on the surface. The killer stalks her and harasses her continuously and Natalie not only tries to convince everyone about the danger in vain but has to deal with melanic issues from her past. People soon start dropping like flies and Natalie and her friends are helpless before they all meet their fate. Many years before the incidents the college was rumored to have been plagued by an insane professor who flipped and invaded the students' dormitory killing many fraternity members at one single night. One of the few survivors is proven to be a sociopath weird janitor who is not willing to share his traumatic memories in order to help solving the mystery of this new killing spree. The murderer is much more than a freaked loser copycat who simply wants to rekindle the horror on the 25th anniversary of the alleged massacre but has an obscure agenda.Maybe all these plot elements sound stereotyped and nothing special. The premise of a horror movie localized in a college is as old as it gets and has been done to death no pun intended. Nevertheless there is a special originality in this film. The killer's modus operandi follows a unique pattern of an urban legend methodology. You probably all know what an urban legend is. Folklore stories which are always laying on the verge of reality and myth. Usually they are scary crimes and everyone seems to know or have heard or have read a similar crime although no one seems to have actually enlisted specific names. Stories like these are usually typical frightening tales. One example is the poisoned candy children are frequently treated on Halloween by insane people. Another example is the seemingly normal father who mysteriously brutally slaughtered his entire family over one night preferably by axe and disappeared never to be heard of again. The screenwriter plays cleverly with all the cliches and the fears of the dark. The urban legends provide fertile ground for some genuinely original and shocking death scenes. Urban Legend despite an intriguing premise cannot hide its  origin. It is a typical 90's horror film mixed with a whodunit subplot recognizable TV faces and plenty of gore. The film succeeds in being a memorable and above average effort but if you are set to watch it you are bound to find all the stupid overused themes a teeny bopper provides without nudity though that is the determinant between 80's and 90's. There are plot holes the size of a volcano crater. For example the police officers are so dim witted that they regard a clearly obvious strangulation which would probably have left distinct bruises on the victim's neck as a suicide. Moreover why oh why don't they send officers during the climactic tragic events after all those murders. I can accept the fact that the phone lines were dead but couldn't someone just go and ask for help? When they do arrive it is far too late. The cast was also overcrowded and it was obvious that the protagonists were nothing more than screen fillers. It is too bad since their acting skills which seemed promising were withheld. For example Jared Leto and Michael Rosenbaum are Paul and Parker respectively. Although the film starts off interestingly with equal screen time Natalie soon wins the absolute focus and their roles are so small that they end up being extras. Things are even worse for Brenda Rebecca Gayheart and Sasha Tara Reid who also had shrunken roles and are wandering pretty faces waiting in line to be sliced and diced. Although the suspects are many the final revelation of the killer is weak the motives even weaker and of course we have the inevitable catlived nature of the killerwhorefusestodie escorted by the predictable cliffhanger epilogue with the TO BE SEQUELED sign.An extra detrimental element is the presence of Alicia Witt in an especially important role. Her acting is not awful but it is definitely misguided and fails. Witt is way too calm to convince as a realistic character. After a certain point it is clear that her psychopath stalker has not only killed her friends but is after her and she doesn't even show a trace of panic. She DOES try of course to warn the bonehead authorities and she does a little research on the urban legends. The bad thing is that even in the gruesome finale she doesn't seem to fear the maniac even a little bit and even worse she is not the willingtofight heroine that Sidney Prescott in Scream was. Now I don't want to be misunderstood I wasn't looking for Jamie Lee Curtis's overblown vocal pipes but she could have more human reactions especially after the deaths of her friends. It's as though Natalie had read the victim list and knew that she had a contractual commitment to survive until the end. The only one of the main characters with some substance is Joshua Jackson as Damon. This guy is a derivative from other horror films and strikes as a cardboard cutout a prankster who teases his friends and is slightly horny. At least Damon has a certain and sensible persona and Jackson is adequate. The funniest aspect of the film is that the cameos are far more successful and memorable than the leads!! Danielle Harris in a short role is the quite trendy Gothic young diva who is the incarnation of the Lust sin the aged John Neville is the strict and by the rules Dean of the University and Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance in a role which I won't reveal. The best of them is Robert Englund as the clever and a bit creepy Professor who teaches folklore and introduces his students to the urban legends. Professor Wexler seems to be the chief suspect for this horrific situation and although there are sporadic hints throughout the film which point to other directions Englund virtually dominates the screen even with his absence!!! Of course I won't omit Loretta Devine as Reese the guardian of the University who is very funny and adds the necessary comic relief. Who could have thought? A woman and indeed a black one as the copprotector. It is another attempt to break a few cliches. Well done casting directors.Apart from some good performances Urban Legend has many other assets. The opening sequence alone was enough to keep me hooked on as I realized I would watch a great film. The rainy frames and the professional shooting with the distant take angles is enough to pose the threatening tone and warn us about what is to follow. The introductory scene is a stand alone masterpiece. The killer here doesn't have a costume but hides under a winter jacket with a cowl and this gives a realistic touch and a difficulty in pinpointing the culprit since many people have the same type of jacket. The best part of Urban Legend is the setting and the cinematography. The university buildings are bulky and old enough to support a medieval atmosphere which excites our imagination. Further these baroque aged buildings give a much more scary climate and ensure that no matter how much they run the protagonists will never get away since the corridors are so long that probably no one is going to hear them scream. But the greatest virtue is the photography which was dreary and gave a sense of a documentary style. The best example to describe the stigma the director tried to pull off are the library scenes. The leads are in a situation reminiscent of the Name of the Rose lacking the religious undertones of course!!! and are trapped in an infernal game they cannot escape. The whole point of view of the movie is clearly cinematic and the imaging techniques are much supportive. As I aforementioned the death scenes are fascinating and catapult the adrenaline to heights. Although the character development is bare you feel sorry for the victims well OK for most of them. One surprise follows another as the body count increases. It comes as a great disappointment therefore that after a chilling 90 minutes period the last 30 minutes go downhill. The action is very weak the suspense retreats and we are left with overacting inept and predictable plot twists inadequate explanations and a rather disappointing climax . I mean how could anyone not wonder why the maniac wouldn't just kill Natalie and get over with this revenging mission instead of doing this wild carnage. So be warned the last half hour is extremely disappointing. Thus if you are a horror fan who wants an entertaining thriller Urban Legend is a good shot. Despite some letdowns Urban Legend is yet another landmark in 90's horror genre. URBAN LEGEND  8  10".

	schema:headline " Let's get our slasher on!";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah our precious 1990's so many great things came out of this memorable decade including a streak of teen slasher films. Let's face it after the mega success of Scream which opened the doors once again after Friday the 13th Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street we needed a new classic. So naturally all the screen writers who were a bit scared to present their ideas on the table thanks to Kevin Williamson the clever writer of Scream and Dawson's Creek. After that every teen slasher film was released the Scream sequels I Know What You Did Last Summer I Still Know What You Did Last Summer etc. But we didn't stop at that we were now presented with Urban Legend.The film begins on a dark and stormy night as college student Michelle Mancini realizes she is near empty while driving in her car. There's someone in the back seat as Michelle drives a figure in a dark coat with a fur trim around the hood sits up in the back seat and with a swift blow from its axe decapitates Michelle. The same night on campus a group of friends listens to Parker Riley tell an old story about one of the campus halls Stanley Hall. According to the story in 1973 an abnormal psychology teacher went crazy and killed all the students living in an oncampus residence hall. Paul a school paper journalist thinks the story is bogus.

Realizing both Damon's death and Michelle's murder closely resemble famous urban legends Natalie goes to the library to read up on urban legends. Not realizing the terror has just begun to scare her and her friends even more.Basically Urban Legend didn't stand out against it's competitors it has every clich in the book. Not to mention no memorable actors that had the same chemistry as the cast of Scream. It's over written at times and has every predictable moment the friends don't believe in a ghost story a couple people get killed off but everyone thinks it's a prankfake death a classic chase scene with a big breasted girl in a skimpy costume the creepy janitor the smart girl that no one believes is all of a sudden right about all the murders and of course a mega twist ending that no one will ever see coming! OK Urban Legend isn't a horrible movie while it has all these predictable moments and clichs it's still actually fun to watch and a good part of the memory of good teen slasher films that came out of the 1990's.610".

	onyx:emotionText "Ah our precious 1990's so many great things came out of this memorable decade including a streak of teen slasher films. Let's face it after the mega success of Scream which opened the doors once again after Friday the 13th Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street we needed a new classic. So naturally all the screen writers who were a bit scared to present their ideas on the table thanks to Kevin Williamson the clever writer of Scream and Dawson's Creek. After that every teen slasher film was released the Scream sequels I Know What You Did Last Summer I Still Know What You Did Last Summer etc. But we didn't stop at that we were now presented with Urban Legend.The film begins on a dark and stormy night as college student Michelle Mancini realizes she is near empty while driving in her car. There's someone in the back seat as Michelle drives a figure in a dark coat with a fur trim around the hood sits up in the back seat and with a swift blow from its axe decapitates Michelle. The same night on campus a group of friends listens to Parker Riley tell an old story about one of the campus halls Stanley Hall. According to the story in 1973 an abnormal psychology teacher went crazy and killed all the students living in an oncampus residence hall. Paul a school paper journalist thinks the story is bogus. Still the story sticks in their minds especially for Natalie and Brenda. The next day the front page of the campus newspaper has an article about Michelle Mancini's murder written by Paul but the papers are quickly confiscated by school officials. Later that night after going into a secluded area of woods to talk Natalie reveals to Damon that she knew Michelle but they hadn't spoken in years. Damon playing on Natalie's vulnerability tries to make a move on her but she rejects him. Upset Damon goes into the woods to urinate but is attacked by the killer. He then is hung from a tree in a noose with the rope attached to the bumper of his car. The next day no one believes Natalie's story due to Damon's penchant for pranks and tricks.

What little suspense there is comes from the anticipation of these scenes since the surrounding story is almost as ridiculous as the film itself.If the screenwriters had concentrated less on incorporating the whodunit aspect into the plot and more on the legends themselves they might have had something here. Experienced viewers will spot the killer's identity and motive early on and those that don't will be fooled only because the conclusion is so completely ludicrous not to mention mostly impossible.Of course most of this would be easily overlooked if Urban Legend was scary but time and again director Jamie Banks telegraphs the surprises far ahead and doesn't know how to time the shocks.  Over and over we get the sudden burst of loud music followed by a character running into another character but it doesn't work. And that gets annoying after the third or fourth try. Occasionally Banks does get something eerie going but the style is more suited to an action flick.Of the cast most of the actors more or less get by despite a lessthanclever script though it's disheartening to see a talented young actor like Jared Leto wasting his time with a nothing role as the reporter. Horror favorites Robert Englund and Brad Douriff pop up in cameos adding a nice touch to their brief scenes.What we're left with is an intriguing idea undone by cliche after cliche. The legends are potent enough to hold your attention to the end and horror fans will find a few gruesome goodies to amuse themselves. And even though the script needs to be about three times again as clever as it is there is a great injoke at the end about one of the actresses and a commercial.That clever scene might have been the first scene of a clever movie.

Among the better features here is the fact that back when this movie came out the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The opening backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on the dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car in the woods offers some rather nice suspense with the killer appearing and continually trying to break into the car and the sexstrangulation misidentification is really cool mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true from the backstory needed to make sure she shouldn't see anything the killer gaining access to the room without violent means and the actual sounds of the incident are all mixed together and makes a marvelous scene. These here really work nicely due to the way they incorporate the whole mythology of the premise into their stalking and work incredibly well at bringing these together. Other great scenes where she watches someone in the killers known attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool while she is helplessly trying to get her attention or the tense stalking of the DJ in the radio station during the thunderstorm make for some additional tense thrilling scenes and the way it works out due to knowing what the killer is dressed like is effective enough. That also leads into the twist about the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept as the way there are so many different red herrings involved and all of them given good alibis to clear them so by gaining more clues to their identity it broadens the suspense by making an extra clue for the people to solve. These here really work nicely for the film as there isn't a whole lot really to dislike here. The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume so it has a lot of toneddown gore. Many of these killings should've been gorier and it will probably disappoint many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those films where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare and here is one example that having a ton of cheap scares aren't that frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny so it is a bit flat in some places. The pacing is a little off in the first half with all the buildups to the class and what they all mean but there's not a whole lot else wrong here.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language some alcohol use a scene with a dog drinking and a brief mild sex scene.".

And all of the movies in the late 80's weren't considered copycats. So in the end this movie is better than Scream but not as good as Scream 2.

Picture a New England mansion while it's raining in the dark. That's the feel of the college  and inside a comfortable home like area where the central characters hang out. The beginning interactions with these friends make them all very believable and real. Not shallow or just there to scream run and get killed. One of the classes is about urban legends so the theme of the movie is are these really just urban legends or are they real? It's the 25th anniversary of the school's socalled massacre. Most students don't believe it but as friends go missing or turn up dead one of the main characters Natalie believes it is not only real but someone after her. Watching it now so many years later it's amazing how well known most of the actors have become. I was shocked to read that Michael Rosenbaum from the TV show 'Smallville' was in this movie as one of the main characters. He looks so different I would never have made the connection. And I've seen this movie a lot. I read someone call it predictable but I didn't think so at all. It was suspenseful to the end. Not knowing who you could really trust. Even after knowing what happens something about this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. The characters become real and the ominous looking school with grounds going towards the woods gives it a real feeling of a New England town. In the dark...at night would you say Bloody Mary three times in this superstitious place?".

Others have described it better here on IMDb so I am just going to say this It is not a historical correct piece and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy even though the vikings portrayed and their buildingssettlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.Btw To all you who like the abovementioned movies for the big battlescenes and swordfighting don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area even though it got them. On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in premedieval times. Instead of having the one superhero defying all logic you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie with Banderas Storhi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.This is a great adventure of a movie which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.910  Must see for all who like adventurefantasy".

It should be viewed as a fantasy even though the vikings portrayed and their buildingssettlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.Btw To all you who like the abovementioned movies for the big battlescenes and swordfighting don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area even though it got them. On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in premedieval times. Instead of having the one superhero defying all logic you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie with Banderas Storhi and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.This is a great adventure of a movie which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.910  Must see for all who like adventurefantasy";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely well crafted film but a poorly edited one. Much like The Ghost and the Darkness it has such a winning historical concept that it is easy to forgive a little narrative incoherency from time to time. This film is a bit muddled when it comes to plot and characterization but hits all the right notes in terms of creating an adventurous spirit and thrilling action sequences. Jerry Goldsmith's score is a real high point as is the cinematography. This is an absolutely wonderful film to get all caught up in on a lonely night because it makes you feel as if you are on the journey with Banderas' character. It is an action thriller that is actually...thrilling. In particular the scene with the fire dragon is one of the more memorable battle sequences I have seen in any movie and I really mean that. The only negative aspects of the film are the feeling that a lot of scenes were left on the editing room floor which is true and if there was ever a film that really deserved a director's cut this is certainly one of them so long as Jerry Goldsmith's music the soul of the picture remains in. Greame Revell composed a score for the unreleased longer version which I have heard and in no way compares to Goldsmith's thunderous adventure music. The lavish costumes set designs memorable characters and brilliant camera work somehow allow this film to overcome its editorial handicaps. All being said this is a film well worth watching.".

Antonio Banderas as the narrator of the piece and incidentally the 13th warrior was also fun to watch.  He has a knack for humor and uses it well.  The whole ensemble cast was a joy to watch as they moved throughout the film as a team of men who valued each others strengths and talents.The camera work in this film is dangerous and thrilling.

The final battle was nothing short of exhilarating and it was a joy to see Omar Sharif on the big screen again. This movie is very underrated and it went unnoticed...I think the marketing for this movie sucked. My biggest disappointment is that Jerry Goldsmith's score in this movie never received any award and surely his work in this one is one of the best ever to be put on film..on par with Randy Edelman's work in the last of the mohicans. The movie is never boring. Running only for 90 minutes there is no one dull moment or space for you to sit back and relax..everything happens fast and straight to the point. The direction and the cinematography are all top notch while the cast is great specially the actor who played Beowulf..his commanding presence on the screen totally ruled the movie.".

Fast paced but not too fastwith great scenic shots. I don't like the modern MTVStyle of editing with its fast cuts and sweeps. I like it a bit more subtle. And this is done here. The scene at the watchtower for example esp. the moment when the camera lingers a moment on Banderas when he is looking for the mist. Great! Second the scenery and production design. These guys should be very proud. Apart from one type of armor Helfdane the fat which is a bit too modern It looks like a Spanish ConquistadorArmor all look very neat and stylish As a Liveroleplayer I have to say I envy Bullwyf for his cloak. The weapons look real and authentic too. The buildings in the village and the great hall look like original replicas they have in Scandinavian museums. Third the cast. Perfectly cast through all roles. My personal favourites are Diane Venora as the Queen Sven Wollter as King Hrothgar and Kulich as Bulwyf. But all the others deliver peak performances. Last but not least is the script. I read the book Eater of the dead before I saw the movie. I liked the story and used it in several PP RPGsessions but after the film...whoooah. They took all that is possible to put in the movie and made that movie. Personally I rate the movie better than the book...no not better more entertaining since the book is more of a documentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early years of the 10th century an exiled Arabian nobleman falls in with a band of Vikings. Disgusted by their poor hygiene and their barbaric ways he nevertheless reluctantly agrees to accompany them to a distant kingdom where an unspeakable menace terrorizes the land. This is an interesting interpretation of the tale of Beowulf with the monster Grendel transformed into the fierce Wendol a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who have somehow survived long past their time. Despite the fact that Banderas is the title character and credited as the star he is not the hero here at all. The band of 13 is led by the huge and intimidating Buliwyf read Beowulf a hero among his people who must battle both the Wendol and their deadly mother. Alexander Gudonov lookalike Vladimir Kulich is the hero of this film and delivers a strong amazing performance. Banderas spends much of the film bumbling stumbling screwing up and trying to keep up with the Vikings who look upon him with contempt but finally perhaps grudgingly accept him. Okay so it's not entirely historically accurate and suffers from production problems and an occasional overdose of testosterone but it's not a bad movie by any means. The casting is great with standout performances by the aforementioned Kulich as well as Dennis Storhoi as Herger Banderas's translator and only friend the handsome Scottish actor Tony Curran in an unlikely kilt but who cares?!?! as the Celt Weath and the woefully underrated Richard Bremmer as the intimidating tattooed redheaded and damn sexy! Skeld. The film was worth watching for these three men alone but then I am female and perhaps a bit prejudiced in my opinions. These guys are HOT! But I digress... Beautiful scenery tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a bone strewn cave lift this movie well above average. There's something for everyone here fans of horror fans of action fans of classic literature should all find something to enjoy about this film. It may not be the best film ever made but its still one of my very favorites.".

It's sad that he belittled such a great movie because of it's box office failure. This movie has a LOTR feel about it without the high end production. The production here is just right for the story and cast. The main attraction over LOTR is that it only runs 103 minutes. Beware if you are easily affected by carnage.

What a joy to be able to say that the acting and directing strove to meet the same standards and succeeded! All of this is topped off with an intriguing and thought provoking story that is scripted to be humorous informative and very engaging. What a wonderful way to peek in to other cultures and world history. We've used this movie as a jumpingoff point for a wide range of discussions and further study. The fact that this is the story of Beowulf adds to the value as it will entice almost anyone into wanting to pick that worthy tome up again!

	schema:reviewBody "I feel the need to comment to a few of the reviews I read from the first page which I must say were totally offbase.A few notes at random and in no particular order.Several reviewers are evidently confused about the relationship of the movie to a textual source. Specifically they don't get the point because they misunderstand what it's trying to do. The movie is based on the novel Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton. This novel is a fictionalized history written in the form of an epic translation which it isn't and recounts what happens when a group of Norsemen accompanied by an Arab observer end up at war with a remnant population of Neandertals. Yes Neandertals. It's not completely ridiculous though the most recent evidence for neandertals that I know of I'm an archaeologist in northern Europe is about 25k before present. It didn't happen  it's just Crichton's device and it's a fun one. Neandertals are very close to modern people but not the same. They are in some sense Other and to xenophobes like medieval Norse they must have seemed well something like Grendel is discribed in Beowulf. When Crichton wrote this originally in the 1970s even less was known of Neandertals than now thus the brutish characterization exaggerated a bit by the movie.Once this background is adequately understood several criticisms should disappearA. One reviewer complains that the movie isn't faithful enough to the original text apparently believing in this case the text written by Ahmed ibnFahlan and published a few years ago. This reviewer appears unaware that this is a literary conceit on the part of the actual author Michael Crichton.B. Meanwhile a second reviewer complains that the movie is insufficiently close to the Beowulf myth. As implied by the above this criticism goes nowhere because it is not a simple retelling of Beowulf. Eaters of the Dead is Crichton's effort to fictionally historicize Beowulf by placing it in the context of a struggle of Norse against a remnant population of neandertals. The 13th Warrior is a pretty accurate retelling of the encounter as envisioned by Crichton and its relationship to Beowulf is as tangential as Crichton's.C. A review complains about the ragged mobs of bad guys clad in bear skins for no good reason. The reason is that there is good evidence to suppose Neandertals had a ritual life oriented in some way around cave bears. They might be ragged mobs because the book and movie are emphasizing their primitiveness relative to the modern humans they are fighting. I had more difficulty with Neandertal cavalry but there isn't any particular reason to believe a remnant population of Neandertals couldn't observe the use of domesticated horses steal some and figure it out from there.D. I didn't think that was the lamest love interest subplot ever by far. First the woman was gorgeous so it can't be a waste. heh okay Second it underscores the relatively casual attitude of the norse toward sex especially as initiated by women. This is obviously not a universal trait in medieval western cultures and is a nice historical touch. It would have been sappier if he'd stayed or she'd followed but neither happens. It's a moment of comfort and connection in a hopeless situation and works well in that context.E. We have no idea how a complex Neandertal society might work  there's no evidence to suggest they might ever have had one. For them to coalesce briefly around a few charismatic leaders and disperse when those leaders die is no stretch at all. In fact it's the most likely scenario. I'm not that'd happen in the middle of a battle but maybe it would. Who knows? After all if they had a structured society that didn't depend on the presence of charismatic leaders they'd be more visible in the archaeological record and might have been more of a threat. It'd be a different situation certainly. Anyway it's Crichton's story and it works.I have no particular rebuttal to those who didn't like the characters or the acting or whatever except to say I think they're dead wrong. And the reviewer suggesting this as MST2K material ... well...evidently doesn't know much about 13th Warrior OR MST2K. Trying to be nice here. Hint MST2K makes fun of bad movies not good ones. I love the characters and thought the chemistry was terrific. Visually it's stunning.The movie just works great on a lot of levels. It's just a quietly great movie. Certainly on my top 10 list and probably top 5. A lot of my friends avoided it in the theater but when I show them the video I haven't seen anyone not like it. I think it will have a solid second life. It should.Apologies for length".

Well in my personal opinion nothing is and that's why I was so enthusiast when I first heard about this Thirteenth Warrior being released! And even though I'll admit the film is flawed on several levels I enjoyed it very much and I'd like to encourage as much people as possible to find out more about the North men and their intriguing history. Coproducer Michael Crichton who also wrote the screenplay bases the 13th Warrior on his own Eaters of the Dead' novel. It's a tale of a banished Arab man who joins twelve North men on a conquest against an ancient form of evil. He learns their language and becomes a warrior during the journey he fights along against the Wendol'These are giant bearlike men who're extremely violent and savage. The good thing about The 13th Warriors is that it contains multiple impressive battle sequences and extremely interesting characters. For example the leader of the North men   Buliwyf   who's a truly overwhelming personality. The costumes and geographical settings are breath taking and perhaps even the most succeeded aspects in the entire production. And of course you can't tell a Viking tale without the use of explicit violencethe battles are pretty gruesome and the shed of blood is enormous. I didn't have a problem with that though. I even love it but it might be something to keep under consideration when you have a weak stomach and you're planning to watch this film. Yet it's only fair that I name a few of them negative elements The 13th Warrior suffers from. The largest parts of the script  and especially the dialogues  are very poorly written. The film also desperately tries to insert humor that is painfully unfunny and even embarrassing at times. Even the entire last battle scene may have been skipped since it's too heroic and a bit too much. Terrifically shot though. Antonio Banderas will never be a classA actor neitherluckily for him the accent works out well enough in stories like this. Nonetheless The 13th Warrior is good entertainment and the background of it is food for education! Vikings rule!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm writing a review for 13th warrior. The actors were very good they acted hard and tough. The setting was very realistic and matched the movie very well. The clothes they wore were very old fashion and great for this movie. They fit in very well. The dialogue was very good and you couldn't tell they weren't from that time period. The movie wasn't my taste but it was still a good movie for people that like those kinds of movies. I would recommend it to friends or somebody that is working of stuff Beowulf. 13th warrior is similar to Beowulf because there are big monsters destroying both of their villages and wrecking their lives. This movie represents Grendel and the dragon from Beowulf. The cannibal bear people would kill everybody and then eat them alive just like Grendel. The dragon is represented by warriors descending from the mountain with torches. These interpretations are very unique.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 13th Warrior may not match contemporary action film expectations and neither is it strictly a Beowulf allegory. While the film gives a nod to classic Epic literature the real magic is grown of roots in history. In Eaters of the Dead the novel which inspired the film writer Michael Crichton drew inspiration from the true story of Ibn Fadlan.Ahmed Ibn Fadlan was a poet and diplomat who lived in the caliphate of Bagdhad in the 10th century. He received a deputation in the year 921 A.D. to journey to the King of the Bulghars of the Volga as an emissary of the Caliph alMuqtadir. Fadlan outlined the details of this journey in his 'risala' or 'kitlab' diaryhistory. Somewhere along the way Fadlan found himself in the extensive company of an Eastern Scandinavian tribe called the Rusiyyah. The Rus were being raided by the Varangians a more barbarous tribe with customs rooted in prehistory. In his story Crichton calls the Varangians by the name of another barbaric European tribe the Wendols. From their name we get the English words vandal and vandalize  so one can imagine in what sorts of business they engaged.So this is the background for the film. Is the movie history? No but if one puts aside obvious errors such as Bulwyf's German plate armour 500 years ahead of its time or another warrior's Roman helmet 500 years after its time  the movie is enjoyable. The Rus were not Vikings with a capital V. They were Slavs who went a' viking meaning raiding. Ibn Fadlan spent years among the Bulgars Khazars and other Slavic tribes of the North. In all his travels he gave no more detail than what he wrote of his time with the Rus and of their battles. What Crichton has given us is not history but it is an entertaining point of departure from which to consider history. Next time you watch this movie imagine you are Ibn Fadlan come from a life of civilized luxury and suddenly thrown into this strange world. Try listening to the language understanding his fear. Imagine that you must face cultures and battles entirely alien to your experience. That is what the 13th Warrior is all about. It is the tale of the journey of the stranger in the strange land. It is a great adventure film one I've enjoyed dozens of times.".

My wife has zero interest in movies like this but that's cool. The film has a substantial creepy factor but it's pivotal to the storyline  and setting up the backdrop of fear and uncertainty.

I would like to remind those people that 13th Warrior is set in a place where expansive scenarios don't just appear and landscapes are not necessary when the movie is based around such a small area. The acting was exactly as I imagine it would be if the characters in the film were real people and the events that took place were real. Every one of the characters in the film seemed on cue in my opinion  which is obviously what these reviews represent  my opinions. And in my opinion you cannot fault the acting. As for plot... The 13th Warrior is a superb fest of testosterone larger than life characters and a simple course of events as seen from an outsider. There is no need for complex or boring plots and stories. The film isn't meant to satisfy only those who want such complexities the same people who would discard any fantasy movie as being too unreal. The 13th Warrior delivers. The inspiration I receive every time I watch this film  and I believe it is about once a month that I put it on again  is staggering. I love it entirely and cannot find a single reason to fault it  other than it is too short.If you can suspend your belief's and allow yourself to just absorb an action fantasy film this should delight. If it doesn't then I pity you.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film makes one wonder what would have happened if after the superb understated little gem that was Nomads Mctiernan had made something other than Die Hard. Apparently assorted screenplays for an adaptation of Michael Crichton's pseudohistorical novel Eaters of the Dead had been knocking around Hollywood for years before Crichton's name become forever associated with Jurassic Park. At that point the smell of money began to emanate from the project and so away we went. This could very easily have been awful. That it is actually an emotionally and structurally complete and satisfying film is in no small part due to its respectful and levelheaded treatment of two disparate and underexplored cultures both foreign to western audiences namely Umayad Arab and Viking. Anonio Banderas is as good as he has ever been as Ibn Fahdlan an unwilling ambassador to the Norsemen who finds himself part of a band of unusually believable heroes defending a crumbling Scandanavian kingdom against a possibly supernatural menace. The casting of to Americans at least unknown European actors as the viking warriors is key to making them seem to be so real and thus to committing the audience to their fate. Czech actor Vladimir Kulich as leader Buliwyf is a dominating presence and equal credit goes to the Norwegian Dennis Storhoi as the charmingly phlegmatic Herger the Joyous. Accepting that at some level this is The Seven Samuraii with longboats this is an original and entertaining experience. McTiernan making intelligent use of night and a rain machine films some of the better battle sequences in recent memory. He also presides over the most thoughtful if not totally plausible handling of different languages that I can recall seeing. It's sort of the next logical step from his transitioning from Russian to English on board the Red October. An interesting tale in a gorgeous and well thoughtout historical context. Entertaining without being mindless. In other words a rarity.".

As some have already pointed out the plot is quite thin even if you have to be totally illiterate in order not to figure out this wants to be a reinterpretation of Beowulf and has some bad inconsistencies. Of course there's no way an Arab speaking a semitic language would learn old Norse indoeuropean language in a few weeks by just listening etc etc etc.HOWEVER this isn't what this movie is about. The 13th Warrior is just a vehicle made to get the modernday man in touch with the kill or be killed stand your ground or everyone in your village dies spirit. I mean if the scene where Buliwyf barely drags his feet and his sword to stand in the way of the incoming onslaught of the primitive's cavalry charge doesn't fill you with adrenaline and with the sudden urge to grab a damn spear or something it means that you're either a old woman or... well let's not go there you know what I mean D On top of that I'm willing to bet that many of the bad reviews are actually caused by the very positive depiction that this film gives to Arabs. Add positive view on Arabs to Norse mythology and you easily can figure out why some critics will rate this movie as complete crap. Well it isn't.Someone wrote here with acted disgust that this is a movie for men who like to bang their chest with their fists gorilla style.

Neither side approves of their romance so obviously kung fu action ensues with a soundtrack by Aaliyah.";

It manages to be a romantic film without being sappy and stupid it manages to be an action film where the action rocks but isn't too overthetop and it manages to make good use of the Shakesphere story ROMEO AND JULIET while still respecting the themes and the humor. Generally the film is pretty silly. The acting isn't particularly good the characters are two dimensional the plot holes are numerous and events are sometimes quite predictable. However I don't regret watching it. I was entertained and was satisfied by the film as a whole. It worked really well. If you're looking for a good film that doesn't require a lot of thought and investment from the viewer but is at least entertaining and energetic ROMERO MUST DIE is a good film to check out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not usually a fan of this type of allout Action movie Romeo Must Die knocked me off balance when I found it to be one of the best films I have ever enjoyed. Producer Joel Silver Who also produced The Matrix describes the film as an Urban rendition of Romeo and Juliet and although this is a very simple way of looking at the film it's not far off the mark. Like the great Shakespeare work there are two opposing families in this film each looking to make big commercial gains in the world of real estate development. Caught up in their lies greed and violence are Trish O'Day Played by Aaliyah and Han Sing Played by Jet Li. The story revolves around their quickly blooming relationship and the opposing families around them.The film boasts some serious eye candy with some of the best special effects you'll see. Luckily this is not the only good thing going for the movie as the eye candy is wonderfully supported by some fantastic performances from the cast. In her first feature movie Aaliyah is absolutely breath taking as Trish O'Day. Showing the kind of charm and 'x' factor that few will ever have she alone makes this film a must see. Jet Li's performance is as always about his skills as a martial artist but his scripted acting continues to improve. Another stand out performance for me was that of D.B. Woodside who plays Trish O'Days brother  Colin. Although not such a major role D.B. excels in this role. High end production values mean the film has a real style and gloss to it and everything fits in place and the story moves along at just the right pace. In fact Romeo Must Die is a shining example of how good story telling does not need to be lost in a sea of special effects and glossy American values. Jonathon Ross describes the film as Fast Furious Fun which is definitely true but there is more to this film that the audience can take away with them. The reason the film works is that it works on two levels  storyline and action. You can enjoy both aspects and take from them what you like. This is a brilliant film and I highly recommend it.".

Most of the black characters even the villians are sympathetically portrayed even though the hero is Asian. Aaliyah is wholesomely sexy and quite beautiful.  Russell Wong is phenomenal is a very short role.  This guy has the looks style and presence of Russell Crowe. Jet Li however is very humane and appealing though his character is underwritten. Most of the asian characters are shortchanged dramatically. However the white primarily Jewish characters are shortchanged the most.  They receive the brunt of the ugly stereotyping. The kungfu sequences are nothing special.  They are too fast and too confusing to be completely effective.  Though neat the Xray effect detracted from the realism sort of like the old split screen and slomo effects of the 1960s films. Bonecrunching is far more effective and would someone please dispense with this flying nonsense?  I don't want to see anything up there or the screen that is not physically possible. Special note must be made of Francoise Yip the Female bike  fighter.  If Ms. Yip did all her own stunts she's not only stunningly beautiful she is also awesome. One quibble which I feel follows a disturbing pattern in motion pictures.  Though Jet Li and Aaliyah are quite obviously in love at the close of the film they never kiss.  In a film which shows two beautiful asian dances french kiss and one bares the other's breast and kisses her erect nipplewould it have been too much to ask to have to people of different races who are obviously in love share a romantic kiss?".

He proves that not only can he kick but has some acting ability in there as well.  Aaliyah is not great but fills the role nicely as Li's romantic interest.  The other characters are left beautifully in the background until the necessary time when they spring to the limelight to steal the show however briefly from Li.Ok so it isn't his best martial arts movie that was probably the Legend of Fong SaiYuk but his fighting is coupled with an excellent story one that is far more elaborate than a simple Romeo and Juliet with less of the soppy love stuff too.For any martial arts mystery action thriller even dare I say sports a wonderful American Football scene film fan will love this film.Definitely one for any video collection!".

	schema:reviewBody "I read some notsogreat reviews about Romeo must Die so I really didn't have my hopes up high. I only decided to watch it because I love Jet Li. Good thing I did watch it!! It was SO cool!! Jet Li didn't disappoint  not only was his fighting as 'wow' as ever and I know a lot of people think too much CGI was used compromising his true abilities. I agree with that but you have to admit it still looked pretty dayam good his dramatic acting is amazing too!! However living in Hong Kong I DO have a few problems with the film. Firstly it REALLY exaggerates the whole Asian thing making it seem like we Chinese all practice Kung Fu in our backyards while drinking Oolong tea every day...which in fact is NOT what Hong Kong people do yes I'm sorry if I'm shattering some dreams here  Hong Kong people do too watch television and shop and do things other than learn Kung Fu. In fact you'd be hardpressed to find one person in Hong Kong who knows martial arts Jet Li style. The Chinese people in the film all have names like Po and Han and say things like let's show them our true strength...I'm surprised they didn't put some phrases like Let's summon our family's ancestral dragons in. ALSO I was really confused when they showed Hong Kong. It was nothing like the Hong Kong and all but one person spoke in Mandarin most people in Hong Kong speak cantonese. I'm not sure if that bit WAS actually Hong Kong but...if you're going to say that he's in prison in Hong Kong why choose a place which does NOT give a proper image of Hong Kong? There must've also been some confusion with Chinese and Japanese because I swear at times Han's Jet Li's character dad seems more Jap than anything...Still I liked the film. There wasn't enough development between Jet and Aaliyah but Jet Li still looked really cute. Jet Li really kicks something serious in the movie and so I let all the other things slide  even the idea that the Chinese guys turn out to be the bad guys and the black guys turn out to be actually...awww...really nice people. Lindo was good and Aaliyah was REALLY REALLY good. It's sad  she would have made a terrific actress and I'm happy that she did leave behind at least this movie.Watch this movie. I just realised that my review doesn't actually sound too positive but trust me  I really did like the film. In fact I'm going to watch it again now!".

Playing Han was a big one for him. Aaliyah19792001 the RB sensation really got her acting chops in gear playing the alluring Trish O'Day who is being shadowed by the bumbling Maurice played by the hilarious Anthony Anderson. Everybody would call him MORON! Which I think is funny.I liked the Xray effects of the movie whenever a fight was going to happen. I liked the part when Han refused to a fight a woman he used Trish to fight her with. It looked more of a swing dance to me. Since Trish's words backed him up the enemy was impaled through the heart. And after the final fight Trish's father Delroy Lindo wanted to meet Han for himself and I 'm glad he got that chance I think it was silly for him to demand a handshake from him but hey he wanted to who the cat was and make sure he did. Han never declined any offer only to know who was the troublemaker behind the war. Before anyone remember seeing Aaliyah in Queen of the Damned check out this movie first. Rating 4 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say right off the bat that I was very disappointed with this movie. Jet Li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen with credentials in martial arts not acting that rival the late great Bruce Lee and easily surpass Jackie Chan.  He can do things with his body that I can't even do in my dreams.Having said that I sat through this movie wondering to myself Why did they feel the need to CGI enhance these fight scenes?  He can do amazing things by himself!  By inexplicably making him jump 30 feet in the air while kicking in 9 directions at once they serve only to discredit his true athletic ability.  And not only did they meddle with his fighting talent but they did it so poorly.  The tampered scenes are very obvious with more visible seams than a tailor shop.  Granted the xray effects were a welcome change but that was about all this movie had to offer in terms of fresh ideas.The plot is drawn out at great lengths with fight scenes a little too few and far between for my tastes.  Also I felt the black gangsters were overdeveloped while the asian gangsters were underdeveloped Russell Wong's character is barely on the screen for 10 minutes of the movie while Isiah Washington's incessant melodrama drowns out a good portion of the flick.I think most of the problem comes from the overambitious screenplay.  The premise is a good one  asian mafia versus black gangsters.  However there are two roads this premise could have taken.  Either A they could have turned it into a hardcore action pic about gang violence with lots of guns fighting double crossing etc. or B they could have made a romantic tragedy focusing on the struggles between the two lovers because of their opposite backgrounds.  This movie strives desperately to do both but the end result is that neither aspect is fully explored leaving a mediocreatbest storyline for the cast to work with.So on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd have to give this movie about a 4.  It had a lot of promise and I was hoping to see Jet Li showcased to his full potential but it appears that his ship has yet to come.".

This is my favourite Jet Li movie others include Kiss of the Dragon Unleashed Born to defend and Black mask. The late Aliyah looks great as ever especially when she takes Li to the night club. DMX appears in this movie in a small role he later makes a Decent movie alongside Li in Cradle 2 the grave. It wasn't exactly a Blockbuster Hit of a movie but it was Great Fun. There is a large number of actors another actor that provides laughs are Maureen who also appears in cradle 2 the grave. One of my favourite scenes is when Jet Li plays football and is sarcasticlly fouled on purpose. He decides to take advantage of the rules and hit back in a Great Way. Recommended if you enjoyed Jet Li Movies.".

Fear not once you see ROMEO MUST DIE.There isn't much else to say about how this movie's tone jumps all over the place. It's a predictable but decently engaging movie. What makes it worth renting is the presence of Aaliyah Jet Li and especially Delroy Lindo. There's little doubt this movie did well off the marquee value of those first twoand they're both good here separately and togetherbut Lindo is a great actor and invests Isaak O'Day with a dramatic presence that insists we take him seriously. It's a huge tragedy that Aaliyah died so young and a great loss for the movies she would have been superb in she saves her thin poorly developed character from being useless and makes Trish interesting.  Jet Li shows he can be tough or funny whatever's needed at the moment and it's nice to see an action star who seems to LIKE doing action film roles. Note I have to agree with Roger Ebert that seeing Li doing FXaided fight scenes was pathetic Li's a fighting FX just by being himself and we saw that in LETHAL WEAPON 4 and hopefully will again in the future.For all that this and GONE IN 60 SECONDS were the quintissential average films of 2000.

	schema:reviewBody "Romeo Must Die is an action drama starring Jet Li Aaliyah and Delroy Lindo.Hong Kong cinema standout Jet Li spent the 80s and 90s mostly known to Asian and select international audiences. His American introduction was as a heavy in Lethal Weapon 4 for Li a rare turn as a villain.Apparently Lethal producer Joel Silver promised a lead heroic role as a followup and Romeo Must Die was the vehicle.The film is a very looselyupdated take on Shakespeare's Romeo  Juliet but don't look for any allegories except in the broadest of strokes.Li plays Han a 30ish Hong Kong police officer who took the fall for a crime he didn't commit allowing his father and younger brother to escape the Chinese mainland to the United States.Po's father Chu turns out to be a career racketeer and as the story opens up in Oakland California he is in the midst of a violent turf conflict with a prominent black gang boss Isaak O'Day Delroy Lindo. Aggravating the conflict is the recent mysterious murder of Han's brother Po Chu blames O'Day's gang but Isaak is firm in denying any involvement.Meanwhile Isaak is working on a mysterious real estate project and his top lieutenant Mac Isaiah Washington may have his own secret plans.Trish Aaliyah runs a small boutique in Oakland possibly a vanity gift from her dad and she catches the eye of Han who comes to her store while following clues left behind by his brother.The bodyguards who work for Isaak openly don't like the Chinese fellow getting too close to Trish so problems ensue and the fists and feet start flying.The mystery gradually unfolds about who killed Po and just what the big plans are of Isaak. This is explored alongside a very chaste romance between Han and Trish.Character actors like Lindo Washington and Russell Wong help anchor the film which could have gone in a campy direction.Aaliyah is very pleasing in her debut role and comes across as very natural in portraying the collegeaged Trish.Jet Li is very capable in all the martial arts sequences which likely is the main reason for watching this film. Since English is not his native language it's difficult to judge him for coming across as a little stiff. Still at a fantasy level it would have been interesting to see an AsianAmerican in the Han role and dispense with the conceit of being foreign bornandraised.Viewers should also recognize a younger Anthony Anderson Blackish in an early role here as a hapless henchman.Rapper DMX has an important bit role here as well.The director Andres Bartowiak is Eastern European in origin making this movie very multicultural in its filmmaking pedigree.This movie is very worth checking out as it is basically taking a Bmovie premise and giving it an extremely glossy look. In fact it is not unlike a 90 minute music video full of hiphop music in the background for various scenes.".

However I enjoyed the soundtrack more than the movie itself. Not saying it was a horrible movie it was just OK. I wish the fight scenes were more authentic. You could tell they were choreographed. When I watch a movie like this I want it to look like people are really fighting each other. I also felt that Jet Li and Aaliyah lacked in the chemistry department. Sure they look good together as friends andor partners in crime but nothing more and I mean nothing. Anything beyond that seemed forced. I actually felt the entire cast lacked in chemistry. There were a couple of twists that were unexpected and the plot was OK but nothing to really knock your socks off. It is entertaining if nothing else is on TV or if you just want to watch the beautiful Aaliyah in action. For me it is a bit nostalgic for that reason. Also I was still a teenager when this came out and this was the movie to watch at that time. Again not the worst movie but not the best. I will admit that I have probably watched this at least 5 times. Sometimes I just can't say no because although it is not perfect it is still entertaining.".

When I watch a movie like this I want it to look like people are really fighting each other. I also felt that Jet Li and Aaliyah lacked in the chemistry department. Sure they look good together as friends andor partners in crime but nothing more and I mean nothing. Anything beyond that seemed forced. I actually felt the entire cast lacked in chemistry. There were a couple of twists that were unexpected and the plot was OK but nothing to really knock your socks off. It is entertaining if nothing else is on TV or if you just want to watch the beautiful Aaliyah in action. For me it is a bit nostalgic for that reason. Also I was still a teenager when this came out and this was the movie to watch at that time. Again not the worst movie but not the best. I will admit that I have probably watched this at least 5 times. Sometimes I just can't say no because although it is not perfect it is still entertaining.";

What resulted were some awesome martial arts sequences courtesy of Jet Li seeing him grapple with the gang members left and right were both great and funny especially him throwing around Anthony Anderson. The humor in the movie was also pretty topnotch and gave me some chuckles but the acting was a bit average to me and the hiphop soundtrack was pretty awful. However Jet Li and Aaliyah had some great chemistry together in her first motion picture Aaliyah delivered a pretty witty and dramatic performance.Overall it's a good action film with a wellpaced plot.Grade B".

However what he finds is a supposed gang war between Chinese and Black businessmen looking to build a water front stadium.  Han teams up with Trish to find the killers.This was Jet Li's first big lead role in the US and unfortunately it's a disappointment.  The story is OK but almost everything else is a letdown. First the fight scenes  where are they?!  Jet Li is hugely talented but here he isn't allowed to shine  a lot of his scenes uses very obvious CGI why?  The CGI takes away from  his own ability put him on wires and make it look natural!  Secondly to keep the black audience Li isn't allowed to fight any black character seriously or kill any of them! so most of his fights with Lindo's goons are handled for comedy effect.  The only decent fights in the film are the one where Li uses Aaliyah as a weapon and of course the final showdown between Li and the Chinese lieutenant.The second problem is that the film makers clearly didn't want to upset the black audience by having too many unsympathetic black characters in the film.  For example all the Chinese mobsters are bad guys who get their fate whereas Lindo leads the black gang but isn't a bad guy and only one of the black gang turns out to be bad and any black person who gets killed only gets killed by another black person.  This is part of the reason why Li's fights feel so muted  check out the comedy' touch football or the fact that the fat black guy always seems to have a good line to deliver while being kicked.This is a few steps away from the blackploitation films of the 70's where producers deliberately made films to get the blackdollar.  I don't mind that if it creates good films.  The black cast are good Washington is good even when he's playing a cartoon character like here Lindo is always good and even DMX is alright.  The R n'B soundtrack is also great but the problem is that no one wants to upset the audience and the whole film feels like it's trying to be some sort of PC black movie.  Hence the black gangsters are either comedy figures or are good people at heart while the Chinese gangs are money grabbing murders.  It also explains why Aaliyah and Li despite having a romantic involvement never get to kiss or anything else. I don't want to appear that this is a big deal but to me this PCness ruined everything from the fights the characters right down to the romance between Li and Aaliyah.Li and Aaliyah are both good.  Aaliyah is a surprise as I thought she'd just be another hiphopRn'B star making an illadvised jump to films but she was good.  Lindo and Washington are as good as ever but both are better than comicbook bad guy roles. The Chinese roles are never developed and only remain bad guys till the end.  However the cast shouldn't matter  we should have been blown away by the action  just like in all Li's Hong Kong movies. Why did the producers get such a great martial arts actor only to waste his talents by having poor fights that rely on CGI?Overall the film is just about enjoyable but it's hard to watch it without seeing the wasted opportunities at every step.".

Thus it becomes the murdered man's brother Han Sing Jet Li who is locked away in a Chinese prison to escape and go to America. Once there he seeks out his family and the leaders of the three gangs to learn who killed his brother. However when he arrives in America Sing is lovingly captured by beauty Trish O'Day Aaliyah and discovers that the gang leaders each have their own reason for the murder. With the superior cast of actors the movie gravitates towards dark drama excitement and a flurry of Martial Arts action. These include Isaiah Washington Russell Wong and versatile Delroy Lindo. It is the incredible action scenes which give this film it's highly charged entertainment atmosphere which is kept on high speed throughout the story. Jet Li and his opponents offer the audience an exciting run for it's money and one which is sure to establish first and foremost that he is indeed a worthy candidate to fill the shoes of the great Bruce Lee.

	schema:headline " A lot of people seem to like this movie even though it doesn't have enough action or Jet Li.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  12 out of Jet Li kicks ass. There's no doubt about it. My first introduction to him was in Lethal Weapon 4 and that film's most memorable action sequence was easily the twoonone raindrenched finale where Li was thiiiisss close to killing both Riggs and Murtaugh. Romeo Must Die was his first lead role in an American production and I feel unfortunate to report it didn't live up to my expectations.Li stars as Han Sing a former cop from China who escapes from prison to avenge the death of his brother. This leads him all the way to Oakland where his father a local crime lord is in contention with a rival black gang headed by Delroy Lindo over an NFL land deal that could make serious money. Turns out all the people living in the desired territory who have no intention of signing their property over are being killed off by the two gangs. With virtually no one to trust Han turns to the rival boss's daughter Aahliyah for help.The movie is very loosely based on Romeo and Juliet but despite what the purist naysayers might think the thought of adapting the play into a martial arts thriller actually seemed like an interesting idea. But the film boasts nothing in the way of effective romance. Li and the late Aahliyah have almost no chemistry together their pairing is awkward and stilted and it's even more offputting that it seems as if the filmmakers themselves look down on this interracial romance. The closest they get to intimacy is a hug and even that looks like a hesitant move.Love story aside Romeo Must Die is actually part kungfu flick and part hiphop gangster movie blaring with an obtrusive rap soundtrack. The latter genre doesn't serve the former particularly well. The rap music interferes with the fight scenes the attempts at storytelling are shoddy and confusing and the rivalry between the gangs isn't the slightest bit compelling. The plot is mostly nonsense seeing as it relies on duping its audience into believing nobody in the press would somehow catch onto the connection between all these mysterious deaths and this highprofile NFL deal.Far worse is the fact that Romeo Must Die simply doesn't have enough action especially for a film that runs nearly two hours. It also doesn't help a lot of these fights are a bit awkwardly filmed with distracting attempts at style Xray shots of bones breaking for no reason whatsoever and generally poor framing of what should be spectacularlooking moves. I can only think of two action sequences I truly enjoyed a playful fight in an alley and the climactic showdown between Li and Russell Wong. But even that last fight much like the rest of the action is marred by ridiculouslooking wirework and CGI.Recent addendum It wouldn't be for another five years if you don't count the more balletic Hero that Li would regain ground in his traditional bonecrunching kungfu subgenre. Thankfully the recently released Unleashed gave the martial arts star the right script cast and filmmakers to work with and the results were fabulous. Check that film out instead.".

Li and the late Aahliyah have almost no chemistry together their pairing is awkward and stilted and it's even more offputting that it seems as if the filmmakers themselves look down on this interracial romance. The closest they get to intimacy is a hug and even that looks like a hesitant move.Love story aside Romeo Must Die is actually part kungfu flick and part hiphop gangster movie blaring with an obtrusive rap soundtrack. The latter genre doesn't serve the former particularly well. The rap music interferes with the fight scenes the attempts at storytelling are shoddy and confusing and the rivalry between the gangs isn't the slightest bit compelling. The plot is mostly nonsense seeing as it relies on duping its audience into believing nobody in the press would somehow catch onto the connection between all these mysterious deaths and this highprofile NFL deal.Far worse is the fact that Romeo Must Die simply doesn't have enough action especially for a film that runs nearly two hours. It also doesn't help a lot of these fights are a bit awkwardly filmed with distracting attempts at style Xray shots of bones breaking for no reason whatsoever and generally poor framing of what should be spectacularlooking moves. I can only think of two action sequences I truly enjoyed a playful fight in an alley and the climactic showdown between Li and Russell Wong. But even that last fight much like the rest of the action is marred by ridiculouslooking wirework and CGI.Recent addendum It wouldn't be for another five years if you don't count the more balletic Hero that Li would regain ground in his traditional bonecrunching kungfu subgenre. Thankfully the recently released Unleashed gave the martial arts star the right script cast and filmmakers to work with and the results were fabulous. Check that film out instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment the antihero version of Dick Tracy herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors.There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film her role includes the only nudity content of her boxoffice movies career. Yet Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool starts walking in Eve outlook looking for her Adam then Newman comes by.The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch she asks him Do you love me?. He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits and hinders himself from replying No I just love your tits. Thankfully Mel speaks before him I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not. If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life they might be right.The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now and don't know who Patrick Malone is it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon1991.Even though the cast is rich on paper the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him and he acts only with his selfbelief. From my point of view the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman James Garner Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast since the storyline is so simple.".

He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon1991.Even though the cast is rich on paper the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him and he acts only with his selfbelief. From my point of view the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman James Garner Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast since the storyline is so simple.";

Unfortunately there are no sparks in this slow evolving take on deceit and an unsolved crime in L.A.The opening scenes are deceiving because they take place in Puerto Vallarta. We see Harry Ross a private investigator going to the rescue of a rich girl Mel Ames. Mel is a gorgeous creature that is seen in all her glory and it seems to have been planned that way in order to hook the viewer into staying for the rest of the story. Alas beautiful Mel goes straight and is only seen in a couple of other scenes! We lose that's all!As a film noir there are too many things that don't make sense in Twilight. The film is not a complete waste although the pace being slow doesn't add anything to the story or the way we feel after sitting through it after a while.Paul Newman makes an interesting appearance as Harry. James Garner another great personality does the best with the small part of Raymond Hope. Susan Sarandon is mysterious and secretive as Catherine and Gene Hackman doesn't have much to do. Reese Witherspoon making her screen debut is lovingly captured by the camera. Stockard Channing one of the best stage and film actress working in films today is wasted. Giancarlo Esposito is the only one that brings a badly needed comic relief to the movie. M. Emmet Walsh Liev Schrieber Margo Martindale and John Spencer play minor roles.While the film is far from horrible but it requires a lot of patience from the viewer. The crisp cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski gives the film a beautiful patina. Also the moody music score of Elmer Bernstein and the production design of David Gropman contribute to make the film appear much better than it is.".

What I liked about the script were the subtle dialogues ranging from Samuel Johnson misquotes to acerbic oneliners that developed each of the characters slowly. Take the mistyeyed Lt.

Newman Hackman Garner Channing and Sarandon provide sophisticated and amusing banter. Although Ms. Sarandon and Channing are somewhat younger than the aforementioned actors they blend in with the boys smoothly. The talents of the supporting cast Liev Reese Giancarlo and muchoMargo Martindale are not lost either. The depth and intricacy of the story line does not suffer as a result of the cute and witty banter rather the humor augments the tone and helps to set the stage for the evolving dramatic plot twists.I would be remiss to exclude lauding the hauntingly beautiful and appropriate soundtrack and recurring theme by Elmer Bernstein. His contribution is as important to the subtlety and color of the story line as any cast member's. Although all the characters shine in this Hollywood detective escapade Mr. Garner shines the brightest in his sardonically gritty role even in its more limited time allotment. A good flick to catch especially if you like the subtlety of substance over form!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to attend the first UK screening of Shane Meadows' latest offering THIS IS ENGLAND last Tuesday at the London Film Festival. Having been a fan of Meadows' work since seeing TWENTYFOURSEVEN in 1998 I have anticipated each of his new films with excitement and great interest. Meadows' films defy categorisation and always exceed expectation as anyone who has seen A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS or DEAD MAN'S SHOES will attest. THIS IS ENGLAND had a lot to live up to Set during the summer of 1983 THIS IS ENGLAND is the story of Shaun Thomas Turgoose a precocious twelveyearoldcoming to terms with the death of his father. Shaun is soon inducted into a group of local skinheads a fun loving bunch who spend days committing petty vandalism and listening to ska records. Although much younger than the other members of the group Shaun endears himself upon them with his sheer determination and defiance and is quickly embraced as their mascot. However the frivolity and naivety comes to an abrupt conclusion when exmember Combo Steven Graham is released from a spell in prison. Combo soon causes a rift within the group and becomes the catalyst for them becoming a militant racist force.Anyone familiar with Meadows' earlier work will notice many parallels between this and A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS the film is told from a child's perspective and the corruption of youthinnocence is an underlining theme. Like ROMEO BRASS THIS IS ENGLAND manages to balance the lighthearted and often hilarious with menace and tension that's excruciating to endure. Many British films that attempt dramedy falter because one or the otherboth is unconvincing but Meadows manages to combine comedy and drama seamlessly the laughs come thick and fact but the jolts come harder than a kick to the head.Typically for a Meadows film THIS IS ENGLAND is exceptionally well written with some infectious dialogue and fullyfleshed characters though one of the film's standout attributes is that of Danny Cohen's cinematography. Being a film set during the 80s its look plays a significant part in the audience buying into the film. Many 80sset films have been betrayed by garish lighting and ultimately end up looking like contemporary people parading around in 20yearold clothing. Cohen's photography really manages to encapsulate the bleak feeling that was evident of the time and is both gritty and dour. THIS IS ENGLAND is a film without polished aesthetics and one that has the raw visual style that's not be seen since the films of Alan Clarke SCUM MADE IN Britain THE FIRM.In addition to the film's look Meadow's has raided the vaults for a whole host of archive footage leading thirtysomething viewers on a trip down memory lane. The credit sequence alone features footage from Roland Rat the Falklands and Knight Rider As a child of the 80s I literally sat in the cinema beaming  It's a great hook into a wonderful film.As assured as Meadows' writing and direction is the film benefits greatly from its ensemble cast. Predominantly made up of teenagers the cast of THIS IS ENGLAND excel beyond belief without one putting a foot wrong. A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS' Andrew Shim is superb as Milky as is Stephen Graham as Combo  who gives a terrific and complex performance. However THIS IS ENGLAND belongs to Thomas Tommo Tugoose  for a dbutant child actor he is astonishing and effortlessly conveys the array of mixed emotions the material requires.In conclusion THIS IS ENGLAND is essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in film. Once again Meadows has set a precedent for British filmmakers and has eclipsed many of his contemporaries. THIS IS ENGLAND may not make for comfortable viewing but it is cinema at its best.".

We are given a glimpse into the lifestyle of a group of characters over a short period of time. It is very much a fly on the wall type of movie. The point of these films is to understand the actions of the characters rather than judging their actions. I have no doubt that there will be some people that tag this film as being racist which is rather missing the point.The film follows Shaun a 12 year old being borough up in early 80's England. He has lost his father in the Falklands war and suffers bullying and isolation until he is befriended by a group of skinheads. The happy band are challenged when Combo is released from prison. Thomas Turgoose is magnificent in the lead role and the directionscreenplay are also spot on the mark. For anybody that lived through the period there are lots of reminders about the period. The film is based on Meadow's own childhood and is quite mesmerising at times.I was gripped throughout the film and it also gave me plenty to think about afterwards. What more can you ask for when going to the movies? I suppose if you go to the movies for escapism then go watch something else but if you want a gripping thought provoking drama then it doesn't come much better than this. Outstanding!".

Just as the effectively chilling bloody yet arguably flawed Dead Man's Shoes showcased a passionate return to low budget focused film making This Is England sees him perfect his technique. It is a seemingly effortless achievement that matches a warm humorous portrayal of a young lad growing up with his experience of the cold brutality that came with the 80s skinhead culture. The way in which Shane blends these two aspects together without compromising on either is most impressive.Delivering a surprising enchanting performance in the lead role as Shaun Thomas Turgoose portrays a youngster of incredible warmth and charisma. He is befriended by a relatively harmless gang skirting with the skinhead culture rife at the time. His strength of character in the face of the adversity life throws his way is truly unforgettable a credit to both Shane as the writer and Thomas as the performer. As Shaun discovers the joy of belonging in the gang the viewer takes a similar journey. Through sublime use of another excellent soundtrack an ear for music in relation to visuals is one of Shane's most loved and respected trademarks the joy of youth and life literally springs from the screen.What is particularly successful is Shane's restraint where it comes to grounding the film in reality. It would have been all too easy to escalate these events above and beyond the core group of characters creating a power struggle on a much bigger thrill friendly scale. Instead the film remains focused and convincing not once do you doubt the likelihood of events. The canvas may be smaller but emotionally This Is England resonates more powerfully than ever before taking the harsh greys of a story like Dead Man's Shoes and enlightening it with a central character full of warmth and honesty. In the end this serves to engage the viewer on a much greater level.It is in comedy that This Is England truly surprises not the usual splash of dark humour but humour of much broader appeal. Thomas' performance brings the sharp dialogue to life with a wonderful physical range the first half the film is crammed with delightful comic moments that really draw you in to the character making future events all the more affecting. Much is made of Shaun's romance with a much older girl the scenes are tearjerking in their tender wonderfully observed realism. There is much in the film that will trigger moments of recognition in the viewer especially but not exclusively those who were young in the 80s.As big time skinhead Combo the other stand out performance of the piece from Scouser Stephen Graham comes out of jail the film takes a UTurn presenting a troubling unrestrained view on racism through extreme nationalism getting deep under the skin to question the source and nature of such hatred. It is in this that we realise this is a study of human nature as Shaun is presented with more extreme acts that drive him to question the moral behind such irrational prejudices.Book ending the film is real news footage of the political climate surrounding the events depicted prominent among which is Maggie Thatcher's invasion of the Falklands a conflict that's consequences prove key to the central narrative When asked Will we ever talk to the Argentines again? on a radio interview Thatcher purrs No I don't think so The parallels are fitting and thoroughly engaging. Inspired shaped and formed by Shane's own childhood This Is England is ultimately an honest confident piece of film making right from the heart. The film is a wonderful example of what British cinema has to offer the world. The film may be grounded in period authenticity but the narrative is ultimately applicable to all of us having experienced the inescapable process of growing up. Shaun's quality shines through his experienced may be unique but the messages conveyed are most certainly universal.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the success of 'Dead Man's Shoes' local filmmaker Shane Meadows returns with 'This is England' a story of absence and isolation belonging and the power of persuasion. Set in 1983 with a backdrop of the war in the Falklands the film opens with a montage of relevant images everything from Maggie Thatcher to Knight Rider that really take you back and put you in the right space to meet Shaun. Shaun the films central character played superbly by newcomer Thomas Turgoose is a typical eighties kid riding round on his griffter washing neighbours cars for cash to buy a catapult and being constantly picked on for being different. When we first meet him we quickly learn that his father was a victim of the war raging at Maggie's command. Enter the gang Woody Milky Pukey et all a rag tag bunch of mods and skinheads complete with crimped haired girlfriends with the absence of his father and any real sense of being part of something Shaun is quickly welcomed into the group and takes up not just the mannerisms or clothes but drinking smoking and growing up to quickly. Things go OK for a while until Combo arrives on the scene. Straight out of prison and a British blooded skinhead through to his core you can sense trouble on the horizon. Soon the gang becomes segmented because of differences of opinion and fuelled by the war and the council estate mentality of accepting foreigners' things start to spiral out of control and Shaun finds himself in way above his head. A brilliantly written script that can at times have you laughing out loud and at others sitting nervously on the edge of your seat as the tension builds is delivered well by all the cast. The music is fitting mixing eighties chart hits with haunting piano pieces and the cinematography is close to a previous Meadows outing 'A Room for Romeo Brass' which gives it a feel like it was filmed in the eighties. The attention to detail is brilliant as shop shelves are laden with products we no longer see or have long since upgraded there packaging. One of the scariest things was it was hard to imagine that time in this country because any of us who lived through it have almost chosen to block it out completely but it was done so well and had me fishing in my memory to fit things into the time scale being used. There is defiantly a more matured Meadows at work here but he's lost none of his cheeky charm and observational skill and the characters he's created could have easily have lived next door to me growing up. The metaphor of the country getting behind Thatcher in the Falklands juxtaposed with that of the skinheads including the initiated Shaun getting behind the slightly off kilter Combo is handled with a great sense of poignancy and it is moving to see both stories unfold from within the film and library footage. Racism and intolerance are by no means behind us but here we are shown one of the skeletons in the Great British sic closet through the eyes of a child and one who would grow up to represent the next generation. Meadows has said in interviews that it is partly based on his experiences growing up and he sees a lot of himself in Shaun I saw a lot of me in the character but I also saw memories I'd have rather forgotten. Funny British and bleak Meadows is slowly climbing the ranks to join the Mike Leigh's and Ken Loach's of this world and if this film is anything to go by it wont take him very long. Any fan of Meadows previous work will love it and no doubt delight in his continuing growth as a filmmaker but everyone should see it regardless as it is another fine example of British film at its rawest and best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seen at BFI  London Film Festival Shane Medows take on proNazi minority groups comes at a time where racist extremism is uncannily blurred itself out of the picture. Although we are familiar with the non less aesthetic fear to terrorist attacks by fundamentalist Muslim groups we have somehow forgot the 'collateral' damage that could arise in the eve of a Parissuburbstyle racial riot.This is England perpetuates a picture of a country not far from the one we are overlooking now but puts aside the blossoming images sold to the outside world of a hectic and prosperous London and a gay Brighton. The film takes us back to the Thatcher years in a clearly accentuated north of England ridden by jobless youth and financially stretch families encapsulating a small landscape of issues that stirred the nation under the Iron Lady's rule.Medows takes us in what could be described as the deep England journey. North of the black underground line lay other counties where unemployment and lack of cultural resources are becoming predecessors for extremist thoughts. Social tensions are on the rise and a new radical party The National Front is taking advantage of the situation by blending anger and national pride rallying people around the country.Matching the style of Mathieu Kassovitz also director and writer in La Haine historical footage of the poque is embedded in between frames to illustrate the social expression of society. Furthermore Danny Cohen's photography beautifully sets the landscape for the characters to take centre stage.The storyline evolves around a social microcosmos. The characters represent the blue print of residual society perpetuated in the form of Shaun Thomas Turgoose. At a very young age Shaun has already endured the loose of his father at the Falklands War as well as facing financial hardship. He stands daily bulling from school peers which brings him to state of outcast.He then becomes approached by an urban tribe of Skamod skinheads. The group takes him under its wing as if a sort of mascot although Shaun quickly becomes a strong character within the group thanks to his stand up attitude. The group is soon divided by the return of old gang member Combo Steven Graham after a brief term in prison. Combo represents the proNazi skinheads versus the fun loving petty vandalism of the Ska music and mod style teenagers.Steven Graham work deserves a standing ovation far away of easy slapstick popcorn performance he produced in Snatch Guy Ritchie. Nevertheless his impressive characterisation of Combo is somehow overshadowed by Thomas Turgoose first ever acting role. Although presented at a later stage in the movie as the anti hero it is impossible not to feel for his profound facial expression and sympathise with his early age portrayal of innocence.Despite all round notable performances from the rest of the cast I feel terribly let down by Jo Hartley's mediocre interpretation as Shaun's mother however this can be considered a minor decay to an all round great piece of contemporary art.This is England crosses the boundary of the purely British audience oriented motion picture to a larger scale scenario where its intricacies are presented in manners which well enable the international audience to get a small picture of a bigger problem.In a world that tries to trade our eyes for feelings by diverting our attention to the big picture such as United 93 it might be of some use to stop and stare at the small picture. This little yet well behaved movie might allow us to adapt our eyes to the dark and pay more attention to detail.By Jordi Lltzer".

Although we are familiar with the non less aesthetic fear to terrorist attacks by fundamentalist Muslim groups we have somehow forgot the 'collateral' damage that could arise in the eve of a Parissuburbstyle racial riot.This is England perpetuates a picture of a country not far from the one we are overlooking now but puts aside the blossoming images sold to the outside world of a hectic and prosperous London and a gay Brighton. The film takes us back to the Thatcher years in a clearly accentuated north of England ridden by jobless youth and financially stretch families encapsulating a small landscape of issues that stirred the nation under the Iron Lady's rule.Medows takes us in what could be described as the deep England journey. North of the black underground line lay other counties where unemployment and lack of cultural resources are becoming predecessors for extremist thoughts. Social tensions are on the rise and a new radical party The National Front is taking advantage of the situation by blending anger and national pride rallying people around the country.Matching the style of Mathieu Kassovitz also director and writer in La Haine historical footage of the poque is embedded in between frames to illustrate the social expression of society. Furthermore Danny Cohen's photography beautifully sets the landscape for the characters to take centre stage.The storyline evolves around a social microcosmos. The characters represent the blue print of residual society perpetuated in the form of Shaun Thomas Turgoose. At a very young age Shaun has already endured the loose of his father at the Falklands War as well as facing financial hardship. He stands daily bulling from school peers which brings him to state of outcast.He then becomes approached by an urban tribe of Skamod skinheads. The group takes him under its wing as if a sort of mascot although Shaun quickly becomes a strong character within the group thanks to his stand up attitude. The group is soon divided by the return of old gang member Combo Steven Graham after a brief term in prison. Combo represents the proNazi skinheads versus the fun loving petty vandalism of the Ska music and mod style teenagers.Steven Graham work deserves a standing ovation far away of easy slapstick popcorn performance he produced in Snatch Guy Ritchie. Nevertheless his impressive characterisation of Combo is somehow overshadowed by Thomas Turgoose first ever acting role. Although presented at a later stage in the movie as the anti hero it is impossible not to feel for his profound facial expression and sympathise with his early age portrayal of innocence.Despite all round notable performances from the rest of the cast I feel terribly let down by Jo Hartley's mediocre interpretation as Shaun's mother however this can be considered a minor decay to an all round great piece of contemporary art.This is England crosses the boundary of the purely British audience oriented motion picture to a larger scale scenario where its intricacies are presented in manners which well enable the international audience to get a small picture of a bigger problem.In a world that tries to trade our eyes for feelings by diverting our attention to the big picture such as United 93 it might be of some use to stop and stare at the small picture. This little yet well behaved movie might allow us to adapt our eyes to the dark and pay more attention to detail.By Jordi Lltzer";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film last night with anticipation but really wasn't very impressed.With the exception of 'Combo' I thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited. It came across like a 'made for TV' drama.I felt that the film was very contrived. The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start yes we get that this is 80s Britain  you can stop now was tiresome and gave a very onesided view of what life was like in 80s Britain  poverty war juxtaposed with royalty Margaret Thatcher yet nothing in between? There were actually middleclasses who existed back then  just ordinary working people with a decent wage and a mortgage. The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end for 'dramatic effect' I presume.The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly.The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was toecurling. I couldn't even look during the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger but also looked so much younger. I know there were only four years between them but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties yet it's a huge difference in your teens! In my experience that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one since girls mature so much quicker and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry but I didn't buy it  an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.The ending was somewhat abrupt and again contrived. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the povertystricken. Don't get me wrong I love Trainspotting and Four Weddings has its charms but can't we Brits come up with anything different? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973 so wasn't much different in age to 'Shaun' would've been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly downtrodden council estate in a city in England. However my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film  I don't even remember racism being an issue although i'm not saying it didn't exist. 'This is England'? Not in my experience.The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.".

Danny Boyle take note. Paul Anderson stay where you are.This is a considered exceptionally well acted story centred on a 12 year olds adoption by a gang of skinheads in the months after his Father's death in the Falklands. Initially it's all harmless enough smashing sinks and wasting time. They listen to good music and smoke dope  not a problem you may think in fact I once worked for a man who essentially built a career on that. But things turn ugly when old gang member combo returns from prison having had any vestige of racial tolerance buggered out of him. He's a protoNick Griffin in the days before he opened an account with tie rack but with more visible tattoos determined to fight the war against ethnic undesirablesand no that doesn't means Geordies I had to check that too. The boy is drawn in by Combo's pitch particularly the part about wasted solders liberating sheep in the Falklands which strikes a simplistic note and before you can say wasted youth trouble ensues.The period is vividly recreated though Meadows can't resist having the greatest hits of the day playing on the radio as people walk down the street and a cast who weren't even sperm and ovum in the real 1983 are superb and have a great career ahead of them or rather would were there an independent domestic industry to speak of. Mind you Shane should be working for a while at least.What impresses are the finely rendered details. Mass recruitment to the National Front is portrayed in relatively benign terms  a cosseted meeting in a working men's club. There then as now a hatred of immigration and cultural diversity is rationalised as a rescue mission  hauling Englishness back from its diluted and fractious state to something bound to a fictitious idyll represented by the likes of Churchill who opposed all emancipating reforms throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and pioneered the use of chemical weapons and labour camps war time working class solidarity and that kind of male sack contents. Then again as now the ringleaders pass themselves off as respectable patriots suited and business like trotting out the familiar mantra of welcoming the hard working immigrant but rejecting the rest  ergo they're not racists at all. Obvious really! Having presented this pack of lies Meadow's discredits it with equal verve. When combo storms into the hard working Pakistani shop owner's newsagent threatens to kill him and steals his stock because presumably working for it wasn't an option there's little in the way of appreciation for the man's contribution to the economy. A simple thank you for the annual 2 billion pound surplus in 2007 money you and your fellow immigrants contribute subsidising benefit dependent excons like myself would have sufficed but no its abuse a giant knife. As combo listens to Milk describe the simply pleasures of his family life  a scene that's like watching someone sit on a bomb you know is about to explode his decision to try and batter him to death in a jealous rage is a tacit acknowledgement of what actually lies at the heart of the future BNP's membership  simple envy and bitter resentment coupled with an idiots view of history.When Meadow's explores the personal motivations for this hate his characters and the film as a whole have an air of authenticity built on universally excellent and naturalistic performances. It's the attempt to tie the characters to the wider political and social context that strikes a false note.Meadows locates the mutation of the skinhead movement from anarchist to racist by showing us footage of the Falkland's war and Thatcher. Combos been in prison for three and half years and it isn't a coincidence that his captivity dates from Thatcher's accession to government  he's a symbolic globule of Thatcherite folly. Sending your armed forces to protect a hill and kill sheep Meadows suggests proved a stark reminder of Britain's loss of status in the world and this coupled with Maggie's systematic and ruthless destruction of the working class through mass employment and the atomising of society which essentially ate like acid through traditional working class communities which was always the point was decisive in inflaming social tensions. This is a fair judgement of history but labouring the Falkland's as an inciting incident overstates its importance when a more rigorous look at the domestic situation might have struck a stronger note. All of this suggests that while Meadow's is a vintage documenter of his own childhood experiences and has an gift for social realism his credentials as a social historian are less secure.Mind you this may be all a misreading. Perhaps Meadows is suggesting Roland Rat is responsible  the morning TV menace featuring in the opening archive footage and who'd bet against it?".

Although they are skinheads Shaun likes their leader Woody and likewise he wins them over with his attitude is bigger than his size and he becomes part of the gang  hanging out and having fun. This changes when Woody's friend Combo is released from prison his militant views causes a split in the group  with Shaun staying wit Combo as Woody Milky and others head off.It helps to be of a certain age to appreciate everything this film has to offer. For myself I barely fell into this group mainly because I grew up in Northern Ireland and it goes without saying that we had our own issues to deal with while England had theirs. However I have some point of reference with the news etc even if I was not even 10 at the point of this film. That said even with my limited knowledge I still found the people and period within this film to be totally convincing. A colleague who encouraged me to see this was in his teens in the Midlands at the time this film was set did tell me that the film got it spot on in regards the people that he remembered and the culture at the time.This is the film's strength and has always been an attraction of Meadows' films that he manages to produce natural and convincing characters within a realistic world. This is important because the narrative relies you the audience being engaged by the characters as it is very much driven by them. Through them Meadows deals with issues such as male rage intolerance and the importance of belonging to a gang or group and he does so in a powerful and engaging script. It is easy to say that Meadows achieved this by drawing from real life experiences but it still takes a great deal of skill to translate experiences to written words and then to actors. Like I said it does really help to understand the society and mood at the time this was set but even without that it is good enough to get you into it without this knowledge ahead of time.The delivery of the characters falls to a strong cast who will mostly be unknown outside of the UK but who all turn in spoton characters. Turgoose got the attention early on when this film came out and rightly so because he does delivery a strong performance that is a million miles from the cute and annoying performances of others his age in many other mainstream films. However for me the absolute standout performance was from Stephen Graham. Words and action give him a simple racist thug character but he has understood his character and the complexities of the rage within him looking for a channel. When he is in thug mode he is convincing and compelling but his best moments come where he lets you see something else momentarily. It is obvious to pick it but his best moment is his relaxed chat with Milky you can see the real person but also see the anger spark in him before finding the easiest outlet for it  something simple to lash out at. It is an impressive moment in a roundly impressive performance. These two together dominate the film but that is to take nothing away from the roundly solid support work from Shim McClure Gilgun and others who are all convincing and play their parts perfectly. I rarely think to mention the supporting crew when reviewing a film but several things did stand out for me. Firstly those designing sets and costumes got it just right  there was really nothing that felt modern from the clothes right through to the outdoor locations the scattering of archive footage also helps. Secondly is the cinematography which is bleak and gritty perfectly matching the mood of the time and of the script.Overall then a very impressive British film  no a very impressive film full stop. The places period and characters are really well scripted by Meadows who in turn brings the best out of his cast with not a single performance really standing out as clunky or out of place. Excellent leads from Turgoose and Graham only make things better while the film looks great by capturing the period in looks costumes and feel cinematography.".

The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichs that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.Very disappointing".

	schema:headline " Meadows Shoots Himself In The Foot";
	schema:reviewBody "Shane Meadows is a great example of a British film maker who is talented but who fails to maximise that talent . Where as Danny Boyle is often criticised for failing to maintain the first half momentum Meadows is slightly different in that he can come up with a good premise which he then proceeds to demolish via his own hand . Where as DEAD MANS SHOES quickly stops being gritty and realistic and becomes fantastical and silly TIE suffers from quickly turning from a heart warming film in to a mouth piece for Meadows which defeats the object of the exercise .Make no mistake this is a truly heart warming film for the first half hour . Set in Grimsby in July 1983 tweleve year old Shaun is an outsider . He is an orphan whose father died in the Falklands conflict the previous year . He is the butt of jokes from school bullies and on his way home he is befriended by a group of non racist skinheads who invite him to tag along with them . Even the most cynical heart can't fail to be touched by this scenario which is helped greatly by all the cast  especially Thomas Turgoose as Shaun and Joe Gilgun as skin head leader Woody . Watching it a few short years after the film was released you can still understand why the critics loved it and heaped praise on the unknown cast and there's still plenty of time for Turgoose and Gilgun to become household names . If this is what they're capable of they're deserving of stardom Unfortunately when the audience are introduced to racist skinhead Combo the film starts to fall apart . There's nothing wrong with Stephen Graham's performance and will hopefully join Turgoose and Gilgun on the road to stardom but as a three dimensional character from 1983 he's sadly lacking . Meadows is on record as saying that he didn't agree with the Falklands war . I'm surprised he is able to remember since he was ten year old at the time and one can't help thinking that it's Meadows who is talking every time Combo opens his mouth  we went in to that war on a lie . it was for nothing  Hmmmm how does Combo arrive at this conclusion ? It's not like Mrs Thatcher addressed the houses of parliament saying that Argentina was days away from invading the Falkland Islands in a similar manner Blair did with Iraq . It was a war of aggression by Argentina who at the time were led by a fascistic junta . For people to claim  The Falklands Conflict was due to a lie  is very anachronistic not to mention untrue . By a bitter irony The Falklands Conflict is one of he very few wars where the extreme right and extreme left in Britain disagreed . The extreme right was for sending the task force the far left were against it . As Nick Cohen and Christopher Hitchens continually point out with glee Neanderthal Nazis and gormless do gooders are nearly always on the same side In fact one can't help wondering why on earth it is set in the Summer of 1983 . If Shaun had been orphaned in 2004 and the story took place in 2005 then you'd still have the exact same film . Perhaps this was Meadows intention but decided having a film set against the background of Iraq and Afghanistan because it might be too similar to DEAD MANS SHOWS . . Meadows wasn't a teenager in 1983 and it shows . Anachronims abound like Strawberry Switchblade on the radio and Blockbusters on TV and how could the Summer of 1983 not have Blue Monday by New Order being played at every opportunity ? If you're going to make a film set in a particular time then please let someone who was there direct it . Since Meadows has decided to bring up politics I'll rubbish him by asking what on earth was the point in showing footage of the miners strike which took place from March 1984 March 1985 ? If political events take place AFTER the timeline the scenario is set then please don't include them In conclusion TIE had all the potential to be one of the great feel good movies ever to have come out of Britain a sort of THE FULL MONTY meets LITTLE VOICE and the way the film quickly becomes something  gritty and realistic  is somewhat unforgivable . Some people think they've been misled in thinking this was going to be a Brit version of American HISTORY X and I can see their point and one can't help thinking how much more praise Meadows might have received if we'd never have met Combo and we'd had Shaun  Woody and co walking off in to the sunset friends forever".

	schema:headline " Too Much Too Young";
	schema:reviewBody "At 12 and younglooking even for his age Shaun Fields Turgoose looks hardly capable of breaking and entering a boiled egg. His loss of innocence is at the heart of Shane Meadows' most autobiographical work to date notice how 'Shaun Fields' deliberately echoes 'Shane Meadows' along with everrelevant subjects like absent and surrogate fathers Western imperialism and white workingclass marginalisation particularly in the postindustrial suburbs. Right on time the film also addresses the flashpoint issue of the day an incipient racism virtually legitimised under recent governments and in sections of the press stoking antiMuslim sentiment. This packs a lot into its 100 minutes but never feels hectoring. I've been picked on three times today all because of my trousers Shaun tells poodlepermed mum Cynthia whose soldier husband died a year earlier in the Falklands. Other schoolyard taunts cut deeper How many people can you fit in the back of a Mini? Two in the front two in the back  and your dad in the ashtray. Salvation comes in the form of fairminded skinhead Woody and his apparently parentless gang of puppyish moonfaced boys and preternaturally aged girls all pinched faces and feathercuts. Little older than Shaun himself burdened with the same juvenile insecurities they're nonetheless better dressed in their immaculate Ben Shermans and cherry red Docs. Shaun signs up receives his regulation uniform and haircut. Not that mum approves. We've got problems a wheedling Gadget tells her obsequiously. But at least he's found some friends. Life is now a fizzy sherbet rush of trashing empty houses on decrepit Nottingham estates and getting an education in skinhead music  an authentic mix of 2Tone and rocksteady. Shaun also gets an education in girls via beanpole Smell. You might look about four drawls Smell but you kiss like a 40yearold. As usual Meadows gets great moving performances from his young cast. When the older damaged Combo Graham shows up newly vomited from prison he drives a nail into the group exemplified in his loaded question for Milky Andrew Shim their sole black skinhead. Do you consider yourself English or Jamaican? Combo spells out his call to arms For 2000 years this little island has been raped and pillaged by people who would want a piece of it. For what? Just so we could open the floodgates and say 'come in'? Now threeandahalf million of us can't find jobs 'cos they're taking them all. Margaret Thatcher is also deeply unpopular with Combo for having marginalised the far right by whipping the immigration issue and the union flag from under them. Then there's her war in the Falklands shipping fine upstanding white men to a phoney war to kill a load of shepherds. Having convinced Shaun his father died in vain Combo drags his splinter cell to NF branch meetings led by Frank Harper's Lenny. They harass the Asian locals and struggle with racist graffiti  Hey how many effs in 'Off?'  until a brutal incident makes Shaun think again. Working on a characteristically modest budget Meadows and crew have fashioned a fantastically authentic drama from the recreation of the era's dingy landscapes its youth cults exerting a pull on suburbanites long after their metropolitan counterparts were morphing into Tacchiniclad casuals that exhilarating soundtrack Toots And The Maytals Specials UK Subs and the tangled political climate set against a backdrop of mass unemployment working class disenfranchisement and a phoney war. This is England indeed. Courageously the film also rescues the skinheads from allencompassing neoNazi associations. The movement's origins lay in a shared celebration by white workingclass Britons and the Rude Boys of Jamaican music a multiculturalism made more potent and pronounced during postpunk. Though leaving one in no doubt about the stupidity and crassness of the far right Combo's racehate merchants give Smell porn mags for birthday presents it also digs deeper trying to find out what makes them tick. Make no mistake despite its lowkey approach certainly less hysterical than Meadows' true masterpiece Dead Man's Shoes This Is England is a deeply political film but here renders the political personal particularly when depicting the farreaching consequences of war on the families left behind. There is also a second drama being played out here one that audiences may not pick up on. As Meadows has revealed in the film's backstory Combo like Stephen Graham the actor who plays him is mixedrace. His explosive reaction to Milky's description of a large loving Jamaican family isn't just one of jealousy but borne from more complex emotions concerning his parentage. However not knowing this takes nothing away from the film's power. The use of The Smiths' 'Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want' at the finale not only captures the film's melancholy yearning but historically heralds the new wave of white working class indie culture in which Morrissey's brand of wistful introspection would succeed the skinhead's sulphatefuelled moonstomping at least for a while. Good times for a change. In April 2007 just prior to the film's release the British Board Of Film Classification hobbled the film with an 18 certificate though Bristol City Camden and Westminster councils later successfully whittled it down to a 15 decreeing that the movie's use of vicious racial language... might give out the wrong message to an impressionable audience. Such a move didn't just preclude Turgoose from seeing his own film but further prevented Meadows from screening it to 15yearold schoolchildren to show the dangers of bullying peer pressure and racism to young people. While it was the filmmakers' misfortune to have released their film at a time when policy is dictated by public perception it was hoped that this vital piece of cinema would eventually find a proper receptive audience making its win for 'Best British Film' at the 2008 BAFTAs a richly deserved and very satisfying victory.".

The scene where the 12 year old hero has a French Kissing festival with the 18 year old Smell I found very indecent. I found the social topic about racism within the Skinhead subculture to be a yawn. I cannot for the life of me understand that a movie which trumpets itself as what England was like in 1983 failed to even mention the Irish Republican Armys Rampage in Englands cities at that time! From what I remember everyone in Britain bemoaned the IRA's campaign of terror including this subject would of made a much better movie. Don't bother paying the rental fee for this movie.".

It's also very pretentious because the back drop is the Falklands war trying to give the scenario some gravity.But seriously it's no better than a made for TV movie. Its one single unique factor is that it portrays skinheads in their original identity  a bunch of fun loving ganja smoking reggae listening kids who dressed in those funny Erkle pants and red suspenders  then things get ugly.The events in this movie move along with no real purpose other than to move through a script and throw some heavy scenes in the viewer's face. And what's worse is that the facts are also off. The racist skinheads of 1983 were not just nationalists trying to get Pakistani immigrants out of their country. They were full blown neoNazis in other words the interaction between Combo and Milky never would happen or at least not in the order the film insists. It's complete rubbish.Furthermore the romance between the kid and the older gothglam chick is really weird and creepy. It makes no sense! It's like 'The Tin Drum' only it attempts to be real! It's really gross! In total I didn't like it. I felt nearly every single moment of this movie was embarrassing and silly. The Falklands war imagery was pointless. And constantly reminding us what decade the movie was set in was annoying  hey another 'Maggie is a c!' reference woo!".

And constantly reminding us what decade the movie was set in was annoying  hey another 'Maggie is a c!' reference woo!";

I remember skinheads kicking off in pub car parks because they knew the police were too busy dealing with striking miners to respond to any complaints. The entire production looks so authentic that at times it's as though you're watching a documentary filmed in 1983. The actors imbue characters that could easily become stereotypes with a depth that makes even the nearsociopathic Combo a sympathetic and tragic victim of his own emotional retardation. Several performances are award worthy and 'This is England' contains more of the real England the England of my childhood in just five minutes than all the middleclass fantasies of Richard Curtis combined.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bangkok Dangerous isn't a bad film  or at least not as bad as most of the reviews around here claim  but it is an astonishingly ordinary film that features literally every clich of hired assassin concept you can possibly think of. There's the lonely and superskilled hit man who intents to pull of one last job before quitting the business for good he teaches his errand boy to become his successor finds love and happiness with a girl for the first time and  last but not least  refuses to make the final hit because his target is a noble individual. We know this is the prototypic pitch of every thriller in its type yet we still pay the full price of a cinema ticket because the film stars Nicolas Cage and we'll probably see a lot of spectacular action and virulent gunfire. Bangkok Dangerous is a bigbudgeted remake of a Thai thriller released in 1999 which was also directed by the Pang brothers. In the original the hit man was a deafmute but since Nicolas Cage is far too expensive to have him shut up the whole time they made his love interest a deafmute instead. Unfortunately this takes away the one truly ingenious aspect about the original. What remains is a painfully predictable and bland thriller that can't even be saved by the handful of impressively staged action sequences. Still I wouldn't call Bangkok Dangerous a complete waste of time though as there are a couple of stylish and worthwhile  albeit less obvious  elements working in its favor. Nic Cage gives a good performance as the unworldly killer and particularly the Pang Bros' depiction of the city of Bangkok is deeply enchanting. Especially at night it looks like a melancholic and depressing place infested with prostitution petty crimes and perverted tourists. The moody soundtrack emphasizes the atmosphere of melancholy even more. This is definitely not a film that'll increase the tourist business there. Otherwise there's very little to say about Bangkok Dangerous. If you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and rough action you won't regret giving this one a look. Just realize you'll have completely forgotten about it the next day.".

Nic Cage gives a good performance as the unworldly killer and particularly the Pang Bros' depiction of the city of Bangkok is deeply enchanting. Especially at night it looks like a melancholic and depressing place infested with prostitution petty crimes and perverted tourists. The moody soundtrack emphasizes the atmosphere of melancholy even more. This is definitely not a film that'll increase the tourist business there. Otherwise there's very little to say about Bangkok Dangerous. If you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and rough action you won't regret giving this one a look. Just realize you'll have completely forgotten about it the next day.";

He is possibly the biggest victim of typecasting in Hollywood and he does his best with the roles he is given but the odd film slips through the net and sadly Bangkok Dangerous is one of them. Nic is distinctly average in this and the performances of the supporting cast aren't much better with the notable exception of Charlie Yeung who delivers a fine performance as the love interest.This film isn't awful it just suffers from an average and completely unoriginal script. This is Action Movie 101 and unlike some movies it doesn't get away with it by glossing over the cracks with special effects like Wanted. Like Wanted I successfully predicted the entire plot straight after Nic's opening monologue. Some scenes were very good some very bad the scale is balanced. The movie is like Marmite you'll either love it or hate it.".

But the lasting action was quite entertaining for me.The biggest flaw of this movie is probably the story line. Some parts of the story are rather rushed without telling background information. Sometimes the story feels a bit rushed with more focus on the action than the actual reason for an event to happen. Some parts of the movie feel a bit overdone and unnecessary making the main character look quite dumb...I find this movie worth a 64 i did not want to give it a 6 because i do find it deserves higher than a 6 this explains the 7 star rating".

Matter of fact it just kind of came and went when it played in theaters for a few weeks in September of 2008 around that time i.e. Labor Day weekend when few movies really do well with audiences or critics. It looks like it will be garbage just from the video cover a half interested Nicolas Cage in damnridiculous hair basically a Muppet called and wants its body back and with a premise that sounds just like it is a remake of an action movie from years back. But going into the movie my expectations were altered within some minutes. The initial thought was 'well this will just be another hackneyed predictable action movie in the Asian setting of Bangkok and stuck with what I call 'genericitis which means a movie suffers from its perpetual sense of the usual... and in ways the movie is that.It also surprised me with a few things and it actually made me take the movie seriously as an actual piece of work as opposed to something to deride with teeth gnashed like Ghost Rider. Nicolas Cage is trying for something a little different here. At first yes it may look like he's bored or wooden or both in the character of Joe the hitman who has his four rules and naturally breaks at least a few of them during the run time of the movie in Bangkok i.e. be anonymous don't make connections with people you don't know and know when to quit but this gives way to something else. He's trying for nuance and observation of being subtle in a role that should call for it albeit Joe isn't a terribly interesting person save for his detachment. While he's definitely no Alain Delon when it comes to playing cold killer who may have a couple of portions of humanity in him I actually did find myself being drawn into the character just based on Cage's projection of this detachment as a means to hide himself away from people. And for good reason since he's not a people person really.That is until Joe meets 'Kong' who is a guy he hires for work but then takes on as his pupil as the narration dutifully and unnecessarily tells us because he sees something in Kong and then also a romantic interest in a deafmute girl who works at a pharmacy. The latter scenes especially were touching because of it becoming a kind of silent movie perhaps by default when the two of them were together and there's a rather sad painful scene later on in the film between the two that is shockingly good and believable. I even liked the actors who played Kong and the girl and how their characters unfolded in the story limited as they might be... and yet that old bastard clich and convention kept coming back moreso into the action scenes and setpieces whenever a chase happens in the film save for one moment involving an arm dismemberment you can zone out and not miss much. The editing is that kind of fast kinetic style where you can barely take in a shot before it goes whizzing by. There's also some scenes that are ludicrous that are taken deadserious such as when Cage's Joe practically has gills and drowns a man underwater without any trouble.It's really a matter of the plot just not giving anything much for the characters or actors to do. And yet there is a misconception that becomes apparent this is much more about the characters than the plot at least for a while and when it sticks to that the Pang brothers sense of cinematic style of the love of dirty Bangkok and elephants works and is enjoyable. When the story comes back though particularly in the last twenty minutes when Joe makes a fatal choice it turns into something else  something frustratingly forgettable. For a short while there is hope which is nice until it reverts to what the expectation foretold. It's truly a mixedbag but far from the failure that was projected by the reviews and audience reaction... Oh and of course try not to look at Cage's hair. The bad jokes would never end. 5.510".

But being the rebel I am I went anyway. I liked it.We're introduced to Cage's character on assignment in Europe. Cage's character Joe lives by the clock like Tom Hanks does in Cast Away. He's cold and methodical. I realize that sounds clichd for a hitman but the Pang brothers get it across a lot better than other movies with the same subject matter. Joe goes to Bangkok to carry out a series of hits for a Thai mobster. He quickly hires a street smart pickpocket by the name of Kong to be a messenger and translator. Cage has several rules one of them being not to get close to people but slowly he and Kong begin to bond. After a hit or two Joe takes Kong under his wing and teaches him the tricks of the trade think Leon and Mathilda. Cage also meets a deafmute pharmacist he takes a liking to. She's about as innocent and sweet as somebody can get providing some good contrast to Joe's work and the seedy dark streets of Bangkok the Pang brothers have a knack for depicting. As they get close we see Joe go through what I thought to be some convincing character development. It's not that we relate to Joe we just understand and sympathize with him both before and after the transformation takes place. So the Pang brothers went through a lot of effort to get us invested in these characters and that's what makes the action sequences so much better. On their own they'd be just alright. But since we actually give a damn if Cage or Kong or whoever gets shot they carry with them a certain emotional weight. In the reviews I read before going a few mentioned Bangkok's photography as one of the positive aspects of the film but many criticized it. I thought it perfectly matched the atmosphere of the movie. It's dark gritty forlorn desolate... No other style would have matched the story as well. And that's one of the things the Pangs show they're great at they really set the mood of the movie well. It's a dark and dreary world full of immoral unsavory people. Joe acknowledges this and lives his life accordingly but as he's introduced to humanity in one of the most unlikely places of the world he discovers a completely different outlook on life one that's worth fighting for one that's worth dying for.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review may have mild spoilers but they come through implication and aren't explicit in short your viewing of the film shouldn't be ruined by anything written here. This was surprisingly a very interesting action and character piece from Nicholas Cage. I generally find his work either very good or cheesily over the top. In 'Bangkok Dangerous' he delivers an understated and nuanced performance as a hitman who has withdrawn from humanity for so long that when he steps back in the personal and professional consequences are tremendous. To survive as a hitman he's lived by a set of rules. Finding a major contract for four jobs in Bangkok leads to deep personal revelations when his strict adherence to those rules starts to peel away. Cage's character Joe says at one point that the only way for him to do the job is to withdraw from humanity. He leaves no trace that he's ever existed finds no acknowledgment from other human beings and exists only as the wind. Humanity ... starts to look like a different species and he only comes out to study people for brief moments before withdrawing again to remind himself that they aren't. So what happens when he goes to Bangkok and the culture is so alien to him that he can't help be drawn into it?There were a number of things I really liked about the movie. The exotic location is matched with beautiful cinematography and luxuriant sets. The colours the atmosphere and dark vibrance of the city at night is in stunning contrast to Joe's spartan and nondescript apartment white walls and brown tables. The Pangs did an excellent job of drawing the audience into the same intoxicating world that Joe is drawn into. The sights in the markets the sounds in the clubs and in the streets and the wonderfully engaging score the taste of the food and the smell of the city  these all leapt out. The Pangs direction here is in my opinion some of their best work. Joe's hits are tense and well set up. In one particularly horrific action scene the camera looks up at Joe who has just dispatched his target Joe who stands even in shock at himself for the brutal killing Joe who realizes that killing has moral complexity since his humanity has reawakened. The camera lingers on Joe for an eternity shock and awe in the audience shock and awe as he realizes what he is.So how does it happen? Is it the city that draws in him? Partially but he's been in other exotic cities. Is it the sidekick and messenger he's hired on to be an errand boy? Partially. Joe reveals a soft spot when he sees that the sidekick goes above and beyond what he has been asked to do in order to protect Joe during an attempted robbery. Is it when he is first troubled in the film by his rule to leave no traces of himself? Is it when he makes a connection with a beautiful deaf pharmacist? Joe's survival in his career has been from dehumanizing himself from the rest of the species. Bangkok is dangerous to him because of the jobs he has taken and the people who have contracted him but Bangkok is also dangerous because he recovers part of himself. People who genuinely care about Joe crack the armour at once strengthening and destroying.Is it a nihilistic film? On a superficial and literal level yes 'Bangkok Dangerous' is a nihilistic film about a guy who kills for a living. Much deeper is the understanding of how we are all shaped by our choices but how redemption and rebirth are possible  even in the most unlikely of antiheroes.".

He then promptly breaks his own codes and his life comes under threat.That's pretty much it as regards plotting. The Pang's bring much visual style to the picture and show themselves to be adept at action sequences but it all feels so familiar. Action movies are rarely going to bring new stuff to the table they often as is the case here are kinetic popcorn pictures missing some emotional depth to marry up with the carnage. Thus this is not a film to be sought out by any action junkies looking for something new to add to their collections. As it happens Cage is fine and broody managing to blend hard ass machismo with vulnerable traits. He and the filmic style make it above average even if ultimately it's instantly forgettable afterwards. 610".

	schema:headline " Frustrating and disappointing.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bangkok Dangerous is an oft frustrating and disappointing experience not because it is inherently bad per se but rather because it shows promise yet consistently squanders it. At its core the movie exists as a compelling and at times engaging feature that caters to high octane thrills and adequate drama. Yet burdened with an overwhelming sense of kitschy design put in place to satisfy those looking for nofuss action the feature inevitably comes to a close in a manner that reflects the experience as a whole. This unconvincing backandforth structure inevitably hinders the movie's ability to fully envelop in the manner that it hopes to the action can be potent but all too contrived characterisation welcome but treated as plot devices drama which is emotive and interesting but underplayed all the same. A jarring neurotic affair with underdeveloped promise and too many flaws to capitalise on such greater features Bangkok Dangerous is a two headed monster one of which is far easier on the eyes than the other.Following impeccable and highend contract hitman Joe Nicolas Cage the focus of Bangkok Dangerous is simple a man who lives by 4 rules which dictate how to do his job with precision and success Joe is also one ridden with loneliness unable to create relationships with anyone for fear of breaching his security. At its heart this is the story that Jason Richman wants to bring out and for the most part it's what gives the feature its most engaging form of narrative. Going from here it's only natural that Joe should find a woman within his new location of Bangkok who comes in the form of a deaf pharmaceutist. This subplot plays out well in the context of Joe's story through her we see his softer more human side and Cage does well in getting across such sides of his character naturally. The romance isn't as potent as one might hope but given that Bangkok Dangerous isn't exactly a movie likely to pander to the whims of romantics such casual development is forgivable.What isn't quite as forgivable however lies in two other subplots which too often distract and take up too much time from the two characters in the story that we care for. The first of these unwanted aspects comes in the form of Kong Shahkrit Yamnarm who essentially plays the part of Joe's apprentice of sorts because well Joe sees a little of himself in Kong. Granted there are some strong moments that play out in this dynamic but again hindered by a sense of trying too much in too little time such moments are lost within a cloud of underdeveloped ideas. Branching off of this subplot is another which goes even further and tries to develop some sort of romance between Kong and a distant associate that supplies Joe with his contracts. Not only is it a superfluous and unnecessary inclusion but it doesn't even provide any substance when it does show up. Every time I had to sit through such moments I couldn't help but think of what could have be shown on screen between Joe and his love interest instead of the perplexing and inane romance that was in front of me.Reinforcing the central motif of the film's sporadic and mixed bag nature though is its aesthetic design which often complements the movie's biggest and most poignant moments action and character orientated. Perhaps the most significant and consistent of these elements is the enveloping score penned by Brain Tyler who has made a habit out of writing for creatively jarring movies such as this. Remaining as the only real constant of the film outside of Cage's natural performance Tyler reinforces the moods of the film throughout echoing themes of loneliness confliction and unbendable duty through his similarly structured compositions. Although not quite as complementary or remarkable as the score the photography by Decha Srimantra has some interesting moments in itself which help to draw the attention past the numerous instances of dry uninspired action.In the end however Bangkok Dangerous essentially comes down to a battle between opposite forces literally speaking. Like their central character directors Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang are too often found conflicted by a willingness to stick to the genre's actionorientated blueprints and a more natural but fleeting sense of romantic characterisation. It's a statement in itself that Bangkok Dangerous a film that will most likely attract those looking for explosions and gun fights will no doubt leave such audiences underwhelmed by the mediocre action and unfulfilled by a distinct lack of focus on such. Indeed it's an interesting and ironic twist that the real substance and entertainment value to be had here lies in the character of Joe himself and his conflicting state of mind rather than his weapons. That's not to say that Bangkok Dangerous is neutered because it certainly has its thrilling moments but such instances are best when left to pander to character rather than run off on their own. So while the movie certainly doesn't ever take off it at least stays close to the ground with a fine and fitting performance from Cage and tells a decent character story all the same a throwaway action movie for those only interested in seeing action as consequence of drama and character.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Not only is it a superfluous and unnecessary inclusion but it doesn't even provide any substance when it does show up. Every time I had to sit through such moments I couldn't help but think of what could have be shown on screen between Joe and his love interest instead of the perplexing and inane romance that was in front of me.Reinforcing the central motif of the film's sporadic and mixed bag nature though is its aesthetic design which often complements the movie's biggest and most poignant moments action and character orientated. Perhaps the most significant and consistent of these elements is the enveloping score penned by Brain Tyler who has made a habit out of writing for creatively jarring movies such as this. Remaining as the only real constant of the film outside of Cage's natural performance Tyler reinforces the moods of the film throughout echoing themes of loneliness confliction and unbendable duty through his similarly structured compositions. Although not quite as complementary or remarkable as the score the photography by Decha Srimantra has some interesting moments in itself which help to draw the attention past the numerous instances of dry uninspired action.In the end however Bangkok Dangerous essentially comes down to a battle between opposite forces literally speaking. Like their central character directors Oxide Pang Chun and Danny Pang are too often found conflicted by a willingness to stick to the genre's actionorientated blueprints and a more natural but fleeting sense of romantic characterisation. It's a statement in itself that Bangkok Dangerous a film that will most likely attract those looking for explosions and gun fights will no doubt leave such audiences underwhelmed by the mediocre action and unfulfilled by a distinct lack of focus on such. Indeed it's an interesting and ironic twist that the real substance and entertainment value to be had here lies in the character of Joe himself and his conflicting state of mind rather than his weapons. That's not to say that Bangkok Dangerous is neutered because it certainly has its thrilling moments but such instances are best when left to pander to character rather than run off on their own. So while the movie certainly doesn't ever take off it at least stays close to the ground with a fine and fitting performance from Cage and tells a decent character story all the same a throwaway action movie for those only interested in seeing action as consequence of drama and character.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net";

	schema:headline " A critique of French society between the wars";
	schema:reviewBody "A weekend party assembles at the chteau of the Marquis de la Chesnaye. Among the guests Andr an aviator is in love with the Marquis's wife Christine the Marquis himself is conducting an affair with Genevive Octave an old family friend is also secretly in love with the Marquise. Meanwhile a poacher appointed servant by the mischievous Marquis comes to blows with the gamekeeper over the latter's flirtatious wife.The setup may remind one of The Shooting Party or Gosford Park but the debt is naturally in the present film's favour. Rather the upstairsdownstairs intrigue the mingling of comedy with drama and the setting prior to cataclysmic socialpolitical change owe much to Beaumarchais's Le mariage de Figaro. Which explains the hostility of audiences and government alike on the film's release it was cut then banned outright and not reconstituted until well into the 1950s.To tap the source of the disquiet aroused by this superficially fluffy piece of bedroom farce 'Surely just the French doing what they do best?' one must look beyond the typical observation that it was 'socially insidious because it was a clear attack on the hautebourgeoisie the very class who would shortly lead the troops against the Germans'. The autocritique goes deeper than that.Consider. The lower orders are no better than their irresponsible masters the women are no less immoral the men just as concerned to preserve their foreheads from cuckoldry. This is the culmination of Figaro's contract with the Count he enjoins the latter to behave like an honest man as befits his station two centuries later not only has the nobility welshed on the deal it has brought the servant classes down with it. Renoir serves up for the French a portrait of a society which is rotten from top to bottom. 'The Rules of the Game' are keep up appearances and somehow the whole charade will be preserved indefinitely barring Adolf and his Panzers that is.Andr the aviator the crosser of the Atlantic distance perspective is the one who threatens the edifice. Being Christine's lover is not enough she must elope with him it must be 'honest'. If she does this she will be showing that feelings matter more than money and position. The choice is too much for her and she runs for cover with Octave and thus sets in motion the mechanism by which everything ends in tragedy but the status quo is maintained for now.The working out of this theme in Renoir's hands leads to some striking juxtapositions of tone. Renoir the 'humanist' like Octave whom he plays was a lover and forgiver of humanity. It was not in him to condemn without affection. In one scene the gamekeeper chases his rival through the drawing room discharging a pistol while the guests barely look up from their cards he is merely playing by the rules after all. It was perhaps the coexistence of farcical sequences like this with the wanton slaughter of wildlife in the hunt scene that audiences found hard to take. Renoir himself wrote 'During the shooting of the film I was torn between my desire to make a comedy of it and the wish to tell a tragic story. The result of this ambivalence was the film as it is.' Amen.".

	onyx:emotionText "A weekend party assembles at the chteau of the Marquis de la Chesnaye. Among the guests Andr an aviator is in love with the Marquis's wife Christine the Marquis himself is conducting an affair with Genevive Octave an old family friend is also secretly in love with the Marquise. Meanwhile a poacher appointed servant by the mischievous Marquis comes to blows with the gamekeeper over the latter's flirtatious wife.The setup may remind one of The Shooting Party or Gosford Park but the debt is naturally in the present film's favour. Rather the upstairsdownstairs intrigue the mingling of comedy with drama and the setting prior to cataclysmic socialpolitical change owe much to Beaumarchais's Le mariage de Figaro. Which explains the hostility of audiences and government alike on the film's release it was cut then banned outright and not reconstituted until well into the 1950s.To tap the source of the disquiet aroused by this superficially fluffy piece of bedroom farce 'Surely just the French doing what they do best?' one must look beyond the typical observation that it was 'socially insidious because it was a clear attack on the hautebourgeoisie the very class who would shortly lead the troops against the Germans'. The autocritique goes deeper than that.Consider. The lower orders are no better than their irresponsible masters the women are no less immoral the men just as concerned to preserve their foreheads from cuckoldry. This is the culmination of Figaro's contract with the Count he enjoins the latter to behave like an honest man as befits his station two centuries later not only has the nobility welshed on the deal it has brought the servant classes down with it. Renoir serves up for the French a portrait of a society which is rotten from top to bottom. 'The Rules of the Game' are keep up appearances and somehow the whole charade will be preserved indefinitely barring Adolf and his Panzers that is.Andr the aviator the crosser of the Atlantic distance perspective is the one who threatens the edifice. Being Christine's lover is not enough she must elope with him it must be 'honest'. If she does this she will be showing that feelings matter more than money and position. The choice is too much for her and she runs for cover with Octave and thus sets in motion the mechanism by which everything ends in tragedy but the status quo is maintained for now.The working out of this theme in Renoir's hands leads to some striking juxtapositions of tone. Renoir the 'humanist' like Octave whom he plays was a lover and forgiver of humanity. It was not in him to condemn without affection. In one scene the gamekeeper chases his rival through the drawing room discharging a pistol while the guests barely look up from their cards he is merely playing by the rules after all. It was perhaps the coexistence of farcical sequences like this with the wanton slaughter of wildlife in the hunt scene that audiences found hard to take. Renoir himself wrote 'During the shooting of the film I was torn between my desire to make a comedy of it and the wish to tell a tragic story. The result of this ambivalence was the film as it is.' Amen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Renoir is often considered as one of the masters of French cinema of the thirties. He surprised in the diversity of the genres he tackled during that era literary adaptation Madame Bovary 1933 entertaining comedy Boudu Sauv Des Eaux 1932 or political manifestation la Marseillaise 1937. Perhaps more than la Grande Illusion 1937 la Rgle Du Jeu is the magnum opus of that era and perhaps of Renoir's whole career. A movie offering a great variety of tones and a liberty of style which looks like a light comedy but which conceals delicate topics. Given that it was a mirror of French society it encompassed an unusual construction a highly worked and unconventional directing it is easy to understand why the movie was decried by French public in 1939. Throughout the years it was butchered was cut several times before fortunately being restored to favor in 1965.Renoir had developed in some of his anterior films a scathing critic of French bourgeoisie. Movies like Nana 1926 la Chienne 1931 or Boudu Sauv Des Eaux 1932 already embodied a wholesale massacre of the upperclass milieu whom Renoir underscored their hypocritical aspect. La Rgle Du Jeu is his last attack on this society. The filmmaker understood that it was impossible to change the aristocratic world and its shallow rules. The tail end is here to prove it. Robert De la Chesnaye Marcel Dalio by qualifying Jurieu's death as a deplorable accident whereas it was a premeditated murder saved the appearances. But Renoir also knew that the Second World War was about to break out and was going to put an end to the aristocratic domination. So he felt that it was his duty to give a true image of French bourgeoisie before the tragedy.Renoir's magnum opus is an innovative film because the director did the opposite of what a majority of French filmmakers did at that time. Many of Renoir's French peers relished on Hollywood conventions to tell and shoot the stories of their films. Here the movie isn't built from one character's standpoint but from a group of characters belonging to different social classes a scheme which was unusual in the thirties. Renoir used this device for a better observation of French society in decay and he was audacious enough to break the rules of narrative continuity and to use a complex directing. For example he had tapped the depth of field in his wondrous Partie De Campagne 1936 here he used it again with startling results to create memorable images notably during the party sequence.Renoir knew very well the aristocratic world he described in his film because he used to belong to it. He was the son of the famous French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir. An important part of the film takes place in la Colinire a mansion which seems to be virtually cut off from the world it's the sole world which exists. La Rgle Du Jeu represents a world with a constricting etiquette immutable values. Two camps the smug posh bourgeoisie and the servants. Its members are walled up in their respective social background and the two most important criteria of distinction are money and property. Apart this hardhitting assessment Renoir's genius shines when it comes to underline their mediocrity and lack of education. Jackie tells Mrs La Bruyre that she studies PreColombian art and the latter assimilates it to Buffalo Bill. Moreover the rule in question is based on lie hypocrisy and injustice. La Chesnaye has an affair with his mistress Genevive and his wife Christine ignores this. But the sight at the shooting party is a symbolic object because she makes Christine's eyes open about this illicit love affair. But perhaps the most powerful symbol of this society is the automatons. They are clockwork toys just like the rules the manners which govern an ossified world. Then if Jurieu died at the end of the film it's because he remained honest in a world of corruption.Although there are no direct references to war there are veiled hints at it throughout Renoir's work. Of course the famous hunting sequence was often interpreted as warning signs to the tragedy but also during the party with the danse macabre the way the audience reacts a mirror of French society about the impending tragedy which weighs like a Sword of Damocls and the military capacities of French army. But there another allusions to war elsewhere in Renoir's work the tolling of the bells when the guests arrive to la Colinire the gun shots La Chesnaye can hear when he walks in his domain his gamekeeper Schmacher's persona... Moreover there are clear signs that this society is in poor running notably during the party sequence. The frontier between masters and servants is abolished. An impression of disorder is enhanced by an astute use of the depth of field and long takes during which several actions take place in the same time. Then Christine who will think of fleeing from this rotten microcosm. But in the end La Chesnaye will have saved the appearances. But for how long?Every sequence every character of la Rgle Du Jeu should be studied in detail. It's an unqualified must for any cine buff. The technical innovations will have an influence on future directors like Franois Truffaut while the bourgeois satire will be later resumed by HenriGeorges Clouzot and Claude Chabrol.".

So offended were the masses that the picture was banned. It is said that behind every joke there is truth and whether this was intended to be a joke or not Renoir still found truth. One could argue the director's intentions all day but one matter that cannot be disputed is that this film is extraordinary! As a handful of French men and women converge on a chteau for a hunting expedition their love affairs clash with their obligations to society's game. For instance one cannot leave one's lover to be with another until he has confessed his adultery to her. Attempts to leave with another man's wife are particularly difficult as well unless the other man has a mistress of his own. These are but a few rules of the game. The old are for the old the young are for the young. Members of one social order are forbidden to see members from another and so on. Combine these rules with a tangled web of countless love affairs between a handful of people and you can see the madness that erupts during the course of this movie. The parts are all played well but it is the writing and directing of Renoir that makes the film the masterpiece that it is. Keeping all of these sordid affairs in order is an achievement in its own right but Renoir moves his pieces all over the board like a skilled chess player achieving his goal while never forgetting the rules of the game!".

	schema:reviewBody "At the risk of seeming heretical I have to confess that having finally seen this film at the American Museum of the Moving Image in NY I found it disappointing to some degree. I can appreciate the provocative candor with which Renoir has created this satireindictment of a society which has lost its moorings. I think I'm capable of seeing what he was trying to do and respect the goals he seems to be aiming for. I can also appreciate much of the acting Nora Gregor seems especially luminous the dramaticnarrative organization the witty structural recurrences of things like the old man's they're a dying race lines and indeed the overall enormity of Renoir's ambitions. I like what he set out to do and in most ways I was on his side as I watched the film.And yet  I find that it doesn't quite all add up for me. Most surprisingly the film seems to be without a very distinct visual style style beyond its overall professionalism. By 1939 the work of Hitchcock Murnau Lang Flaherty Lubitsch Eisenstein Whale and others had already rampantly shown the potentials of visual style and expressive composition even in the talkie era. Renoir himself had already achieved a masterful job of subtextual visual strategy and meaningful compositions a few years earlier in his powerful GRAND ILLUSION. But that visual confidence is no way in evidence here. Is it because of how many different cinematographers there were?I'm sure some will point out this or that scene and all the interesting objects within it a certain fluidity of camerawork intelligent use of depthoffocus interesting overhead shots in the hallway as people headed off to bed at the chteau or some of the shots in the kitchen the hunt or even the almost surreal party . I will grant you that there is there are some fairly impressive shots now and then with perhaps the opening scene of the reporter on the runway the most showy. But after one viewing I have yet to be convinced that there is any distinctive visual personality to the picture. Professionalism yes. The occasional interesting shot yes. But the visual creativity or a bravura sense of cinematic identity from the director? I thought not.But the underlying ideas are what is most important in RULES OF THE GAME and I give Renoir plenty of credit for successfully exploring them in such a complex way. There are a lot of characters and we have a strong sense of who they all are once up at the chteau contrast this with GOSFORD PARK where there are a couple of random young men among the upper class whose identities are still a bit obscure when the film is over. Renoir seems to be balancing on a difficult tightrope of effectively telling a complex story with characters who are not truly meant to be real but rather to some degree caricatures in a larger satirical whole. This is perhaps the greatest ambition of the film and while I'm not convinced it really works I'm impressed with the diligent thoroughness of how he has attempted to construct it. Much has been said and written about how the public turned against the film when it was released but I wonder if the real culprit was that the film seems a bit unmoored from any specific context from which an audience could approach it. It has numerous elements of farce but it is not a farce. It has very witty lines and eventually an overabundance of buffoonery and implausible behavior from nearly everyone concerned by the last reel or two and yet it is not a comedy. During the hunt it juxtaposes shots of servants and gentry with rabbits and pheasants and you understand the irony intended but that scene for example seems a bit meandering in execution. Is it a fable? Not really that either. I'll admit that a work of art need not comfortably fit into any category yet one still feels a bit bewildered by what Renoir expects you to make of this narrative or how he expects you to process the characters.For while certain things work beautifully and other things seem contrived I often felt caught in a structure where Renoir was deceiving me into trying to relate to the characters as real people and many of the fine performances help that tremendously only to pull out the rug and say in essence haha! I have a satirical agenda here which requires that the integrity of these characters is expendable. Yes one could say that it is the paradox of that rugpulling which represents the genius of the film. No one is immune to the absurdity at the heart of this script. But ultimately I suspect that I either want the characters to seem genuine OR I want the satire or farce to be the point. In this film neither is exactly true.I would see this film again because I agree with others posting here that there is enough in it to warrant additional viewings. It is undeniably an essential landmark in the history of cinema. But I would also agree with those who say it is overrated. For me it lacks the honesty AND the visual distinction of GRAND ILLUSION and also despite its ambitions lacks the basic humanity at the core of something like Bergman's SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT. Admittedly this film came first but when you have a director with the visual pedigree philosophically and genetically of Jean Renoir I expect a more satisfying sense of the auteur as filmmaker not merely as writer and actor. Where this picture is concerned Renoir succeeded best as a thinker and secondly as its writer and as a director of actors. In terms of control of its visual sense and aesthetic as cinema I'm not sure he did quite as effective a job as he might have.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was intrigued by a long review on this site detailing the reasons for the reviewer's dislike of the film since I am also at a loss to understand the film's status. I can defend the film against the reviewer's comments yes Christine is vacuous although also a naive stranger in a strange land a little like Henry James's Isabel Archer but hey she's the Eternal Feminine loving All Men and None.SPOILERS As for the ending it's tragedy remember The Iliad where Patrocles borrows Achilles' armour? and the viewer just has to accept the element of contrivance. It's not supposed to be a surprise we're supposed to guess and dread what's going to happen before the characters do so that we watch the tragedy unfold with awful inevitablity. And if we haven't gotten to know the character who dies well enough to feel any emotion over the ending he's the Romantic Hero rash and reckless and his death is significant because of what he represents.But these are the problems I intellectually understand what Renoir's characters are supposed to represent and the archetypal significance their actions and fates are supposed to have. But maybe because they're archetypes rather than individuals I can't feel anything for them. The movie has a beautiful design but it just doesn't have any emotional immediacy for me unlike contemporary Hollywood masterpieces. The plot is very similar to one of my favourite novels The Portrait of a Lady but I'm drawn into that novel because the novel focuses on the heroine The Rules of the Game is divided between the characters a filmmaking style many defend for vaguely political reasons but which in my opinion diffuses emotion and she is a complex fascinating character not a nebulous archetype. And I have to admit I'm fairly annoyed at the chauvinistic portrayal of women in so many masterpieces of European film Fellini is another culprit here we have the pert sluttish maid her fickle tease of a mistress and her husband's clinging irrational hysterical exmistress. Unlike great European filmmakers like Ophuls and Dreyer Renoir doesn't make even the slightest attempt to get inside the heads of his female characters he doesn't necessarily judge them harshly but he always perceives them from the outside.After 3 viewings this movie has gotten better for me so I'm not giving up and maybe one day it will make an emotional impact on me. Until then however I'm on the outside of this movie too I can understand why it's supposed to be great but I just don't care about it.".

While the camera movements and miseenscene are spectacular most of the characters are one dimensional. Some are interesting. I liked Octave the husband Marceau and Lisette. But the main two characters are completely uninteresting. Andre is a one dimensional character who appears only once in a while in the film. Christine is a zerodimensional character who seems to have no thoughts or opinions on her situation whatsoever. Whoever comes to her she loves them. I didn't believe she was confused for a second. More like she had an empty head.SPOILERSBut I did enjoy the film a lot before I figured out how it would end. At that point I threw up my hands and gave up. Most of the film was kind of light with an existential flavor. I liked that. I still didn't like the main two characters but I did enjoy the mood produced elsewhere in the film. Even when Schumacher was chasing the very funny Marceau around the mansion with a pistol it was funny. It should have seemed ridiculous but it seemed in the spirit of French comedy. But when those two were fired and they mistake Christine for Lisette everything becomes exceedingly silly. Anyway it was a very simplistic and copout way to end the film. The mood and rhythm were completely disrupted and we are left with a rather hackneyed conclusion. To think the man who made possibly the greatest antiwar film ever La Grande Illusion made this weakkneed film. 710.".

	schema:headline " The grandeur and decline of Old World Europe...";
	schema:reviewBody "THE RULES OF THE GAME takes place on the eve of World War II at an aristocratic house party at an opulent chateau on a country estate just outside of Paris where the overlapping affaires d'amour' of all social classes are observed with a keen and compassionate eye.  Renoir looks to the eighteenthcentury world of commedia dell'arte and Mozartian opera and seamlessly integrates farce with tragedy using a classical form to offer his audience a profound and multifaceted parable on the disturbing realities that underlie the veneer of contemporary French society and which are themselves symptomatic of the nascent decline of Old World Europe.The film opens with the arrival of a middleclass aviator Andr Jurieu Roland Toutain who violates the unwritten rules' of social propriety by declaring to a radio reporter his disappointment that the woman he had been courting Christine de la Chesnaye Nora Grgor is not present at his reception after completing a recordbreaking flight across the Atlantic. His apparent indiscretion of making public his private feelings to high society diminishes his initially heroic stature and his skill with the advanced technology of aircraft is not matched by an ability to deal with people particularly in matters of love.  His careless and unmediated show of desire for a highborn lady not only transgresses the received law of proper social conduct but of traditional class distinctions as well. Andr's reckless pursuit of his desire of what he could not have caused him to behave as one beneath his class in order to rise above his station and in the end he was destroyed by the overlapping desire and misguided frustration of yet another man of even lesser social status and refinement. The final killing of Andr is echoed in Alain Resnais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD 1961 when we see the mysterious M' Sascha Pitoff dispatch X' Giorgio Albertazzi with a shotgun for apparently having cuckolded him with A' Delphine Seyrig the year before.Renoir's approach to miseenscne is especially groundbreaking.  He employs seamless cutting as well as long continuous takes and tracking shots which follow characters as the move from one space to the next in a manner that anticipates the graceful circling panning sensuously kinetic camera of Welles Ophls Godard Resnais Bertolucci and others.  He uses deepfocus compositions avoiding closeups by putting many actors in the frame at the same time to suggest multiple viewpoints.  The balustrades of La Colinire and the languorous tracking shots down the long corridors undoubtedly inspired those in LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD while the checkered floor suggests a harlequinade and a chess board upon which the characters maneuver themselves in relation to each other  like the similarly checkered shuffleboard floor in Antonioni's LA NOTTE 1961 or the geometrically precise arrangement of the garden in MARIENBAD.  Interestingly enough Coco Chanel designed the costumes for both THE RULES OF THE GAME and LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD.  Like Antonioni Renoir frames characters in architectural space juxtaposing interior and exterior space such as when the guests arrive at the chateau and a curtain of rain in the foreground obscures their indoor activities.  Renoir's fastmoving tracking shots during the rabbit massacre are imitated in Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY with the camera ominously winding its way through the trenches of World War I.  These kinds of tracking shots also serve to keep the film from becoming talky and static and to deemphasize the importance of the dialogue in the cinematic narrative reducing the interplay of voices to a mere din of savory bon mots' and constant stream of overlapping background chatter.Robert de la Chesnaye Marcel Dalio Christine's husband is fascinated with antique mechanical toy birds and other such gadgets and this fixation suggests an ambivalence toward nineteenthcentury Positivism and how an abstract theoretical or scientific approach to life alienates people from the actual spontaneous concrete experience.  In a way Robert recalls von Rauffenstein Erich von Stroheim forever tending to his geranium in Renoir's previous film GRAND ILLUSION 1937 as well as the character anticipates Steiner Alain Cuny in LA DOLCE VITA who derives more aesthetic pleasure from listening to taperecorded sounds of nature than hearing the real thing or M' in LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD who prefers to continuously play God in an inscrutable matchstick game which only he can win  with the rules of the game known only to him  instead of dealing with messy unpredictable human relationships.As an aristocratic Jew Robert de la Chesnaye could be a composite of Dalio's rich young mercantile Jew Rosenthal and the generous selfsacrificing French nobleman De Boeldieu in GRAND ILLUSION.  When a chef makes an antiSemitic slight against Robert revealing the bigotry of the French working classes it evokes the controversy surrounding the Dreyfuss Affair.  The General's final comment that Robert is one of a dying breed' not only heralds the decay of aristocratic privilege but in from the vantage point of hindsight also seems a chilling spectre of the Holocaust. Christine's Austrian origin alludes to the looming war with Germany and seems a prediction of France's collaboration under the Vichy rgime.  The indiscriminate destruction of life in the rabbit and pheasant hunt sequence forecasts the waste and destruction of the war to come.Robert's comment that he does not want any  fences' separating people seems to indicate the gradual dissolution of the old class systems and nationalistic loyalties and indeed of all the traditional illusions about human nature and civilization that are to be swept away by the war.  The most cryptic sign is the penultimate danse macabre' echoed in the sance and ritual journey to the realm of the dead in LA DOLCE VITA suggesting that Renoir's superficial roundelay in THE RULES OF THE GAME is really a dance of death heralding the apocalyptic destruction of the old Europe.".

	schema:headline " Complex movie about complexity one of the greatest classics";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a movie of superlatives masterpiece classic cult reference influential lesson of cinema best French film ever the movie of movies Truffaut. When it came out in 1939 it was a relative failure albeit not as complete as Renoir himself believed. Critics were balanced. Attendance was low but it was summer and there was turmoil. It was shortened and then banned as were some other films. After WWII it had limited success. Only in 1959 was the present version shown close to the original one it became an instant hit and has remained so ever since. It is the only picture that has always been in the top 10 of Sight  Sound recurring poll 10 in 1952 between 2 and 4 afterwards.Many articles and books were published about this movie I will try to summarise the main findings. WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS IMAGE. It is the first film two years before Citizen Kane to use so masterly and purposefully depth of field long shots and camera movements we see lengthy action in foreground and background. This allows to follow antagonist forces at the same time masterservants menwomen truthlie conventionsinstinct etc. This complexity illustrates the key words of Robert de La Cheyniest Everyone has one's reasons. Just an example when Christine explains her relationship with Jurieux Robert and Octave move behind her. First they are worried then they look happy and fool around. Hence Christine's speech can be heard at two different levels sincere or clever talk to solve a mess. Afterwards the camera moves out and as we see other characters we realise her speech was interpreted as social formality.Images throughout the movie are superb but Renoir warns us image is not truth because truth is complex. For instance when Christine with the binocular sees her husband kissing Genevive she thinks he is cheating while actually he is breaking up.STRUCTURE. As the title hints the main theme is social rules versus human instinct. The hunting scene situated precisely in the middle of the movie is pivotal. This scene is a masterpiece in itself it follows the point of view of the animals massacred and brilliantly alternates generalspecific and longshort shots. Before etiquette is dominant Robert refused to leave Genevive hunters are polite This pheasant was yours  No it was yours everybody plays the social game. The cruel hunt seems to unleash primary instincts afterwards the same two hunters argue about another pheasant people laugh when the general tells about a mortal hunting accident Robert dismisses Genevive Jurieux bluntly tells Jackie he doesn't love her. This revealing of passions will climax in the final party where people will argue fight and eventually kill.The way action flows from one scene to the other is outstanding for instance at the beginning. First located at the airport we move to Christine's room through radio broadcast then to Robert's as Christine walks to him then to Genevive's apartment through a phone call. This fluid efficient movement might now seem obvious however at the time it was groundbreaking.SYMBOLS. They abound but discreetly to illustrate the main themes. For instance persons are shown as prisoners of social conventions they are associated to various automats statues and costumes. When Robert meets Genevive in her apartment we see the two characters among statues in the background. Progressively the shots get closer and closer until finally they focus on their faces just next to the statues the similarity becomes striking.During the party in the castle at the end Robert shows his huge automat. The camera moves on the puppet's faces then on his again he is assimilated to a social automat. However there is more the female painting and the three male puppets can be linked to the actual love stories Lisette  SchumacherMarceauOctave or Christine  JurieuxSt AubinOctaveRobert shown in the flesh.Later on during the party an automated piano symbolically plays on its own the Macabre dance by SaintSans and skeletons enter the stage. We have moved into another dimension and know something will go wrong. However there is more Schumacher comes into the room from behind a curtain just as the skeletons did. He is hence associated to death and will be the one delivering it. At the end Robert gives the closing speech at the top of stairs in front of the persons gathered below just as if he were on stage the social performance finally triumphs celebrated by offscreen music playing for the first time. Hence with the elimination of the disturbing element Jurieux conventions can resume as before. Society needs sacrifices to carry on. As we see with all these examples the movie plays on symbols at different levels one is obvious one is concealed.CHARACTERS. Complexity again they arouse both attraction and contempt. Robert is smart and classy but only values property. Schumacher is a brute but his grief at the end is touching. Marceau is funny but deceitful. Lisette is charming but manipulative. Octave is sweet but eventually pathetic. Some characters evolve notably Christine who at first is lost in social rules. She then tries to comply with them she pretends to Genevive she knew about her relationship with her husband and also tries to cheat on him when actually all she wants is love and children. At the end she says this terrible sentence in a harsh tone to Jackie who is crumbling after Jurieux's death People are looking at us!STYLES. The movie is one of the first to so efficiently mix styles drama comedy thriller social historical. On this last point Renoir wanted to show society at the eve of WWII however some themes are still valid today for instance Octave's speech about lying.The above review only rapidly highlights a few qualities of this rich multilevel movie. It has to be seen and seen again We watch it as we listen to a symphony Bazin.".

Progressively the shots get closer and closer until finally they focus on their faces just next to the statues the similarity becomes striking.During the party in the castle at the end Robert shows his huge automat. The camera moves on the puppet's faces then on his again he is assimilated to a social automat. However there is more the female painting and the three male puppets can be linked to the actual love stories Lisette  SchumacherMarceauOctave or Christine  JurieuxSt AubinOctaveRobert shown in the flesh.Later on during the party an automated piano symbolically plays on its own the Macabre dance by SaintSans and skeletons enter the stage. We have moved into another dimension and know something will go wrong. However there is more Schumacher comes into the room from behind a curtain just as the skeletons did. He is hence associated to death and will be the one delivering it. At the end Robert gives the closing speech at the top of stairs in front of the persons gathered below just as if he were on stage the social performance finally triumphs celebrated by offscreen music playing for the first time. Hence with the elimination of the disturbing element Jurieux conventions can resume as before. Society needs sacrifices to carry on. As we see with all these examples the movie plays on symbols at different levels one is obvious one is concealed.CHARACTERS. Complexity again they arouse both attraction and contempt. Robert is smart and classy but only values property. Schumacher is a brute but his grief at the end is touching. Marceau is funny but deceitful. Lisette is charming but manipulative. Octave is sweet but eventually pathetic. Some characters evolve notably Christine who at first is lost in social rules. She then tries to comply with them she pretends to Genevive she knew about her relationship with her husband and also tries to cheat on him when actually all she wants is love and children. At the end she says this terrible sentence in a harsh tone to Jackie who is crumbling after Jurieux's death People are looking at us!STYLES. The movie is one of the first to so efficiently mix styles drama comedy thriller social historical. On this last point Renoir wanted to show society at the eve of WWII however some themes are still valid today for instance Octave's speech about lying.The above review only rapidly highlights a few qualities of this rich multilevel movie. It has to be seen and seen again We watch it as we listen to a symphony Bazin.";

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then a firefight breaks out on one of the boards about this film. Amid the pomposity of the latest DFC2 thoughtfully wrote This is one film perhaps because of its director and precarious early history that has taken on a halo and the requisite critical support to nullify any criticism. The only question is Is it truly that much better or different or has hyperbole and elaborate rationalisation been canonised as truth? Which is the real heart of the issue when it comes to why I found myself taking against this film so violently.For many people it's not enough to like the film  the dissenters have to be proved wrong. Objective opinion isn't allowed. Only acceptance of a proscribed opinion is acceptable. Anything less is a fault not of the film or a difference in personal taste but of the character of the viewer. I was involved in one dispute over on European Film about this a couple of years ago dismissed as one of the 'army of knuckledragging Nantherthal British morons' that poster Paul Panzer was so fond of racially berating because it was impossible for him to accept anyone else's opinion of the film as being as valid as his own. The reason for the antiBritish sentiments was I think because it had just been reissued in the UK and done very very badly at the boxoffice. Unlike other posters he didn't claim my fellow soldiers were unable to understand it but that we had not seen it at all because noone who saw it could not like it.I recently posted on a thread about overrated films and listed this as one of the two worst films I've ever seen BREATHLESS was the other but that's another story. I just thought it was a bad film plain and simple more CARRY ON UP THE Chteau than high art. There are hundreds of worse films but unlike RULES noone is claiming THE WINTER WARRIOR or Timbo Hines' WAR OF THE WORLDS are alltime greats so the fall from expectation to reality isn't so hard. Thing is would I have had such a low opinion of the film if it weren't for the following factors? 1. The film's reputation as one of the five greatest films of all time. I've never found any reason to agree with this. It just creates a gulf of disappointment when it just turns out to be a silly bedtime farce. I think LA GRAND ILLUSION suffers from the same problem although its a much better film BTW. It's as overhyped as any summer blockbuster popcorn flick.2. The arrogance of many of its defenders. Now I DON'T mean all the posters here who like the film. Some of them have been very reasonable about it some do see that people have their reasons for disliking it. But there's still the stink that this is a film you HAVE to like to be taken seriously.3. The insecurity of many of its defenders. Again this does not apply to all the posters here. But there is a desperate need to cling to the supremacy of one set opinion as a mark of to paraphrase CFK being the 'right kind of personfilm buff.' The phrase Emperor's New Clothes ring any bells? 4. Snobbery towards the initial audience. The whole thing about audiences of the day 'getting it wrong' or not understanding the film. Who says they didn't? Maybe they understood it too well and THAT's why it flopped? Maybe they too found it's artificiality boring it's acting bad it's plot plain silly.5. Reading too much into the history. We keep on getting parallels to Nazi Germany and the assumption it's a comment on fascism and indifference. I don't buy that for one second. Schumacher isn't some protoNazi. He's a very French figure of ridicule. He's not even German but one of those Alsatian FrancoGermans whose nationality changes with the borders after each new war. What he represents is the kind of old fashioned moral puritanism that later found its selfflagellating expression in the Vichy government and its moral renewalhypocrisy. He's not a prophecy but a reflection of a state of mind the French flit to and fro between over the years as the wind changes direction. You'll find the same thing in America with the Moral Majority.This is a film that needs to be seen with low expectations and an open mind. The more people insist on its undeniable greatness the worse it looks the more it disappoints.Bottom line to me the film is just another country house sex comedy. It's just the accident of history that has seen its importance blown out of all proportion as people try to explain away its failure and create a myth that the film cannot live up to for many people. And a lot of people on that longforgotten firefight disliked the film just as a lot liked it. It divides opinions which is one thing in its favour. But I have found that some of the people it appeals to are the very kind of narrowminded selfimportant snobs obsessed with invisible rules that the film takes the pss out of so amateurishly. The best joke in the film is that it appeals to EXACTLY the kind of people it is attacking!".

Renoir is giving us a hero that we almost immediately find is flawed and does not stand up to close inspection as do none of the great political figures of that time.  As the film progresses the hero Jurieux is found wanting in every regard as it turns out.Paulette Dubost as the maid Lisette is introduced early as attendant to a key figure  Christine de la Cheyniest played by Nora Gregor  and is so heartbreakingly pretty even watching her eat an apple is a guilty pleasure.  Christine turns out to be the hub of a wheel of fascination deception and unrequited love yet herself is only as exotic as her foreign background. This Mutt and Jeff pairing is nicely shown in drawing room scenes as the highsociety semicharmer is fawned over by the lovely Lisette.The players intermingle primarily at the chateau of Christine's husband Robert played by Dalio and what unfolds is a tale that documents the excesses of both classes.  We might say we see a series of interpersonal clashes amidst cluelessinlove slackers with the occasional agendawielding guest thrown in but all this is recorded with just the right touch of realism.  So we find that Christine's heart may well lie with the adoring Jurieux that Lisette is not exactly pining for her gamekeeper husband Schumacher Robert's lover is not sure of her need for him or he of his feelings for her and throughout poor Octave remains a stolid yet curiously uncommitted friend to all.      The only aspect of the film that does not come across well is the sometimes overly hammy acting of some of the players.  But with the exception of Renoir himself playing Octave this overthetopness comes in fits and starts never overwhelming us at all.  Renoir's Octave could have been played by Jackie Gleason to great effect.  Very noticeable to current viewers is the great similarity of the more recent Gosford Park' to this 1939 Jean Renoir film.  While Robert Altman's film focuses on class differences so piquantly Rules' is actually more sublime.  But that hankypanky and its inevitably hurtful consequence knows no class  despite Rules'  could not be more fascinating than the depiction given it by Renoir in this film.Rating Four Stars.".

I was expecting something revolutionary something really unique but instead I found it to be clich and boring. I suppose one could argue that that was the whole point of the movie that the upper class life was trite and boring and that's all well and good say what you must but a good filmmaker need not make the movie trite and boring to prove those same qualities as a point about society. The direction was blas although i did enjoy the sets and the use of space. The writing was mostly predictable and when it wasn't it was instead idiotic. The characters were ridiculous and not just because they were supposed to be. They were ridiculous in the way Days of Our Lives characters are ridiculous. Which leads me to my overall point of the movie This disappointing film seems to be a precursor for today's mindrotting brainboiling television soap operas. Stick this two hour movie on the WB I'm sure couch potatoes would love to follow it as a sixweek mini series right after Smallville or One Tree Hill maybe? Maybe Fox would like to pick it up stick it before Lost. Although the movie's historical context and history helps the film to be a bit more impressive and allows a viewer to appreciate it in some respect it does not save the film. Only watch this movie if it's free and you've got absolutely nothing else to do for two hours or if you have to write a term paper on it and it's 75 of your grade. if it's any lower than 75 try and find a cliff notes version.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not all cake that looks good from the outside is good as its dancing down your throat. From a distance The Rules of the Game looks visually stunning but inside the package lies a broken story full of jumbled story lines weak dialogue shallow decisions bizarre actions characters that come out of nowhere and character that literally disappear from the flick. The director has a good eye for shots but the story needed oh so much help. Yes I am fully aware that it's important in the history of film. But an example I've used before Faceball 2000 is the first firstperson shooter game in console history. Does it make the game any good being a contributor? Of course not but we are aware of its existence and bookmark in history. The Rules of the Game is a benchmark much like how the French Revolution is a bookmark one some would rather not talk about. However I've already started babbling about the flick might as well finishsomething I was wishing the film could do.He loves her. She loves him. He doesn't love her. She does love him but not that much. She wishes he could love her. He is a nice guy that secretly loves her. She is an idiot that loves someone else. Rabbits are hunted. This is more or less the plot of the movie. Yes there are plenty of underlying details and plenty of themes explored but it doesn't make up for the ridiculousness of the plot line involving several rich socialites and the web of love they are weaving that escalates and involves more people during the climax at a dinner. The web isn't the annoying part it's the ability to change your mind many times as the movie progresses as to whom you are attracted to and just how much you are attracted to them. It strips away from the realism of the movie and strips away at the credibility of the writing staff. Film historians love to point out that the movie is old and one mustn't watch the movie with a modernday eye. My rebuttal is to watch some classic Charlie Chaplin whose work came out mostly before this and then see a good story with good themes.The director knows how to craft a good shot and move the camera in a motion that involves the audience and makes them a member of the socialite clan. However this is contradicted with the stupidlooking fights the constant fainting and one of the more disgusting scenes in cinema history the extended sequence of rabbits getting shot. What on earth is going on when a movie is praised for its camerawork as it spends five minutes showing animals getting shot at? First off the movie is long enough as it is second off it doesn't contribute much to the plot third off its just disgusting altogether. The director doesn't deserve to have his name mentioned in this paragraph for that sequence alone.Might as well mention him in this paragraph. Eh not yet. The acting of the movie is a mixed bag too bad the dialogue doesn't help them much. Their true acting chops can be revealed towards the end as each of the main characters is emotionally stripped and you see each of their flaws and anxieties towards the end. Too bad the ending comes out of nowhere and really doesn't close out the story. After 100plus minutes of bickering and dialogueheavy conversations that really doesn't reveal anything other than love and lust one would hope for an ending that can tie all loose ends. Not here.What is it with the forgiveness of flaws in older movies? The theme of love here is butchered to a point of embarrassment. Just like Romeo and Juliet the way love is presented here is all wrong. This isn't love this is a lot of lust lusting about through the entire picture. Morality is shot in the foot and at the face as we see constant cheating oncamera and offcamera through verbal clues. From the beginning as the pilot curses the heavens and the woman he is in love with to the end as the backstabbing reaches a maximum level this predates MTV's Real World. The difference is this movie is considered a masterpiece. Why? Bottom Line Studying film becomes tough sometimes simply because of the requirement to appreciate and fall in love with several crucial movies of the early 20th century. Another trashy movie like this makes me almost want to switch majors or change my title to ModernDay Film Critic. If this title doesn't exist I shall be the first to achieve this because despite the camerawork there isn't much positive to say about this movie. The story is a mess the characters aren't that likable there is very little comedy there is very little entertainment value and the tastelessness of it all just hampers the experience even more. Unless you want to cue this movie or copy the way the camera captures all that is going on there is no reason whatsoever to watch this French mess.

	onyx:emotionText "Not all cake that looks good from the outside is good as its dancing down your throat. From a distance The Rules of the Game looks visually stunning but inside the package lies a broken story full of jumbled story lines weak dialogue shallow decisions bizarre actions characters that come out of nowhere and character that literally disappear from the flick. The director has a good eye for shots but the story needed oh so much help. Yes I am fully aware that it's important in the history of film. But an example I've used before Faceball 2000 is the first firstperson shooter game in console history. Does it make the game any good being a contributor? Of course not but we are aware of its existence and bookmark in history. The Rules of the Game is a benchmark much like how the French Revolution is a bookmark one some would rather not talk about. However I've already started babbling about the flick might as well finishsomething I was wishing the film could do.He loves her. She loves him. He doesn't love her. She does love him but not that much. She wishes he could love her. He is a nice guy that secretly loves her. She is an idiot that loves someone else. Rabbits are hunted. This is more or less the plot of the movie. Yes there are plenty of underlying details and plenty of themes explored but it doesn't make up for the ridiculousness of the plot line involving several rich socialites and the web of love they are weaving that escalates and involves more people during the climax at a dinner. The web isn't the annoying part it's the ability to change your mind many times as the movie progresses as to whom you are attracted to and just how much you are attracted to them. It strips away from the realism of the movie and strips away at the credibility of the writing staff. Film historians love to point out that the movie is old and one mustn't watch the movie with a modernday eye. My rebuttal is to watch some classic Charlie Chaplin whose work came out mostly before this and then see a good story with good themes.The director knows how to craft a good shot and move the camera in a motion that involves the audience and makes them a member of the socialite clan. However this is contradicted with the stupidlooking fights the constant fainting and one of the more disgusting scenes in cinema history the extended sequence of rabbits getting shot. What on earth is going on when a movie is praised for its camerawork as it spends five minutes showing animals getting shot at? First off the movie is long enough as it is second off it doesn't contribute much to the plot third off its just disgusting altogether. The director doesn't deserve to have his name mentioned in this paragraph for that sequence alone.Might as well mention him in this paragraph. Eh not yet. The acting of the movie is a mixed bag too bad the dialogue doesn't help them much. Their true acting chops can be revealed towards the end as each of the main characters is emotionally stripped and you see each of their flaws and anxieties towards the end. Too bad the ending comes out of nowhere and really doesn't close out the story. After 100plus minutes of bickering and dialogueheavy conversations that really doesn't reveal anything other than love and lust one would hope for an ending that can tie all loose ends. Not here.What is it with the forgiveness of flaws in older movies? The theme of love here is butchered to a point of embarrassment. Just like Romeo and Juliet the way love is presented here is all wrong. This isn't love this is a lot of lust lusting about through the entire picture. Morality is shot in the foot and at the face as we see constant cheating oncamera and offcamera through verbal clues. From the beginning as the pilot curses the heavens and the woman he is in love with to the end as the backstabbing reaches a maximum level this predates MTV's Real World. The difference is this movie is considered a masterpiece. Why? Bottom Line Studying film becomes tough sometimes simply because of the requirement to appreciate and fall in love with several crucial movies of the early 20th century. Another trashy movie like this makes me almost want to switch majors or change my title to ModernDay Film Critic. If this title doesn't exist I shall be the first to achieve this because despite the camerawork there isn't much positive to say about this movie. The story is a mess the characters aren't that likable there is very little comedy there is very little entertainment value and the tastelessness of it all just hampers the experience even more. Unless you want to cue this movie or copy the way the camera captures all that is going on there is no reason whatsoever to watch this French mess. Bah forget the use of decent English words this movie sucks. There. Take my film degree if I am required to like it. Take it.P.S. The director's name is Jean Renoir.";

I'm thinking of Marriage of Figaro and Cosi fan Tutte in particular as the Mozart operas most closely related to Renoir's cinema masterpiece. Like those operas there is a masterfully proportioned blend of outrageous humor and deep pathos. It is a comedy but it is a particularly civilized form of comedy that you will not encounter in another film except maybe in some films of Charlie Chaplin. Above every human situation in the convoluted plot there is the allpervading sadness for a fading civilization about to be extinguished. The ambiguities of that civilization are perfectly captured in two hours of cinematic heaven. Everything about this film is extraordinary and I long to see it issued on DVD and only Criterion will be able to do it justice. I hope they will turn to it soon!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are reading this comment page you will see only two semi negative reviews one of the two this one split up into two. They're both mine. Every other one calls The Rules of the Game one of the best films ever made. I saw it for the first time right around one year ago in a class in which we had already seen such masterpieces as L'Atalante Quai des Brumes and La Grande Illusion. All three are on my personal top 100 list. And I've seen other French films within a halfdecade's or so radius that are nearly on my top 100 list  Le million A nous la liberte Children of Paradise and Beauty and the Beast.The Grand Illusion was the film we watched prior to this one and I liked it quite a bit. I didn't quite think it was a masterpiece but I had an inkling that the poor VHS quality may have been the fault. I bought the Criterion DVD which was just recently printed from the master print that had been confiscated by Nazis and stored away in Berlin. Anyhow even before I LOVED The Grand Illusion I thought it was great. Then I saw Rules of the Game and I was bewildered. What had happened to Renoir in the two years between Grand Illusion and this? I gave it a 710 on imdb mostly because I did recognize Renoir's direction as being excellent 90 of the flaws are in the script 0 in the direction or technical aspects the final 10 can be found in the performances and wrote a review in which my ultimate verdict was weakkneed. During the next class period everyone was exclaiming how much they loved Rules of the Game. Had I missed something? I didn't admit so at the time but as I began to read more and more of how great people thought it was my own confidence in my opinion began to falter. I had no real desire to see it once again but I always felt that I should. When I began visiting movie message boards the ones on imdb I posed the question Why is Rules of the Game so great? I can't figure it out myself. A ton of people gave very helpful explanations especially on how to look at the characters of Christine and Andre both of whom I had found lame when I had first seen the film. Many proposed themes found here but really there wasn't any particular theme proposed that I thought I had missed the first time around. I posted that discussion in June. Almost instantly it appeared on TCM which made it all feel like an omen. I taped it but I still put off watching it. Now four months later a full year after I first saw it I finally sat down and watched it again.My verdict is almost exactly the same. The first time around I handed it a low 710. Now I raise it to the glorious height of a high 710. Little consolation to Rules of the Game fans. A 710 is a 710 on the imdb. So what has changed about my perception of the film? This time Christine came off better. I called her a zerodimensional character below who says 'I love you' to whichever man comes up to her arbitrarily not exact quotations mind you. This time around I sympathized with her much more. I see her as a stranger in a strange land who has been taken advantage of by La Chesnay Maurice Dalio whom I didn't recognize as Rosenthal from La Grande Illusion last time that's actually referenced in this film with specific reference to La Chesnay's Jewishness. She's kind and she doesn't really know how to handle men especially romantics like Andre. SPOILERS Everything else I said in my review stands. Andre is still a onedimensional character with whom I really wish we could spend more time in order to understand him better. He's barely in the film and his death has no impact whatsoever. Basically the structure of the film is what is weakkneed. The first half or so is delicious up until the masquerade. Everything becomes exceedingly ridiculous not too bad but Renoir is trying to be funny as you can tell from Schumacher's Loony Toonslike pursuit of Marceau the guests' reactions to the gunfire Genevieve's drunken tantrum and the fisticuffs between La Chesnay and Andre. I don't find any of it funny and neither did that first audience with whom I watched it although everyone claimed to love the film and most of it I find hard to believe especially Schumacher's behavior. I believe that he'd be insanely angry but I don't buy that he goes about shooting randomly.But it is especially in the final sequence after most of the unimportant guests go to their rooms that the narrative falls completely to pieces. I cannot think of a more contrived 30 minutes in all of filmdom. It's almost insulting. Okay say that I accepted the wackiness of Schumacher's blasting away indoors. How the heck do I accept that he and Marceau are now fine with each other? This is Renoir's old notion that people who are in the same boat will naturally be amigos the French and Chinese farmers paradigm. I buy this when we're talking about Marechal and Rosenthal Marechal and Elsa or Boedlieu and Rauffenstein in The Grand Illusion but when Schumacher has just been attempting to whack Marceau for the last hour and ended up without wife or job on account of it this man's going to want to whack his nemesis even harder when they get outside at least Renoir has Marceau flinch when he sees Schumacher. I find it even less believable that Marceau would go along with the murder of Lisette's other love since when did we ever see that he was the jealous or vengeful type? If Marceau had disappeared and Schumacher had acted alone then I'd be a little more accepting.".

They certainly don't want to be perceived as a lay person! Quickly they convince even themselves that Rules of the Game is not only better than The Grand Illusion but much much better or for another example that the studioneutered The Magnificent Ambersons is better than Citizen Kane or for yet another example The Godfather II is better than the original or that Kundun is better than Raging Bull or another Scorsese example The King of Comedy is better than Taxi Driver these latter two opinions you may be hearing much more often in twenty or thirty years judging from some of the favorite alternative critics and some of the film buffs I've been speaking to over the last couple of years. Again they don't want to be perceived as lay persons. The great irony of this is that Rules of the Game shows characters of lower class wanting desperately to be perceived as upper class. So what happens when Rules of the Game is perceived as too well known? Then what will be the favorite Renoir film to all who claim to be hip? Nana? Toni? The Southerner or The River?

The history was simple a group of rich french meets in a big house for a hunting ant it happens a lot of confusions and unexpected romances. The film is not more much it is so slow and boring... that the viewer wants that film just finish. You can find similitudes with the style of Lubitsch but Lubitch's titles are more interesting and dynamic than this one.

By the time the film was in cinemas it was horrible results and it is logical.The film is apparently a comedy with a drama include but the film was so boring... The history was simple a group of rich french meets in a big house for a hunting ant it happens a lot of confusions and unexpected romances. The film is not more much it is so slow and boring... that the viewer wants that film just finish. You can find similitudes with the style of Lubitsch but Lubitch's titles are more interesting and dynamic than this one.

	schema:reviewBody "This farce about love flirtation and decadence in the upper class society was too much for the rich and famous when this Jean Renoir film premiered in France before the outbreak of the second world war in 1939. The film got bad reviews and some of the angry viewers trashed interiors and on of the premiere cinemas was fire lit with a newspaper by an angry cinema goer. Obviously one from the aristocracy and no wonder they were upset. Because in this film Renoir ridicules the rich and famous in a way that must have been provocative.After a rather insightful but still rather static start where we get to see the importance if radio and mechanical playing dolls and music boxes leading up to when we meet the whole ensemble at a big mansion party where also a madlyinlove pilot is maneuvered in thanks to help from a friend. The weekend is about hunting rabbits and women and eventually men. The film winds up like a bad party with crying and a messy lovejealousy lite night when the whole party is going to pieces. Still it ends in a way quite happy.The film is of course very 1939 but has remarkable quality though it was thought lost as both the original rolls were bombed to bits during the war as well as most copies were burnt both by the French haters as well as the German occupiers the following years. They also hated the film for more than one reason. Some copies was found 17 years later which made it possible to restore all except one scene according to Renoir himself.The film ridicules also the light hearted and easily scared and hysterical women this is why women tend to like this film less than men though it's really the men which I think come out silly here the Jews and also have a couple of other things we today actually would find non appropriate. But then this was back in 1939.Jean Renoir plays one of the more significant roles himself as the guy bounding the whole charade together. It's easy to see this film has influenced many later film makers and novel writers in many countries. I find many scenes which resembles scenes I've seen before in films which has come out far later. I would even count in late films like Von Triers Melancholy and some of the great ensemble films by Robert Altman. So you could surely say this is essential and is also often used as a film reference for film students.After the slow start the film really rolls on to be significant and a cut above most if the Hollywood films from the same time era. The instruction and acting is the thing assuring this. It doesn't hurt that the film was regarded as a provocation to the rich back then and the same to the Nazis. A classic!".

In its day I'm sure it probably did well in the theaters but in this day and age it just seemed really old and tired to me. This is not because I hate old films or French filmsI love both if done well. However I just found myself pretty bored by the picture and felt that watching practically EVERYONE from the rich jetsetters to the servants bouncing from partner to partner was not my cup of tea. It actually was rather funny that although practically everyone was cheating on their spouses in the film they never really seemed to get around to having sex. Mostly they just seemed to go through the motions of wooing and sneaking about instead of any real infidelity.Although a few Hollywood films have similar story elements this movie stands in sharp contrast to the average American film. The French in the 1930s would probably have seen most Americans in films of the day as uptight and too conventional while Americans would have been amazed at how fixated the French were on infidelity. Even way back then the differences in the two cultures seem extreme when we view them in film.By the way Octave is actually played by the director Jean Renoir.".

Marcel Dalio the Casablanca croupier as the Count is superb in his childlike qualities while scrupulously adhering to the rules of society and good manners.  Jean Renoir the director who also has a key role as Octave is delightful as the friend and gobetween.  Others characters are all well cast with in my opinion one exceptionthe count's wife Christine played by Nora Gregor.  While I like her a little better with each viewing I don't feel she does justice to the role.  Arletty would have been great though perhaps too sophisticated for the role.  Like Carne's Children of Paradise this is a film where the characters become more and more like old friends with each viewing.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys films of the 1930s and 40s.".

May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that wasn't needed sorry to Robert Englund but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.Freddy is back but he's got something we don't know about a daughter. Maggie she's not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best to resist his powers but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic isn't it? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3D radical huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story. I didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is the death master of nightmares not Father Knows Best.210".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film.  Is it one of the best of the Nightmare series?  Maybe not but I had lots of fun with it.  Freddy Krueger reaches his evil wisecracking potential.  Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down I felt this socalled final installment New Nightmare is the real finale brought the series out of its slump.  There are some great nightmare sequences including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls.  This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence especially when we see him out of the dreamscape hopping around like Super Mario.  And Freddy belts out the funny oneliner Great graphics.  And since the movie was made about 10 years ago it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove.  Anyone who remembers the first 8bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove.  The cast is superb.  Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead.  I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since The Running Man and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago.  He's another great underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence.  And who can forget the cameos? The best one is by Johnny Depp from the first Nightmare playing a spokesman for an antidrug commercial.  The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome!  So for those who are looking to check this film outplease rent or buy it on DVD!  Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed.  I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film.  It even elaborated on Freddy's backstory.  The film is a great mix of humor and scares and the grossout effects are terrific.  Could this have given better justice to the franchise?  Of course it could have.  But Rachel Talalay did a fine job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.And in closing I loved the montage over the opening credits.  Fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy.   My score  7 out of 10".

The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. Only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere.

Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to watch Freddy's Dead. the end was originally filmed in 3D.A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang! Lisa Zane Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final installment. Rosanne Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one.I have to recommend this movie for Freddy fans.".

The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price. Only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that doesn't stop Freddy from seeking out his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him he always comes back for more. But this time he finds out a little more about his old life. Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to watch Freddy's Dead. the end was originally filmed in 3D.A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang! Lisa Zane Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final installment. Rosanne Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one.I have to recommend this movie for Freddy fans.";

There were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities and don't get me started on the bad.The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but I will recap them here in case anyone cares. Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with Freddy's longlost child. Now the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is HEREDITARY so why not a mysterytype slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.Then there's the trip to Springfield where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.Of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with Freddy's Dead it just doesn't try at all leave alone hard enough.On a related note I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions the sciencefiction miniseries V for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played Freddy is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast well I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than Bgrade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of Bfilms.All in all Freddy's Dead gets a 1 out of me. I'd vote lower but the IMDb doesn't allow for that. FD is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Often people will have low expectations going into a film like FREDDY'S DEAD THE FINAL NIGHTMARE. How good can the sixth installment of any series be let alone a string of lowbudget frightfests? Yet I am not of the belief that horror series are doomed to run out of steam. Heck I think Friday THE 13TH got better with age. But although I had an open mind while watching what was supposedly the last NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET film I found it a bitter disappointment in every way.Once again our favorite grotesquelydisfigured dream stalker is after a group of teens dispatching them one by one as they sleep. Yet none of the creativity or style of the previous films is present. Whatever happened to sequences such as the waterbed from Part 4 or the marionette from Part 3? It's as though producers cobbled this together just for the sake of making another Freddy film.Other shortcomings abound. While other NIGHTMARE entries have been nothing short of brilliant at making the most of a limited budget FREDDY'S DEAD looks the cheapest of them all. This is especially true when we see a younger Freddy meet the computergenerated dream spirits. It was reminiscent of a thirdrate Saturday morning children's show. Humor was attempted here with cameos by Johnny Depp and Roseann Arnold and a video game sequence with Freddy at the joystick but it all falls flat. The acting is stale and Rachal Talalay directorial debut uninspired.The finale is a particular disappointment. Of all the memorable ways Freddy has been killed in previous films is having his daughter turn his own glove against him the best they could come up with? Granted the idea of bringing the killer into the real world was a good one but its potential was not fully explored.Overall FREDDY'S DEAD is arguably one of the worst  if not the worst  films in this popular saga. And yes that includes Part 2 and the overly artsy DREAM CHILD. One has to believe that if they had it to do all over again the people behind this film could come up with something a lot better than this.".

	onyx:emotionText "Often people will have low expectations going into a film like FREDDY'S DEAD THE FINAL NIGHTMARE. How good can the sixth installment of any series be let alone a string of lowbudget frightfests? Yet I am not of the belief that horror series are doomed to run out of steam. Heck I think Friday THE 13TH got better with age. But although I had an open mind while watching what was supposedly the last NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET film I found it a bitter disappointment in every way.Once again our favorite grotesquelydisfigured dream stalker is after a group of teens dispatching them one by one as they sleep. Yet none of the creativity or style of the previous films is present. Whatever happened to sequences such as the waterbed from Part 4 or the marionette from Part 3? It's as though producers cobbled this together just for the sake of making another Freddy film.Other shortcomings abound. While other NIGHTMARE entries have been nothing short of brilliant at making the most of a limited budget FREDDY'S DEAD looks the cheapest of them all. This is especially true when we see a younger Freddy meet the computergenerated dream spirits. It was reminiscent of a thirdrate Saturday morning children's show. Humor was attempted here with cameos by Johnny Depp and Roseann Arnold and a video game sequence with Freddy at the joystick but it all falls flat. The acting is stale and Rachal Talalay directorial debut uninspired.The finale is a particular disappointment. Of all the memorable ways Freddy has been killed in previous films is having his daughter turn his own glove against him the best they could come up with? Granted the idea of bringing the killer into the real world was a good one but its potential was not fully explored.Overall FREDDY'S DEAD is arguably one of the worst  if not the worst  films in this popular saga. And yes that includes Part 2 and the overly artsy DREAM CHILD.

The only reason it holds it self up is the back story on Freddy.The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are the death scenes. But the death scenes were very crappy in this. The visual effects were great and the acting was OK but the back story was excellent. Basically Freddy's story comes full circle in this.I have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws 1. A Nightmare on Elm Street. 810 2. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare. 710 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master. 710 4. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 The Dream Warriors. 710 5. A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child. 610 6. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge. 310 I recommend it if you enjoy the series. This is were Freddy is fully explained but thats all there is. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare.710".

Its am big fan of the Freddy movies and this finale to the saga is just plain insulting.  I might even call it one of the worst movies not only of 1991 but in cinematic history. It's a mess beyond wildest proportions. The look of the movie is just unsightly. It's acne. It looks like the work of a really low budget student filmmaker.  The cinematography is ugly the whole production design is a junkyard.  The plot of the movie is retarded.  The characters in the movie have no color and we have no sympathy for them. There just dumb teenage stereotypes.  Freddy isn't much of a villain in this movie.  His murder sequences are played for laughs but they aren't funny.  We get the odd feeling that Freddy is aging and that he can't be too evil and domineering or else he might get a bad back.  He's a wuss. And the special effects. There aren't many in this movie. It's like the director said  OH! WE DONT NEED A SPECIAL EFFECTS TEAM! LET'S JUST MAKE THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF THE MOVIE IN 3D TO COMPENSATE!  The FreddyVision 3D sequence is laughably bad.  I found the Fox TV MOVIE REVENGE OF THE NERDS NERDS IN LOVE's 3D sequence more visually stunning.  When the main character first puts on the special 3D glasses that will enable her to enter Freddy's brain she begins to see everything in 3D and puts her hand into her face with amazement.  Is it just me but even without her glasses on she'd able to see things around her in the third dimension anyway. OH MY GOD!  We're suppose to believe the main character is entering Freddy's thoughts.  There is a scene in the 3D sequence where the Lisa Zane character has to break a circuit in Freddy's head to get into a door...Since when did anyone have electrical fuse box sitting in their brain.  it's just gets suckier and suckier..it's depressing. The finale in FREDDY's DEAD when Freddy actually dies is the most disappointing insultingly dumb ending you'll ever see! He dies in a basement of a youth shelter and he explodes from a stupid pipe bomb. HOW CHEESY IS THAT??!!!  I CAN'T GO ON HOW MUCH I HATED THIS MOVIE!  IT'S GETTING ME SO MAD..I just feel like strangling the head of New Line Cinema for taking 90 precious minutes out of my life that I will never get back.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSA couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic. Generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant soulless and cynical this venture was.Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain Robert Englund's innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it so who's the one laughing? And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character predeath in a flashback Englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic ie. overstated misplaced and not at all funny irony.Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself Yaphet Kotto keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit. Carlos Ricky Dean Logan opens a road map upon which the Noel Cowardlike Freddy has wittily written you're fked. When prompted for the map Carlos responds well the map says we're fked. Who wrote the screenplay Oscar Wilde?Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. Nice hearing from you Carlos quips Freddy hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy Lezlie Deane is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the fk up man and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.".

I like the beginning scene with the house falling a homage to Wizard of Oz the old house at 1428 Elm Street and the various dream sequences that lead to the deaths of the various characters. Now the bad stuff.  Well this movie does not follow the events of the other NOES movies. But who cares! You can't take the NOES series seriously for Jebus sake.  Its a horror plot  enjoy the outlandish and creative ways the antagonist kills his protagonists.  That and the acting is pretty campy.  As a NOES fan I enjoy this movie and consider it mindless and entertaining. It adds a twist to the other movies and helps in a positive way for the surreal dream sequences.I give it an 810 for the horror that is Nightmare on Elm Street series NOES series.".

Crime stories often fall in common places this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this.

	schema:headline " A masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darn turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974 a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darn and his superior the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier if it was an Englishlanguage film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy love violence and humour is brilliant and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darn is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem in fact the secondary acting is all firstclass. The camerawork is impressive especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's it deserves to walk it.".

Ricardo Darn turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974 a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darn and his superior the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier if it was an Englishlanguage film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy love violence and humour is brilliant and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darn is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem in fact the secondary acting is all firstclass. The camerawork is impressive especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's it deserves to walk it.";

This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time no decays at all and the set design is also great to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "In my country Juan Jos Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know dramatically what we're going to watch Ricardo Darn in an important role a lot of sentimentalism references to the country's past a love story. And technically if it's the highest order there won't be any complaints. When the film ended the people in the movie theater started clapping.El secreto de sus ojos tells the story of Benjamn Esposito Darn and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales Pablo Rago who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. You have to see his eyes they are in a state of pure love Benjamn professes in front of Irene Hastings Soledad Villamil his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget Campanella knows well and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years as we saw with Darn and Villamil in El mismo amor la misma lluvia we expect characters with inner ghosts things to hide and things to hold on to we expect total control over the language of the environment in El mismo amor... it was a magazine staff in Luna de Avellaneda the neighborhood club a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for daytoday comedy. In this aspect the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances. That's about everything we can expect. The fact is El secreto de sus ojos is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture Campanella flirts with thriller mystery and real action handycam included he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters each of them with a rich mysterious private and inner world must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact because Darn as a director tried to achieve something like that with La seal. Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film everything that went wrong there can be seen here improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk however and defy you to tell me if because of image and makeup resemblance and disposition of images and voice in off the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's The Prestige. It's quoting it somehow at least.It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much we know what they do we admire them and respect them and as with Campanella we tend to know what to expect. However sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darn do in this film it's enchanting and contagious purely human as it occurred in El mismo amor... but at the same time moving simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film or young actors with expressive faces or newcomers that take our breath away they are Ricardo Darn and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this filmmaking of the highest order? I believe so in our country and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and who knows maybe other national pieces.".

I think one of the greatest things of the movie is the dialogs with or without swearing it is very local and this might be the only flaw of the movie.";

	schema:headline " Sus Ojos as Literature on the Screen long";
	schema:reviewBody "To get the big picture before beginning this piece I did a quick sweep of previous reviews and immediately had to ask myself why does the same film generate such passionate applause on the one hand and such punishing comments on the other? I suppose it goes back to the question of sus ojos your eyes. Those looking for an American style murder mystery or a boymeetsgirl losesgirl findsgirl romance may in fact have their eyes closed to some important possibilities. But those willing to see film as a novel have an experience to look forward to an experience that satisfies and enlightens on every level.Sus Ojos is a multilayered film that like the work of Dostoevsky makes us totally vested in the lives of its characters while exploring universal themes that can resonate with all of us. There are two major threads here that are worth close examination the first is the unrequited passion that the intelligent and humane legal affairs clerk Benjamin Esposito feels for his wellbred supervisor the beautiful distant and self possessed Superior Court judge Irene Menendez. Having only completed high school he has convinced himself he has nothing to offer her. In fact his life is comparable to the clunky typewriter he has been given with the defective a that always pops up as a capital letter flawed just not good enough. Esposito is held back by his selfdoubt to the extent that 25 years after the relationship begins as he tries to start a novel based on an unresolved murder case the prompt he uses to remove writer's block is TEMOI fear. Yet he is not a true coward he simply like any blocked writer doesn't know how to reach his goalsboth the completion of the novel and true connection with Irene.The second theme one that is strategically intertwined with the first is the murder case itself. Soon into the film it becomes apparent that Esposito's inability to resolve the rape and stabbing of a beautiful 23yearold school teacherthat is to bring the murderer to full justicerepresents his de facto impotence in bringing his relationship with Irene into reality. And on an immediate leveltoo his obsession with the case makes perfect sense. Empathetic and perceptive to begin withwho else would continue to give support to an alcoholic friend as Esposito doeshe wants to bring justice to the dead girl and some element of resolution to her traumatized husband. Soon we are intrigued by the growing relationships between not only Irene and Esposito but between Benjamin and his friend who disparages him to barfly friends Esposito and the husband who insists that life in prison is the only acceptable punishment for the murderer Esposito and the murder suspect the murder suspect and Irene revealing a toughness and ingenuity we hadn't seen before and ultimately the husband and the killer. And it is when Esposito sees that the final resolution is left to the husband that he is free to move on with his life. A simple act brings the decision to life he suddenly realizes that by putting his defective letter A into the word TEMO he will end up with teAmoI love you the declaration he must makethe action he must takein order to go forward and leave the past behind.Visual motifs keep the viewer connected and grounded throughout the film but placed to appear to be a natural artifact of the story telling. The most obvious one is the door image used in promotional posters for the film. The judge's chamber door consistently is kept open or closed depending on her relationship with those who enter. Esposito attempting to put the final piece of a 25year old puzzle into place must wait for the husband to leave his house and enter a secret door. In the same way secrets are hidden or revealed throughout the movie by means of doors large and small obvious or subtle. A second motif is the train image showing arrivals and departures journeys and moving on from situations that cannot be resolved. Esposito his life threatened by associates of the murderer must take the train to a new town leaving behind a regretful running Irene. The husband tells about murdering the suspectthe roar of a passing train disguising the sound of gunshots. A third of course is the eye seen open and waiting in Esposito in the beginning shotsthis is the eye of a person open to experience. The dead girls' eyes must be physically closed by an attending police officer. Esposito feels deep connection to her husband citing the love for the lost wife seen in his eyes. A fourth is the interplay of columns at the department of justiceseen top down or bottom uprepresenting the aloof justice system corruption and bureaucracy of the Argentian course system that prevents justice from taking place.This film has it all under the accomplished hand of director Jose Campanella. Acting is up thereRicardo Darin as Esposito Soledad Villamil as Irene and Pablo Rago as the friend are equally affecting. Then again there are the strong story lines thematic development pitchperfect cinematography the chase seen through an enormous soccer stadium is as believable as they come and even touches of humor developed through perfectly synchronized dialogue. Is there a happy ending? Well as both Esposito and Irene tell each other at the endand as we see in the best loved novelsit's complicated.".

Over a twentyfive year period these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also in the middle is the messed friend an alcoholic who can be a true talent but is submerged in his problems spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him you will see why I choose this character as a reference.

Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirtyfive years and now in just few days after we saw it we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie Tell No One one of our all time favorites as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish of course with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by wellknown Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre there is a strong ending which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.".

It's spectacular cinematography.It's a masterpiece.Going in all I knew is that it was a highly regarded film from Argentina that won an Oscar. I know zip about Argentine cinema but it's hard to believe a better movie has ever been made there.One thing Americans should know is that this foreign film with subtitles is in no way shape or form an art movie loaded with ambiguity and other hoity toity stuff like that. This movie is the work of a master craftsman director working off a brilliant and intricate thriller script.The narrative unfolds in interspersed scenes involving the same people but 25 years apart. It's the same actors and characters but youthful in some scenes and with wrinkles and gray hair in others.The plot turns on the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young wife. Front and center throughout the movie are Benjamin the passionate young investigator for whom this particular case is one he cannot set aside and Irene his colleague it was a little unclear to an American what their professional relationship was who clearly is drawn to his passion and has feelings for him even though she is engaged to someone else offscreen.Two shots must be discussed. First there's THE shot. Anyone who has seen it will know exactly what I mean. It's a onetake seemingly but not really  it would be impossible without CGI tracking shot involving a chase in a packed soccer stadium. The second muchdiscussed shot is only about a minute long and happens in an elevator but you will not breathe during that incredibly tense minute.Lots of credit goes to the secondary actors who portray a law clerk with a drinking problem the perpetrator of the crime a hapless intern a weaselly judge and the devastated husband of the victim.The ending is an elegantly shown series of reveals. The nexttolast sequence totally screws with your mind. I kid you not it's a shocker and it comes out of nowhere. Then comes the grand finale with Benjamin and Irene in the touching end scene.You will leave the theater simultaneously with a chill down your spine and a lump in your throat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Douglas McGrath has done a splendid job bringing Charles Dickens' delightful novel 'Nicholas Nickleby' to the big screen. 'Nickleby' is quintessential Dickens in its mixture of sentiment and satire its finely drawn characters and caricatures its clear cut delineation of good and evil hero and villain its melodramatic and coincidenceridden plotting and its championing of the downtrodden underclass of 19th Century England. Like many of Dickens' protagonists Nicholas is a young man who is forced by circumstances in this case the death of his father to leave the comfort and security of his home and family and to venture forth to make his way in the world. On his journey he meets many vivid and colorful characters all of whom reveal to him both the goodness and the cruelty inherent in human nature. These picaresque tales almost always end up with the hero a bit wiser and less nave for his experiences  but more committed than ever to righting wrongs and seeking justice for those less able to do so on their own. And 'Nicholas Nickleby' is no exception.In his approach to the material McGrath has employed an amazing economy that allows him to effectively compress a 500page novel into a 2 hour and 12 minute film. With so much storyline to work with McGrath wastes no time in setting the scene and defining the characters then moving merrily along from one dramatic incident and encounter to the next. Yet the film never feels rushed or telescoped as movies derived from lengthy novels so often do. Each character whether major or minor is given the opportunity to make his or her mark on the scene. It's true that in Dickens' world the villains and eccentrics are generally far more intriguing and memorable than the comparatively pallid heroes and heroines but McGrath has succeeded in making even those latter characters moving and interesting. Above all the film is blessed with a cast made up of firstrate performers who bring each of the author's creations to vivid life. Charlie Hunnam despite his having to embody a character who is a fairly onedimensional conventional 'pretty boy' manages to make Nicholas a bit more active and a bit less passive than he might have become in lesser hands. Nathan Lane and Barry Humphries make a delightful couple as Mr. and Mrs. Crummles the leaders of the fifthrate theatrical troupe that for a short while becomes a family for young Nicholas. Jim Broadbent enacts a fine comic villain as Mr. Squeers the brutal but henpecked schoolmaster with whom Nicholas quite literally comes to blows. The film's finest performance comes from the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer as Nicholas' evil Uncle Ralph. Plummer understands that the key to conveying villainy effectively is by underplaying the role. By doing so he helps to ground the film with a muchneeded center of gravity.Special recognition should go to the handsome production and costume design to the fine cinematography and to the lovely score by Rachel Portman. In fact everyone involved in the making of 'Nicholas Nickelby' should take a bow for converting such a fun entertaining novel into such a fun entertaining film. Dickens I believe would feel honored and proud.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness.  Truly exceptional adaptation of Dickens really shows how terrific writing can allow a film to work.  Yes the cast was very capable and in fact Christopher Plummer was  multilayered pure evil as Uncle Ralph.  The Squeers team of veterans Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson made escape from their school seem the only rational approach. Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas and herein lies the problem.  While not for the youngest of kids those 12 and up would probably enjoy the movie very much.  As a way to touch Dickens this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders.  Why aren't audience was filled with 40 and 50 somethings who read the novel growing up and a few like me brought teenagers with them.  My daughter and her friends loved it!  Very frustrating that studios will sink millions into drawing crowds for trash like Planet of the Apes XXX Blue Crush etc but almost nothing into this.  Of course this offers an education in story structure and the supporting casting was inspired.  In addition to Hunnam Anne Hathaway Princess Diaries Jamie Bell Billy Elliot Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent.  Tom Courtenay was funny and pitiful at the same time.  Yes the story is like much of Dickens it provides hope for those who seem to have little.  Good prevails over evil.  Personally I like that approach.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stunning photography outrageous characters and a powerful emotional story that's Nicholas Nickleby the 2002 adaptation from the famous book by Charles Dickens. I have not read that book so this story was new to me and I couldn't help but be impressed.Hopefully most people are still satisfied to see good people triumph in the end. With a Dickens story you know there will be a lot to overcome too and lots of suffering and heartache along the way to a happy ending.Douglas McGrathdid a fine job directing this film. Dick Pope director of photography cinematographer made England look as beautiful as any MerchantIvory film I've seen. Starttofinish the landscape of England never looked prettier. Pope performed the same kind of magic two years later in The Illusionist a gorgeouslooking movie. Kudos to Rachel Portman for a magnificent score too with a beautiful sweeping theme song. This movie is a treat for the ears as well.Charlie Hunnam as Nicholas Nickleby was adequate Christopher Plummer as his Uncle Ralph was very good and Jamie Bell as the unforgettable Smike was excellent. It's hard to believe he's the same kid who played Billy Elliott just a couple of years ago.Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevens as the wicked evil husbandandwifeteam who run DotheBoys Hall a boys boarding school were also memorable. Dickens also had cruel people mistreating little boys and these two personify cruelty. Two beautiful women Anne Hathaway's as Nicholas' love Madeline Bray and Romola Garai as his sister Kate were both pleasant and easy on the eyes. As for supporting actors I enjoyed them all as well getting an extra smile from Timothy Spall and Gerald Horan and Charles and Ned Cherryble The same can be said for Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming who provide muchneeded comic relief and whimsy.I did not recognize Tom Courtenay as Newman Noggs. I guess I still picture him from his younger and much thinner years. It's been almost 25 years since I last saw him in The Dresser and he's changed quite a bit.One other thing that was fun to observe in this film everyone's vocabulary!  I loved how they expressed themselves the good and the bad peopleOf the many wellput sentences delivered in this wellintentioned and highminded film I remember Nickleby saying near the endWeakness is tiring but strength is exhausting.".

	schema:headline " A Very Good Dickens Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "With his complex plots and casts of often literally hundreds of characters Charles Dickens might not seem the most cinemafriendly of novelists but as of January 2007 no fewer than 235 works are credited on the IMDb as being based on his works all the way back to The Death of Nancy Sykes in 1897. In recent years however most of these have been multipart series made for television a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been A Christmas Carol which is a novella rather than a novel followed by Oliver Twist and Great Expectations both of which are among his shorter novels and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent Oliver Twist for example omitted many of Dickens's details and subplots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.Nicholas Nickleby by contrast is one of Dickens's lengthier novels so it was perhaps a brave move to adapt it for the screen. The title character is the son of an impoverished country gentleman. When his father dies heavily in debt young Nicholas sets out for London with his mother and sister Kate hoping that his wealthy uncle Ralph will be able to help them. Ralph however proves to be arrogant coldhearted and avaricious. He takes Kate into his home motivated not by kindness but by the hope that he might be able to marry her off to his business associate Sir Mulberry Hawke. He sends Nicholas to Yorkshire to work as an assistant teacher in a rundown boys' boarding school run by a sadistic headmaster named Wackford Squeers. Nicholas is appalled not only by Squeers's ignorance but also by his neglect of and cruelty towards the boys in his care he is eventually forced to leave the school after intervening to prevent Squeers beating a crippled boy named Smike who will play an important role in future plot developments. After a brief interval as an actor Nicholas returns to London to be reunited with his family.Dickens's villains are generally more memorable than his heroes and even more so than his heroines who are often rather colourless and that is reflected in this film. Even an actress as lovely as Anne Hathaway tends to fade into the background as the saintly Madeline Nicholas's loveinterest. Romola Garai is rather livelier as the spirited Kate and Charlie Hunnam makes her brother an honourable and brave if headstrong hero. The performances that stand out however are from Jim Broadbent as the vicious Squeers Juliet Stephenson as his equally unpleasant wife Edward Fox as the dissipated lecher Sir Mulberry who turns his attentions to Madeline when he realises that Kate is not for him and Christopher Plummer as Ralph outwardly calm and rational but inwardly cold and stonyhearted a man who cares for nobody except himself and for nothing except his bank balance. It is noteworthy that Ralph's luxurious house is filled with stuffed animals and birds presumably intended to symbolise his cruelty and sadism. The one piece of casting I didn't like was that of Dame Edna Everage a creation of the Australian comedian Barry Humphries as Mrs Crummles the idea of a fictitious female character being played by another fictitious character who is herself being played by a male actor is a bizarre almost surreal one. The only place for a pantomime dame is in a pantomime.There have been complaints on this board that some reviewers' favourite characters or episodes from the novel have been omitted from the film but such simplification is inevitable if a nine hundred page novel is to be adapted into a feature film with a running time of just over two hours. What matters is that the feel of the film is authentically Dickensian and this is achieved here not only through the recreation in best heritage cinema style of the England of the 1840s but also through the steadily growing sense that good will triumph over evil that the heroes will be vindicated and that the villains will receive their just deserts. This is a very good Dickens adaptation on a par with Polanski's film and much better than Alfonso Cuaron's eccentric Great Expectations. 810".

Christopher Plummer as the evil uncle Ralph Nickleby is excellent. This is an actor's actor. He plays this villain with relish and a panache not easily found in many other actors. Jim Broadbent appears as the lunatic Wackford Squeers in another star turn. Another performance that is subtle yet very effective is by Tom Courtenay as Newman Noggs who at the end helps Nicholas get to the truth. Juliet Stevenson plays Mrs. Squeers with the right amount of bitchiness and evil. How about Nathan Lane?. He is outstanding again as is Barry Humphreys playing his wife.The only problem are the younger roles. Charlie Hunnan is a likeable performer but out of his league in this company. The role of Smike a key figure in the novel is handled with the clumsiness the role requires by Jamie Bell. Anne Hathaway as Madeline Bray and Ramola Garai as Kate are adequate.All in all this makes a pleasant occasion if somehow tamed at the movies.".

Juliet made the character so realistic which is practically needed for every character in every movieTV show. I think it's just amazing how she and Jim Broadbent made the characters seem so real.The movie is absolutely perfect for Juliet Stevenson and Jim Broadbent. I almost didn't recognize Jim the first time I watched the movie. Actually I have the DVD and watched the Special Features. All the major actors had fun being in the movie together.

Of course I cannot forget Anne Hathaway Nathan Lane Alan Cumming and Jamie Bell as from start to finish Madeline Vincent Crummles Mr. Folair and Smike. Now they were also amazing as well. Anne Hathaway Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming are my personal favorite actors.To be honest the entire cast and crew of the movie were amazing. I barely noticed any mistakes all actors made their characters realistic the choreography is fantastic and the directingproducing made the movie a hit even though I didn't know about the movie until this year. My sister gave me this movie Nicholas Nickleby as a high school graduation gift. I have not yet stopped watching this movie. The movie was so well written produced and directed that I can't stop watching this movie. I've probably watched it at least five to eight times since the beginning of June.Anyone who is anyone can watch Nicholas Nickleby and not cry or laugh. It might matter what kind of genre movies you're into but I do recommend Nicholas Nickleby to everyone. This movie is just fantastic and has many twists turns and shocking news. Whispers.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film adaptation if you follow what others said an altered plot even based on the book. If you wanted to see the book dramatized then I guess you'll be disappointed. But I however wanted to see Alan Cumming so I rented it. I don't care that it's supposed to be Dickens. I had to convince my husband to watch it because he hated the book. In fact ours would not be described as Dickens house. We are not fans. We don't attend literary societies and haven't gone to university for literature. Neither are we fans. The closest we can come to liking Dickens is Blackadder's Christmas Carol.What our perceptions are will not be so elite as my fellow commenters here but if you want a straight unbiased perspective on this film do read on.We found the acting inspirationally good. We would stop at times to comment to one another how excellent the acting is. Especially when Nicholas gets into a fury over his sister in Hawk's face. When he gets angry at the schoolmaster Squeers is equally good. The actors did a great job and the film was at once both charming and idyllistic and at other times cruel and unforgiving. It definitely portraits a time long since past a way of thinking the gentry and the way society was at the time within a fictional story written by Charles Dickens. This is another version written by someone else. Regardless it has its own merits. There are ALWAYS elitists around to hen scratch at any and all adaptations of classic works to film and usually it looks to me to be on principle alone if nothing else. The last comment said the acting was terrible but really it was fantastic so I don't think they even watched beyond like 15 minutes of the film or whatever point they believed it deviated from the book. Let's face it I haven't even read the book but I know it would take many hours of time like the extended versions of the complete Lord of the Rings to capture it faithfully in which case I wouldn't have finished watching it because it would be a too damn long and b far too boring because it'd be faithfully like Dickens. This version is shorter and appeals to me a lot more than the drivel shoved down my throat in the classroom at an age when I actually appreciated classic literature far more. And to reinforce this point I don't remember a damn thing from that because it was so boring.So it is NOT the faithfully adapted verbatim snorefest it would have been. It is a very good film. I think only Dickens fans will moan about it. Otherwise no one else would have a problem with it. Everyone's a critic. I don't usually post here hardly ever post anywhere. But this is a great film and I came here to IMDb just to see who played Nicholas. Ladies will want to watch it just for his looks .".

No reference at all to the Mantalini's or to the downfall of the Squeerses and the closure of Dotheboys hall I sorely missed those episodes! But what I missed storywise was partly made up by the acting of Christopher Plummer as Ralph Nickleby and the heartrending performance of Jamie Billie Elliot' Bell as Smike. A pity that the director also puts the accent mostly on the melodramatic aspects of a story which is full of delicious humor. This adaptation has it charms but check out the royal Shakespeare's Company's version for a faithful adaptation that does Dickens real justice!".

	schema:headline " Historical drama doesn't have to be this dull...";
	schema:reviewBody "The main thing that this movie suffers from is that it has been condensed to an almost absurd degree. The copy that sits on my shelf clocks in at over 900 pages written by Charles Dickens with great energy and humor. Director and frequent Woody Allen collaborator Douglas McGrath trims the story down to a commercial length and revs up the pace to an astonishing degree. This film seems like it is in a hurry to get to the closing credits which in one sense is great because it's not very good.The movie begins with Young Nicholas Charlie Hunnam and his family enjoying a comfortable idyllic life. The idyll comes to an end when Nicholas's father dies leaving the family bankrupt. Nicholas his sister and mother journey to London to seek help from their Uncle Ralph Christopher Plummer but Ralph's only goal is to separate the family and take advantage of them. Nicholas is sent to teach at a ramshackle school run by the merciless Wackford Squeers Jim Broadbent. Eventually Nicholas runs away with schoolmate Smike Jamie Bell and the two set off to bring the Nickleby family back together.There are some good elements. Christopher Plummer is worth watching as the wicked uncle. Nathan Lane is interesting. Dame Edna as his wife is fun to watch but by and large the film is beige. Just average. In the title role of Nicholas is Charlie Hunnam a British television actor who made his name on Queer As Folk and unfortunately he's not very interesting. As the central character you have to want to watch him. You have to care about his character. You have to want him to succeed. You have to want him to marry the right girl. You have to want all that for him and you don't.The problem is that while you are traveling with him you meet all sorts of characters that are far more interesting than the central character. You want to say Nick you go on. We're going to stay here for a while.'Historical drama doesn't have to be this dull. Dickens is brimming with juicy characters and interesting plots if only the filmmakers had trusted the source material a book that has been delighting people since 1839.".

Authors like Charles Dickens understood this and often made his heroes out to be hardworking compassionate young men caught up in a world of evil lies and cruelty. Dickens also had a profound effect through his novels on the English school system he forced authorities to take a closer look at orphanages and boys' boarding schools. He would love this film.'Nicholas Nickleby' is only the second adaptation and directorial triumph of Douglas McGrath. Based on this and his wonderful success with Emma I hope he makes many more. He is one of the few directors who shows restraint when it is needed and yet does not fail to make the conflicts within the hero's life suitably obvious. He makes us loathe and hate the villains without being subjected to graphic material which is something sadly lacking in many Hollywood films. As a director I admire his work. As a writer I admire it even more. The dialogue here is poetic sometimes wrought with wit and always impacting.There are interwoven with this deep drama splashes of humor  the theatre troupe's production of Romeo  Juliet some of the banter between Uncle Ralph and his tipsy but goodhearted clerk even some dry reactions from the oneeyed Squeers.The casting is brilliant. Chrisopher Plummer plays Uncle Ralph with such tainted pleasure that we learn to loathe him but also in the end to pity the mess he has made of his life. Charlie Hunnam in the role of Nicholas is exceptional few young men can blend in with a Victorian environment. Like Helena BonhamCarter he was born to star in costume dramas. Anne Hathaway The Princess Diaries and Jamie Bell along with an enormous supporting cast everyone from Nathan Lane to Nicholas Rowe were superb. There's not a weak actor in the lot.The hero is in every way above reproach  he refutes lies with a swift tongue takes compassion on his enemies and shows justice to one and all. The world would be a better place if more young men were raised with the same high standard of honor and virtue as Nicholas Nickleby.".

This part may finally put to rest our memories of the man who was wrong wrong wrong for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music.If you love Dickens you will love this film.  See it right away.";

This version had some actors I liked Christopher Plummer Jim Broadbent Juliet Stevenson Timothy Spall amongst others but their roles were not at all large enough to make this film worth watching if you happen to be a fan of any of them.So what were my qualms? Well I have read half the book it is rather large so you must excuse me not finishing yet I will eventually. It is very good though there is this beautiful paragraph in the second chapter where Dickens describes an area near Ralph Nickleby's house which could never be communicated in film so you should read it too. Anyway point being I know enough to know there were a lot of inaccuracies. Now this wouldn't matter if it didn't affect the overall atmosphere. I can't remember many things it's mainly a blurry haze of hatred but I do remember Wackford's school was not a school it was in fact a shed it was especially not s school with stupid slogans painted on the walls. The film also seemed very choppy. I thought that it was rather promising when it started and they started from the very beginning in the book but alas this part which was not in the in 2001 version was well made up for by cutting out other things...like the Mantalinis...I don't recall them being there which is a damn shame! The lead actor was not good at all and as for good looking well I don't think many people can pull off blonde hair and dark eyebrows and on another note I'm not sure whether any one has mentioned I got the slight inkling the actor was not entirely straight... I know he has been married and all but he just seemed rather effeminate which I found very distracting.There were a few characters whose stories were greatly reduced to the point they were rather twodimensional like Madaline Bray. She just turned into this running weeping woman of mystery not well acted either.Now Jamie Bell I don't think one could dispute his acting talents but well perhaps he was too young to tackle such a profoundly haunted character such as Smike. I think Lee Ingleby's performance much better captured it.Well I've lost my steam. I did not like this film. If you haven't seen it don't.".

Gone is the rich tapestry of Dickensian characters. Miss Snevilicci the Kenwigs the Mantolinis Miss Knag The Wititterlys Tim Linkinwater Peg Sliderskew Mr Lillyvick Miss Petowker and others. Even the main players who are left are shallow interpretations. The plot is drastically altered to accommodate this skeletonization and the whole story is turned into a nonsense. Gone also is the fatal duel between Sir Mulberry Hawk and Lord Verisopht the outcome of which is one of the main reasons for Ralph Nickleby's fall. Also gone is Arthur Gride Madeline Bray's prospective albeit unwanted bridegroom and NOT Sir Mulberry Hawk as portrayed here. Another change is that the Brays were originally placed as living in the Rules of the King's Bench debtor's prison and although perhaps not so important with regard to the storyline exactly why the producers deemed it necessary to alter this point or any other parts of the story is beyond me. The Brothers Cheeryble are made to look like discards from the Wizard of Oz and whoever thought up the idea of Barry Humphries playing Mrs Crummles must have been on magic mushrooms. No mention is given to the ultimate fate of the Squeers family or the school and the closing scenes include the Crummles who according to the novel have by this time emigrated to America. As to the actual movie per se it is plodding patchy and utterly uninspiring. With one exception the cinematography and even that isn't great I tried but failed to find one saving aspect of the movie. Even the acting is at best mediocre at worst atrocious. Relatively nonessential parts of the story are kept in whilst other essential details of the story are cut out. In short what promises at the start to be a reasonable production turns out to be more than a bit of a mess and somewhat of an insult to Dickens and the lovers of his works. For me this movie has to be one of the worst adaptations of a Dickens story ever made and if Charles Dickens himself were to watch it from his celestial armchair I'm quite sure he would pull out most of his celestial hair. Give yourselves a real treat and watch the RSC version instead.".

That Victorian era is vividly revealed in a wonderful pace without either flashy nihilism or hiphop angst to keep the story interesting. The film substance follows Dickens' spirit and moods all the way... as if to scream out his indignation and outrage against the inhumanity of the times. A faithful account of the times of one of Dickens' most successful novels! And definitely it's an artful blend of the tragic and the comic!The themes come powerfully well on screen. The power of money is shown to either corrupt those who have it or to destroy those who don't. It's goodness of heart crusading against social injustices. Two characters  Ralph Nickleby and Nicholas Nickleby  offer a profound insight into two totally different expectations of life.  Oh yes the film does succeed in presenting the viewers with what seems to be Dickens' satire of three different sets of environment  the world of the London moneylender that of the Yorkshire school  hey Yorkshire schoolmasters were deemed to be notoriously evil in the Victorian era and of the touring stage company somewhat theatrical no doubt but still interesting for Dickens did have a keen eye for the stage! With a great topnotch British Canadian and American ensemble of actors whose team interaction is of a classic quality this film is worth taking time off to see.  This film is rich with witty dialogue and pathos beaming out of a superb drama.  It leaves one with momentary chuckles despite the overwhelming bleakness of events.Charlie Hunnam's performance of noble Nicholas is solid offering a heroic character of absolute conscience as presented in the novel. Christopher Plummer's avaricious miser and Jim Broadbent's unscrupulous Wackford Squeers are so viciously bizarre. Alan Cumming Nathan Lane and Timothy Spall are there to provide comic relief to balance out the complex grotesquerie of the tale.  Edward Fox's Sir Mulberry Hawk is all slime. Anne Hathaway's Madeline is delightful to watch. Juliet Stevenson's Mrs. Squeers is totally inhuman. But it's Jamie Bell's pitiful Smike and Romola Garai's Kate who succeed in stressing the wickedness of the societal system of those days. Excellent performances with enormous onscreen chemistry floating all round! And every background setting is well established to coincide with the moods and spirits of the events and characters. If the characters seem unreal to modern day life don't blame McGrath. He has subjected his viewers to a staged' puppet show with cardboard characters at the beginning as if to prompt his viewers to expect the story's characters as coming out of some popular past entertainment.  We can't deny that the colorful characters do belong to Dickens' imagination and they do fit into the abusively distasteful social ills and failures of the 19th Century Industrial Age.         A great film for the family! Director McGrath has truly captured the mores of Charles Dickens' days!   Would certainly hope to see some of the talented actors nominated for the Oscars!!".

If Shakespeare were presented as farting farm animals in party hats would we mourn or laugh as intended? Well at least McGrath knows his craft. He knows how to let the creative team construct the darks and lights of the matter and the actors to fill those spaces as best they can. Actually I liked many images within this. Its no Barry Lyndon but visually similar. But I really hate how it has been evened out. The original carefully placed extremes as sort of speedbumps so that we had to pause in reading and ponder.This removes those extremes and carries us smoothly along on a wind designed to amuse only without risk. If that's what you want then this will be a well manufactured product for you to consume. Others may want to take Dickens more seriously if not quite as seriously as he wanted.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

Others may want to take Dickens more seriously if not quite as seriously as he wanted.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.";

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Dickens classic Nicholas Nickleby gets a fine remake in this 2002 version with Charles Hunnam in the title role. Definitely the prettiest Nickleby you'll find in any version. I would expect nothing less from a star in Queer As Folk. He and Anne Hathaway certainly make an attractive pair of lovers.In fact though Hunnam's very bisexual appeal gives an added dimension to this version. The relationship with young Smike played tenderly and touchingly by Jamie Bell is what drives this particular story. The best scene in the film is the death scene of the crippled and sickly Smike with Jamie Bell giving so far a career role performance.Hunnam's antagonist throughout the film is his Uncle Ralph played by Christopher Plummer. He's the rich older brother of Hunnam and Romola Garai's father who makes out like he's interested in their welfare. In fact he sends young Nicholas to a cruel school run by Jim Broadbent and his wife Juliet Stevenson. As for Garai he essentially uses her as a come on to rich and dissolute minor nobility so they'll invest with his brokerage house.After giving Broadbent a well deserved thrashing Nicholas escapes the school with the crippled and sickly Bell. There is definitely a very homoerotic tinge to their relationship in their scenes together. In his short life Bell has experienced nothing but cruelty. Basically he falls in love with the first person who has shown him kindness and the fact that Hunnam is one beautiful twink is a bonus. All their scenes are beautifully played and will move you to tears.As for the end let's say a lot of Plummer's sins come back to haunt him in the end and the Nickleby name is no longer disgraced. This is a wonderful version of the Dickens classic with an outstanding performance by Jamie Bell.".

Robinson's Remy Marko is a beer baron who made it big but never stopped to wonder why. Even Capone or Dutch Schultz would have sought to make their product digestible but Robinson apparently never considered it it does not help him that he never drinks  he based his knowledge of his product on what his loyal torpedoes Allan Jenkins and Harold Huber tell him. It is only when he finally belatedly tastes it that he realizes that he has been selling swill these years. His success was due to strong arming speakeasy owners in Prohibition. Once Prohibition ends he no longer can use strong arming as the speakeasy owners are now legitimate bar owners again.The twists keep coming The real villains are the bankers who look forward to stealing Remy's failing business led by usually good guy John Litel  here an unusually opportunistic man. Remy's wife Ruth Donnelly is perfectly at home as a legal moll but she is desperately trying to be a grand dame. Remy's daughter Mary Jane Bryant is trying to marry Dick Whitewood Willard Parker who is a state trooper and Remy despite becoming legitimate discovers that he still dislikes and distrusts cops. Dick's father Paul Harvey is mostly choleric due to not knowing anything about Remy's background and not liking what he sees. And this very weekend Remy's charitable side is demonstrated when he brings a poor kid from the orphan's home to his house. The boy Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom Bobby Jordan is a potential hoodlum Margaret Hamilton as the orphan home head is glad to let him out of a cage he's kept in with pretensions of being a poet. The introductory summary line above is part of a couplet he creates. To top all four of Remy's old enemies have just committed a robbery and are lying in wait to dispose of him. They are disposed of by a fifth member who can't flee with the loot before everyone else arrives followed by Remy's old chums coming for a party.The film is an absolute comic joy and one wishes more comedies like this came along for Robinson.

	schema:reviewBody "A Slight Case of Murder had its origins on the Broadway stage where this play by Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay flopped miserably with only 69 performances in the 1935 season. It certainly adapted better for the screen when Warner Brothers bought it for one of their gangster stable in this case Edward G. Robinson.The story concerns a gangster Remy Marko who is trying to go straight and get out of the bootleg beer racket now that Prohibition has been repealed. It was a problem faced by any number of people who were not Lucky Luciano or Meyer Lansky.In Robinson's case he's decided to go legitimate and brew beer legally. Of course no one has the heart to tell him that the stuff he's been peddling for years has been nothing but swill not even his family Ruth Donnelly and Jane Bryan nor his closest associates Allen Jenkins Harold Huber and Ed Brophy. While all this is going Robinson and the family and friends go to his summer home near the Saratoga racetrack where a big robbery of the bookie's money has taken place. This was in the days before the paramutual machines and track bets were taken at the sight by legal bookmakers. The gang decides to hide out in what they think will be Robinson's deserted home.Daughter Jane Bryan is romancing state trooper Willard Parker a prospect the going straight Robinson still finds appalling. No less so than Paul Harvey Parker's nervous blueblood father. All these elements mix well for a very funny screen comedy. Robinson who was really getting tired of all the gangster parts seems to be enjoying himself referring to himself constantly in the third person and earning quite a few laughs and keeping up with some of the best scene stealers around. Ruth Donnelly keeps up very well who most of the time remembers she's now supposed to be respectable but every so often slips back to her familiar background.The guy who really is funny here is Paul Harvey. He's mixing with people he's not used to and it's putting quite an evident strain on him. One of the running gags in A Slight Case of Murder is how bad the beer Robinson makes. He never drinks himself so he doesn't know and no one is brave enough to tell him. Damon Runyon who probably sampled every kind of illegal liquor available during Prohibition knew well the kind of rot gut that was peddled. The classier places imported stuff from across the border but the dives used whatever they could get. Marko's lousy beer was something drinking people during Prohibition knew well from. A Slight Case of Murder is one of the few films that ever dealt with that fact albeit in a comic way.Though the plot situations are certainly dated the talent of this very good cast is timeless.".

No less so than Paul Harvey Parker's nervous blueblood father. All these elements mix well for a very funny screen comedy. Robinson who was really getting tired of all the gangster parts seems to be enjoying himself referring to himself constantly in the third person and earning quite a few laughs and keeping up with some of the best scene stealers around. Ruth Donnelly keeps up very well who most of the time remembers she's now supposed to be respectable but every so often slips back to her familiar background.The guy who really is funny here is Paul Harvey. He's mixing with people he's not used to and it's putting quite an evident strain on him. One of the running gags in A Slight Case of Murder is how bad the beer Robinson makes. He never drinks himself so he doesn't know and no one is brave enough to tell him. Damon Runyon who probably sampled every kind of illegal liquor available during Prohibition knew well the kind of rot gut that was peddled. The classier places imported stuff from across the border but the dives used whatever they could get. Marko's lousy beer was something drinking people during Prohibition knew well from. A Slight Case of Murder is one of the few films that ever dealt with that fact albeit in a comic way.Though the plot situations are certainly dated the talent of this very good cast is timeless.";

When prohibition ends Marco proudly announces that he's going to be strictly legit believing that he will no longer need strong arm tactics and that he will continue to rake in the money from legal sales. What he doesn't realize is that because he's never actually tasted his own brew is that it tastes awful.Now that the public can buy well brewed better tasting beer legally Marco sees his fortune disappear over the ensuing four years. On the verge of bankruptcy he finds himself in debt over a half a million dollars and has to deal with two predatory bankers Post John Litel and Ritter Eric Stanley who are trying to foreclose on him.Marco's daughter Mary Jane Bryan has returned home and plans to marry the bumbling State Trooper son Dick Whitewood Willard Parker of business tycoon Paul Harvey. Marco and his wife Nora Ruth Donnelly plan to host an engagement party at their country house in Saratoga. What he doesn't know is that a rival gang has heisted 500K from bookies and are holed up in Marco's house.With his three stooges Mike Allen Jenkins Lefty Edward Brophy and Gip Harold Huber Marco learns that four of the five gangsters have been murdered and their bodies left in a guest bedroom while the fifth hangs around trying to escape with the money.

But Warner Bros. saw him as a gangster and so he had difficulty breaking away from that genre. After he left Warners in the early forties he turned in a number of great performances notably in Double Indemnity 1944 and two FRitz Lang classics The Woman in the Window 1944 and Scarlett Street 1945.

There are but just not as many as I was expecting after reading the hype about the film. The story centers around a crook Remy Marco Edward G.

When prohibition ends Marco goes legit with his beer business. What he doesn't realize because he never tastes the stuff is that his beer stinks. Once the public has more of a choice on what to drink his brewery sales go down the tubes.The movie has many sidebars if you will such as a big heist four dead guys in his house a wiseguy orphan kid taken into Marco's house Marco's daughter marrying a state trooper on and on. Those keep things lively.There are lots of wild and wacky scenes so I can see why this probably was a fun movie for the folks back in the '30s and even for some people today.

	schema:headline " E.G. Robinson breaks from typecast with many laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Although he had played a variety of roles in his career up to 1938 Edward G. Robinson had become known for his gangster criminal and tough guy roles. Little Caesar of 1931 was the blockbuster film and performance that set the typecast of Robinson for several years. He had done no comedy before A Slight Case of Murder but this film showed that he had a knack for humor. This film on DVD has a bonus featurette. In it film historians and writers say that this was one of Robinson's favorite films. He thoroughly enjoyed making this film breaking away from his typecast. He would go on to star in more crime mystery and suspense films but he also had some very good drama roles in biographies war films and thrillers. He made three more comedies. Two had plots paired with crime Brother Orchid of 1940 and Larceny Inc. of 1942. A good war comedy was Mr. Winkle Goes to War of 1944. I devote so much to Robinson here because his role is so different and refreshing and he plays it to the hilt. It's clear that he enjoyed making this movie. And while the best humor and bulk of it in the film is in his character of Remy Marco a tremendous supporting cast piles more humor onto the heap. Ruth Donelly plays Remy's wife Nora. Remy's three lugs are some of the best dopey characters in crime in movies around that time. Allen Jenkins plays Mike Edward Brophy is Lefty and Harold Huber is Giuseppe Jip. Other comedy comes from Paul Harvey as Mr. Whitewood and Willard Parker as Dick Whitewood. Bobby Jordan plays Remy's vacation orphan guest Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom. Many others in this huge cast have snippets of humor here and there. The movie is billed as a satire and that it is. It's a spoof of racketeering and of the very gangland culture that arose during prohibition. The film is based on a Damon Runyan play. Runyan was known for his chronicling of life on the streets of New York especially around Broadway and the stories he wrote many of which were made into stage plays andor movies. E.G. Robinson never won an academy award but he was a highly acclaimed actor for four decades. He was well liked off screen by his colleagues who found him to be a gentle soul. In his real life he was a refined person who could speak several languages. He was a serious collector of art especially paintings. In his tough guy and criminal roles his characters often were poorly educated guys who spoke street language. So when one knows his real background Robinson is very funny as he rattles off his dialog in this comedy satire. I can imagine him and others of the cast cracking up between takes at some of the buffoonish dialog. Here are some of my favorite lines from this film. Remy Oh and by the way  have Mike take the spittoons out of the living room.Dear boss we've tooken a half hour off. Mike. Remy Look at the way he spells tooken  with two o's.Norma I'm thinking of your father. He doesn't like ruffians. He's a pacifist.Remy Never treat a sucker like so much dirt when he's down. Play ball with him and you'll find you always get a little better edge in the end.Remy And remember you always come out on top with honesty integrity and a good hard right to the button.Mike tells Remy they found Dutch Schultz and three others bodies upstairs. They were shot right in the middle of a game and one of 'em had a king flush. Remy Which one of 'em had the king full Little Dutch? Mike Yeah. Remy I thought so. Lucky fink that Little Dutch. The boys at Star of Good Hope Orphanage sing a song when their distinguished alumnus Remy Marco comes to visit. How do you do Mr. Marco how do you do? All the happy little orphans welcome you. We are glad that you are here 'Cause you always bring a cheer. How do you do Mr. Marco how do you do?".

	schema:headline " Very amusing Damon Runyeon Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a great spoof of the Edward G. Robinson crime dramas first given laughs in 1933's The Little Giant a forgotten gem. He is a former bootlegger who can't believe that no one will buy his beer which he later discovers is disgusting. Ruth Donnelly is his lowclass wife living a highclass existence and is hysterical. It's great to see this wonderful Warner Brothers character actress from the early 30's finally getting a part to sink her teeth into. She is what Helen Broderick was to RKO. I would have loved to see them play sisters. Think Elaine Stritch and Eileen Heckart or Joan Blondell and Ann Sothern together....Similar enough to be siblings but different enough to be individuals. Ms. Donnelly gets more to do than the topbilled female lead Jane Bryan then being groomed by Warners to take over the type of parts that Jean Muir used to play. The basic premise has them moving to the country with orphan Bobby Watson their guest for the summer and dealing with other gangsters who have hidden a stash of cash in the mansion. Watson unfortunately isn't seen enough It would be like one of the Dead End Kids interacting with the veteran gangster as the DE Kids did with Cagney and Bogart and the passing of the torch. Still the dialogue is typically Runyonesquire think Guys and Dolls and The Big Street set in the country but not quite CapraCorn either. Allen Jenkins is typically amusing as Robinson's major sidekick. Willard Parker is the police officer engaged to Bryan whom Robinson keeps trying to get rid of. Margaret Hamilton has a great part as the principal of Watson's school. Toss in character names like Sad Sam NoNose Cohen and Blackhat Gallagher and you've got a period comedy that they don't make anymore. Warners later remade this as a musical Stop! You're Killing Me! with Broderick Crawford and Claire Trevor in the RobinsonDonnelly roles which isn't bad but catch the original first.".

He is a former bootlegger who can't believe that no one will buy his beer which he later discovers is disgusting. Ruth Donnelly is his lowclass wife living a highclass existence and is hysterical. It's great to see this wonderful Warner Brothers character actress from the early 30's finally getting a part to sink her teeth into. She is what Helen Broderick was to RKO. I would have loved to see them play sisters. Think Elaine Stritch and Eileen Heckart or Joan Blondell and Ann Sothern together....Similar enough to be siblings but different enough to be individuals. Ms. Donnelly gets more to do than the topbilled female lead Jane Bryan then being groomed by Warners to take over the type of parts that Jean Muir used to play.

The familiar voiceover narrative by Winston Hibler gives an ongoing account of wildlife activity in the southwestern dessert of the United States. This apparent wasteland is teeming with life. The photography is a joy to watch as we view lizards lapping up unsuspecting insects turtles performing a mating ritual javelinas chasing a bobcat which is forced to take refuge on a large prickly cactus. The movie is well edited as the viewer watches the seamless transition from scene to scene accompanied by music often right in tune with the action. Symphonic music for the slithering striped snake burrowing in and out of the sand soon followed by hoedown music for courting tarantulas. Told in the vernacular of mid20th century life we hear analogies to males fighting off rivals for the right to the female. Fortunately these scenes are still available to viewers on stations like TCM. Highly recommend.".

Also it is even more clear today that with 1953 audiences that some outdoor scenes were filmed on an artificial desert set on a soundstage. Despite these problems the documentary is still worth a look. Viewers young and old will learn a lot about the wildlife in the American desert. The movie moves along at a brisk pace with no dead spots. And some of the footage is still spectacular today such as with the sequence with the tarantulahunting wasp. By the way Walt Disney did learn his lesson with this documentary  later entries in the TrueLife series significantly toned down the humor and the manipulation.".

The movie moves along at a brisk pace with no dead spots. And some of the footage is still spectacular today such as with the sequence with the tarantulahunting wasp. By the way Walt Disney did learn his lesson with this documentary  later entries in the TrueLife series significantly toned down the humor and the manipulation.";

Some individuals suffering from anal obstructions might complain about some of the Disneyisms such as silly sound effects and comedy scenes. If you're one of these I suggest watching a dry National Geographic documentary that will put most people to sleep. That's probably more your speed. For everyone else definitely seek out this colorful fun and educational documentary. It's especially good for kids who might not have seen such things before. But beware there's lot of closeup footage of snakes and other creepy crawlies in this. So if you or your kids have issues with that you might want to prepare yourself before watching.".

Also some critters like snakes and spiders seem natural villains to most of us while little furry critters seem friendlier. The movie makes use of these popular reactions. Nonetheless Disney's little formula worked. As I recall this feature and its companion The Vanishing Prairie 1953 were both boxoffice successes. Now of course much of the same material can be gotten on cable. Still some of the footage is superb the blooming desert flower buds the flash flood and who would imagine a wasp that only hunts tarantulasthat's a real fight to the death.

Sand in a sidewinder's eyes can get it to stop looking at you as your next meal. A bobcat is chased up a cactus by a family of bores. All this and more in The Living Desert one of Disney's classic Live Action Adventures that combines art animation and live action footage where the camera work is the star utilizing special effects in its fast forward motion and being in on the goings on where there's no way the sometimes monstrous looking creatures can be directed. Unlike The Secret of Life however I did find this one a bit gimmicky where even though it was made before it was made in a way where little kids could not become horrified over seeing cute creatures gobbled up in a most horrific way. Fans of the Warner Brothers cartoons will be thrilled to see a real road runner no coyote in sight going after the tails and leathery bodies of various mammals and reptiles. The presence of several lizards including the infamous gila monster whom the narrator describes basically as a poisoned beaded purse reminds me of the various monstrous looking creatures in The Secrets of Life that along with this influenced filmmakers to create Godzilla sized monster for all those infamous mid 1950's1970's creature features. Natural wonders such as the description of how the desert stops Pacific Ocean rain in its tracks how sudden floods change the landscape and the nearly castle like mountainous rocky formations create various legends. This thrilled me as a kid in a double bill with a Disney feature and it stands the test of time. Other than the narrator there is no human being in sight only pretty much every kind of critter you can imagine all living out in the open determined to survive another day. The poor bobcat though on the top of the giant cactus had me in stitches. Poor kitty with thorns in their tootsies but that's better than a bore tusk in its belly.".

	schema:reviewBody "...people really need to take another look at Natural Born Killers.The plot Mickey and Mallory Knox Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in roles that are a little too convincing are a husbandwife pair of serial killers whose vicious crime spree across the country has made them into media superstars.This movie is a barrage of frightening and surreal images and is damn near hypnotic to watch.I can see where the controversy surrounding this film comes from but what I don't understand is where the hate is coming from.1994's Natural Born Killers has to be one of the best movies of the 90s  its sole purpose on this planet is to showcase America's fascination with violence.But lets try to understand the hate.  This movie is here for one reason and I think that we can all agree on that reason.  Oliver Stone is a competent and accomplished filmmaker and most of the hate seems to be directed towards him.  Stone who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by Quentin Tarantino pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision.I can understand why fans of Tarantino have a right to be pssed off but I find it extremely difficult to believe that they truly hate the finished product and the same goes for Tarantino.  Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Tarantino fan myself and I'm sure he didn't appreciate Stone rewriting his script but he should be proud of what was done with it.The message if you can call it that is that we are obsessed with violence and Stone exposes our love for it and spits it back in our faces.  To quote Marlon Brando   The horror the horror.  I say to hell with the hypocritical people who find this movie offensive for they are the ones that this movie is truly aimed towards.Yes horrific images are displayed in this movie and terrible things happen to people all throughout but it's giving us we want and we hate it.  The hate surrounding this film is extremely misguided.  My high school paper recently did an article about sex and violence on television and one of the supposed outlets of that violence would be our fascination with the war in Iraq and the Jessica Lynch story.It said that we are much much more concerned with the sex I personally don't think today's teenage girls are THAT impressionable but who knows? rather than the violence which apparently seems to be causing a misguided sh!tstorm of controversy too and like the sex I don't think that people are that impressionable namely the kind that is seen in music videos and such.  Though the article refused to go into specifics but we know who the people being discussed are and I'm sure they do too it brings me back to Natural Born Killers which I think people need to take another look at.In this day and age violence on television is becoming more and more commonplace and this movie's relevance seems to make its viewing that much more important.  Before we go and continue to bash the hell out of it again people need to come back and take a look around themselves and watch Natural Born Killers.".

'Natural Born Killers' is a risky mad all out filmmaking that we do not get very often strange psychotic artistic pictures.'Natural Born Killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory and the teenager says 'Murder is wrong.... but If I was a mass murderer I'd be Mickey and Mallory'. Mickey describes this with a situation of 'Frankenstein the monster and Dr. Frankenstein'  Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killersMost Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America the country that the director loves and admires. I guess 'Natural Born Killers' is about the effect of mass media technology and how obsessive as a nation Americans are and most of the world over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.The killers played by Woody Harrelson Mickey and Juliette Lewis Mallory are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism survival of the fittest  Mickey says in his interview in prison that other species commit murder we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment the script is interesting but it is questionable how much this film amounts to in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison we see the harsh realities of prison life the attitudes of the warden etcoverfilling of prisons  maybe Stone is questioning the future the path that society is leading to.Two other interesting characters First a reporter who runs a show about 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti an insane perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory  he also has some weird obsession with mass killers since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco Texas by Charles Whitman.The cinematography is superb different colours shadows styles create a feeling of disorientation the green colour most evident of all is green to resemble the sickness of the killers in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote.The camera work is insane shaky buzzy it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox psychedelic and unusual.'Natural Born Killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...Although the above review sound quite positive I did dislike the film. Quentin Tarantino who originally wrote the script for the film was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why.

The violence in it was sickening just a few years ago but such things have quickly gotten normalized in our culture's ongoing desensitization. Ironically this very process of media desensitization is precisely the topic of this film's satire. NBK has since even been the subject of copycat crime sprees or so the culprits claimed. This is troubling because while the film works hard to analyze the dubious process by which violent killers are turned into romantic heroes in the mass media NBK seems unable to escape from the same orbit ending with the killers as living happily ever after justified by the brutality of their backgrounds and morally superior to the prison officials and popular journalists who pursue them. But as a postmodernist satire of media saturationviolence from wrestling to sitcoms to real crime dramatizations to obsessive live news interviews Stone's film is a thought provoking exercise that is stylistically mesmerizing.As a postscript several people accused Stone of inciting copycat crimes and called for him to be sued for damages which happened. The lawsuit was dismissed. At the least he was negligent they argued. Interesting to me that the glorification of violence found everywhere in the thriller genre is taken to be safely neutral while a powerful satire of glorification is condemned as well too violent. The last time I checked this was always defined as hypocrisy. The major contradiction in media culture now is that on the one hand Natural Born Killers is reviled for inciting violence while on the other hand it is reviled for being too obviously critical of media violence in a simplistic and unsubtle manner. But can we have it both ways? No.A 2nd postscript on another form of hypocrisy Quentin Tarantino the reigning postmodernist King of Cool who plays with pastiche of pop culture genres wrote the script for Stone's Natural Born Killers but then criticized the way the film was directed. Ironically Tarantino then copied several formal film techniques and innovations straight out of NBK for his later Kill Bill films.  with the key exception that Tarantino continues the tradition of glamorizing violence. The Tarantino crowd sees itself as properly aesthetic and cool far above the hamfisted Stone! Creepy isn't it?".

The elements of a good story are there Boy meets girl boy and girl fall in love and go on a mass murdering spree which is lapped up by the media.  While there is definitely a strong social statement the story is too erratic and scattered to be completely coherent.Visually however Natural Born Killers is stunning.  It is intensely colorful unflinchingly violent and innovative in its cinematography. This movie is not for most but if you decide to try it out be warned  It is not for the faint of heart and not for the weak of stomach.

The film is twisted outlandish and out of its mind  Oliver Stone has gone stonecold crazy and it's awesome.Despite my reservations about his lack of subtlety there is a flip side to the coin It is a story about excess. Stone's filmmaking has gone somewhat awry over the years look at the pointless excess of his films after this but this fits the bill because it IS a story of excess.Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play the titular Natural Born Killers Mickey and Mallory a pair of crazy serial killers who both suffered traumatic childhoods and are now rampaging America on a literal killing spree.After they are finally apprehended the media has by now turned them into such icons and glorified personalities that the public and media seems to respect them as titans of filth.This is where the social satire of the film comes into play essentially saying We focus more on the killers than the heroes.I do think it's a bit hypocritical of Oliver Stone to attempt to point this out as he is a diehard liberal at his core and as the controversy surrounding this film's release proved the conservatives are too conservative to praise killers. It seems to be the liberal media that glorifies violence to some extent of course so I thought Stone would be the last person to ever criticize the media.So yes it does come across as somewhat of a moot point but nevertheless the film is still enjoyable despite its sometimes sickening amount of overthetop violence the opening sequence of the Director's Cut is stomachturning.The cast is superb  Rodney Dangerfield Robert Downey Jr. Tommy Lee Jones Tom Sizemore Edie McClurg the rental car agent from Planes Trains and Automobiles and Rooney's assistant in Ferris Bueller! and Denis Leary and Ashley Judd in deleted scenes included in the Director's Cut.The story was conceived by Quentin Tarantino and it's very similar to his True Romance script  a sort of modernday Bonnie and Clyde Redux and rewritten by Stone much to the chagrin of QT. I'm not sure which would have made for a better film but despite its flaws which are mainly a nonetoosubtle message and too much violence Natural Born Killers is a sort of bizarre outlandish masterpiece of druggedout cinema.

I'm not sure which would have made for a better film but despite its flaws which are mainly a nonetoosubtle message and too much violence Natural Born Killers is a sort of bizarre outlandish masterpiece of druggedout cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "What a whirlagig of a movie. It is in your face every second of its running time. It never stops. It may take a lickin but it keeps on blaring. The only soothing thing about it is the musical score which ranges from A Night on Bald Mountain to the heftier portions of Carmina Burana when the electric guitars aren't whanging and the electronic drums not palpitating.The story insofar as I could make it out among the glitz roughly follows that of Starkweather and Fugate in the 1950s. Woody Harrelson is Mickey Knox. He runs off with teenaged Juliette Lewis after he kills her hated father. They indulge themselves in a spree of moral nihilism. Dead bodies abound. There are bath tubs of gore. The screen and the people on it are riddled with bullet holes.The malignant duo are turned into heroes by the media. Fan clubs spring up. Their Hooper rating goes up with each new pile of cadavers. Finally though they are cornered by police led by Detective Scagnetti famous as the author of a book called Scagnetti on Scagnetti. The two are isolated for a year in the same penitentiary.A rabidly ambitious Australian journalist Robert Downey Jr. who hosts a TV program called American Maniacs is given permission to interview Harrelson. But Woody no more of a slouch in the department of brains than in gonads grabs a shotgun during the interview rescues Lewis and shoots his way out of prison while the elated Downey follows them with his TV camera and immortalizes them.Well! This movie raises a lot of questions. The first question is Why was it made? The director was Oliver Stone and I guess his message is clear enough. The media and violence feed on one another. You know  If it bleeds it leads? But was it really necessary to put the viewer through the wringer like that? Okay. Stone understandably disapproves of the degradation of vernacular culture but what did WE ever do to him? I can't speak for you but he doesn't even KNOW me! Some of the cinematic chicanery is germane to the story or the message it puts so much effort into conveying. The tornado that permits Harrelson to escape from his first prison is straight out of The Wizard of Oz. During scenes of violence there are momentary inserts of cartoon monsters. Lewis's tragic home life is presented with a laugh track as a situation comedy. We get it. The visual media intrude into every aspect of our lives and we frame our experiences in accordance with the models they provide.But other exercises in directorial pyrotechnics lead nowhere except to confusion. There is an ordinary twoshot of law enforcement officers  Tom Sizemore and Tommy Lee Jones  walking along a corridor. The simple scene goes from color to black and white to negative and back from slow motion to step motion to pointofview shots of Jones' shoes. Why? The tricks tell us nothing about the story the characters or the moral principle.The title of the movie Natural Born Killers is Harrelson's reply to Downey's query about why Harrelson committed those dozens of murders. Inmates have ready responses to questions like that. In sociology they're part of a generic process called accounting. Harrelson is saying I did it because that's the kind of guy I am. He goes on to explain that murder is part of nature. That's not bad as far as it goes although it's utterly meaningless. Other real examples that I've heard inmates give for theft or murder include It was nothing personal and for a killing in prison He had no business being there in the wrong wing. They're not meant to be taken literally. They're just a way of indicating that logic is dispensable because there is no answer. Incidentally when Lewis unzips Harrelson's trousers in the visitor's room that conforms to my observations at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. I was there for a job interview as a psychologist. I hope that last paragraph wasn't too scrambled. I think I'm still a little dizzy. How did all these tiny butterflies get into my office in the dead of winter? Gee. They're chartreuse.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen too many Oliver Stone pictures JFK Scarfacewhich he wrote not directed and this one. I don't know too much about his directorial style but if any of his other films are like this one I'll have to watch more of them. The visual style is amazing. The whole film has sort of a psychedelic visual style and utilizes constant cuts and constant change in color scheme often changing between powerful green blue red and even blackwhite. Of course none of this is random. It's there to project symbolism and keep the mood intense and constantly evolving and believe me it works perfectly. With many references to popular mediatelevision mainly demons and the desensitizing effect of television. The effect of half of the imagery being seen through a television screen or hallucinated is amazing. The film is experimental and psychological. As Stone puts it in the documentary it's a film about two people breaking the rules so it's only fitting that the filmmakers are also breaking the rules. It's chaotic and wild insane and mentally exhausting. It's a film about pain violence and giving in to cravings and desires. But it in no way romanticizes the aforementioned three points. Quite the opposite. I believe someone once told me that the film makes killing and violence look appealing. I can't even explain how wrong that is. This truly is an amazing film. If you can sit through this and you honestly think of yourself as perceptive and intelligent you have to see this movie. It's not just recommended or a good idea to watch it's mandatory for anyone that 'get' it. The plot is great and wellpaced. It's never boring. The acting is great. The characters are wellwritten credible and so easy to understand and sympathize with that many will hate the film for it. The whole film is amazing on so many levels. I recommend it to any person who believes himself or herself to be hardened and intelligent enough to sit through it and more importantly understand it. I recommend you get the directors cut as it keeps everything that the other released version cut off. Highly recommendable. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike the media it lampoons I don't despise Natural Born Killers because it's violent I despise it because it's crap. Honestly are there any other films that are quite so heavyhanded poorly executed and mind numbingly dull as Stone's turgid 'satire'? I can't think of many  it certainly must rank amongst the worst films of the 90s.Of all the things I hate about the film it's Mickey and Mallory themselves that I hate the most especially as the film loves them. I mean as much as the film tries to be a clever comment on the violence obsessed media the film despite itself idolises these two losers  murders are filmed in slowmotion and different film stocks and their love is portrayed as honest and true. Compare this with everyone else  all the other characters are liars schemers and scumbags. But while any right thinking individual would have nothing but contempt for all of these characters Stone allows Mickey and Mallory to come out clean at the other end. What a load of rubbish.One of the most infuriating scenes in the film is when Mickey and Mallory go and visit an Indian. He talks gibberish for a while and then Mickey appears to go to sleep I can't blame him the scene strains for meaning in every frame and fails at every turn. Then while Mickey's sleeping he has a nightmare about being abused as a kid. However when he wakes up Mickey kills the Indian. Mallory's response is one of horror saying 'You killed life. He fed us.' Let it be noted that this is the only murder that Mickey and Mallory feel really bad about. And the only reason they feel bad about it is because the Indian gave them something. The lesson to be learnt here so Mickey and Mallory appear to be saying is that it's fine to kill people and not feel bad about it if they do nothing for you.But that scene touches on another annoying element in the film  childhood abuse. Of course it's a fact that most violent people have been either been abused or have come from a violent upbringing but the film gives us that and nothing else  oh they were abused that's why they're the way they are it all makes sense. What a load of crap.And all the segments to do with childhood are completely removed for reality. For example Mallory's childhood is filmed like a sitcom with laughs in the background as daddy feels his daughter up. But rather than be a clever comment on the corrupting influence of television the sequence is so over the top that it feels like petulant whining. Boo hoo daddy felt my bum. Look what he made me into. Again it's a gross oversimplification. And the burning of Mallory's mother is ridiculous. You were abused too and you did nothing to save me. Therefore you deserve to be burnt to bits. What the? But despite all this the film still tries to make us feel sorry for Mickey and Mallory. Just take the scene where the two of them get arrested. Mallory gets the crap beaten out of her and Mickey gets tasered before getting beaten up himself. But rather than weep tears at the excessive Rodney Kingstyle police brutality I could only think that the two deserved more punishment. They deserved a severe beating followed by a bullet in the brain. But alas the film never gave me this satisfaction thus making it even more painful for me to watch.However the film did at least give me the satisfaction of seeing Mallory get maced. That was fun. And it's rather telling that while the film wants us to love the two mass murderers it's the sleazy journalist the evil cop and the wicked prison warden who are the most likable. And they're likable because unlike Mickey and Mallory they're not full of pious sanctimonious BS. They're scum and they know it. But Mickey and Mallory are always justifying their actions always claiming to be pure when they're anything but. It's infuriating.Also annoying is Stone's filming style. He's obviously snorted too much blow and watched too many music videos because the film uses different film stocks skewed angles stock footage and front and rear projection to nauseating effect. It's a mess. But of course Stone probably thinks it's making a wonderful comment on the sensory overload that is present in our multichannel television obsessed culture. But no the film has nothing intelligent to say about television as anyone with half a brain knows that the masses are glued to the idiot box and that crass ratingsobsessed journalists do nothing but desensitise the people who watch them. A ridiculous detail in the film is when Mickey and Mallory visit the Indian. 'Too much TV' is projected onto them. It strains for profundity but it ends up as being a visual trick more suited to a pretentious R.E.M. or Radiohead video. However to briefly defend the film I will say that Robert Downey Jr. is quite funny in parts Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore also provide a couple of chortles even though they play twodimensional grotesques. And there's a segment in 'American Maniacs' that gave me a laugh. But what Stone doesn't realise is that the reality is even more ridiculous. Just watch World's Wildest Police Videos with Sheriff John Bunnell. Wayne Gale is tame in comparison and nowhere near as disturbing or amusing.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is rare to come across a film so offensive and thoroughly reprehensible and devoid of entertainment value like Natural Born Killers that it should almost earn another star for that distinction alone. Alas I will restrain myself from that scant praise.Oliver Stone's overthetop acid trip follows the exploits of a pair of serial killer lovers played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis who become a media sensation during their cross country killing spree. And there you have the plot.Stone's fans will say that the film has lots to say about our media culture sensationalism and violence. While it is true that it may have something to say  it is an overstatement of biblical proportions that it has lots to say. In fact one can argue that it barely scratches the surface and rather than being a stinging indictment of any of those issues ends up glorifying them in its own right. Rather than castigate the media culture for raising the remorseless killers into some sort of folk hero status Stone's film rather seems to half believe that they are worthy of such status and he often depicts their army of hapless victims as a gallery of grotesques that have it coming.The violence and imagery of the film is disturbing and not in a good way. There is literally no restraint or sublety...anywhere. Not in the direction not in the acting and not in the  although I am loathe to use this term for this screenplay  writing. Whereas Bonnie and Clyde may have been romanticized for cinema NBK's Mick and Mallory are appalling in every way. Certainly no one could possibly sympathize with them. They murder people for kicks and basically get away with it. If anything the fact that the film has any complimentary critical accolades and supporters merely cements my assertion that if legendary lousy film director Ed Wood had been born later he would have been deemed a genius. Stone's film is incoherent rambling overlong largely pointless and drenched in violence. His imagery is completely foolish and oftentimes laughable. Characters will be sitting in a hotel room while babies float by the window. While traveling down the highway a giant monster stomps by the car. It is like Stone raided the stock footage department and pell mell superimposed it into the background of his wretched film. When depicting Lewis's crummy home life the film suddenly takes on the guise of a bad TV sitcom. Stone apparently thinks these flourishes are brilliant but they instead remind one of Woods' work  with Bela Lugosi narrating while stock footage of an unrelated cattle stampede is interspersed.Acting is universally horrible. Robert Downey Jr. probably comes off best as an Australian news documentarian but even his work is spotty. Lewis well on her way to becoming to goto girl for white trash roles is dreadful and Harrelson manages to condescend to equal her every step of the way.Some people insist the film has a message but the problem is that Stone makes his point in the first 30 minutes and spends the remainder of the running time sledgehammering it home. The point is not deep and the biggest problem is that Stone the filmmaker seems just as in awe of his murderous amoral central character as the film that supposedly derides their supporters and the society that makes them celebrities. Stone and his film has absolutely zero sympathy for the human wreckage that they leave in their path which makes both the director and his production more than a tad hypocritical and ultimately pointless.".

Lewis well on her way to becoming to goto girl for white trash roles is dreadful and Harrelson manages to condescend to equal her every step of the way.Some people insist the film has a message but the problem is that Stone makes his point in the first 30 minutes and spends the remainder of the running time sledgehammering it home. The point is not deep and the biggest problem is that Stone the filmmaker seems just as in awe of his murderous amoral central character as the film that supposedly derides their supporters and the society that makes them celebrities. Stone and his film has absolutely zero sympathy for the human wreckage that they leave in their path which makes both the director and his production more than a tad hypocritical and ultimately pointless.";

	schema:headline " The 8th most controversial film of all time according to Entertainment Weekly";
	schema:reviewBody "Note This is probably the longest review I have ever written and it mostly deals with the source of controversy surrounding Natural Born Killers so if you just want a brief summary of why this film is worth watching skip to the end!I remember when Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was released in 1994 and delivered a welldeserved kick up the arse to American audiences. Stone set out to criticize media for its mindless glorification of violence and criminals in the media and did so through a sharp satirical spectacle about two infamous killersturnedidols starring the it actors of the early 90s. Unsurprisingly conservative American families were outrageddisgusted at what was presented to them and saw the film itself as a mindless glorification of violence and criminals as opposed to criticism. Indeed they were so outraged that when teenfans left their Oklahoma home to go out east and shoot fellow Americans parents blamed Natural Born Killers for having inspired the shootings. Oliver Stone was left with blood on his hands while more murders were being linked to his masterpiece. Lawsuits were filed cases were tried and reinstalled until finally they were dismissed in Louisiana in 1998. The reason I bring this up again after so many years and so many more violent films later is because Entertainment Weekly has published a list of The 25 Most Controversial Movies of All Time and Natural Born Killers is ranked as 8. Now I don't want to knock Entertainment Weekly as they report on reality but when a film like NBK gets a high ranking as 8 they should be called Entertainment Weakly. My point is rather that this is a film that dealt with such an important realistic issue that it should never have been controversial in the first place. So why was it?The reason for this high ranking I assume is the ending of the film. Instead of opting for your typical clichd copout in which the good guys win and the bad guys are punished Stone lets Mickey and Mallory Knoxthe glorified killersget away with precisely everything and ride off in their car on the highway. This was what lead to a public outcry and what caused an antiviolence film like Natural Born Killers to be mistaken for a proviolence advertisement. Firstly it is my opinion that audiences who need everything to be carefully spelled out for them in a film in order to get the message and morals right are probably devoid of morals in the first place no offense Crash 2004. So because Natural Born Killers did not have a perfect righteous ending with a good guy shaking his finger and telling you that this was unacceptable and having the bad guy repent their crime some people took this as homage to serial killers. This fills me with concern for your average moviegoer. Secondly Natural Born Killers shouldn't have inspired this much controversy because while it often exaggerates to get its message across it is realistic to the coreand why should realism be labeled controversial? Isn't it just the opposite? Having violence in a film is a realistic portrayal of the world today. Having media glorify violence is even more so because that is what is happening. By making Mickey and Mallory Knox into infamous symbols If I were a mass murderer I'd be Mickey and Mallory! one worshipping teen tells the TV camera team Stone is parodying reality. He is parodying the idea of media turning serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer into celebrities. Dahmer was on the cover of new magazines more than once for example. The prison interview with Mickey is based upon the Charles Manson interview with reporter Geraldo Rivera. The story told on American Maniacs about Mickey killing a cop after asking him for directions is taken almost verbatim from a story made up by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1930s about bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in an attempt to try to silence the couple's growing fan base. In other words no one can argue that Natural Born Killers is not a realistic portrayal of the media's response to criminals.Now thirdly it is my guess that the film struck a little too close to home when it opened and therefore attracted unfair criticism. It pointed to things that were too familiar with audiences. Take the famous sitcom scenes of Mallory's family featuring hammy acting clownlike sound effects and canned laughter. All the stylistic elements were present it was just the content that was overblown Mallory's father made lewd suggestions and it all culminated in a ruthless killing spree. Yet somehow it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom. This was Stone's intention. In prison when Mickey is being interviewed on national TV the film cuts to a simple black and white image of a typical American home. The family is sitting around watching the interview glued to the television like mindless zombiesthe very same people who hated this film. That's biting irony.So controversial? I have watched Natural Born Killers many times and cannot see anything else than a satirical masterpiece. I also do not think that exaggerating images or scenarios is overkill  I think exaggerating morals and 'happy endings' to get a point across is overkill. Natural Born Killers had the perfect balance and was meant to be taken tongueincheek. It doesn't glorify violence it shows how desensitized the media and the public have become to it. And it does so with flair and fury. 9 out of 10".

The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt.

Let's make him an admirable character.  Fat Chinese clerks and hicks are uncool so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twistedhateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked.  The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film  just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film's message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous reallife results.  The clever message is nowhere to be seen.".

The casting of nonentities Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as Mickey  Mallory a white trash version of Bonnie  Clyde whose crime spree is chronicled in gruesome detail by muckraking TV reporter Robert Downey Jr doesn't help. They don't have the depth or gravitas to shines through the muck left behind by Stone's direction. They're lightweights when the film needs the likes of Dennis Hopper and Sissy Spacek. The rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either. Tommy Lee Jones is embarrassingly bad as the prison warden bent on capturing the couple and Downey affecting an Australian accent is dismal. Rodney Dangerfield and Edie McClurg have cameos as Lewis's parents. Ashley Judd's scenes were cut from the theatrical release.".

I knew other kids my age liked it for the same reason I did so I wasn't surprised when I heard two idiots were blaming the film for their crimes.  It's been a while since I last watched the film but I can tell you in retrospect I don't think I would like it as much as I used to.  I don't even care to see the director's cut.  The image of the severed head on the back of the box turned my stomach.  This is the sort of thing I welcome from a stupid horror movie not from mainstream Hollywood and a movie that yes hypocritically purports to convey some sort of message.  If someone has to sit through this dreck to get it in their head assuming they didn't know it already through osmosis that yes the media is corrupt and glorifies violence then they are probably better off living in ignorance.  This is like making a film with the message that eating results in excrement.  We all know we live in world that is often corrupt and ugly.  This film would not be HALF as hard to take if it were simply a violent fun exploitationtype movie as it would seem Tarantino originally intended.  I know I would think of it more favorably now.  This movie was just complete overkill in so many areas that it is genuinely stupid.".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first saw this movie upon its theatrical release I was seventeen mad at the world.  I had a blast.  I knew other kids my age liked it for the same reason I did so I wasn't surprised when I heard two idiots were blaming the film for their crimes.  It's been a while since I last watched the film but I can tell you in retrospect I don't think I would like it as much as I used to.  I don't even care to see the director's cut.  The image of the severed head on the back of the box turned my stomach.  This is the sort of thing I welcome from a stupid horror movie not from mainstream Hollywood and a movie that yes hypocritically purports to convey some sort of message.  If someone has to sit through this dreck to get it in their head assuming they didn't know it already through osmosis that yes the media is corrupt and glorifies violence then they are probably better off living in ignorance.  This is like making a film with the message that eating results in excrement.  We all know we live in world that is often corrupt and ugly.  This film would not be HALF as hard to take if it were simply a violent fun exploitationtype movie as it would seem Tarantino originally intended.  I know I would think of it more favorably now.  This movie was just complete overkill in so many areas that it is genuinely stupid.";

The only character that was even moderately interesting was the newscaster Robert Downey Jr.. Many of the events were utterly implausible. It was a halfbaked version of the Bonnie  Clyde story only more modern and less interesting.After viewing Natural Born Killers I thought less about the film and more about what Oliver Stone must have been thinking when he made it.

	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers is quite possibly the most controversial film ever made. No other has sparked such a debate of violence in cinema and has caused such a divide between lovers and haters. Many people see it as a poignant social commentary a wickedly funny and dark outlook at a society gone mad with the idea of celebrity and media obsession. Others see it as depraved celebration of sick violence and a catalyst for what it seeks to undermine. The film certainly contains scenes of horrific deplorable violence but I would argue that the overthetop 'cartoon' violence is done to let the audience know that the film is not meant to be taken too seriously. Yes the message is serious but we need a bit of black comedy with our satire otherwise it's just like watching a very boring fact based documentary. The violence and the whole film is completely over the top because that is what Stone is telling us We have gone too far.Based on a script by Quentin Tarantino the film follows two young lovers Mickey and Mallory Woody Harrelson and Julliette Lewis as they travel across America killing because it's what they want to do. Hot on their heals is hotshot cop Jack Scagnetti Tom Sizemore who is not quite what you would call an honest cop. Also along for the ride is sensationalist journalist Wayne Gale Robert Downey Jr who hosts and produces and directs the cheesy tabloid show 'American Maniacs'. The first 45 minutes of the film shows us how Mickey and Mallory meet and shows us their murderous rampage across the country. Like Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange the first act of the film is the most shocking part. Most people who have turned off either film has done it by the end of the first act. The two films share many other things in common at the end of the first act our antagonistic protagonists are caught and sent to prison they both have graphic violence and are hated by politicians and mother's groups and both have much to say about our society and the mindset of it's outcasts. NBK is very much the A Clockwork Orange of the 90's.Whilst incarcerated Mickey gives an interview to Wayne Gale and it is here that the film is at its most interesting. He provides a thoughtful indepth insight into why he is what he is and does what he does and the brilliance of the film is that it makes us see his point of view. Of course this is also where the film makes itself vulnerable to attack because anybody who goes out and murders somebody and happens to have a copy of the DVD can be said to have been warped by the films 'proviolence' message. The film is about as proviolent as American History X is proNazi but unfortunately far too many people are unable to watch a film with an open mind or a view to learn something new and so the message goes over their heads. SPOILER If NBK had ended with Mickey and Mallory being killed by a relative of one of their victims then I'm sure everybody would applaud it's profound message of evil never triumphs. Instead Mickey and Mallory escape from prison and are last seen walking into the sunset so therefore Stone must like killers because he lets them live. Right? END SPOILERS How can you talk about NBK and not mention the fabulous look of the film? Shot on everything from grainy black  white 8mm to glossy Super 35mm and using in excess of 2500 edits the film is a visual feast. Stone uses 'vertical cutting' to show what a character is reading into a situation rear projection to show what is influencing their thoughts and decisions and many other great techniques which make NBK the most unique film I have ever seen. Unlike Tony Scott's cinematic turd Domino the style is not done merely for the sake of it to look cool it is done to place us amongst the chaos of the film. Plus it looks really friggin' cool! I must also mention that all of the performances are topnotch. Harrelson and Lewis fit their roles perfectly and really convey that these two people love each other. Sizemore also gives a solid performance as does Downey Jr who is absolutely bloody hilarious! The best of the bunch however has got to be Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden Dwight McClusky. He oozes with creepy redneck sliminess but is also incredibly funny and charismatic.NBK is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of art ever produced. For years to come it will be talked about and I'm sure it won't be long until another murder is blamed on it. NBK sets out to show us that we are far too obsessed with fame and celebrity and in my opinion it does just that. The media makes celebrities out of criminals whilst people who deserve recognition go unnoticed. How many of the 911 victims can you name? How many doctors who have saved hundreds of lives can you name? How many of the Columbine victims can you name? Can you name the killers? Probably. THAT is what NBK is all about and that is what it seeks to discourage.".

	schema:reviewBody "You don't have to be a fan of brass bands to enjoy Brassed Off but it couldn't hurt. The music is a central focus of the film but not as a compromise to the story of a town in turmoil. Coal mines being shut down in the name of progress puts many men out of work which naturally also jeopardizes the existence of the colliery band. The music combined with brilliant storytelling and editing is merely a platform for some superb acting particularly from Pete Postlethwaite.Having lived all my life in a large metropolitan city I cannot relate first hand to the plight of a small town community. Despite that I found the story intriguing even though it may seem the outcome is somewhat predictable.Having just purchased the DVD I found the brief writeup on the box to be way off the mark. It touts this film as some kind of romantic and hilarious comedy never once even grazing past the real subject matter of the film. This is another perfect example of the continued miscalculated promotion of a truly well crafted film that Muriel's Wedding also fell victim to. I'm not sure what the promoters were thinking but if you set someone up for a hilarious romantic comedy and what they receive is a thoughtful serious and sometimes depressing film are they going to be happy just the same? There are graciously some light moments and humourous turns in this otherwise sombre subject matter but this film doesn't have a happy ending. But it sure does have a moving one. Postlethwaite's performance hits you in an unexpected way and you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be moved by it.Any success that the film enjoys now that's it's strictly on video is likely to come from very strong word of mouth. I had been told how good it was and enjoyed it immensely. Now that I've seen it twice and thus been twice moved I wait for a reasonable time to pass so that I may watch and enjoy it again as I am bound to do.".

This is another perfect example of the continued miscalculated promotion of a truly well crafted film that Muriel's Wedding also fell victim to. I'm not sure what the promoters were thinking but if you set someone up for a hilarious romantic comedy and what they receive is a thoughtful serious and sometimes depressing film are they going to be happy just the same? There are graciously some light moments and humourous turns in this otherwise sombre subject matter but this film doesn't have a happy ending. But it sure does have a moving one. Postlethwaite's performance hits you in an unexpected way and you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be moved by it.Any success that the film enjoys now that's it's strictly on video is likely to come from very strong word of mouth. I had been told how good it was and enjoyed it immensely. Now that I've seen it twice and thus been twice moved I wait for a reasonable time to pass so that I may watch and enjoy it again as I am bound to do.";

Yes there are some laughs but there are far more tears some of pain some of joy.  This is a drama with a sense of humor.  You have to keep a sense of humor to survive when life kicks you in the gut.I've read some reviews condemning the politics of this film.  Well I applaud the political message.  I grew up near an industrial town one centered on the auto industry heavy machinery and agribusiness.  As I got older I watched it disintegrate through the 70's and 80's as the grain embargo auto industry woes and recession bled the life out of the town. It has never recovered.  Many of us felt that Reagan and Thatcher and their descendants were monsters who sold their people out for a quick buck while the parties that were supposed to represent the workers and middle class joined in the takings.  To us this isn't an antiThatcher film it's the truth.The performances of this film particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson as well as Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald are top notch.  There is a sweet and painful romance here but it is the community of the miners through the life of the band that is the center here. The music is beautiful and will move you.  The piece played as the pit closure is finalized stirs so many emotions. The rendition of Danny Boy brings tears to your eyes.  The review in our local alternative paper said the surprise near the end would reduce even the hardest heart to tears and they were right.There is so much to see and love about this film regardless of your political beliefs.  Music does matter but the people who create it matter too.  Communities matter love matters.  This is what good filmmaking is all about.  See this film.  You'll laugh a bit cry a lot get angry become sad but you'll never be bored.".

People I know or reviews I have read that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood yet still manages to be funny charming heartwarming heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.

That's the Grimethorpe Colliery Band winners of the national Battle of the Bands competition in the year that the colliery closed down. And they did turn professional too!Films like Brassed Off which seek to present a view of a sensitive issue are often derided for not offering a solution which can be written on the back of a cereal box. Personally I take that as a recommendation!The point of the film is this put people in situations that most of us will happily never face and they react in extreme fashions. There was little or no 'political' argument other than the fact that the Conservative Government of the time did destroy an entire industry. That same government them spent millions of pounds a year buying coal from Europe and South America. Angry? I would be.I saw characters portrayed in their entirety which meant 'scabs' and 'sellouts' rubbed shoulders with the committed and poor. I saw unflattering portraits of basically decent people prepared to risk friendships and relationships to keep alive an industry which was killing them but without which they could not live. It was a desperate time and the fact that families have been split since the 1984 strike shows just how deep feelings can run on this issue.And I saw no skipping over the holes in the logic either. No mention of the 41 vote in favour of closing the mine? Half of the chuffing film was about that! What about the fate of Gloria's report? What about Phil a striker from 1984 voting for closure? Did noone notice that he was one of the major characters?I do think that there were some problems with the structure of the film although it was dramatically more satisfying than the Full Monty. Gloria was unconvincing the wives were underused and the speech at the end yes I found it embarrassing too!But please before you attack the veracity of such a rounded and honest film as Brassed Off take the time and trouble to watch it properly first!".

The sight of these brilliant musicians trying to continue playing when they can't see straight stop laughing or keep their instruments in one piece is one of the most honest amusing and humble moments in a film in recent years. there is no flashy camera work no deeper meaning just something that says exactly who these people are. Ordinary human beings not superheros and just trying to live life whilst having fun in difficult circumstances. And you really can't play wind instruments drunk I've tried.The film is not perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "Grimley Colliery Brass Band has been going for nigh on a century but as the town's colliery itself comes under threat of closure due to the drawn out miners strikes so does the bands very own survival. Giving much relief to a very depressed area the band are hoping to make the grand finals day at the Royal Albert Hall could the arrival of Flugelhorn player Gloria be just what the band needs? Or is she merely the catalyst to something far more critical?Brassed Off is the first of what I personally call the Magical British Trio three films that perfectly portray the British sense of humour during dark depressing times of unemployment. The other two of course are The Full Monty 1997 and Billy Elliot 2000 of which Brassed Off is essentially an appetiser of sorts the warm up act for the big hitters so to speak. Not to say that Brassed Off is not worthy to sit alongside those well received pictures home and abroad as they say it most certainly is it's just that its blend of humour and strife doesn't find any easy ground thus making it hard for the undiscerning viewer to be at ease at the right moments. It is in short unsure of what it primarily wants to be. The humour does work well tho but it's in the dramatic core of the miners strikes and the affects they have on the denizens of this quaint colliery town that Brassed Off truly works with some scenes literally tugging away at the old heart strings. Then there be the music itself The Grimethorpe Colliery Band on whose real life story this film is based provide the music for the soundtrack and its most enjoyable often stirring and definitely poignant at crucial moments.The cast are tremendous Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald offer up splendid youthful heart but they are playing second fiddle or should that be third brass section? to Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. As father and son Postlethwaite and Tompkinson give the film its deep emotional being each driven by differing needs Brassed Off's success rests with both men being able to hold the viewers attention from the get go. Tompkinson has made a very profitable and thriving career in British Television and rightly so but it remains criminal that he didn't go on and make more well known and profitable full length feature films after his fabulous turn here.

	onyx:emotionText "Grimley Colliery Brass Band has been going for nigh on a century but as the town's colliery itself comes under threat of closure due to the drawn out miners strikes so does the bands very own survival. Giving much relief to a very depressed area the band are hoping to make the grand finals day at the Royal Albert Hall could the arrival of Flugelhorn player Gloria be just what the band needs? Or is she merely the catalyst to something far more critical?Brassed Off is the first of what I personally call the Magical British Trio three films that perfectly portray the British sense of humour during dark depressing times of unemployment. The other two of course are The Full Monty 1997 and Billy Elliot 2000 of which Brassed Off is essentially an appetiser of sorts the warm up act for the big hitters so to speak. Not to say that Brassed Off is not worthy to sit alongside those well received pictures home and abroad as they say it most certainly is it's just that its blend of humour and strife doesn't find any easy ground thus making it hard for the undiscerning viewer to be at ease at the right moments. It is in short unsure of what it primarily wants to be. The humour does work well tho but it's in the dramatic core of the miners strikes and the affects they have on the denizens of this quaint colliery town that Brassed Off truly works with some scenes literally tugging away at the old heart strings. Then there be the music itself The Grimethorpe Colliery Band on whose real life story this film is based provide the music for the soundtrack and its most enjoyable often stirring and definitely poignant at crucial moments.The cast are tremendous Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald offer up splendid youthful heart but they are playing second fiddle or should that be third brass section? to Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. As father and son Postlethwaite and Tompkinson give the film its deep emotional being each driven by differing needs Brassed Off's success rests with both men being able to hold the viewers attention from the get go. Tompkinson has made a very profitable and thriving career in British Television and rightly so but it remains criminal that he didn't go on and make more well known and profitable full length feature films after his fabulous turn here. Filmed in the ideal Northern English town of Barnsley South Yorkshire Brassed Off is a film that has evident problems but to someone like me a Brit who lived thru those depressing days under Margaret Thatcher's government it's a film that I love for a myriad of reasons one can only hope that one of those reasons strikes a chord with yourselves.A completely biased 910 from me!";

At the start pits are closing all over Britain but the Grimley colliery in South Yorkshire is still open and making a profit.

In the background the future of the mine is becoming bleaker.In the meantime Danny who is developing a very bad cough decides the band can make the national championships at the Albert Hall and despite bailiffs mendacious mine management feral hospital matrons and British weather they get there.This film in many ways is an update of the fine well crafted Ealing comedy of the 1950s celebrating the triumph of ordinary people over adverse circumstances officialdom and middle class pretentiousness through their own determination and talent. For the 90s the comedy has a harder edge and the political element more overt. At the end we are reminded of the hundreds of pits closed and 250000 jobs lost in Britain between 1984 the year of the great miners' strike and 1994. But surely the filmmakers are not arguing the miners should still be down below. Global warming alone means coal has had its day. The real crime was the failure to invest in alternative employment and to allow the destruction of the communities which had grown up around the mines. The British State which owned the mines for 40 years after World War Two proved a harsher master than the old private owners especially when the Bad Baroness herself Margaret Thatcher decided to sell.On the strength of their performance here the mythical Grimley band could easily turn professional like the similarly displaced workers in The Full Monty. Unlike The Full Monty the Brassed Off crowd don't step outside their mindset  they are still chained to their working class attitudes and the future looks like happening without them. They escape from the working class to the underclass clutching a year's salary most of them will soon be parted from. The traditional happy ending of the Ealing comedy is here only symbolic. Still the miners' spirit shines through and you can't help admiring their grit. And the music's nice.".

Thatcher's Britain did result in the pit closing down and threatened the band's future. The band did take the stage at the National Final and so the reason that the band don't turn professional is because there is no room in the banding movement for a professional band.For a point of information there are 4 basses in a Brass Band 2 Eb and 2 Bb not 2 or 3. Oh yes and bandsmen most certainly do carry there instruments through the street without a case especially bass players.On a slightly different point Phil does not have a gambling habit. He is still paying off the loan that he took out in 1982 to cover the loss of earnings because suspended I were. 18 b months it took that lot to sort it out. 18 b months on strike pay.

It is a natural wonderfullyacted film that moved me to tears in many scenes.The plot? It's about a group of miners in a small Yorkshire town who are also members of a brass band. However the mine is to be closed down and the film shows what happens to the redundant workers afterwards. There is also a romance between Andy Barrow and Gloria a woman who works for the management of the mine which causes conflict in the group.Many scenes made me cry like a little child. One of these was the 'Danny Boy' scene outside the hospital window. Another was the scene where Stephen Tompkinson one of the most underrated actors working in my opinion dressed as a clown is entertaining a group of children at the local church and loses it completely because he's so preoccupied with the thought of his sick father. The Albert Hall scene at the end is very emotional and enjoyable and one of the highlights of this beautiful film. Sadly many of the actors in it are still unrecognised as truly brilliant. Ewan McGregor lights up the screen in a pretrainspotting role however but whatever happened to his love interest in the film Tara Fitzgerald?   Overall a beautiful emotional and deeply moving film that made me cry. I don't usually cry at films. When most other people cry I laugh. Not this one. Had tears rolling down my cheeks. There were a few funny lines however such as 'Is this man bothering you?' Of course he is. He's my dad which is both funny and sweet. See this film the next opportunity you get or you'll regret it later on. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "South Yorkshire England and its 1917 the year The Grimethorpe Colliery Brass Band first formed now some 75 years later this is their story albeit loosely of how they and their coal mining community struggled against pit closures redundancies and the grim prospect of the Bands possible split during the early 1990's.In the fictional mining town of Grimley this is the towns folk and their love for their community heritage and of course their music. Set some years after the 1984  1985 miners' strike that brought the National Union of Mineworkers to its knees and Thatcher's Conservative Government to implement new laws to prevent miners from travelling in convoy to assist other coal pits. This was butchery of human liberties' and the hearts and minds of this once great mining tradition throughout England and Wales. Rumours of MI5 infiltration via spies phone tapping's and its anti subversive and heavy handed State Police style tactics and the new laws formed by then Tory party that prevented striking miners any State Benefits that lead many families into vast amounts of debt. This only succeeded in the English coal mining communities to further dig their heels in and fight for their jobs their rights and their families. One only has to see the opening sequence to the true story of the 2000 movie Billy Elliot that set against the 1984 strike itself to get a taste of the extreme harsh dictatorship and demoralising positions the miners were placed under.The year is now 1992 and we now see the aftermath of the last eight years and how this particular mining community has adapted to its changing climate of crumbling poverty and hollow existence. Now the threat of closure has finally caught up with them and they too must make a stance to regain any dignity they have left. With pickets and their rallying calls of Miners united will never be defeated the harsh facts are more relevant in 1992 as it was back in the mid '80's.Brassed Off centres on the future of the Grimethorpe Grimley Colliery Brass Band and its bandmaster Danny Pete Postlethwaite ambition to reach the finals of the National Brass Band competition. While walking on eggshells his is a story of pride and bitter resentment that he just might be the last of his kind. The fabric of the band is interwoven within the collieries future one cannot exist without the other Danny's refusal to give in to accept this fate is more than commendable to his everincreasing worries of ill heath family concerns and dashed and missed hopes. This is a movie of civic pride the battered bruised withered and imploded egos the cold unforgiving nagging of the pressures of older men beaten down by the new age of Privatisation and globalisation and the younger men who too are falling victim to this new giant of corporate sellouts'. There after to add insult to injury Grimethorpe via a 1994 E.U. enquiry into poverty had become of the poorest and destitute towns in both England and the European Union.Brassed Off shows just a very tiny tip of the poverty stricken district on this South Yorkshire village here the debt collectors Pawn Shops picket lines the feuding and divided relationships between men and their wives and their children and the struggle to make ends meet for the basics is at times harrowing to witness. This may be a fictional place but the times and actions are as true as the mines that have now become housing estates parks or wastelands and sad reminders of a once thriving British industry very much liken to the Steel industry of Sheffield as seen in the 1997 movie The Full Monty.We see a young Ewan McGregor as Union member Andy and his love interest with the pretty clerical worker Gloria Tara Fitzgerald making a nice metaphor for the dealings between management and the betrayed workforce but in the end it was all about the music these guys weren't just brassed off they were punched and kicked to the ground.During a radio interview with the actor Stephen Tompkinson Phil in early 2007 it was said that the movie showed the band winning the Trophy at the Royal Albert Hall some two weeks after the closure of the pit but the reality was that they won it the day after the pit had closed its gates for the final time. This twoweek time scale was added because the writers thought that the movies audience would seem this to be a little farfetched and unbelievable. Mark Herman b. East Yorkshire 1954 has written and directed this fable of trouble and strive if a little on the sentimental side but rightly so a hardhitting realistic flashback of the times of a land of prosperity turned upside down and laid to waste and the terror of despair of a people that died a little with it.Where there's camaraderie there's always hope and always glory even in this land of gold and brass.".

One only has to see the opening sequence to the true story of the 2000 movie Billy Elliot that set against the 1984 strike itself to get a taste of the extreme harsh dictatorship and demoralising positions the miners were placed under.The year is now 1992 and we now see the aftermath of the last eight years and how this particular mining community has adapted to its changing climate of crumbling poverty and hollow existence. Now the threat of closure has finally caught up with them and they too must make a stance to regain any dignity they have left. With pickets and their rallying calls of Miners united will never be defeated the harsh facts are more relevant in 1992 as it was back in the mid '80's.Brassed Off centres on the future of the Grimethorpe Grimley Colliery Brass Band and its bandmaster Danny Pete Postlethwaite ambition to reach the finals of the National Brass Band competition. While walking on eggshells his is a story of pride and bitter resentment that he just might be the last of his kind. The fabric of the band is interwoven within the collieries future one cannot exist without the other Danny's refusal to give in to accept this fate is more than commendable to his everincreasing worries of ill heath family concerns and dashed and missed hopes. This is a movie of civic pride the battered bruised withered and imploded egos the cold unforgiving nagging of the pressures of older men beaten down by the new age of Privatisation and globalisation and the younger men who too are falling victim to this new giant of corporate sellouts'. There after to add insult to injury Grimethorpe via a 1994 E.U. enquiry into poverty had become of the poorest and destitute towns in both England and the European Union.Brassed Off shows just a very tiny tip of the poverty stricken district on this South Yorkshire village here the debt collectors Pawn Shops picket lines the feuding and divided relationships between men and their wives and their children and the struggle to make ends meet for the basics is at times harrowing to witness. This may be a fictional place but the times and actions are as true as the mines that have now become housing estates parks or wastelands and sad reminders of a once thriving British industry very much liken to the Steel industry of Sheffield as seen in the 1997 movie The Full Monty.We see a young Ewan McGregor as Union member Andy and his love interest with the pretty clerical worker Gloria Tara Fitzgerald making a nice metaphor for the dealings between management and the betrayed workforce but in the end it was all about the music these guys weren't just brassed off they were punched and kicked to the ground.During a radio interview with the actor Stephen Tompkinson Phil in early 2007 it was said that the movie showed the band winning the Trophy at the Royal Albert Hall some two weeks after the closure of the pit but the reality was that they won it the day after the pit had closed its gates for the final time. This twoweek time scale was added because the writers thought that the movies audience would seem this to be a little farfetched and unbelievable. Mark Herman b. East Yorkshire 1954 has written and directed this fable of trouble and strive if a little on the sentimental side but rightly so a hardhitting realistic flashback of the times of a land of prosperity turned upside down and laid to waste and the terror of despair of a people that died a little with it.Where there's camaraderie there's always hope and always glory even in this land of gold and brass.";

Yes it is does wear its heart on its sleeve and it is both a comedy and a tearjerker but it has a real soul focusing on a colliery band and their lives by using comedy rather drama is a smart way to tell something of what happened to those 250000 men and their families who lost their jobs in 140 pits across Britain. What makes Brassed Off great is that is does not scream instead it uses real humour and light touches to make its point and it is watchable because it's genuinely a good moving film.With a good solid cast including a young Ewan MacGregor and the excellent Pete Postlewaithe solid directing and more than a touch of northern rough humour the films charms and disarms the viewer.

Everything politically important has been said on the previous 12 pages of this IMDb commentary particularly about Thatcher Reagan and now Bush and that ilk who put profit above all and people last. This film yes does belong in the full monty category but even more it falls into the Drum Line category as wellthe power that music has to lift people above their ordinary lives and to help them realize the depth of their humanity. This film like Drum Line is an education in itself about musical traditions that millions are ignorant of. I was stunned at the richness of sound produced by a colliery bandno woodwinds to thin out the total effect.The film also has echoes of How Green Was My Valley a film made in the 40's and set in Welsh coalmining country where male choral groups meet weekly and also compete in an annual national contest.In addition as an American tourist in Yorkshire I loved the literary aspect of that areaBronte country if you willbeing an English teacher but this film was a cold slap in the face concerning the reality of the fate of men and women upon whose backs and blood the nation was enriched and who are discarded like rusty tools when conservative economics trumpet the importance of investors over the fate of the workers in the industry. Yes as one commentator pointed out coal has no future in the 21st century but shortsightedness and greed have ignored the need for other energy solutions that could have saved those Yorkshire communities and families and which just might make the planet inhabitable for our grandchildrenif we don't continue to be stupid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dawn of the DeadI'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked that extra long image of the little girl skating away the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse the picture of perfect serenity and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic when quite unexpectedly morning comes and with it the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes holed up at the now abandoned local mall join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easytospot weakness one shot to the head takes them out but they're extremely fast and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense for instance if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy tshirts? there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creepouts gore and slaughter.And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the lighthearted breakthenerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out lookalike zombie celebrities which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of builtup jitters.Overall this is a remake that actually works. The characters for all their strength and weaknesses are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall I definitely recommend it even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.Grade A".

This is my first online review.My wife and I saw the original Dawn of the Dead 25 years ago at a midnight show and left wired enough to talk each other down till the morning. Perhaps a quarter of a century has inured us to the violence a bit since we just watched it again rental video last week prior to yesterday's venture to the local multiplex to see the remakereimagining and were mostly unperturbed by the revisit.For some reason I was hooked on the new Dawn months ago from the teaser and subsequently the actual trailer.  The Sparklehorse song in the former fit perfectly and the suburban shot followed by killer Vivian and closing with the burned projector film of the latter was intriguing in its own way. So I was primed to see the movie usually a recipe for disaster since preview expectations are rarely fulfilled by the finished product.  This time however they were.The cast was uniformly believable and more important empathizable at least with the good guys who got sorted out along the way.  Even the playboy jerk had several relevant lines.  Polley was a good strong female lead with another great rebuttal  No I'm a  nurse to a query about her medical skills and Rhames a cheerable if reluctant hero.  The camaraderie such as it was worked and visceral mefirst survival gave way more often to selfsacrifice.So what's not to like?  The fundamental premise that a classic got remade? Doesn't wash.  These are two different movies with the same name and similar premises but very different attitudes.  Better special effects didn't hurt either although this new version was oddly less disturbing sans zombies munching on dismembered body parts.  Speedy zombies except for the twitchers?  No problem hey they're hungry and as always persistent. My attention was held for the better part of two hours the story was interesting the outcome ambivalent the characters arisen to the task at hand becoming coldly rational to the divisions between life and death and zombiedom the music weirdly appropriate the black humor welcome respite. No Dawn of the Dead isn't Citizen Kane nor is it a sacrilegious assault on the horror genre.  It's solid filmmaking that's entertaining and thoughtprovoking.  Otherwise I suspect Romero would never have put his imprimatur on the remake.".

The good acting the spot on cast the refreshingly unbearable scares the Paul Verhovenesque completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore the almost uniquely unHollywood ending... It's all there.What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's recreators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values cheese cuddles and love will conquer all which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds and then the ketchuptastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead it's right at home.Ving Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie second only to the fast moving constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies once he actually starts speaking and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because oh my god someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white tshirt. again!Her character is only clichd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soontobe cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing wouldbe zombies before they turned I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.Since we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers Robocop Resident Evil etc. then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket I don't know why I'm bothering I hate rubbish like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film and all of us came out saying how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..?

	schema:headline " As good as the original with exciting new directions and room for a sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "Shortly after a number of strange cases begin to appear at the hospital where Ana Sarah Polley works a bizarre zombie epidemic hits the Milwaukee Wisconsin area full force. Sarah escapes her immediate threats and meets a number of other humans who decide to seek shelter inside a large shopping mall. As they learn that the zombie outbreak is much more widespread than anyone could have imagined their chances of survival grow increasingly dim.I know an awful lot of genre fans rail against remakes but like the update of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 this version of Dawn of the Dead is so good that we should instead be clamoring for more.Writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder knew that they had to come into the remake with both barrels blasting. Hardly five minutes into the film we're already into hardcore high tension gorefilled horror material. In lesser films our introduction to fullfledged zombie activity would have been dream material as a kind of teaser. Gunn and Snyder dispense with such weakwilled tactics and immediately launch into Armageddon. We quickly move to a wide shot of explosions brutal car crashes and other mayhem.We do finally get a breather while we're learning our cast of characters at the mall in nicely written scenes that bring out personality and depth to the relatively large cast but horror fanatics need not fret that the film will evolve into a dramatension and gore are never far removed from the film.Gunn and Snyder earn credit for both paying homage to their source material and taking off into other interesting directions. This remake is just as intense and titillating as Romeo's original but with a different spin.The cast is excellent the cinematography and editing exciting and innovative and the makeup and creature effects are top notch.Even though I've seen greater quantities the DVD for Dawn of the Dead also has some of the best extras I've seen on a disc in terms of quality. You get two excellent short films that effectively extend the feature. In one a new character from the remake Andy Bruce Bohne who runs a gun shop across the street from the mall gives us a 15minute video diary of his last 15 days. It's similar in some ways to the feel of The Blair Witch Project 1999 but for my money it's much better than that film. In the other we get a 30minute condensation of the news broadcasts following the outbreak of the zombie epidemic. This also easily beats any mock horror documentary such as The Last Broadcast 1998 with its hands tied behind its back. Make sure you at least rent the DVD to check out these extras.".

This remake is just as intense and titillating as Romeo's original but with a different spin.The cast is excellent the cinematography and editing exciting and innovative and the makeup and creature effects are top notch.Even though I've seen greater quantities the DVD for Dawn of the Dead also has some of the best extras I've seen on a disc in terms of quality. You get two excellent short films that effectively extend the feature. In one a new character from the remake Andy Bruce Bohne who runs a gun shop across the street from the mall gives us a 15minute video diary of his last 15 days. It's similar in some ways to the feel of The Blair Witch Project 1999 but for my money it's much better than that film. In the other we get a 30minute condensation of the news broadcasts following the outbreak of the zombie epidemic. This also easily beats any mock horror documentary such as The Last Broadcast 1998 with its hands tied behind its back. Make sure you at least rent the DVD to check out these extras.";

The script worked rather well and the movie flowed nicely also. Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully maybe before rigor mortis sets in you'd be able to move quickly who knows? But I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of the movie and you start to really care about the characters in the movie. I am anxiously waiting for 1 week to pass so that I can get my copy of Dawn. I already have it pre purchased.810 rating. The movie missed a perfect 10 for the simple fact that zombies SHOULD NOT run that fast.".

IT MAKES A GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER.Comments from other reviewers have sometimes made reference to a lack of character development in the film. The UDC version restores this kind of content and is one way that the UDC version improves on the theatrical release. I see better character development in this version of dotd2004 then in the 1978 original version of Dawn.The other improvement the UDC version makes is to restore some really excellent gore shots.

	schema:reviewBody "How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to Night of the Living Dead' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana Sarah Polley a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband Kenneth Ving Rhames a toughasnails cop Michael Jake Weber who tries to be twosteps ahead of any dangerous situation and Andre Mekhi Phifer whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.The plot is pretty straightforward and relies mostly on clich themes to move the story along. So as a rule most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on making it thankfully every bit a characterdriven drama as it is a horroraction piece.As Ana Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavyhanded sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most bigbudget horror movies  Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to 28 Days Later' than House of the Dead.'However despite all the movie's strengths it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first 'Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy handheld camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTVgeneration style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies coexisting but in different parts of the world.One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.One of my favorite realisms of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I'm certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen yes I know it's impossible.  Also it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this but I'm not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero the quickthinking blond heroine the official dumb jerk the official slut the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group's protection the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie's social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree's character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie  though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger Sly Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today's prettyboy action heroes such as Tom Cruise Ben Affleck Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves  who all look like they couldn't fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.All in all this movie was not better than the original and won't be nominated for any Academy Awards but if you're looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it's worth checking out.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD someday.".

There's plenty of gore and quite frankly the zombies scare the bejesus out of me and I don't scare easily. I think one think I particularly like about this film is that the zombies are really nasty fast aggressive inyourface intimidating monsters who would really scare you in real life. I've just never been that keen with slow moving sinister but gormless zombies. The zombies in Dawn of the Dead are truly terrifying.The pace of the film is excellent too.

This stops this being just another one dimensional gorefest. What elevates it above most of is that it has characters are not only interesting but totally believable. All the cast do a good job in particular Michael Kelly as the power crazy CJ and Sarah Polley Jake Webber and Ving Rhames as the main survivors. This is an incredibly entertaining film packed full of memorable scenes. Most films are let down by their ending but this one is highly satisfactory if a little bleak.

He dies before returning to life and attacking Ana. She runs and escapes in her car driving through a neighbourhood rife with violence and fires.  After crashing her car she hooks up with a group of armed survivors who take refuge in a mall.  The group settle in and fortify their position as an army of the undead gather outside.Before I start my review let me just say that this will be biased as I am always easily won over by zombie movies.  The fact that they just keep coming fast or slow lack character and only want to kill really just freaks me out.  So I tend to get easily scared by the genre even if enjoy' is perhaps not the right word and be easily more negligent towards their faults.  Despite telling myself that I wouldn't bother with this film as it would scare me I went for it anyway in a fit of confront your fears' type of stupidity!  The film starts with a creepy opening and pretty much manages to keep the pace up for the whole film.  It like the zombies moves fast and brutally throughout and is very very tense.Others have complained about the lack of gore  however I found the graphic exploding heads to do that more than enough for my tastes!  Better than gore is the atmosphere.  The use of news footage is not original but it succeeds along with the aerial view of the town in creating the impression of a world turning to sht.  I don't know about you but this scares me and the film did it well.  The speed of the zombie attacks makes for a thrilling ride and it did make me very tense  Snyder managed to make the whole film a threat especially for a first time director and I honestly have a very stiff neck a day after seeing this simply because my body was tensed up for the whole film!The pace of the film also serves to cover the real problems in content and plot.  Unlike the original there is no satirical swipe on consumerism  the fact that the zombies are just wandering aimlessly around the mall like they used to in life is pretty much ignored here  but times are very different now I guess.  The plot itself also has quite a few stupid moments where the characters act in a way you know they wouldn't in real life.  For example people go on suicide missions for little real reasons and you can tell that the script is just doing it to create more action.  However when you are into it these things don't really seem to matter.  The film may be a little silly when you think about it but it does have a good ending  downbeat and realistic or at least as realistic as it can be! and left me with no hope of a happy ending  in this regard it is everything that 28 Days Later..' is not.The cast is good even if the script places their characters secondary to the action.  Polley is used to slightly more substantial roles but still does well here.  Rhames is lumbered with a religious background that is never explained but he is a great presence throughout.  Weber is the standout role however.  His character is a slightly less cartoon version of Evil Dead's Ash.  He is the unwilling hero but yet he seems to accept all the obstacles he comes across.  He also manages to be one of the group that the audience cares about  most of them are fodder and we know it!  Phifer is a good actor but seemed too gangster' to really be driven to this degree by his family.  The rest of the support cast are mostly just there to get eaten but they do OK.Overall this is not a great film  but it is an effective one.  As a film it lacks subtext comment and plot logic. However as a thriller it is fast paced gripping and tense with a satisfyingly bleak conclusion.  Snyder does a good job as a first timer and creates an atmosphere that is gripping even if it lacks originality.  Like I said I don't deal with zombie movies very well and am easily scared but I reckon that this should satisfy many a Saturday night thrillseeking crowd even if it does nothing for your brain apart from it's risk getting eaten.".

However after a friend of mine brought Dawn Of The Dead over I said If I was going to make this movie that's exactly how I would have done it.The remake of DOTD is probably one of the best horror movies I have seen. It has enough blood and guts to satisfy the gore freaks but not too much to offend the casual viewer. I also really liked the intentional humor throughout the film. What really surprised me is that unlike most horror movies you really get to know and care about the characters most of them at least. You cheer when some of them die and frown when others stay alive.In most movies the characters are quite two dimensional and you can generally pick out from the first five minutes which ones will live and which ones will die. With this movie villains become heroes and heroes become villains. I wanted so badly for the character of CJ to die but by the end of the movie I was sad to see him go.All in all this was a wonderful remake and I hope remakes of other movies are just as good as this one.".

It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through.

	schema:headline " In my opinion not as good as the '78 original nowhere near.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana Sarah Polley as she goes home after another long shift she  her husband Luis Justin Louis go to bed  have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian Hannah Lochner their next door neighbours young girl who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room  locks the door Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life  attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window  sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life  attacking the living Ana gets into her car  speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth Ving Rhames who in turn find a guy named Michael Jake Weber along with Andre Mekhi Phifer  his pregnant wife Luda Inna Korobkina who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in  watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope if any...Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead 1978 which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead 1968 which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line  I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available the theatrical cut  a longer director's cut unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title  the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different  in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective  well built up once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside there's no running around shooting zombies there's no hiding out there's no locking or blocking the doors off there's no raid by the bikers  it all seems rather stale static  predictable. Then there's the character's there's just too many of them  there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clichs like the self serving yuppie the 'strong' female the big cop the middle class hero  the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide  nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere  they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film it moves along at nice pace it has some decent if unspectacular setpieces  action scenes I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits it's very sleek  it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.Director Snyder does OK  there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree Scott Reiniger  the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing there's no big gore scenes unlike the original there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies some gunshot wounds to the head a spike through a zombies head a poker through a zombies eye  after that I'm actually struggling there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.With a supposed budget of about 28000000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it it's well made  has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical  commercial failure of House of the Dead 2003. The acting is forgettable I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable  entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78 it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines poor character's  no stand out setpieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant  overall pretty disappointing.".

The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian Hannah Lochner their next door neighbours young girl who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room  locks the door Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life  attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window  sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life  attacking the living Ana gets into her car  speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth Ving Rhames who in turn find a guy named Michael Jake Weber along with Andre Mekhi Phifer  his pregnant wife Luda Inna Korobkina who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in  watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope if any...Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead 1978 which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead 1968 which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line  I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available the theatrical cut  a longer director's cut unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title  the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different  in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective  well built up once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside there's no running around shooting zombies there's no hiding out there's no locking or blocking the doors off there's no raid by the bikers  it all seems rather stale static  predictable. Then there's the character's there's just too many of them  there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clichs like the self serving yuppie the 'strong' female the big cop the middle class hero  the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide  nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere  they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film it moves along at nice pace it has some decent if unspectacular setpieces  action scenes I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits it's very sleek  it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.Director Snyder does OK  there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree Scott Reiniger  the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing there's no big gore scenes unlike the original there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies some gunshot wounds to the head a spike through a zombies head a poker through a zombies eye  after that I'm actually struggling there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.With a supposed budget of about 28000000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it it's well made  has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical  commercial failure of House of the Dead 2003. The acting is forgettable I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable  entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78 it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines poor character's  no stand out setpieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant  overall pretty disappointing.";

	schema:headline " Absolutely STUNNING remake!";
	schema:reviewBody "I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers no TV spots no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is moving at a neckbreaking pace and not letting up on the gutwrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed something damn rare for a remake.While many remakes are easy pointless cashins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.Young Nurse Ana Sarah Polley is living the suburban dream perfect house loving husband wellmanicured culdesac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight her life is changed forever as anyone's life can when a lethal virus that causes the dead to come back to life spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly completely hopelessly outnumbered Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery as so many many other reviewers have and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.First of all the zombies the word is never mentioned in the film can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them no hate no prejudice and no grudges. They exist only to create more as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters more zombie nosh! boarded up in the mall cop nurse hoodlum survivalist old lady pregnant woman security guards gay guy arrogant playboy millionaire pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reportersthe very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of criseschickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive despite differences that the original didn't have.The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20something teen soapopera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.There are a few references to the original I'd hate to call them 'injokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.Writer James Gunn Scooby Doo Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and the absolutely awful 28 Days Later. But they are far far FAR more terrifying than the slow sluggish riggermortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore bridging scenes more character development more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.Filmed in Super35 the DVD presents the film in 2.351 anamorphic widescreen with DolbyDTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman The Lost Tape Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed Special Bulletin We Interrupt This Program!complete news coverage of the attacks deleted scenes Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches Anatomy of Exploding Heads.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978 which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead. This new version written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder follows the original storyline fairly closely centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesheating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.The original in addition to being a horror film was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straightahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually dumb down a horror film but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason the most famous and imaginative images from the first film  that of the undead wandering through the mall vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein just as they did in their previous lives  are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although theoretically this should increase their terror potential it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.Nevertheless this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original. There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There's even a very subtle homage to the great Carnival of Souls the far more gentle precursor to all these overthetop zombie pictures when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his calling as just a job. Although the film isn't really all that scary Dawn of the Dead provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.".

	schema:headline " was shaking my head through the entire film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I LOVE horror films. And zombie films have a place in my heart especially George Romero's zombie films. And when I heard of a remake of Dawn of Dead with Romero having a hand in it I was excited. Finally a decent budget and modern day effects along with Romero's touch. Unfortinately I felt betrayed and very unsatisfied after the first 10 minutes of the movie. And sadly the rest of the movie followed suit. The only good thing if any in this film was thankfully the gore wasn't restrained But that's the only decent thing about this film.What makes this film so bad? Well it follows the trend of movie 'remakes' which in reality are a totally different movie and using an existing title to get fans to watch. And unfortunately this was no different. The director simply had no respect for the original masterpiece of it's older namesake. It lacked everything that made the original so memorable and replaced them with cheap thrills action sequences and annoying characters. I understand that it was Mr.Snyder's first time But jeez he already had a base to go on and plenty of reference material. The Mall seemed to be there in name only and the zombies where laughable rather scary.There's not enough space and time for me to explain every reason why this film was beyond disappointing. So I'll just summarize instead.First 'And foremost' the zombies. They ran they climbed they hissed and they made threatening faces at you. Wrong very wrong and shouldn't even be called zombies. Romero understood what made the zombies so scary in the original 'Dead' movies. They were believable and that's what made them scary. Because he realistically portrayed what a reanimated dead corpse would do. Their muscles where too rotted and stiff to move fast or do complicated movement if at any. They were too stupid to speak or make facial threats at you. And they were relentless and numerous. They simply wouldn't stop and they were simply so many it was overwhelming. These aspects are what made Romero's zombies so scary the 'remake' is completely devoid of all of that.Secondly was the overwhelming stupidity of all the characters It's expect that a few of the characters in films such as these are supposed to be stupid. But in this case they all are and none of them give you a sense of loss infact quite the opposite when they are finally dispatched. The only character I felt sorry for was the lone gunshop owner But his demise was all but predictable and on the whole irrelevant. The rest of cast you feel rather gratified when they meet their doom. In this film The characters and the zombies have something in common their IQ.Films like 28 days later and Return of the Living Dead I enjoyed even though they feature what I described as the first part at least as Dawn 'remake''s failings. But neither of these films boasts or pretends to be on the same level of Romero's work. 28 Days Later is not a Zombie film per se as the people weren't undead but diseased so them running and screaming wasn't as far fetched. And 'Return' was more comedic and satirical in nature as well as it took a totally different path from Romero's 'Dead' movies Dan O'Bannon made it abundantly clear that his movie had nothing to do with Romero's work or story lines. The 'Remake' however boasts about remaking a classic that carries the same name this is where it becomes inexcusable.If at all possible watch Romero's 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead. It's a classic And avoid the 'remake' travesty of a film.".

And when I heard of a remake of Dawn of Dead with Romero having a hand in it I was excited. Finally a decent budget and modern day effects along with Romero's touch. Unfortinately I felt betrayed and very unsatisfied after the first 10 minutes of the movie. And sadly the rest of the movie followed suit. The only good thing if any in this film was thankfully the gore wasn't restrained But that's the only decent thing about this film.What makes this film so bad? Well it follows the trend of movie 'remakes' which in reality are a totally different movie and using an existing title to get fans to watch. And unfortunately this was no different. The director simply had no respect for the original masterpiece of it's older namesake. It lacked everything that made the original so memorable and replaced them with cheap thrills action sequences and annoying characters. I understand that it was Mr.Snyder's first time But jeez he already had a base to go on and plenty of reference material. The Mall seemed to be there in name only and the zombies where laughable rather scary.There's not enough space and time for me to explain every reason why this film was beyond disappointing. So I'll just summarize instead.First 'And foremost' the zombies. They ran they climbed they hissed and they made threatening faces at you. Wrong very wrong and shouldn't even be called zombies. Romero understood what made the zombies so scary in the original 'Dead' movies. They were believable and that's what made them scary. Because he realistically portrayed what a reanimated dead corpse would do. Their muscles where too rotted and stiff to move fast or do complicated movement if at any. They were too stupid to speak or make facial threats at you. And they were relentless and numerous. They simply wouldn't stop and they were simply so many it was overwhelming. These aspects are what made Romero's zombies so scary the 'remake' is completely devoid of all of that.Secondly was the overwhelming stupidity of all the characters It's expect that a few of the characters in films such as these are supposed to be stupid. But in this case they all are and none of them give you a sense of loss infact quite the opposite when they are finally dispatched. The only character I felt sorry for was the lone gunshop owner But his demise was all but predictable and on the whole irrelevant. The rest of cast you feel rather gratified when they meet their doom. In this film The characters and the zombies have something in common their IQ.Films like 28 days later and Return of the Living Dead I enjoyed even though they feature what I described as the first part at least as Dawn 'remake''s failings. But neither of these films boasts or pretends to be on the same level of Romero's work. 28 Days Later is not a Zombie film per se as the people weren't undead but diseased so them running and screaming wasn't as far fetched. And 'Return' was more comedic and satirical in nature as well as it took a totally different path from Romero's 'Dead' movies Dan O'Bannon made it abundantly clear that his movie had nothing to do with Romero's work or story lines. The 'Remake' however boasts about remaking a classic that carries the same name this is where it becomes inexcusable.If at all possible watch Romero's 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead. It's a classic And avoid the 'remake' travesty of a film.";

It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot and the story suffers in the same way  there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.

The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.

However not all movies are to meant to challenge social structures or deliver underlying meanings and here there certainly is none of that.... and I liked it! Burlesque is a little cheesy yup filled with clichs uh huh predictable you betcha! That is all part of it's charm though. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. There is no great villain there is no great backstabbing  which in someways is more realistic. It doesn't try to have an overly deep plot. It knows it's superficial and embraces it. Did anyone ever doubt Christina could sing? Her voice is amazing and her acting ain't bad either. Cher is well Cher and how can anyone not love her? Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy. If you want to be visually and audibly entertained for about an hour and a half shut your brain off sit back and enjoy Burlesque.

	onyx:emotionText "At times I can be a bit snobby about movies. I am more attracted to slow artsy fartsy movies that try make grand points about society or existence. However not all movies are to meant to challenge social structures or deliver underlying meanings and here there certainly is none of that.... and I liked it! Burlesque is a little cheesy yup filled with clichs uh huh predictable you betcha! That is all part of it's charm though. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. There is no great villain there is no great backstabbing  which in someways is more realistic. It doesn't try to have an overly deep plot. It knows it's superficial and embraces it. Did anyone ever doubt Christina could sing? Her voice is amazing and her acting ain't bad either. Cher is well Cher and how can anyone not love her? Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy. If you want to be visually and audibly entertained for about an hour and a half shut your brain off sit back and enjoy Burlesque.

	schema:reviewBody "When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher I was if you could believe it less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter Britney Spears in the mindnumbing Crossroads I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today that I couldn't have been more wrong.First of all what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film as it turns out. However Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly this film is a musical also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly this film has an outstanding supporting cast including the always great Stanley Tucci Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane Kristen Bell Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film but here they only add to the fun and excitement.The story is really nothing new. Smalltown girl Ali Aguilera leaves her job as an Iowan waitress and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess Cher starts working her way up and eventually becomes the main attraction with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers which turns out to be a godsend for Tess who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack Cam Gigandet after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues and things go from there.Clich right? It's been done before right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry Harry Potter Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress but she's better than you would expect her to be and her songanddance numbers obviously are fantastic as one would expect.She and Cher have fantastic chemistry as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well that they seem to compliment each other enhancing each performance. And I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers but it's safe to say that that's not enough considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture but she's still able to pull this role off somehow.Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of however I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste and the writing is very quick and clever and humorous even when a little corny.However what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song anddance numbers. Soon after the movie begins you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as clich after clich presents themselves Burlesque has enough razzledazzle magic to outweigh its faults and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burlesque may have started out as a dazzling lipsync singing French twist sensation but when a talented girl from a small town takes center stage belching out loud piercing notes screaming with soul You know something got a hold of you and won't let go.The director starts out with scenes in dingy crusty locations overshadowed with filtered sunlight to create an outdated old fashion look. These scenes failed to capture a unique cinematic vision instead the views were dark and dull. His blend of melodrama and music worked better than Chicago because singing was sung only on stage. No phantom of the opera to bring tears just a busting out movie that went straight to the pointI want to sing!Ms small town girl named Ali played by Christina Aguilera changed cities but couldn't quite change her waitress uniform. She worked her way to that familiar job when charmed by neon lights she opened the door to a new world Welcome to Burlesque. As she looked around she watched the bickering and cat fights among the dancers and how shamefully patrons weren't getting their drinks. So she took charge by befriending Jack the bartender played by Cam Gigandet then moved from the unemployment line to waiting on tables and serving drinks. Tess the club owner played by Cher told her she has great enthusiasm and terrible timing. However in the midst of all this tension whiplash Tess told Ali to take off her coat and get to work.Ali studied hard by reading every burlesque book ever written. She demonstrated a fierce determination that she could do every dance every scene step by step better than the other girls at the audition . She was impressive and landed the job. Now here's the catch 22 people pay to see the dancers lip sync to the great stars like Marilyn Monroe's Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend. There is no live singing at Burlesque. What is a girl to do with all that vocal talent? Well she could be lucky to have a vengeful enemy like Nikki who turns off the prerecorded music during her lip sync stage performance. Surely for Nikki that has to be the biggest mistake huge mistake right? Right. So the rest as they say is history! Tess rewrites the whole show around Ali's voice and the small town girl is now center stage on Hollywood Sunset Stripe.Cher's performance was better than great it was awesome. She delivers a warm touchy feeling convincing me she owned the club she loved the club and she wasn't selling her club. Hard set and beautiful standing tall and confident singing  You Haven't Seen the Last of Me Cher is a true goddess definitive of stage and production. I needed to see more and more of her . You can't get enough of Cher and her makeup her hair and her famous I know everything attitude.Christina is the sweetest part of the movie. She worked Burlesque from the beginning to the end with an Eminem's 8 mile state of mind you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow. Without a doubt she definitely lost herself in the music the moment and the dancing. When you know you got it you go get it. She wore skimpy cultured pearls juicy bareback couture glittering with diamonds and holding ostrich feathers only as she paraded the stage singing slow songs old songs and hip hop songs. Her roommate Jack black eyeliner by night is the movie's secret eye candy. Well built nice teeth and shy he gives us a little touch of burlesque with his steamy and lusty private moves. And of course we need to mention Sean played by Stanley Tucci. He held the movie together or should I say he held Tess together.Burlesque is an eyepopping never boring cinematic experience that will entertain you with grandeur songs from the present and the past. As you experience this razzle dazzle movie you can actually feel the music. To me Burlesque mirrors Purple Rain's electrifying energy that generated from a club of talented struggling performers and a sidekick love affair. Christina and Cher in Burlesque will be remembered like Prince in Purple Rain. You have to see it again and again because true talent never ages its ageless. I just loved every mind blowing performance and I'm sure you will too so GO see it!!".

What you should expect from Burlesque is almost two hours of high powered entertainment. Burlesque is just that entertaining. If you are going to this film to witness a great storyline unfold don't go see this film. However if you want to be entertained with great vocals from Christina Aguilera and Cher in addition to great acting from Peter Gallagher Stanley Tucci Alan Cummings and again Cher then this film is a must see. I must say prior to the screening that I attended I was very apprehensive that I was going to see a product that resembled a Nine  Coyote Ugly blend of a film but I was certainly wrong. Burlesque holds itself above the rest of the films in its category. The film obviously cost a lot to produce and I believe that the money was well spent. Cher's performance was excellent. Say what you want about the person but the actress conveys a confidence level in front of the camera as though she has done this a hundred times. Stanley Tucci is also quite merit worthy in this film. His performance in Lovely Bones is still haunting and his role as Cher's righthand gay best friendcostume designer in this film just shows what incredible range this actor has. The costume design casting choreography and set design for this film are also worthy of mention. You can count on this film definitely being nominated in the Best Film in Comedy or Musical category for the Golden Globes in December. This film will also do incredibly well at the box office. I would have no problem watching this film again.".

	schema:reviewBody "i have just watched this movie for the first time today and I must say that I don't understand why I listened to the other reviews. All I heard was that the acting was horrible and the story was bland and so on. I will say that the opening scene is a bit too empty but then Christina starts singing and you forget all about it. The cast is amazing for the guys we have Christina Aguilera Kristen Bell Julianne Hough Chelsea Traille and the rest of the girls even Dianna Agron for the ladies we have Eric Dane and of course the sculptured Cam Gigandet of course we can't forget about the acting powerhouse that is Stanley Tucci playing the gay best friend that every woman wishes she had especially if he is that good looking and we can't forget about Peter Gallagher and Alan Cumming. There is a lot more eye candy from all the boys that work at Burlesque. The story is somewhat predictable but I find that the way it is told between music and extra little drama in the background makes it perfect. Just hearing Christina Aguilera singing is enough to carry the story along. Cher has a solo about halfway through the movie that brings you back to one of the main issues in the background which makes for a very powerful solo thanks to that story and the power of Cher's voice makes it even more dramatic. The writing is exquisite due to a main reason it is perfectly real. It is not full of extra fluff and puff just to create some kind of big moment. It has lots of funny in it but very subtle . Bottom line is the script is simple to the point and every line sounds like something you would hear somebody say in real life. Many films have all that dialogue that you know nobody would ever say but it makes for those big moment but the simplicity in this movie is what makes me like it so much. It is a simple film with an amazing cast that I believe has been completely overlooked. I have a theory as to why it has been overlooked...the marketing for it wasn't very good it only focused on Cher and Christina and it made very little reference to any of the other amazing people in it or even to the story. The trailer makes it sound like it is all about the dancing and sining but there is an actual story behind it all. The love story is only partially shown on the trailer there isn't even one image of Eric Dane or Peter Gallagher there is too much information about the dancing part as well I personally think they should have left a little mystery on the dancing and singing and added some more of the story into it. That's just what I think. Enjoy.".

Because it ain't burlesque and it rips off too many elements from Marshall's film of Chicago and Fosse's choreography for me to count.This movie is as true a glimpse of the real burlesque scene as Showgirls was of the real traditional Vegas showgirl scene. But Showgirls had a slightly more believable plot.Here's a suggestion for Steve Antin How about making a movie called Girl Group with only one musical number in it? After all you've given us a movie called Burlesque with only ONE actual burlesque number in it. The rest is just a ripoff of your sister's Pussycat Dolls routines. Especially that final number. THAT was the song that took so long for the hero to write??? THAT was the song that was so deeply personal that he couldn't share it with anyone until he felt it was perfect??? No wonder my BS detector wore out.The costumes are gorgeous hence the 3 stars from me but they're the only things that made this movie remotely tolerable. And the camera never held still long enough for me to get a really good look at them. Note to all directors If you're spending that much on costumes for god's sake let us see them and appreciate them! Also as someone who is active in the burlesque scene I must point out that merely wearing a burlesque style costume does NOT make someone into a burlesque performer any more than wearing spike heels and a miniskirt makes a nun into a streetwalker.Vocally Christina Aguilera and Cher both have amazing voices. But does every song they sing have to be a powerballad with all those fullout wails and cadenzas? Enough already! Those songs and vocal gymnastics lose their dramatic power when they're all we ever get to hear.All in all Burlesque was 2 hours of my life that I won't be getting back.".

	schema:reviewBody "So it's a movie about a lounge with signers and dancers. It's not a musical but you expect to see dancing sexy and songs. Burlesque delivers on all account it's sexy without being naked it's fun the music is great.I don't know why so many reviewers here say that Christina Aguilera is a bad actress she gave quite a decent performance considering that well she is not an actress. And while Cher is not on the screen all the time she is fantastic. For a woman in her sixties wow...The movie made me buy the soundtrack Christina know how to sing and she is very good.As for the background stories lounge on the verge of closing love interest they are there to give the movie some meaning but are not overly invading on the main content witch is signing and dancing. Those background stories are were the movie lost my 2 points because you don't quite feel the urgency stress of Tess money problems everything runs like there is no problem at all.All in all it's a good entertaining movie. It's gonna be in my bluray collection just for the music and dancing alone.".

	schema:headline " High octane fast paced musical is super fun even if it's not a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I unlike a lot of people in lieu to it's box office results really wanted to see Burlesque. I am not necessarily a Christina Aguilera fan though she has made a lot of songs I like same deal for Cher and though the movie did not seem like it would be a 1010 it looked insanely fun for my tastes and I had been invited by my friend and her mom to go see it with them. We were all fairly excited after seeing the previews and hearing of what reception it did get from audiences was generally well perceived and directly after it was over were pleased to admit that all three of us really enjoyed it and were not disappointed.There is not really many downsides to this movie in my honest opinion that can not be made up for with other material. For example The songs while not all are memorable make the movie ultimately more enjoyable and have some nice choreography to the dances that were made for them. Show Me How to Burlesque is my favorite song with Cher's You Haven't Seen the Last of Me and another song that incongruently and infuriatingly is not listed in the soundtrack titles on here and did not have a really huge part in the movie other than it being my favorite dance sequence besides Show Me How to Burlesque being two other very catchy songs in the movie as well. The others felt like they were there merely to fill time because I personally did not find them that special.There's not really any brand new awesome material but it really is much better than people would expect in terms of entertainment and professionalism. Christina Aguilera has got some pipes. Whether you like her vocals or not she can hit and hold a note and she really is not that bad of an actress. She wasn't in this film at least and while we are at it neither was Cher both gave pretty believable and likable performances. Everyone gave a likable performance both acting and music wise especially my man candy Cam Gigandet. You could grate cheese on that boy's body. There is a nice touch of comedy here and there from Alan Cumming Stanley Tucci and a very cute and well done scene between Aguilera and Gigandet that involves a nice shot of Gigandet's bottom and another mishap in that scene that will make anyone crave the box of cookies at that exact moment. I love Cam Gigandet.Moving on another aspect is the movie has got excellent sparkly costumes during some flashy risqu sequences that could possibly make anyone have a seizure who was not thoroughly prepared. Another of my favorite things is it has got beautiful and I mean beautiful lighting and wonderful makeup in many scenes making the actors actresses and settings look picturesque and crisp. Steve Antin while not an amazing director does a very nice job and does an even better job with the writing even if the script is not Oscar worthy. Like I have said it is not going to be held in cinema history as the next Casablanca or Godfather few movies are nowadays but this was an enjoyable experience for many reasons and I encourage anyone who thinks they can handle it for what it is to see it.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "I waited a long time to write this review. I liked the film a great deal but I'm not so sure everyone will. It is entertaining in the way of old fashioned entertainment. Other people in the theater I attended liked it a lot also. That was easy to ascertain by the loud comments both during and after the film.The story itself is a little shallow mainly it's there as a means to fill in the space in between the elaborate musical numbers. However the story is enough for the vehicle it carries happy ending and all.Cher as the club owner Tess has top billing but the entire show is undoubtedly Christina Aguilera as countrygirl turned burlesque performer Ali. I'm old enough to say that in my life I've seen most of the premiere singing performers of modern times many in live concert. Little Christina Aguilera is not just in a class by herself. Ms. Aguilera is in another universe perhaps even another dimension. Her voice has a tonal quality a power and a range that is nothing short of staggering. But the best part is that she knows how to make fullest use of that magnificent instrument.Every second that Christina Aguilera is on screen she is absolutely riveting. You can't take your eyes off of her and not just because she's remarkably beautiful. Here she is in this film surrounded by a good number of extremely beautiful and talented women yet they all seem to fade into the background fog when she is on. She has something more than beauty. She radiates raw animal magnetism and positively smolders in some kind of unidentifiable sexual power that just plain overshadows everything around her. In short this film is well worth watching just for Aguilara's screen time.If you can tear yourself away from watching Christina there is more here to see. All the participants turn in great performances. All the dancers surrounding her are talented and wonderful to watch. All together they create very memorable entertainment. Kristen Bell as Nikki and Julianne Hough as Georgia are great but it's Bell who is the surprise. Being so used to seeing her as the usual blonde adornment in romantic comedies she surprised me with her dancing talent. She's really good. And Hough is a given in a dancing costume as flawlessly great as she is beautiful.For me the performance I enjoyed the most other than Christina's was Stanley Tucci as Sean. Mr. Tucci is a great talent who adds character and charm to everything he does and he won't disappoint anyone here.I saved any negatives for last and none have anything to do with the cast. I found I didn't like the sound the way it was presented. The techniques they used tended to make the performances almost look like they were all cannedlip synced. I'm sure they thought the vocals had more power the way they did them but it truthfully detracted from the overall presentation.The decision to make a PG13 rated film was no doubt made to try and capture the kiddie ticket buyers. I honestly feel that if they actually pulled out the stops and made an honest R rated film with a more adult slant it would have been better and more profitable in the long run. To me trying to make anything called BURLESQUE anything other than an adult film just seems ludicrous on the face of it.In spite of the negatives it's still entertaining. I'll take friends to see it with a clear conscience.By Bruce L. Joneshttpwebpages.charter.netbruce.jones1".

	schema:reviewBody "Raise the curtain! Before heading to watch thiz movie I already had my own imagination about how the story would look like I thought maybe it revolved around a countryside girl who was about to try her luck to chase her dream in a big city eventually the city is Los Angeles and the girl's name is Ali which is played by Christina Aguilera maybe she would start from a cloistered but extraordinary nite club apparently it named Burlesque maybe she would have a tough beginning for her career and there would be such a mentor for her I talk about Cher maybe she was going to meet her love interest a pretty boy with an attitude I talk about Cam Gigandet or maybe she would be forced to quarrel with her envious evil colleague as well I talk about Kristen Bell. And for the ending I don't have to explain I give it to you to figure it out yourself I am pretty sure that you have already know the ending as well and you are right! In the tradition of Coyote Ugly 2000 and Rob Marshall's movies such as Chicago 2002 and Nine 2009 here it comes a new breed of the genre. The movie is second directing effort after Glass House The Good Mother 2006 by former child star of The Goonies 1985 Steve Antin. Thiz Ali's character is obviously made for Aguilera it's like let a fish swims freely into the sea. It flows naturally. Cher is a legendary music icon who makes one dimensional impression there is no specific chemistry with other Cast members she seems to be talking to herself. Cam Gigandet after seeing his macho performance previously in Never Back Down 2008 thiz time he plays more easygoing and fun role. But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance it's not convincing at all as Ali's competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Actors the film once again is an Aguilera's playground. Her powerful voice covers up all the flaws. The opening song Something's Got a Hold on Me is my favorite with gratifying 1970s Rock 'n' Roll tune. With all those fabulous songs it comes to my mind why there isn't one single duet song from these two world class performers. Anyway the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera's performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. In fact who doesn't want to pay small nite club's cheap ticket that there is a performance from Christina Aguilera. Hello? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is clich. It doesn't look like a movie after all. By the way I didn't come home from a movie. I had just come home from Christina Aguilera's concert. And I am happy!  Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE httpjonnyfendi.blogspot.com".

But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance it's not convincing at all as Ali's competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Actors the film once again is an Aguilera's playground. Her powerful voice covers up all the flaws. The opening song Something's Got a Hold on Me is my favorite with gratifying 1970s Rock 'n' Roll tune. With all those fabulous songs it comes to my mind why there isn't one single duet song from these two world class performers. Anyway the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera's performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. In fact who doesn't want to pay small nite club's cheap ticket that there is a performance from Christina Aguilera. Hello? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is clich. It doesn't look like a movie after all. By the way I didn't come home from a movie. I had just come home from Christina Aguilera's concert. And I am happy!  Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE httpjonnyfendi.blogspot.com";

If BURLESUE was made in the 30s it would be a Warner bros Vitaphone musical like 42nd STREET or FOOTLIGHT PARADE. Christina Aguelira would be played by Joan Blondell who she actually resembles. Cam Gigandet would be James Cagney. Cher vs Mae West. Hop into the 40s and we might have Rita Hayworth as Cher Berry Grable as Christina and called COVER GIRL or PIN UP GIRL or if you prefer staying in a cheaper locale THE SWING PARADE OF 1946 Monogram's big nightclub musical mess starring Gale Storm and performers in a finale who did not appear anywhere else in the whole film. In the 50s well just have a look at either PAL JOEY or THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. The opening 5 minutes of BURLESQUE resembles the 1965 Elvis credit sequence on a bus in TICKLE ME. BURLESQUE really really wants to be all of the fabulous nightclub scenes from SWEET CHARITY... the scenes where Charity meets Vittorio and sees the RICH MAN'S FRUG dance numbers with awesome Barrie Chase and her 10' legs and whopper hair. Now that we are in Fossey territory add some CABARET in fact a lot of CABARET mix in MOULIN ROUGE and plenty of CHICAGO and Columbia's B grade subsidiary Screen Gems give us a new B grade nightclub musical with all the above elements called BURLESQUE. This film just wants to be some of all those above. Hell it is far better than NINE and miles ahead of RENT which for me is just fine. I actually think the 'lets save the nightclub' storyline is a wink to other clich musicals and knows it. Boogaloo anyone? What is good about BURLESQUE is the hilarious script which has some terrific lines the excellent rapport between the three leads Cher C.A and Stanley Tucci... and of course cute Cam as the Paul Newman type love interest. His 'box of cookies' nude scene adds some well timed zing. The dance numbers are thoroughly enjoyable albeit badly edited and filmed too close like most of the film. The songs good and the costumes offer the old razzle dazzle as well they could and actually do. BURLESQUE knows it is silly and has a great time with it... hey just like an actual BURLESQUE show. Just enjoy. it's not difficult. BURLESQUE might even get Barbra Striesand out of the house to make a new musical given she would see it as her husband James Brolin has a cameo and Cher is her same age 66. Also finally Cher might get the cash to make the Mae West musical for which she is now ideal.

	schema:headline " A musical that hits the wrong notes mainly";
	schema:reviewBody "Christina Aguilera is the second singer to make her big screen debut this month. The first being Pixie Lott with her futile effort as Judy in a contender for the worst film of the year Fred The Movie. As we saw in Fred Pixie occasionally sang in some parts of the film to demonstrate the talent and Aguilera does the same but only a lot more considering Burlesque is a musical. So is this the same case scenario as Fred? Better but certainly nothing great.Aguilera plays Ali a small town girl leaving her home to depart to Los Angeles because of the hard time living with her parents in order to live her dream as a singerdancer. She comes across The Burlesque Lounge which is managed by Tess who is played by music icon Cher. Starting off as a waiter in the place she becomes enthusiastic to showcase her singing talent to Tess and her performance eventually convinces Tess who then allows her to perform on the shows. In the background of it all the characters in the club face problems  Tess' club faces bankruptcy and despite putting one obstacle out of the way by refusing an entrepreneur called Marcus Gerber's Eric Dane offer to buy the club she still fears that she will lose the club. And for Ali her problems lie with a fellow dancer who despises her called Nikki Kristen Bell as they clash for who the main star of the club is and an engaged bartender called Jack Cam Gigandet who has a desire to develop a relationship with Ali despite having a fiance. The characterisation is heavily flawed in Burlesque. Let's begin with Ali. Christina Aguilera was suitable for the role but not suitable. She has the skill to act as a good singer and a role like this can display it but playing a young dancer doesn't work she looks a bit old for the role. Her character alters in the film starting off as an unknown waitress keen to perform and saying to the first man met at the club that it reminded her of a strip club to a star performer racking up the cash for the club with the popularity she gains and reiterating her opinion of the club as I've never seen anything like this. From the time it takes for her to go from rock bottom to the most confident singer in the club she evolves into a pompous arse. And that time is very quick. Rome wasn't built in one day but the character of Ali was. Cher as Tess is the opposite. She starts off as 'it' until the club's financial problem hits her then she becomes the character Ali started off with a woman with problems that need to be sorted. It takes two to make a thing go right but not when they contrast heavily even when they change. Not to miss the fact that her looks are incredibly ludicrous. To sum it up the word plastic defines how she looks in this. From the dancers in the club only two have significance in the film Kristen Bell's jealous character Nikki and Julianne Hough's Georgia a dancer whom Ali befriends. Have I mentioned Coco yet? Coco Chelsea Traille is a black female dancer who occasionally grins at Ali in a manner which you would expect something fishy going on between them but it turns out meaningless. Stanley Tucci plays a bent stage manager called Sean. Not much to say about him. Cam Gigandet plays the bartender Jack who first appears gay with his eyeliner but turns out to actually be straight. Oh and the man that I mentioned at the start whom Ali describes the club as having the looks of a strip club to? He doesn't have significance either apart from reappearing in a dance scene which has a lot of sexual interaction between him and the two dancers participating with him. The script writer of this film did a bad job. The dialogue spoken by the characters was very repetitive  when one character said something the other retaliated by saying exactly the same thing but just worded SLIGHTLY differently. I also must say that some of these lines are really corny with the corniness making the bad film so bad that it's good.This is a musical that features a club which is actually similar to a strip club. It contains voluptuous women wearing skimpy apparel and wiggling their butts every so often during their dances. Add a small sex scene which comes out of nowhere starting from a cheesy scene which turns into something mature  which also involves the male completely nude apart from a cookie box covering his midsection  as well as the dance mentioned previously which imitates sex positions yet here is a film rated 12A. Scandalous. Maybe it is because of nothing like pole dancing stripteases and full nudity. At the same time with content like that anyone under 12 going to watch the film would be viewing this.

	onyx:emotionText "Christina Aguilera is the second singer to make her big screen debut this month. The first being Pixie Lott with her futile effort as Judy in a contender for the worst film of the year Fred The Movie. As we saw in Fred Pixie occasionally sang in some parts of the film to demonstrate the talent and Aguilera does the same but only a lot more considering Burlesque is a musical. So is this the same case scenario as Fred? Better but certainly nothing great.Aguilera plays Ali a small town girl leaving her home to depart to Los Angeles because of the hard time living with her parents in order to live her dream as a singerdancer. She comes across The Burlesque Lounge which is managed by Tess who is played by music icon Cher. Starting off as a waiter in the place she becomes enthusiastic to showcase her singing talent to Tess and her performance eventually convinces Tess who then allows her to perform on the shows. In the background of it all the characters in the club face problems  Tess' club faces bankruptcy and despite putting one obstacle out of the way by refusing an entrepreneur called Marcus Gerber's Eric Dane offer to buy the club she still fears that she will lose the club. And for Ali her problems lie with a fellow dancer who despises her called Nikki Kristen Bell as they clash for who the main star of the club is and an engaged bartender called Jack Cam Gigandet who has a desire to develop a relationship with Ali despite having a fiance. The characterisation is heavily flawed in Burlesque. Let's begin with Ali. Christina Aguilera was suitable for the role but not suitable. She has the skill to act as a good singer and a role like this can display it but playing a young dancer doesn't work she looks a bit old for the role. Her character alters in the film starting off as an unknown waitress keen to perform and saying to the first man met at the club that it reminded her of a strip club to a star performer racking up the cash for the club with the popularity she gains and reiterating her opinion of the club as I've never seen anything like this. From the time it takes for her to go from rock bottom to the most confident singer in the club she evolves into a pompous arse. And that time is very quick. Rome wasn't built in one day but the character of Ali was. Cher as Tess is the opposite. She starts off as 'it' until the club's financial problem hits her then she becomes the character Ali started off with a woman with problems that need to be sorted. It takes two to make a thing go right but not when they contrast heavily even when they change. Not to miss the fact that her looks are incredibly ludicrous. To sum it up the word plastic defines how she looks in this. From the dancers in the club only two have significance in the film Kristen Bell's jealous character Nikki and Julianne Hough's Georgia a dancer whom Ali befriends. Have I mentioned Coco yet? Coco Chelsea Traille is a black female dancer who occasionally grins at Ali in a manner which you would expect something fishy going on between them but it turns out meaningless. Stanley Tucci plays a bent stage manager called Sean. Not much to say about him. Cam Gigandet plays the bartender Jack who first appears gay with his eyeliner but turns out to actually be straight. Oh and the man that I mentioned at the start whom Ali describes the club as having the looks of a strip club to? He doesn't have significance either apart from reappearing in a dance scene which has a lot of sexual interaction between him and the two dancers participating with him. The script writer of this film did a bad job. The dialogue spoken by the characters was very repetitive  when one character said something the other retaliated by saying exactly the same thing but just worded SLIGHTLY differently. I also must say that some of these lines are really corny with the corniness making the bad film so bad that it's good.This is a musical that features a club which is actually similar to a strip club. It contains voluptuous women wearing skimpy apparel and wiggling their butts every so often during their dances. Add a small sex scene which comes out of nowhere starting from a cheesy scene which turns into something mature  which also involves the male completely nude apart from a cookie box covering his midsection  as well as the dance mentioned previously which imitates sex positions yet here is a film rated 12A. Scandalous. Maybe it is because of nothing like pole dancing stripteases and full nudity. At the same time with content like that anyone under 12 going to watch the film would be viewing this.

It's all about the music and the main plot of the movie almost seems tackedon as if the studio realized it couldn't just release a 100minute film of Christina belting out burlesque tunes. So they threw a story together to pad out the moments between musical numbers.The plot is pretty transparent the jokes are fairly obvious and if I said the words the club is in financial trouble you can most likely guess the majority of rest of the movie.You'll notice earlier I said Christina belts out burlesque tunes and this isn't exaggerating. Strangely if I have a complaint about Christina's performance it would be her vocal barrages that sometimes seemed forced. A couple times I wanted to throw my hands up and yell Okay I get it! The gruntlike HOOOAAAAHHHHYAHYAHYAHHHHHs physically made my ears hurt in a couple of places. Don't get me wrong she DOES have an amazing voice but it doesn't need to go all the way to eleven all the time. I understand she's passionate about what she's singing. That's fine. But don't beat me over the head with it.The rest of the cast is excellent. Cher does a remarkable job and I'd go so far as to say I enjoyed You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me more than the majority of Christina's songs if only because Cher sings that song with more soul and passion than anything Christina does. It's more than Cher's character singing it's Cher herself if that makes sense.Stanley Tucci is perfect as Cher's gay sidekick. The jokes are basically what you'd expect but that doesn't make the character less charming. Kristen Bell does well with her smallish part. I was surprised and excited to see Alan Cumming's name in the opening credits and was shocked at how small his role was. Cam Gigandet and Eric Dane are the usual meaning they're what you'd expect from supporting male characters vying for the affections of the lead female character. One is involved in the only scene in the movie towards the end that is almost unbearable in it's convenience but it's forgivable given the tone of the rest of the movie.If you're going to see this movie just enjoy it for what it is. Don't expect a piece of masterful cinema don't take it too seriously. Enjoy the music enjoy the plot for the fluff it is and if you're a guy seeing it with your wifegirlfriend enjoy the scantilyclad women.".

The acting was not bad but the plot was a bit thin and sometimes a little unrealistic. Ice Cube plays an American gone to South Africa after the death of his father where his family informs him about his brother who has gone missing. Here he meets up with his brother's girlfriend played by Liz Hurley who is heavily into heroin. They then set about finding his brother which includes Shooting people blowing things up blah blah blah. After a while it all gets a bit predictable.".

He has come to bury his father but is asked by his mother to find his youngest brother who has gone missing in Johannesburg.  Checking out an address Vusi meets one of his brothers friends Karin and finds that his brother has stolen money from a drug dealer   creating more problems for Vusi as Muki is willing to kill to get his money back.This starts with flashbacks to South Africa during the early 80's where we find Ice Cube ys you heard me  was one of the student leaders of the uprising for change.  Years later he returns bringing with him a heavy monologue that lectures us about drugs being the new trap for the black man and how he must help the kids etc.  The story itself never really gets interesting  the only interest is the possibility to learn about life in S. Africa however even that is a bit stereotyped.The monologue makes the film feel even heavier than it is but when the film eventually settles in the guns n' gangstas ending that it promises it appears to have confused itself.  The film lectures about making the right choice as men about the evils of drugs  in fact Vusi makes it his mission in USA and S. Africa to help kids stay in education etc.  However after all that lecturing a happy ending only comes with murder violence and guns  is that the films message?  That drugs are bad and are a global trap for the black man and the only way to stop them is to leave education programmes and murder anyone involved in the deals?  I wouldn't have seen it this way if it had just set itself out as another thriller with an African twist but because it is message heavy until it gets guns I feel that it wanted to have it both ways when it can't.Ice Cube is watchable even when he is in rubbish films here he is OK but is really pushing the laidback yank thing too much.  His voice over is so preachy and monotonous that at times I thought he was falling asleep in the studio.  Hurley looks sexy despite working in a strip cub where noone gets naked! but her accent wanders all over the place  from English to African and back again.  Ving Rhames plays a sort of African Marcellus Wallace  the first dialogue scene he has all we see is the back of his headvery Pulp Fiction.  His accent is good but his character is nothing new.Overall this action' movie is dull  the interesting cast make it worth one watch but no more than that.  The mix of stay in school kids' and just say no' is too heavy and labourious but is made even more pointless by the film's conclusion that the best way to deal with criminals destroying an area is to get guns and kill them!".

One has to laugh really there's nothing else to do when you are presented with the posturing and fauxsincerity invested in the film by its average team of actors.

The woman just cannot act it seems thus she seems more effective simply hamming up her own image in Austin Powers International Man of Mystery and Bedazzled. Her attempts at a South Africa accent gad around all over the globe an embarrassingly inept effort in truth. Yes she 'looks good' depending quite upon one's own tastes but it appears that that is the only reason she is here  along with her ubiquitous 'dat skirt'fuelled star name.So a damn well disastrous film and a real waste of time spent watching it.".

And I thought a film with both my bestloved French actors couldn't fail.And you know what? The funny feeling in my stomach... gone after the first five minutes!!! This is a typical Francis Veber film but one of the better ones definitely. I laughed so much my jaw started hurting after a while. I can't say that there were no stereotypes in there that the story is brilliant or that the jokes were completely new. In this film what counts are the two leading performances next to strong supporting ones the fact that there is no boring moment and the Francis Veber touch to the script. Afterwards coming out of the cinema I felt good for the rest of the day and I know I will buy the DVD when it comes out.

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Veber has been known for his ability to construct extremely entertaining films. Most of his films are built in the same way very classical. This mix includes 2 main characters who basically shouldn't have anything to do with each other but who due to circumstances get together. Then you add a couple of truculent second roles and a series of inevitable clashes between those two. This structure was used among others in La Chvre The Goat 1981 starring Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu. An interesting point about Depardieu is that while he played the tough guy in The Goat he got the opposite role the stupid nice guy in Taistoi Ruby  Quentin. Needless to say he is evenly amazing in both even more as the stupid character where he brings such a pure simple sense of humanity that you can't feel sympathy for him. Both films deserves their place in an anthology of french humour. Francis Veber likes those a little bit simple guys because they offer a lot of potential for comic situations. And while you laugh at these naive character it's never aimed to make fool of them. Their humanity always eventually prevail and even the tough guy the one who just wanted to get rid of them at the beginning of the film finally likes them. In their simplicity they saw or did things a tough guy would never do but in a certain unlikely way they helped. So Taistoi is a skillfully crafted piece of pure enjoyment I would even say a master work in the comedy category. No dead moments every single line of the script is there for a single purpose to entertain us without appealing to our worst instincts. On the contrary.".

Here we have a Depardieu a good 30 pounds lighter than of yore and looking younger with it playing the village idiot to a faretheewell against Jean Reno's strong silent type. Compared to Depardieu who never stops talking taistoi translates literally to 'shut up' Reno's words are as carefully measured as teabags in Tel Aviv. Only see this movie if you're into verbal wit laced with sight gags and thickear confrontations involving a threeway split between DepardieuReno the flics and a team of semihard men. Not quite Veber's best but still a respectable 810.";

He has directed and scripted many films over the years which have given hours of pleasure and laughs to millions. This is because he has found the secret of universal humour which appeals to the vast majority of people whatever their origins. This film is in keeping with his standards. A little weak during the last half hour  unlike Le Placard  the film nevertheless maintains the spectator amused for most of its length. Many of Veber's films are about two central characters who are very opposed to each other but who nevertheless remain together. Some may criticize this idea for its lack of novelty but the hard fact it that people like it so we can say that Veber is a cineast for the vast public and not for his own particular idiosyncrasies. In this film Depardieu plays the weaker person  in previous films it was Pierre Richard Daniel Auteuil or Jacques Villeret  and Depardieu played the tougher character  Les COmpres La Chvre Les Fugitifs and to a certain extent Le Placard though he ends up weakened . The Tough character in this film is played by Jean Reno.  The plot is not as good as that of Le Placard but Depardieu's acting of the part of Quentin from Montargis is superb and is enough to carry the film on its own plot failings aside. I predict that the film should have an international success but perhaps slightly less than that of Le Placard. But one does laugh loud and it would certainly be a shame to miss it !!".

The viewer who discovers Taistoi! for the very first time could attribute as well this opinion to Quentin from Montargis Grard Depardieu in this film. The IQ of this character is so low that the wardens in prisons and the male nurses in psychiatric hospitals can't stand him until one day he makes the acquaintance of a taciturn inmate Ruby Jean Reno and thinks he's his friend because unlike all the ones Thomas met in his life Ruby never tells him to shut up. The two men escape in a preposterous way and are soon tracked down by the police and the underworld...For many French viewers Francis Veber is the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. Throughout the years this respectable scenarist gained a large reputation thanks to a recognizable comic recipe the mismatched duo of men. Two men with a very different disposition who have to be and to face together unexpected situations. This formula gave laughfilled works like la Chvre 1981 les Fugitifs 1986 when it wasn't pure genius with le Dner De Cons I mentioned earlier.With TaisToi! he remains faithful to his cinematographic writing and coming after the dismaying le Placard 2001 it is a few notches above his precedent work. Of course it never reaches the pinnacle of le Dner De Cons but the Veber touch can be felt here and there. This man is a mastermind when it comes to depict the persona of his duo of men between the grouchy ominous Ruby and his partner the silly simpleminded Quentin or to put verbal wit in hilarious dialogs. And it would be hard to resist taut droll moments.If the 2003 vintage is more palatable than the 2001 one that doesn't make a great film for all that. Apart from indisputable assets Veber's scenario is plagued by a humdrum imagination and a lackluster directing to weave an immaculate story for our maladjusted duo of men. Most of the film consists in a chase with fights shooting and stunts a little lazily filmed during which the director doesn't appear to be at ease in spite of the fantastic steps his tandem goes through. What also hampers the venture is its ultramapped direction and a patchy direction of actors. It would be hard to resist the blissful ignorant Grard Depardieu but Jean Reno is a more debatable choice for he's unable to shade his acting even if Veber wrote him some witty lines.I would be tempted to write that this film showcases Veber's strong points and his limits. When he stays confined to the grounds of comedy Francis Veber is in his element. But when he tries to make a foray into other cinema territories or to incorporate his comical gifts in it laughter are too scattered even rare. Even if Taistoi! isn't to be hammered it will be soon forgotten after the screening.".

The two men escape in a preposterous way and are soon tracked down by the police and the underworld...For many French viewers Francis Veber is the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. Throughout the years this respectable scenarist gained a large reputation thanks to a recognizable comic recipe the mismatched duo of men. Two men with a very different disposition who have to be and to face together unexpected situations. This formula gave laughfilled works like la Chvre 1981 les Fugitifs 1986 when it wasn't pure genius with le Dner De Cons I mentioned earlier.With TaisToi! he remains faithful to his cinematographic writing and coming after the dismaying le Placard 2001 it is a few notches above his precedent work. Of course it never reaches the pinnacle of le Dner De Cons but the Veber touch can be felt here and there. This man is a mastermind when it comes to depict the persona of his duo of men between the grouchy ominous Ruby and his partner the silly simpleminded Quentin or to put verbal wit in hilarious dialogs. And it would be hard to resist taut droll moments.If the 2003 vintage is more palatable than the 2001 one that doesn't make a great film for all that. Apart from indisputable assets Veber's scenario is plagued by a humdrum imagination and a lackluster directing to weave an immaculate story for our maladjusted duo of men. Most of the film consists in a chase with fights shooting and stunts a little lazily filmed during which the director doesn't appear to be at ease in spite of the fantastic steps his tandem goes through. What also hampers the venture is its ultramapped direction and a patchy direction of actors. It would be hard to resist the blissful ignorant Grard Depardieu but Jean Reno is a more debatable choice for he's unable to shade his acting even if Veber wrote him some witty lines.I would be tempted to write that this film showcases Veber's strong points and his limits. When he stays confined to the grounds of comedy Francis Veber is in his element. But when he tries to make a foray into other cinema territories or to incorporate his comical gifts in it laughter are too scattered even rare. Even if Taistoi! isn't to be hammered it will be soon forgotten after the screening.";

Porechenkov was also the director on this and adds a bit more comedy to the film with some of it actually funny and numerous references to Tarkovsky's SOLARIS 1972. Really!".

	schema:headline " Liv and Bertolucci Make Italian Movie Magic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Some of the most memorable sequences in Stealing Beauty occur in group situations. In one scene a troupe of family members chat sketch and lounge in a sun drenched backyard while the camera follows each member of the family capturing glimpses of their facial expression and bits of their conversations in what seems to be one endless take. In another scene the camera pulls a similar track at a large outdoor celebration this time using a few virtually seamless cuts to cover more territory and more people. These sequences more than any other in the film are representative of the essence of Stealing Beauty. The camera flows like a warm summer breeze blowing through the trees and people taking us back to your youth while rejuvenating a love for life in the moment. Stealing Beauty is about as solidly structured as such a movement it has no finite beginning no middle and an abrupt end. Like so many great Italian films it merely flows from one scene to another defying genre or perhaps even storyline. Few films of the 1990s were so richly cinematic and it's unlikely that Stealing Beauty would have achieved such a feat had it originated from any other country.With all that having been said the plot of the movie would seem rather incidental but it obviously does set up the events of the proceedings. Lucy Liv Tyler is an American who travels abroad to Italy to spend the summer with the friends of her recently deceased mother and their own extended family. She houses at their exotic country villa where the virginal nineteen year old is secretly on a quest to find the identity of her father convinced that her father' back home is not a biological parent. While staying in Italy she comes of age learning the hard truths about first love fidelity innocence and her budding sexuality.Of course such a succinct plot description lends the impression that this is an Americanstyle loss of innocence drama and this could not be further from the truth. The film never fully establishes itself in any genre. It is at once a drama a comedy a mystery and a sex film. It is this element that adds to the film's distinctly cinematic flair a trait that defines Italian cinema. With notable exceptions Italian films are often rightly or wrongly criticized for their emphasis on the role of the director over the importance of actor and screenplay. In the case of Stealing Beauty the latter is true but the former is not. In what had been heavily hyped as her starmaking performance the film's disappointing critical and commercial reception hampered this prospect Liv Tyler delivers what thus far remains the finest work of her career. With her pouty lips big blue eyes and long legs her unconventional beauty stems from her appearance as a perennial adolescent on the verge of womanhood. Never beforeand presumably never againhad this feature about her been so thoroughly exploited by a director. As Lucy she brings to the screen the perfect mix of gawkiness and confidence navet and overwhelming sexuality she carries the presence of a femme fatale full of mystery and fascinating to look at and yet her heart is always planted firmly on her sleeve. She achieves that rare feat of not simply reciting lines but speaking them it's a performance so clearly personal and passionate that one might think we were watching a wholly improvisational film.Yet perhaps the real star of Stealing Beauty is Bernardo Bertolucci. Best known to American audiences for his 1987 epic blockbuster The Last Emperor Stealing Beauty gave him a chance to go back to his smaller more intimate roots previously his best known film was the 1972 softcore masterpiece Last Tango in Paris while applying his epic sensibility. He lenses the film in the Cinemascope ratio but he does not use the frame to capture grand Italian vistas though several are on display or masses of people. Instead he frames in grand style such tender moments as Lucy's bereavement over the true identity of her first love or the sun lit walk home from losing her virginity. The film was photographed by Darius Khondji whose visual sensibility was arguably the most recognizable and influential throughout the late 1990s and few times in Khondji's career has a director's style worked so beautifully with his images. Much of the action takes place under the golden rays of a burning sun showcasing a vivid color palette as rich as the fabric of the film itself. Though it takes place in present day the look of the film lends a distinctly nostalgic overtone to the proceedings perhaps reminding one of a contemporary European take on Summer of '42.When released in the summer of 1996 Stealing Beauty was among the most highly anticipated films of the year for fans of art house cinema. There was a tremendous amount of hype surrounding Liv Tyler's racy lead role. It was believed at the time that the film could do for her Tyler in the summer of 96 what Clueless had done for Alicia Silverstone in the summer of 1995 both had rocketed to fame as a homoerotic duo in the Aerosmith video Crazy. It was also expected to resuscitate the career of legendary Italian director Bertolucci after the failure of his recent films. Alas when the film was released it drew mixed reviews and failed to appeal to mainstream filmgoers. Bertolucci's subsequent films were never even released in the United States and aside from supporting roles in the blockbusters Armageddon and Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring Tyler never jelled into the movie star the way most industry pundits predicted. Nonetheless the film remains one of the most extraordinary Italian films of the 1990s. Both Bertolucci and Tyler are in top form here and the film's unique success as a comingofage film despite completely defying the mechanics of the genre is an accomplishment in and of itself. Many of the best Italian films demand that you submit yourself completely to the vision of its director for the movie's duration putting aside whatever standards or prejudices you have previously held true. Make such a commitment to Stealing Beauty and the film is a smashingly effective work.My Grade  A".

	schema:headline " A master work by a master director. Excellent!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a Bertolucci fan and this film is one of the reasons why. I watch it again and again and never get tired of it. Don't be fooled by the 'losing virginity' theme this film is about life and death and everything that happens in between. It's about what you seek and what you're willing to give up to get it.One of the best things about this film is that every character has a story and an arc in the film most of which is given by just one or two lines or shots in the film. For example near the end of the film Sinead Cusack's character slumps at the table after having taken an old friend to the hospital probably for the last time. She says she misses England and rain and milk that goes off and says that she's tired of looking after people. Then everyone starts coming in and asking about dinner and she just gets up and opens the fridge. In less than a minute we see into her life and character in a way that most films would take at least an act to explore. We even learn a lot about Lucy's mother Lucy is played by a young Liv Tyler even though she has died before the beginning of the film and never appears in it except in a photograph also of Tyler.There is not a flaw in any of the performances. Never do we feel that these are people acting. They just feel like people interacting and we always have a feeling of their life leading up to the moments we see them and they are interesting lives.The location itself is one of the characters and it is beautifully shot the colours saturated and rich. It feels like you can touch the stones smell the air feel the grass and flagstones beneath your bare feet. If you don't want to go to Tuscany after seeing this film you are ill or on the wrong medication. The beauty that is being stolen or that people want to steal is not just the beauty of the young virgin on the hill it is the beauty of life of living of learning of looking back and finally giving it all up knowing it cannot be stolen. I know that some people criticize Bertolucci for his aesthetic for bringing the beauty out of every moment even the horrible ones and I say to those people that they live the life they choose.Finally there is the soundtrack which runs from altpop to classical to everything in between and works perfectly. It illuminates Lucy's internal reality and is true to the music that a girl of her age would have been listening to at that time and it also helps set the scene and smooth transitions between scenes.This is a master work by a master director and one of my favourite films of all time.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am a Bertolucci fan and this film is one of the reasons why. I watch it again and again and never get tired of it. Don't be fooled by the 'losing virginity' theme this film is about life and death and everything that happens in between. It's about what you seek and what you're willing to give up to get it.One of the best things about this film is that every character has a story and an arc in the film most of which is given by just one or two lines or shots in the film. For example near the end of the film Sinead Cusack's character slumps at the table after having taken an old friend to the hospital probably for the last time. She says she misses England and rain and milk that goes off and says that she's tired of looking after people. Then everyone starts coming in and asking about dinner and she just gets up and opens the fridge. In less than a minute we see into her life and character in a way that most films would take at least an act to explore. We even learn a lot about Lucy's mother Lucy is played by a young Liv Tyler even though she has died before the beginning of the film and never appears in it except in a photograph also of Tyler.There is not a flaw in any of the performances. Never do we feel that these are people acting. They just feel like people interacting and we always have a feeling of their life leading up to the moments we see them and they are interesting lives.The location itself is one of the characters and it is beautifully shot the colours saturated and rich. It feels like you can touch the stones smell the air feel the grass and flagstones beneath your bare feet. If you don't want to go to Tuscany after seeing this film you are ill or on the wrong medication. The beauty that is being stolen or that people want to steal is not just the beauty of the young virgin on the hill it is the beauty of life of living of learning of looking back and finally giving it all up knowing it cannot be stolen.

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 10152005 9 out of 10DirBernardo Bertolucci Marvelous comingofage story about a young woman named Lucyplayed by Liv Tyler returning to a place where her deceased mother spent a lot of time and rejuvenates some of the relationships she had four years prior while her mother was still alive. Bernardo Bertolucci again masterfully weaves this story in his usual poeticallyvisual style of directing. You feel like he's given everything he has and more to tell this story. It's told mainly from the main character's point of view which is amazing in itself but is possibly why the screenplay was written by a woman Susan Minot. The story begins as Lucy arrives at her destination with a diary of her late mother's in hand. She reads thru this as a means to get to know her mother betterwe get the feeling that she was not as close to her as she would have liked to be. The trip is also a way to explore this by getting to know her from the people who were close to her. The trip was the gift from her father whom she has never met and thus begins another search for her. Her virginity is also a hot topic but mostly from those around her. She had only kissed a boy five years prior when she visited before and is still infatuated with him and hopes he will be the oneif you know what I mean. Since her mother's death she has closed herself up in many ways and this has been one of themalthough she denies this. Every character in this story is full of life in one way or another and seems to know their place in it except Lucy. And that's basically what this story is about. Her self discovery and her finding her place in the history of her family. The Italian landscape provides breathtaking views that Bertolucci takes great advantage of the modern music blended with classical makes for an awesome soundtrack and of course the storytelling plays it's way to a wonderful ending that leaves you again wanting to know these people more and more. This is where Bertolucci succeeds so well. His characters are rich and full of stories like real people who are merely here to enjoy their life. What a concept and what a film from a masterful director!!".

Yep she's gorgeous. But where will this movie go? Will it follow its intrigues and conflicts to their resolutions and thus show that it is more about story than underwear? As the answer to Juicy Lucy's mystery brings us to further interpersonal conflicts will these be heeded? Unfortunately not. In the postscript to Lolita Nabakov defines pornography very soft and quite pleasant here as successive escalations of eroticism to climax. Ultimately in Stealing Beauty that escalation takes over as the director kills all arthouse soap opera with the deflowering of his own movie's purported innocence and with rather sudden ideal romance. Shouldn't we see a bit more flirtation between Lucy and her true love? As in even this softest porn the rule is that story and character play second fiddle to sex. Story ends when the sculptor tells Lucy 'This will be our secret.' He doesn't have to tell his wife! His wife isn't even more strongly driven to return to Ireland. Lucy has to continue to pretend she is merely a visitor. Doesn't she want to tell her sister You are my halfsister? All that gets dropped for a bit of simsex that is supposed to feel like a climax.Oh yeah and the three longdistance shots of the villa It was a little disconcerting to keep seeing Gladiator Maximus's villa supposedly in Spain here in Tuscany.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie Stealing Beauty 1996 when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called apparent selfindulgence and lack of character development and drama. I don't care about selfindulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever I feel sorry for them.I rewatched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth longing and bittersweetness.This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film there is Lucy a 19 years old American girl who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists  friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany.Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced gorgeously shot it looks in the faces of characters in the beauty surrounding them with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth nature and Italy Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine Enchanting April 1992. Perhaps because both movies have the same atmosphere the similar scenery the sun of Tuscany and their effect on characters and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic.Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming innocent and curious she was the center of the film and her innocence wholesomeness insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid next  she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it.Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. Stealing Beauty was the last feature film of the multi talented famous and beloved French actor Jean Marais mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first twenty minutes of this movie had me riveted.  The Italian landscape was incredible and upon meeting all the diverse characters one would think this was the perfect stage for a fine film.But it wasn't.Lucy's search for her father is first pushed on the back burner then brought miraculously to life near the end of the movie.  Meanwhile the plot involves the entire house buzzing like old maids about the poor girl's virginity as if the topic were front page news.  But then again Jeremy Irons character said it best Up here on this hill the only thing we have to talk about is each other. Hm maybe so but the idea quickly becomes dull.Instead of becoming interested in Lucy the only scenes I found enjoyable involved Miranda and her dimwitted boyfriend.  Richard made me laugh so much that I nearly forgave the pointless plot.  And I would've been very disappointed were it not for Jeremy Irons and his wonderful character of Alex.  Alex's musing thoughts and expressions made me smile and made me think.  'The incredible frivolity of the dying' You have to allow me a little frivolityAs far as what Lucy sees in Nicholo or what made her take the plunge with someone she barely knew baffles me.  Take the beautiful cinemetography interesting characters and mold them in an entirely different way and you've got yourself a much better movie than what was presented.  Such potential..wasted sigh".

	onyx:emotionText "The first twenty minutes of this movie had me riveted.  The Italian landscape was incredible and upon meeting all the diverse characters one would think this was the perfect stage for a fine film.But it wasn't.Lucy's search for her father is first pushed on the back burner then brought miraculously to life near the end of the movie.  Meanwhile the plot involves the entire house buzzing like old maids about the poor girl's virginity as if the topic were front page news.  But then again Jeremy Irons character said it best Up here on this hill the only thing we have to talk about is each other. Hm maybe so but the idea quickly becomes dull.Instead of becoming interested in Lucy the only scenes I found enjoyable involved Miranda and her dimwitted boyfriend.  Richard made me laugh so much that I nearly forgave the pointless plot.  And I would've been very disappointed were it not for Jeremy Irons and his wonderful character of Alex.  Alex's musing thoughts and expressions made me smile and made me think.  'The incredible frivolity of the dying' You have to allow me a little frivolityAs far as what Lucy sees in Nicholo or what made her take the plunge with someone she barely knew baffles me.  Take the beautiful cinemetography interesting characters and mold them in an entirely different way and you've got yourself a much better movie than what was presented.  Such potential..wasted sigh";

I kept waiting to see who would be the person Tyler would finally lose it with but it was a big disappointment because it was with someone she barely knew and he was a minor insignificant character that we are introduced to towards the end of the film. The sex scene was not erotic it was annoying and unrealistic.The only interesting and redeeming character is the man dying of AIDS played by Jeremy Irons.

The camerawork though it captures Tyler's good looks well makes me suspect that either Bertolucci or the cameraman had lusted after her during the filming sometimes the camera is so close to her it almost touches her.

I don't even know where to start so I'll just write the first things that come to my mindThe plot. It just went nowhere. Before watching the film I had an overall idea of the story in which there was this 19year old American girl involved who travels to Italy in order to resolve the mystery surrounding the father she never knew. With a premise as simple as this I was expecting the director to surprise his audience with a twist in the plot or two. Alas as soon as I saw the credits popping up I shouted out loud so is THAT it?! What was the point of all this? What was I supposed to get? Nothing important happened during those 114 minutes. Let's face it the countryside is fine for resting but if you don't have a damn good story to tell it's just a boring setting for a movie.Cinematography is not enough to make a good film. If I want pretty images I watch a documentary or here's a better idea I just take a walk outside. Watching the regular lives of useless country people don't really match my idea of quality entertainment.The characters are another matter. There are simply no characters that you can relate toshow sympathy because frankly there's something disturbing about horny aging hippies. The only likable person is Lucy then again that might only have something to do with Liv Tyler herself rather than her character.Come to think of it Liv Tyler's the whole reason I forced myself to watch this to the end. 2 stars for casting her.".

If I want pretty images I watch a documentary or here's a better idea I just take a walk outside. Watching the regular lives of useless country people don't really match my idea of quality entertainment.The characters are another matter. There are simply no characters that you can relate toshow sympathy because frankly there's something disturbing about horny aging hippies. The only likable person is Lucy then again that might only have something to do with Liv Tyler herself rather than her character.Come to think of it Liv Tyler's the whole reason I forced myself to watch this to the end. 2 stars for casting her.";

It is not sexy enough not intimate not engaging just empty with a story that from the very beginning we already know about.

If Hello Kitty and the Sanrio gang are deemed to girly and the UltramanPower Rangers Masked Rider et al deemed to manly then Doraemon is just the perfect creation to appeal to boys and girls. A futuristic cat with more than a bagful of fantastic gadgets springing out from his pouch my first brush with the character was through the animated television series and later through translated comics. I still remember vividly the Doraemon gigantic soft toy comes without the cotton woolsponge insert and you have to DIY was the 1 toy that NS boys bring back from overseas during my time.And while there have been Doraemon movies released over a period of time this one marks the very first that makes it to the cinemas here if I recall correctly no doubt boosted by reasonable box office numbers from recent anime movies like The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Brave Story and Paprika. Watching this Doraemon movie is like taking a nostalgia trip down memory lane to meet up with familiar friends only that the friends have been frozen in time and didn't age at all  they're still very much the school going children when we left off with rich brat Suneo fatty Gian the token rose amongst the thorns Shizuka the braggart Nobita who always shoots from the hip but is extremely lucky to have a faithful companion that we too would love to have Doraemon.A typical television episode would have Nobita running into trouble and coaxing Doraemon to bail him out more often than not featuring one of the countless gadgets that get introduced one episode at a time. However this is unlike the series that we don't have an all new all powerful gadget to encompass the entire movie but we have a series of familiar ones such as the time machine through the drawer the stickon helicopter head gear and the shrinking ray gun. The movie doesn't delay any moment in getting things kick started again relying on Nobita's loose tongue to get himself into trouble again this time bragging that he could find a complete fossil to show off to his friends.As luck would have it he finds a fossilized egg and uses a Doraemon gadget to bring to life a dinosaur hence the Japanese title and the cute creature you see adorning the posters. While not spoiling the plot for you it's akin to a Jurassic Park episode with our friends helping to keep the creature alive and through the process learn about friendship perseverance and sacrifice.What I liked about this movie was the 2D animation. While 3D animation can be detailed and crystal clear without parallel if done right this was a refreshing treat for the eyes as we go back to basics to the old school style of animation so much so that it is a breath of fresh air. And while art matters story weighs in a lot more so I'm glad to say that it possesses the little things in the television episodes that endears it to audiences this time magnified for a feature length film. It's not a 90 minute film mind you but a close to 2 hours one but given its length there are portions which could have been shortened of course and I thought it really tried very hard to get some tears out of the tear ducts. Thank goodness for the well placed humour throughout the movie!Given the school holidays just around the corner and for young adults who reminisce growing up with the futuristic robot cat I can't recommend Doraemon enough. An age old classic characterthat would appeal to all fans old or new.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big of Doraemon and Nobita's Dinosaur 2006 is the kind of movie that won my heart. The story is about Nobita finding a dinosaur fossil in his neighborhood. He uses the time cloth to restore back to its original form. Thus it became a full dinosaur egg. When the egg was hatched a baby dinosaur was reborn and was called Piisuke. Nobita loved the dinosaur very much however it grew too much and even walked around the neighborhood causing rumors that a monster exists in Japan. because of this Doraemon and Nobita goes back to the Prehistoric times and puts Piisuke in Japan. But it turns out that they put Piisuke in the wrong place and Dinosaur hunters are looking for Piisuke in order to complete their collection and get rich. Doraemon and the gang who condemn the hunters must bring back Piisuke to Japan and stop the hunters from collecting.What made me love about this movies is the animation. It is gorgeous. At times it can look a little goofy like but most of times it's brilliant. Also the comedy and drama of the film is just gold. The funny parts are hilarious and the sad parts are tear dropping. The part where i cried heavily was at the end of the film Nobita says goodbye to Piisuke and runs away. Piisuke tries to follow Nobita but Nobita tells him to get out of his way and stay in his true homeland. You can actually feel how hard it is for Nobita to leave a best friend or pet. The way he said was really heart broken for me.In conclusion this film is great for anyone especially for anime fans. I am a fan of anime but I LOVE Doraemon and this film. 1010.".

He credits the support of his now long time girlfriend Amy Miller and getting into competitive swimming as the primary reasons for turning his life around which includes working parttime at the hospital where his single mother works. He has become the star swimmer of his high school team so much so that scouts from Stanford University are coming in a week's time to watch Ben swim. Ben has a new swim fan in Madison Bell a recent transfer student to Ben's high school. Despite Ben making it clear that he is in a committed relationship Madison seduces him the seduction to which he succumbs. They agree afterward that their encounter was a onetime only event but Ben slowly comes to the realization that despite Madison's assertions to the contrary she has more in mind with him.

The characters talk and act like teens although they all look their ageearly 20s the story moves fairly quickly and I was never bored.  There are some glaring lapses in logic but while I was watching the movie they didn't bother me.  For instance it's impossible for Bell to do all the things she does.  Also the sex and violence is very toned down for the PG13 rating.  Good performances really make the film work.  Bradford is very good as Cronin.  Handsome muscular and believable.  Shiri Appleby does wonders with her sadly underwritten role as his girlfriend.  Christensen is excellent as Bell. She's both beautiful and very scary.No masterpiece bit a good solid teen thriller.  I paid 9.50 and thought it was money well spent!  Worth catching.".

But since the target audience for this film is today's teens chances are many of its viewers will never even have heard of Fatal Attraction' let alone seen it.Swimfan' is set in one of those high schools that exist only in the movies  you know the ones that seem to be populated almost entirely by twentysomething hunks and babes with the occasional nerd thrown in and which appear to be utterly devoid of teachers principals counselors or any other adult supervisory staff to run the place in all fairness we DO get to see one swim coach.   None of these students are ever seen attending a class cracking open a book or doing any homework but then that would sort of spoil the fun of the high school experience now wouldn't it?Ben Cronin Jesse Bradford doesn't ask much out of life.  All he wants is to be left alone to concentrate on his swimming so that he'll be in tiptop shape to impress the scouts who are coming out from Stanford to have a look at him.  That's his plan anyway until one day into his life strolls Madison Belle Erika Christensen a pretty young seductress who upon her arrival at the school makes an immediate beeline for Ben seducing him in the school's swimming pool and making his life thoroughly miserable thereafter.  Soon Madison is stalking our hero in true Glenn Close fashion finding ways to insinuate herself into every aspect of Ben's once seemingly ideal life.  Indeed Ben has every thing going for him popularity good looks athletic prowess a devoted mother a girlfriend who loves him  and it all threatens to come crashing down around him after just one night of unbridled passion with this freshfromoutoftown psychotic nut case. About the only interesting aspect of Swimfan' is how it shows that in this technologically advanced age a genuine stalker now has so many more options at his or her disposal  answering machines cell phones pagers voice mail email instant messages.  The possibilities are endless.  It's enough to make one long for the good old days when an obsessed paramour had to at least foot the bill for a phone call or buy a stamp to send a deranged letter or at least find ever more clever ways of skulking around.  Stalking just seems way too easy these days.  Technology appears to have taken all the challenge out of it.Unlike Fatal Attraction' which at least managed to achieve a level of credibility before it went off the deep end in the final act Swimfan' never establishes a believable tone.   Madison's actions always just feel like melodramatic plot points and Ben's retaliatory measures aren't much better.  And the law enforcement in the town  well the less said about THEM the better!  Ultimately the story becomes more and more preposterous as it churns along so much so that the film actually ends up generating more laughs than gasps by the time it is over.  Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen may still have solid acting careers ahead of them but my suspicion is that Swimfan' will not rank very high on either of their resumes.".

Given the high school age of the main characters in Swimfan and given background music that is mostly sophomoric the film is clearly targeted at people under the age of twentyfive.Ben Cronin Jesse Bradford is annoyingly smug. He's your prototype high school pop jock. He drives around in a macholooking pickup truck. Madison Bell lovely Erika Christensen gets a crush on Ben and even knowing he already has a girlfriend stalks him relentlessly she's his femme fatale. Conveniently unstable and manipulative Madison makes trouble for Ben with one plot contrivance after another.The script has a setup that is too long. And the second half of the script has action that is wildly improbable. Madison just seems to appear from out of nowhere in the most unlikely places and at just the right time. Her efforts are too easy especially as they relate to hospital security and police procedures. It's as if she has superhuman powers not an effect you want to impart as a storyteller unless your story fits in the scifi or fantasy genre which this film does not.If the script is weak the acting is generally pretty good with reasonably effective performances from Jesse Bradford Erika Christensen and James DeBello as Dante. The film's color cinematography is fine. And I also liked the editing with jump cuts that neatly corresponded with Madison's state of mind.Swimfan is not a bad movie. But its premise is unoriginal and the plot structure is faulty. A script rewrite or two might have rendered a better cinematic outcome. However other elements of the film are fine. And for the right audience this film does have some entertainment value at least for a onetime viewing.".

Jesse has a criminal past but got himself into swimming and is set for an athletic scholarship in that sport. When one of Jesse's swimming teammates winds up dead in the selfsame swimming pool he's looking mighty good for it to the police.Swimfan is not a badly done teen flick and in Bradford one has a young Tyrone Power so Erika's obsession is understandable.Hey I think he looks a bit like Power maybe Rob Lowe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well after watching this movie knowing that it was similar to the classic 'Fatal Attraction'  I smiled and shook my head because even though the movie is so predictable there could have been so much done to change the characters from predictably stupid to vaguely normal.Having said that given what they had the acting was actually quite good. I said good. Not wonderful not great. Just good. Casting was excellent. Madison Erika Christensen is perfectly cast. She looks so seductive innocent and devilish at the same time. Amy Shiri Appleby is fantastically cast as the somewhat quiet girlfriend of Ben Jesse Bradford. Both girls are very beautiful which adds to the sex appeal of the movie as well as the plot. We aren't told so but it's more than obvious that although Ben and Amy are in love they don't get intimate too often leading to Ben's weakness and he didn't try to stop Madison's advances too hard and his ultimate mistake.The direction is quite good. Camera angles are suspenseful lighting is excellent with an obvious emphasis on blue which through the whole movie exudes a rather powerful 'chilling' feeling The pacing of the movie in general is okay although something tells me that a lot of key scenes are lying on the cuttingroom floor ... and this brings me to the negatives.The story is terrible. Apart from the 'Fatal Attraction' clone which isn't a problem in itself  the characters are insanely stupid and naive. As a viewer you are dragged straight into the story with absolutely no room to begin to understand the characters. There is absolutely no character development no character arcs and no plot twists whatsoever. We are not given any motivation as to why Madison is the way she is what her motivations are why she's attracted to Ben or other athletes how she really got to know about Ben so soon and we're also rushed through major scenes in the movie the urineswitch etc. It all culminates to an overlydramatic climax which is frankly quite disappointing but predictable. I would like to have seen a 'stalker wins' kind of ending just adding another victim to her tally.If the point of the movie was to be a dramatic thriller then they failed miserably. Too dramatic not thrilling. Mildly comedic and quite irritating at times. You just want to shake Ben and say to him when the coach tells him that his urine tested positive for steroids Dude! Demand a reanalysis! MAKE A FUSS for crying out loud!!  But he stupidly walks off after a weak attempt at convincing the coach of his innocence only to open his locker and find a baseball bat as a viewer I thought Huh? Where did this come from?? Anyway a passable movie...entertaining but not good enough to make me want to watch it again in a hurry. Major plot holes stupid characters and key elements that were glanced over or cut out or not written in the first place changes this from a 810 to a 510.Surprising though I thought that Polson did a fantastic job with Hide  Seek. Lets hope he keeps improving!".

I saw this movie the day after seeing One Hour Photo which I regard as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best thrillers I've ever seen.  So I thought my mindset when entering Swimfan would be pretty darn negative. But I was able to enjoy it for what it is.  It's an often predictable thriller with some goofy elements but all in all it's very entertaining and a hell of a lot better than some of the crap that comes out nowadays.Jesse Bradford is a handsome charming actor and proves that he is leading man material.  I'd even go as far as saying he could be the next Tom Cruise. He has the looks he has the charisma he has the skills.  I enjoyed him in Bring It On and here he gives another fine performance.  Erika Christiansen makes a perfect bch.  She's a beautiful actress with a smile to die for but she becomes terrifying as the movie progresses that I became terrified whenever her face would pop up on screenwhich is a lot.The film is welldirected and the premise though it's been used before is quite intriguing.  I had a real good time with this movie.  Sure it has its standard Hollywood contrivances like the creepy guy who knows all the answers but I was able to shake those off.  But there was one flaw that really irked me  A high school swimming pool wouldn't be so poorly guarded. I would expect there'd either be a lifeguard on duty or surveillance cameras watching or they'd close down the pool.My score  7 out of 10".

It's an often predictable thriller with some goofy elements but all in all it's very entertaining and a hell of a lot better than some of the crap that comes out nowadays.Jesse Bradford is a handsome charming actor and proves that he is leading man material.  I'd even go as far as saying he could be the next Tom Cruise. He has the looks he has the charisma he has the skills.  I enjoyed him in Bring It On and here he gives another fine performance.  Erika Christiansen makes a perfect bch.  She's a beautiful actress with a smile to die for but she becomes terrifying as the movie progresses that I became terrified whenever her face would pop up on screenwhich is a lot.The film is welldirected and the premise though it's been used before is quite intriguing.  I had a real good time with this movie.  Sure it has its standard Hollywood contrivances like the creepy guy who knows all the answers but I was able to shake those off.  But there was one flaw that really irked me  A high school swimming pool wouldn't be so poorly guarded. I would expect there'd either be a lifeguard on duty or surveillance cameras watching or they'd close down the pool.My score  7 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing really bad in 'Swimfan' but not enough good material either to make it worth of even an average B movie. It's a teenage drama the story is about a new girl in town acted by the attractive Erika Christensen who eyes an average college guy with some sport ambitions a girlfriend relationship who should make him happy for the rest of his life but with some troubled history of himself that makes him a potential stalker victim. He will become one after a one time stand turns into an obsessive pressure from the newcomer. The problem is that the tension does not really get too hard the characters are too average to raise interest beyond the physical appearance and the director although doing a fair cinema job never succeeds to put something challenging enough on the screen to raise the interest of the viewers. The script is quite well paced for the first part then it falls into routine and becomes predictable as well. No real bad moments but nothing interesting enough to make anybody remember this film one hour after its end. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale.".

Keep the costs modest by using a cast that works cheap and not staging any elaborate action sequencespour more budget into promotion than into production then just wait for some nice profits. There is almost no risk because it doesn't have to be a megahit even if the critics hate it the promotional efforts should guarantee more than enough attendance to put this thing into the profitable category. The only thing more moneyinthebank is Disney's rerelease of its classics to a new audience every eight years.Although portrayed onedimensionally the obsessive character in 'Misty and Fatal Attraction was a deep thinker compared to Swimfan's Madison. Erika Christensen must play her as a character that comes with zero motivation. The script provides no way for her to communicate what attracts Madison to highschool athletes what makes her instantly obsessive toward Ben Jesse Bradford or even what she finds attractive about him. Seemingly the screenwriter and director were correct in their assessment of the intelligence of Swimfan's target audience reasoning that very few of them would even be interested in knowing why Madison is so psychotic and unbalanced.They appear to be going somewhere with the revelations about Madison's old boyfriend but these are inserted to advance the action and not as motivational explanations. Fortunately Christensen is talented enough to subtly convey weirdness even before her hookup with Ben takes place. Speaking of which Ben and Madison's sexual tumble in the swimming pool is the movie's one moment of true excellence. This is a case where the constraints of keeping a PG rating inspired rather than hindered as the director ends up with a far more inventive and erotic scene than would have occurred had he been able to be more graphic.What is tragic is that the director really hit a home run in the casting of Christensen. With those big round blankly lidded eyes the only feature that distinguishes her from her lookalike Julia Stiles she could have brought real depth to her charactershe simply glows when on the screen. Superficially Christensen plays the same basic character in Home Room Traffic The Upside of Anger and even The Perfect Score. But she does something completely different with each of them and really demonstrates amazing talent. The director realized too late how much Christensen was bringing to the screen. There was not enough time to change the story and put in an original twist. There is no way after the swimming pool scene that Ben would have resisted Christensen and gone back to a sexless nothing like Sheri Appleby insert Some Kind of Wonderful here. They tried to fix this issue in postproduction by deleting almost all of Appleby's scenes. But the better solution would have been to drop the predictable ending and reshoot with something quirky.The technical aspects of the production are excellent. It is nicely lighted and filmed. The supporting cast is competent and Christensen is excellent. But it is not ambitious and the cheapness comes into play by having almost all the action take place offscreen. During the first half one is fooled into thinking this is a high quality effort. At the point of the swim meet and its sabotaged steroid test the wheels completely fall off. From that point on the viewer is asked to believe a series of absurd plot developments that could only happen if you credited Madison with Bill Murray's Groundhog Day ability to relive days. Mostly offscreen and without plausible explanation she switches Ben's test sample infiltrates the hospital and breaks out of a police car. The second half of the movie can best be appreciated by viewing the film as weird comedy like a restrained version of Scary Movie.".

I am having a hard time deciphering whether this is a story of revenge longing for something missing or downright blatant sadomasochism either way it was bound to fall flat sooner or later. This is a film that walks the thin line between atmospheric and ludicrous with results that are sometimes creepy and sometimes provide for a good unintentional laugh riot. As if that wasn't enough just when you thought everything could be going good the film spits on that line and then walks away snickering. This is a film seemingly so bent on destruction and disaster that it almost seems as if filmmakers didn't realize it was going to turn out this morbidly goofy. Ben Cronin a bad boy gone good is a top athlete who may just be a scholarship away from achieving his life dreams. But things weren't always this happy. He spent time in a Juvenal detention centre for his drug addictions. Now a clean man and an all around loving guy Ben is presented with a new drug that could be the end of happiness as he knows it. This is a drug that may feel good at first but as it invades your privacy during a moment of weakness and becomes a controlling factor over your personality you become addicted. It is at this point where you become not of your own skin and learn to despise what you see in the mirror ever day enter Madison Erica Christensen in a role so sexually charged that you almost wish she was given a decent script to emote from. The deviant vixen strikes attraction to Ben and in a moment of weakness his dreams are laid on the line for one night of pleasure with her. He instantly regrets his moral dilemma and tries to avoid Madison's curse. But soon he finds that she had different ideas in mind for the two and begins his decent into human smile. Now I am not trying to argue that this film is void of all intellectual promise such is not the case. Its major downfall that sets it apart from its senior counterparts is that we have a script that would rather surround itself in the apathy created from the over use of dramatic irony instead of the communication process of human nature. This is a film about character that forgets its characters. The results are a film about character interaction with very little care for cause of the situation. Instead of feeling that our characters are journeying thought a process of harsh selfdiscovery we are reduced to feel that they all instead suffer from a case of mental velocitization. What is left is a brilliant account of the brutality that is suffered within an seemingly normal persons stream of thought and how unidentifiable emotions dominate the mind that becomes nothing more than a stupid teen thriller by means of false delivery and rushed solutions. Then climaxing with a mirrored exaggeration of the results of a choice enacted bye a few thrill seeking teens and not a portrait of the reality of selfparanoia as suggested by the first half of the film. This is not to peg teen films as having less moral code than that of other thrillers. Teen flicks like Joy Ride and the Forsaken are prime examples of good teen horror. Joy Ride was bold in its setup and the Forsaken was fun in its barely believable execution. This film finds itself swaying in the middle of a crossroad with grounds for action but no means for cause. It is far to atmospheric to be fun and far to cliched to too bold. Since this film is one of character let's talk of character shall we? Madison is a very sexually charged presence with a state of mind so that she acts out her emotions instead of recognizing them. She is the equivalent to walking out of a store when the alarm goes off and no one tends to the situation. She is an extremely riveting character until she turns into Charles Manson during the final act of the film. Because of this her methods go without purpose. In Cape Fear Max Cady was a metaphorical foil character reminiscent of the Archangel Gabriel who is sent to right the wrongs of mankind though pain and suffering. Madison's wild lapses in sanity are given no treatment as a cause for concern therefore she becomes nothing more than a bgrade stalker with twisted desires that fuel her fire to escape life. Also with her sanity goes her sexual being. This is a very sexy film but director John Polson clearly doesn't recognize that sexy is a state of mind not a state of physical well being. Mystery is sexy lunacy is not. Just once I wish someone would make a film where the deranged are treated as equal a human being as everyone else and for a moment I thought I was going to receive with this film until it collapses under its own weight. Remember in Cape Fear when Sam Bowden became just as much a villain as Cady did? Well Ben does much of the same in practice. He begins to feel regret over his wrongful actions and starts to drift away into a state of insanity to a point where he can't distinguish between right and wrong anymore. This would have been all right if this were not a character that was first presented as an all around great human specimen. This film gives us no reason to dislike Ben so therefore when his life starts spinning our emotions becomes terribly confused. This also presents us with no characters to root for. It is like watching a hockey game with no teams playing if you don't know whom to care for why care at all? This is a film that possessed so much promise it is sad that it became more worried about its age demographic than the quality of its outcome. It also suffers some of the most awkward editing committed to film. This is a technique used cleverly in films such as Out of Sight and the Limey neither films I would ever recommend but loses all focus here and makes it far to hard to decipher between reality and the minds ideology. There was a moment in this film when I thought quite the funny little query. After Madison starts seeing one of Ben's friends I thought to myself I wonder how long it will be until I see that 'She is only with you to get to me' scene.' To my astonishment it never appeared. But after I had taken it upon myself to view the deleted scenes feature of the DVD it was right there clear as day this was more than enough to produce a giggle from me. Now let's assume that you can stomach the fact that this film turned from a creepy little thriller about the human psychosis into a predicable and over exaggerated teen stalker flick there is still the climax to bear. This is the point when the director figured that he had a method figured out to show films that suffer from weak endings how to change this problem. His solution to omit it. The climax of this film is so scarce that when the film as over I had to scratch my head and wonder what had happened. After having time to ponder over this I found some amusement in this blatant exploitation of moviegoers. The acting here is surprisingly strong especially noteworthy is James DeBello as Dante Madison's weird cousin who could have been a great asset to the film if he were treated more as a disgruntled individual than more of a guardian stranger with a quick fix to help. Also Erica Christensen makes a smooth transition from a drug induced teen in Traffic to a sexually induced teen with eerie precision.  In the end this is not a bad film it just isn't all that good of one either. It could have been brilliant and showed signs of success within the first half but then fell flat on its face. But hey feel free to pick up a copy of this film kick back and enjoy it because after all as a misunderstood teen you disserve it.".

I am having a hard time deciphering whether this is a story of revenge longing for something missing or downright blatant sadomasochism either way it was bound to fall flat sooner or later. This is a film that walks the thin line between atmospheric and ludicrous with results that are sometimes creepy and sometimes provide for a good unintentional laugh riot.

I must admit that when I first saw this movie I did not know that this was from a book.  It wasn't until 15 years later that I read the book and it confirmed my statement that the movie kept the story intact.As far as the acting was concerned I have to admire a cast that had to convey throughout an entire script in a totally different language and manage to keep it consistent.  Watching the film you can see that certain gestures always mean the same thing as well as certain grunts and sounds. Folks that is the result of a lot of hard work and to put down that part of the film is like looking at the Empire State Building as just the result of an erector set.The basic story of the movie is to show prejudice against what is new and not understood.  Ayla's presence is meant to show the Clan what the future holds which is the underlying reason why they fear and hate her though they are unaware of the reasons.  Ayla endures many trials throughout the movie in order to gain their trust and approval which ultimately prepare her for a journey into the world without the Clan.A movie worth watching again and again.  The book is great also by the way so I recommend them both.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the movie lacks anything it is the beauty of the photography in films like Quest for Fire and Windwalker. Otherwise I can't find any serious flaws. It is rare to find a decent movie about prehistoric peoples. Quest for Fire is the best movie of this kind in my opinion but Clan of the Cave Bear is a close second.I am not trying to compare Cave Bear to the books by Jean M. Auel. To me the film takes the best part of Auel's story and makes a pretty good movie. The later Auel stories become more romance novel fodder and to some that may be more entertaining. Clan of the Cave Bear is not romantic. It captures the brutality of prehistory very well for a fiction film. I've seen documentaries about the Neanderthal and was surprised how accurately Cave Bear showed that time. The flaws in human nature are shown in all their rawness in this movie. There is prejudice oppression and abuse in full force. What makes it bearable for me is how the Darryl Hannah character is able to deal with this and eventually over come it.Cave Bear also shows some of the ritual of stone age culture with the Shaman and the hunting rites of passage. There is some beauty in that culture. But the bottom line for these people is survival and that was a very difficult thing to accomplish. They were scratching and clawing literally just to eat and raise children. And sadly we know that they are doomed except for a few Neanderthals who possibly interbred with CroMagnons.This kind of documentary approach in Cave Bear will not thrill those who want a stone age comedyromance Caveman or a special effects absurdity of prehistoric people fighting lots of dinosaurs One Million BC which is historically impossible. But if you can appreciate an intense story of a young woman's survival in the wild and her experience with a lost stone age culture then I recommend Clan of the Cave Bear. 910".

Clan of the Cave Bear is not romantic. It captures the brutality of prehistory very well for a fiction film. I've seen documentaries about the Neanderthal and was surprised how accurately Cave Bear showed that time. The flaws in human nature are shown in all their rawness in this movie. There is prejudice oppression and abuse in full force. What makes it bearable for me is how the Darryl Hannah character is able to deal with this and eventually over come it.Cave Bear also shows some of the ritual of stone age culture with the Shaman and the hunting rites of passage. There is some beauty in that culture. But the bottom line for these people is survival and that was a very difficult thing to accomplish. They were scratching and clawing literally just to eat and raise children. And sadly we know that they are doomed except for a few Neanderthals who possibly interbred with CroMagnons.This kind of documentary approach in Cave Bear will not thrill those who want a stone age comedyromance Caveman or a special effects absurdity of prehistoric people fighting lots of dinosaurs One Million BC which is historically impossible. But if you can appreciate an intense story of a young woman's survival in the wild and her experience with a lost stone age culture then I recommend Clan of the Cave Bear. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "The popularity of DVD has exploded the past couple of years like no new entertainment technology before. We are seeing more and more older films released on DVD for a pittance like this one Clan of the Cave Bear which I purchased for under 6US. There isn't much sound in this film but the images all shot in British Columbia come through really well.The setting in time is prehistoric during the brief overlap of the Neanderthal and CroMagnon humans. Ayla Daryl Hannah a very blonde CroMagnon was orphaned as a small girl wounded and found by the darkhaired Cave Bear Clan of Neanderthals. Against the wishes of the leader she is taken in and nursed back to health by the medicine woman. As she grows up we see that she is innately smarter than her adopted family learns things quickly begins to innovate. The Neanderthals are portrayed as if they had perhaps an IQ of 80 while Ayla certainly has an IQ of 120 to 140. This causes difficulties for her because the women are totally subserviant and one of them showing smarts or initiative is punished. A woman who even touches a hunting weapon is sentenced to die. But when Ayla does to defend a tribesman she is only exiled in the winter and if she survives allowed to come back. She does but finally realizes her spirit is different and leaves to look for her own kind. After she fights and defeats the young alpha male who earlier had raped her thus giving her a child.Some critics scoff at the primative community portrayed here but it in fact is very accurate. In the DVD commentary we learn that much of the design for this film came from watching a few crude videotapes that were actually made by the CroMagnons during that prehistoric period and were discovered wellpreserved in far northern subfreezing caves in the 1960s. Not surprisingly they were in the Beta format.The whole film is about acceptance of someone different and of change. This is a common theme in many many films over the years and is closely related to the popular Pleasantville of 1998. What makes this one different and enjoyable is the setting in time the depiction of community values of these prehistoric peoples. I rate it highly overall.".

All in all It is a nice movie to watch. It tugs at your heartstings seeing all of the brutal honesty presented on screen. And that music! Oh I was the Niagra Falls from the beautiful music.  The most heartbreaking scene of this movie is when Ayla is separated from her mother at 2 from a vicious earthquake.

	schema:reviewBody "I have read Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel several times and I have listened to it on book tape as well.The book is magnificent. It is not high English Literature but it is facepaced engaging thorough realistic and very well researched. I have also read the Valley of Horses and the rest of the Earth's Children Series. However I put Shelters of Stone down because is pales in comparison to her earlier work in Clan of the Cave Bear and Valley of Horses.When I heard a movie had been made I was both curious and concerned. Curious because I really enjoy the story and the prehistory genre  concerned because the vast majority of film adaptations from books are really disappointing.I really enjoy this film and I now include it in my DVD collection.The writers and directors did a very brave and wise thing by subtitling the language of the Clan rather than making the big dumb cavemen speak some form of grunting English. They captured the dignity culture and subtly of the Neanderthals as they were portrayed in Auel's novel they didn't look like raging men in cheap gorilla suits as they did in Quest for Fire. What could not really be captured was the depth of herb lore and knowledge possessed by Clan it would not have made for exciting film if a lengthy explanation of plants were included.I thought Hanna did an excellent job. The reason why they could not use a teenaged girl was most likely the height factor. Ayla is supposed to tower over even the largest man of the clan big and ugly. It would have been very difficult to find a teenager who could not only ACT convincingly in such trying conditions but who would be tall enough in comparison to the Neanderthals.The rape scene is horrible but is realistic and it was necessary to include it. It is a pivotal point in the novel a moment in time when Ayla's spirit could have been shattered she suffers as a result and is the stronger for it. I would not let children watch it though for that scene.The hunting scene is very well done it is real and tense and true to the book so are the clan gathering and the sacrifice of the Cave Bear.I do not understand how a fan of the book could dislike the movie.Spoiler The only things I disapprove of are the end when Ayla leaves and the lack of explanation of Clan memories. In the book Creb dies and Ayla is cast out of the Clan with her loved ones huddled together under the tyrannical leadership of Broud which is what would have happened to a people who had become incapable of adapting. There was no satisfying reprimand from Brun ripping the leadership away from his son Broud. The ending is way too Hollywood and pink and I do not know why they bothered to change it. The film is real and gritty throughout why fluff it at the end? The vision of the shared memories that Ayla and Creb have at the Clan gathering is NOT the same as it is in the book. The vision in the book shows the journey through time from the primordial beginnings of life on Earth to the technological future and possible end. It is the main message of Earth's Children In my opinion and it is unfortunate that it was altered in this otherwise very meticulous film.I am very pleased that the film was made and I am disappointed that it did not get better reviews at the time it deserved much better. It is quiet and patient and authentic. Real animals are used no overthetop musical scores are employed subtitles and gestures are very well done casting and costumes are detailed and the camera shots are long and unhurried. It captures the raw nature of the time.Although I would be pleased to see Valley of Horses made into a film to see Thonolan and Jondalar and the rest of the interesting characters and wrenching moments depicted I hope that a sequel is NOT made unless someone who is true to the books bothers to pick up the project.Most Hollywood movies are really awful nowadays and I would doubt that a studio and filmmaking team would be able to do it justice with the cast and the budget and the patience they would need to do it right.".

Yes there are a lot of Pleasures scenes in the books Yes they could have been done without but that doesn't mean that the rest of the story is not worth reading.

I was more upset that the movie didn't even maintain a SEMBLANCE to the book other than the character's name almost as if the director skimmed the book and took pieces from sections without thinking about how they would go together.".

To the above commenter who said that the subsequent books were all romance fodder first Valley was not it wasn't until the end that most of the pleasures were added with small intermittent scenes throughout. Yes there are a lot of Pleasures scenes in the books Yes they could have been done without but that doesn't mean that the rest of the story is not worth reading. That is not what I am writing a review on however. I was more upset that the movie didn't even maintain a SEMBLANCE to the book other than the character's name almost as if the director skimmed the book and took pieces from sections without thinking about how they would go together.";

I thought it was really good but advice to anyone is READ THE BOOK! The story is absolutely captivating and involving from the start. Darryl Hannah is a good Ayla if not a little old  she is supposed to be 12! and the film does well with the language problem. The hand signals are good and there aren't too many subtitles. I really like the music as well. I think this is a good attempt at summarising Jean Auel's work  which is really very difficult to film successfully  But summary is the right word so you are really missing out until you read the novel  there is so much more to it I think the film could be a little longer  it is a 800 page book! Even though it doesn't live up to the book it's still really good fun to see. I also think that a film of her later books would be a success  especially as the language isn't a problem then. My sister watched it before reading the book and she was hooked so it's definitely a success whether you are familiar or otherwise with this compelling story. I think it's a real shame that it's deleted in the UK! It should be on TV more often so people have a chance to watch it.On the whole I would advise any fan who is prepared to be openminded to watch it  you are in for a treat. If you are just going to nitpick about the plot  Forget It!".

She's perfect for the part. I found it very interesting her struggle to be accepted by the clan. Not only did she have to deal with being an outcast because she was CroMagnon but also because she was female. And although she proved herself worthy of acceptance many times she was still rejected. Rejected out of fear. CroMagnons had a larger brain capacity than the Neanderthals and her intelligence caused great fear. CroMagnons were also much more athletically agile which was another threat.Very good movie.".

I've seen this film a couple of times and am not really thrilled by it but I also don't have too many criticisms of it either.If I were to point my finger at one aspect of the film an aspect that I thought was holding back a better movie I'd have to place my finger on its direction.  The actors are in earnest of their performances and do their absolute best to give us a paleolithic saga but the director points both story and performances to a high energy commercial film.  For myself the performances though genuine aren't natural.  They're forced and that's no fault of the actors.This combined with poor light design and mediocre cinematography really torpedos what could've been a better film.  And for a film supposedly shot in 70mm every viewing I've ever seen has the film shaking in the gate a great deal.  Not to mention the number of hot spots from reflectors bouncing sunlight onto the actors.  The nail in the visual coffin is the color timing.  The upside is that the location selected was quite impressive though the film never conveys the geographic location it's supposed to be.The notion of a blond haired beauty adopted into quite literally a lowbrow tribe is fair enough.  But the fact that she's superior and blond puts a wry knowing smile on this viewer's face.  Then again it is Hollywood so the sappiness is probably there by design.  It's also somewhat ironic that a woman narrator one with a seemingly African accent helps convey the story of a blond heroine.  It just seems silly to me.I've never read the book so I can't comment on the adaptation.  However I will say this I found many of the plot points implausible contrived and just plain outright wrong as well as disconnected from what is known or at least believed to be understood about our ancestors.If you must see a caveman epic then do yourselves a favor and pop Quest for Fire into the video machine of your choice.  Clan of the Cavebear is watchable but not overly great.  I might call it an above average flick but by no means exceeding.Watch at your own risk.".

Having recently bought it on DVD as an adult I can honestly say the film still looks great but the film makers took a powerful epic story and turned it into a one dimensional piece of fluff that never succeeds in enthralling us. I have always been a huge fan of Daryl Hannah and though she really seems to be doing her best here I believe she was miss cast. Ayla was meant to be a young teenage girl  Daryl was far too old. The fault here of course is not with Daryl but with the Director and Producers. The main saving grace of the film is the cinematography  it looks beautiful and must have been a difficult film to light considering it all had to look natural and ambient. The DVD release was aweful  it wasn't in widescreen and looked little better than video. It was released by 'Force Video' never heard of em' and didn't even feature a scene selection function. I know that Jean M. Auel was not entirely happy with the film I wrote to her once and was thrilled to receive a letter back from her some of it even hand written by her! so perhaps one day the entire series of 'Earth's Children' books could be made into a miniseries for television.".

Even though I've never read the novel it still has that feel to it.To be honest at first I really didn't think I'd care for it but the acting is good and the story very good as well.As far as 'accurate' I don't think anyone can claim it is or it isn't considering that the only clue we have that people even existed at that age in history is a few bones and other circumstantial conjecture. I do suppose there was a time between humans being raw animalistic and 'civilized'. Even though 'civilized' is still a stretch for humanity even now in 2011.It's not the BEST movie I've seen but it left me wanting to see more which few films do so I'll give it a 10 just for that along with the acting and story. There were a couple twists in the film that I wasn't quite ready for seeing it for the first time which also strikes me as it's rare that I can't predict 80 of the movie just because the stories are so clich. I can't say I've seen a new movie including Avatar that wasn't pretty much wholly predictable.".

It strikes me as reasonably credible anthropologically and its message about the value of human intelligence and initiative is positive and valid. Primitivism is not idealised but shown as what it is  a set of obstacles. It's also in the great and good tradition of entertaining Hollywood films about prehistory starring babes e.g. 2000 Years B.C. Another interesting aspect of these films is the approach to language and I like the subtitle solution. I should mention that the cast are good as well as Daryll Hannah.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Jean M. Auel's novel Clan of the Cave Bear is essentially a Tarzan premise only instead of apes our protagonist the young Cromagnon girl Ayla is raised by a clan of Neanderthals in Ice Age Europe of 35 000 years ago. This was around the time when the two species first came into contact.Critics say never expect a history lesson from Hollywood how about a prehistory lesson? Compared to Quest for Fire this movie is somewhat subpar but next to last year's 10 000 b.c with dreadlocks and horses this film is the Godfather. There are still some scientific inaccuracies however. For example it is made clear that the Neadanderthals forbid women to use weapons but science has proved that not only did Neanderthal women participate in hunts but it was one of the reasons for the demise of the species. In the earliest social units our own species divided the workload based on gender leading to a more organized better prepared society men hunt women sow make clothing and make tools. Neanderthals while they were good hunters did not lead such organized lives. What bothers me most about Clan of the Cave Bear is not the scientific errors but the way the story is told. It kind of plods along with no general sense of direction. Quite noticeably the editing is sloppy and the transition between scenes is awkward.Some of the other challenges however are executed with competence. There are numerous fights with Ice Age animals including muskox lions wolves and bears. Anyone who knows the film process will know that working with animals is a challenge of epic proportions. To make it even more difficult most of these scenes are shot in forest and challenging terrain to set up camera and gear in. Animals tend to get restless when in such conditions. These scenes are pretty much the only parts where the film has the skill to scale to a good level of drama and tension. Quite frankly most of the picture is just dull. It occasionally offers moments of charm and rising tension but The Clan of The Cave Bear doesn't really come alive. It is neither a complete failure nor a success but if you are looking for adventure or education you'll only find a little of either here.".

I know that movies based on books are rarely as good as said book but this is intense.  The movie cuts adds changes and mishmashes things together all of which is at a detriment to the story line I know some part of that is grammatically incorrect.  The movie loses all the depth and subtlety of Ms. Auel's novel and it miscasts Darryl Hannah.  Don't get me wrong she's a fine actress but she was also way to old to play the leading character.

I never saw the 1980 version of this and when I heard Disney was going to redo it I expected the worst. Fortunately I was wrong. Disney made a quiet beautiful charming fantasy film. They don't overdo the sentimentality as they could have and make the story quite moving and engrossing.This is also a rare film where virtually every performance is goodespecially Bledel and Jackson. But Sissy Spacek William Hurt Amy Irving and Scott Bairstrow also turn in very good acting. And Elisabeth Shue narrates and does an excellent job.This is beautifulwelldirected and acted with a sweeping music score. I was captivated from beginning to end. This failed at the box office but it really should be rediscovered. I give it a 10!".

I never saw the 1980 version of this and when I heard Disney was going to redo it I expected the worst. Fortunately I was wrong. Disney made a quiet beautiful charming fantasy film. They don't overdo the sentimentality as they could have and make the story quite moving and engrossing.This is also a rare film where virtually every performance is goodespecially Bledel and Jackson. But Sissy Spacek William Hurt Amy Irving and Scott Bairstrow also turn in very good acting. And Elisabeth Shue narrates and does an excellent job.This is beautifulwelldirected and acted with a sweeping music score. I was captivated from beginning to end. This failed at the box office but it really should be rediscovered. I give it a 10!";

A fine cast does great work and Ben Kingsley has a field day playing the mysterious Man In The Yellow Suit. The film is a little slow going in the beginning but all the strands and backstory must be laid out and once it gets going  the film moves with a beauty and tenderness that is rare. The music score is lovely as is the cinematography but overall the message of the movie is what is special  it is not how LONG we live but HOW we live. A beautiful film  for kids 9 and up.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Tuck Everlasting' is one of those sweet movies with a lot of flaws you don't care about. You could ask question after question but I did not find a reason to do so. The story about an immortal family and a young teenager that comes into their lives is probably a well known story for some audiences but I didn't know it. The immortal family exists out of father Angus Tuck William Hurt mother Mae Sissy Spacek and two sons named Miles Scott Bairstow and Jesse Jonathan Jackson. The young teenager who is taken by the family so she can not reveal their secret is Winnie Foster Alexis Bledel.Although at first the family thinks Winnie needs to be killed things change when Jesse Tuck and Winnie start to have feeling for one another. Winnie becomes a new member of the family. In the mean while we have Winnie's parents played by Amy Irving and Victor Garber looking for her. A man in a yellow suit Ben Kingsley is actually looking for the Tuck family but thinks he will find the girl with them as well. He knows how the Tucks have found their immortality and has plans for himself.You can probably understand how many flaws a movie like this must have. There a couple of reasons we don't really want to ask too many questions. First of all it is a good thing the movie keeps the attention in the middle of everything. It does not really focus on the reason of immortality it does not really focus on the relationship between Jesse and Winnie and it does not really focus on the outsiders like Winnie's parents and the Kingsleycharacter. Although that is not a good thing in most movies it works perfectly here.Another reason you don't want to ask questions is Alexis Bledel together with Jonathan Jackson. They are sweet together have some nice scenes. Although you sometimes see the Rory Gilmore of 'The Gilmore Girls' Bledel does a nice job with her Winnie Foster. Jonathan Jackson who I only know from a small part in 'Insomnia' is a good choice for Jesse. This and three other respectable actors like Hurt Spacek and Kingsley make sure the movie does not fail on that level.All this together with a very nice score and some beautiful images make this a very good movie. It is perfect for the whole family. If you can forget the flaws forget the question you might have you must be able to fully enjoy this.".

There were a few changes that surprised me. For example in the book Miles is a mild mannered person. In the movie he's extremely bitter because of what happened to him due to his immortality. Sorry no spoilers It was a good change.The casting was amazing. Alexis Bledel plays Winnie Foster. Like Rory on Gilmore Girls Winnie is very serious but wants to have fun. William Hurt didn't strike me as someone old and wise but he portrays Angus Tuck very well. Sissy Spacek was great as Mae Tuck showing her character's motherly side toward Winnie.Ben Kingsley plays the Man in the Yellow Suit TMITYS. TMITYS is a great villain in the same league as Lex Luthor. He has no superpowers but his mere presence can send super humans immortals running for cover. In the book he's a vague character. He doesn't even seem to be a villain until later in the book. All we know is that he wants to find the Tucks and their spring. In the movie TMITYS is presented as a villain and we find out more about what he wants and how he knows about the Tucks. Bravo Mr. Kingsley!One last thought... I know I said 'no spoilers' so I'll be as discreet as I can. Don't let the ending disappoint you. I told my cousin the end of the movie and she said it was a terrible ending. It wasn't terrible. One character just made a choice. I strongly recommend this movie to people of all ages.".

Of all the liveaction films that Walt Disney produced in his lifetime one he was very proud of was the 1960 POLLYANNA and TUCK EVERLASTING reminded me of POLLYANNA in several key aspects. Like POLLYANNA TUCK has a meticulous attention to period details it takes place in 1914. Also like POLLYANNA it has some highpowered acting talent in peripheral roles with the main focus of the story on younger less wellknown actors. The cinematography is beautiful with a rich interplay of light and shadow and to best appreciate this aspect you should try to see it in a theater with the brightest picture available. Like another classic children's book CHARLOTTE'S WEB TUCK EVERLASTING explores philosophical concepts of life and death and eternity that most adult films much less children's films ever touch on. I hope that TUCK doesn't end up comparable to POLLYANNA in one key area lack of boxoffice success. Walt was extremely disappointed when despite the loving attention he garnished on the film audiences for the most part stayed away. TUCK EVERLASTING deserves to be  a huge success. Hollywood has come under frequent criticism for not making enough familyfriendly films but it seems that when a rich intelligent film does come out it's ignored.

Otherwise the story is not changed all that much but there are still a few minor changes to the story that I could remember.Most of the cast was perfect. Ben Kingsley fits the role of The Man in the Yellow Suit pretty well. Out of place kinda are Sissy Spacek and William Hurt who have the minority roles in this film. They were still quite good though.The story flows nicely but there were still a few scenes that were different as I had envisioned. I pictured the Treegap Constable having a bigger role and I also envisioned there to be more 19th century costume and prop designs. Just some things to be kept in mind when the next remake of this novel comes out in another thirty years or so.TUCK EVERLASTING 45.".

Whether intentional or not I think that this movie helps send out a message that No matter what type of life was dealt you you can still make the most out of it if you only put a little effort into it. Though set in the early 20th Century the story makes you forget about the differences of then and now there's no need to depend on a supposedly 'wiser' individual to clear up the things that you don't understand. Because it was a period movie the dialog was written to be accurate of that time and it was well done in my opinion. But it was laid out in such a way that the audience specifically the younger ones can easily accept the language has being relatively close to their own.This movie was a complete masterpiece from beginning to end. The performances can be summed up in one word Beautiful. This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again and it never gets old. I am very proud to have this movie in my collection which I'm sad and almost ashamed to say doesn't have a lot family films included in it. Perhaps in the future more movies will come along that are worthy enough to be labeled A Great Family Film!".

This film shows you the joy of life and how you might use it share it or what it will cost you if you can't share it or live it with loved ones. It also causes you to reconsider the idea of being forever youngparticularly if that were to happen but not by choice.The advice the dad gives in the boat scene with Winnie is thought provoking William Hurt in one of his best roles. Cissy Spacek is also excellent as mother Tuck. By the end of the film Winnie has seen a lot and gets to make an amazing and mature choice that obviously guides the rest of her life. In a sense she is way ahead of Jesse Tuck now.The performances are all good particularly those who play the Tucks. All of the characters are more or less interesting or amusing but the romance and the wisdom that come of Winnie's meeting with the Tuck family are inspiring and lifechanging. The performances of the entire castand the lifestory demonstrated by each charactercontribute to Winnie's dramatic acceptance of the natural decision she must make.All the characters in the filmall but the eerie Man in Yellow brilliantly played by Ben Kingsleyagree that life is about family. Winnie learns it is also about being able to experience different periods in your own development and changes in your own perspective. An interesting What if Tuck Everlasting is a great movie that helps us think about what we want in life and about who we are. This is the kind of movie you will want to watch once a year.".

The adaptation of the story is superficial and those among us that seem to think the movie portrays rounded characters just haven't seen enough movies and certainly haven't read this novel. The length of the film alone 88 min. can tell you that it is impossible to look into their souls. Jesse is the happy brother who wants to live and falls in love with Winnifred his first love in a 104 years ?? Miles is the angry brother who wants to die. His wife ran away from him with their two children because she didn't want to drink from the fountain of youth because she thinks it's the devil's work and thus let their daughter Anna die of pneumonia at 15. Shouldn't he be just a little mad at her as well??? The father is the wise old man. He must be about a 150 and his sons are 104 and about a 115. They should be wise old men themselves by now. Or are we to believe that as the body doesn't grow older the mind doesn't either ? The mother is just the mother loving and caring and protecting her family when she should. The man that hunts the Tucks is a Tuck himself. He's Miles his grandson but all he's interested in is making money of the spring. Noone else seems to care that he's family as well. Winnifred's character is the worst of all. She's a 10 year old trapped in a young woman's body. The other characters I won't even mention because they are even flatter than the above mentioned main characters from this weak screenplay. It's a very bad adaptation of Natalie Babbit's wonderful novel. In the book our naive Winnifred really is 10 years old. That's why she and Jesse only kiss. JEFFREY LIEBER the one who is RESPONSIBLE for this bad screenplay just was to lazy or lacks the talent to let the actions of Winnifred fit the age he has given her or was ordered by the studio to give her. This explains why the young woman in this film takes the challenge of playing some stickball in the beginning of the movie and why at the end of the movie she runs back to daddy instead of following her first true love. All and all the cinematography the acting and the ending make up for the very very very bad screenplay but not enough to change my mind about this film. It's just more infantile Hollywoodpulp that murdered a wonderful story. The 1980 British adaptation of this children's novel was a better one......".

Winifred Foster Alexis Bledel is eager to live without the control of her parents Amy Irving Victor Garber. They own much of the forest. Winnie encounters Jesse in the woods drinking from a special spring. Miles kidnaps her back to the Tuck homestead.It's a fine comingofage romance. It's very PG. It doesn't have great tension or more importantly magic. This needs a sprinkle of that Disney magic. The young couple's romance is not that compelling and they are limited in the amount of heat. Their chemistry is strictly overwrought puppy love. There is a chance for a compelling ending reveal but the big reveal in the movie is not that compelling. It tries a little poetry and leaves it less than satisfying.".

In 2002 when the film was releasedwe are now passed the industrial age and into the age of communication.You know someone would find out and post it on the web.The secret of the Tucks is that they've found the secret of immortality in a spring located deep in the woods where they've settled. The family is parentsWilliam Hurt and Sissy Spacek and sons the brooding Scott Bairstow and theeternally youthful Jonathan Jackson.The property however is owned by Victor Garber and Amy Irving and they'vegot a daughter Alexis Bledel whom they keep most sheltered.

Kingsley has heard rumors of this fountain of youth and immortality and he's here to find it and exploit it as he feels thatonly certain people should enjoy immortality. As the film builds Kingsley grows more evil and more serpentine he will really creep you out.This film bears comparison to the Highlander movies and TV series and a bit ofcomparison to Sean Connery's science fiction classic Zardoz.

Having just seen that a few weeks ago I Revisited the movie and slowly remember what has Enchanted me when I seen this years ago. Jonathan Jackson the handsome and innocentlooking Lucky Spencer from General Hospital is the innocent young boy who is older than he seems. In the opening scene he drives up to an old southern mansion on a motorcycle and the film flashes back many years to when he had first met the heroine Alexis Biedel whom he fell in love with.Do not fear death but only the unloved life. that is the theme for the book two movies and the new Broadway musical. It occurs in the woods in the back of the Foster mansion in the self where Jackson's father William Hurt and mother Sissy Spacek make their home hiding out because they are destined to live forever. Jackson falls in love with Biedel whom his older brother is forced to kidnap when she discovers the secret and the presence of a mysterious Man in the Yellow Suit Ben Kingsley threatens to destroy their hiding place and reveal the secret giving the potential of making them into freaks. Moving performances by the entire cast which includes Amy Irving as the heroine's mother and Victor Garber as her father make this truly worth watching as does the very direct way that the screenplay presents the story.I've always been a Sissy Spacek fan and she is totally lovely as the kindly mother who takes Biedel under her wing as if she were her own daughter. William Hurt who has played his share of villains and heroes is wise and humble as Jackson's father who provides the film's moral. Along with Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin in Edward Ecissorhands these two rank as the best surrogate parents in film history. Kingsley makes a great villain his character amply described in the musical as an evil banana. While this lacks certain elements from the novel and the musical it moves briskly and makes its point which I have greatly accepted a life well lived needs an ending and hopefully you go out with applause and thumbs up for a job well done.".

Bob Hoskins stole every scene he was in. Stanley Tucci chewed scenery. Natasha Richardson was suitably selfish and blonde. New York was lovely. The dog overacted shamelessly. The movie was not perfect but it was delightful. The only wrong note was the series of magazine covers at the end showing what happened to the characters it was much too cute and rather unbelievable all three of her maid friends become hotel managers?

The kid Ty was great and Bob Hoskins was wonderful.I think Pygmalian Pretty Woman is a better story and Julia Roberts is obviously head and shoulders above Jennifer Lopez but I certainly don't regret adding it to my Netflix queue!Van";

Unjust I feel when you go to see this movie or rent it I assume you know that it's a romantic movie? By the title of the movie you could very much assume that it's a feel good movie. So when you bring these 2 together you pretty much know what's gonna happen if you read the back of the movie box. Why rent it then? For it's purpose it makes you feel good. Two people falling in love is always a nice thing and seeing how they cross boundary's for that love is even nicer. Thus I think that the movie succeeded in what he was made for. To give people the romance and the good feeling. Go see this movie with your girlboyfriend if he or she doesn't dislike this kind of movies and sure you will feel happier about your own relationship as well. Because there is nothing heavy about this movie. That's what makes it so good in his genre. Do not watch this movie for super acting skills although I do not dislike the acting. Do not go and see him for the directors special thricks to tell you things. Go see this movie for the romance and positive note and for sure you will not be disappointed.".

I don't understand how something so thoughtless tasteless and utterly unredeeming could get made in Manhattan Hollywood or anywhere else. Somebody should tell Jennifer Lopez that she's not Audrey Hepburn or Jean Arthur. There is a sort of hardness about her that makes her antiromantic. Her wardrobe as the Maid of the title is utterly insane. As is every attempt at sincerity. I'm sure Jennifer Lopez has talent but not certainly for romantic comedies. She keeps making them though.

	schema:headline " All the way back to Cinderella and beyond.";
	schema:reviewBody "Was Jennifer Lopez going through an I want to be Julia Roberts phase in 2002? That was the year in which she made Enough a shameless ripoff of Sleeping with the Enemy and followed it up with Maid in Manhattan which bears a certain resemblance to another Roberts film Pretty Woman.Like Pretty Woman this is a romantic comedy based upon a poor girl loves rich man storyline. The poor girl is Marisa Ventura a divorce with a tenyearold son working as a maid in a smart Manhattan hotel. The rich man is Christopher Marshall scion of a wealthy family and senatorial candidate staying as a guest in the hotel. Chris is unexpectedly a Republican a detail presumably inserted in a bid to dispel those persistent rumours that Hollywood's main function is to act as the Democratic Party's amen corner. The two meet and are attracted to one another but owing to a misunderstanding Chris believes that Marisa is Caroline Lane a wealthy British socialite who is another guest at the hotel. Chris invites Caroline Lane to lunch but he is confused when the real Caroline shows up instead of Marisa. Further complications ensue including the real Caroline taking a fancy to Chris and Marisa losing her job but this being a romcom we know that true love will prevail in the end.Jennifer Lopez has some dreadful films on her CV especially the badlywritten badlyacted and thoroughly nasty Enough and the hilariously bad Anaconda a sort of fifties monster movie resurrected for the nineties. I must admit I have never seen Gigli widely quoted as being the nadir of her career if it is worse than either of those films it must be bad indeed. Maid in Manhattan however is one of her better performances not least because she enunciates all her lines clearly something which is not always the case with her and makes Marisa hardworking determined and caring a very likable heroine.Rather surprisingly Ralph Fiennes who is often at his best playing villainous characters as in Schindler's List or The Duchess makes an equally likable hero. The rather reserved Chris seems more like an English gentleman than an American politician there is perhaps a hint that his desire for a seat in the Senate owes more to family tradition than to ideological commitment both his father and grandfather were Senators before him. The real political animal is his frantically hyperactive spin doctor Jerry played by Stanley Tucci who had played a rather similar role the previous year in America's Sweethearts. There is an amusing if somewhat onedimensional contribution from Natasha Richardson as the spoilt bitchy Caroline. The acting honours were stolen however by young Tyler Posey utterly delightful as Marisa's son Ty who plays a key role in bringing his mother and Chris together. Ty is a budding intellectual who has become something of an expert on the 1970s especially the presidency of Richard Nixon.I don't think that Maid in Manhattan is as good as Pretty Woman which had rather more in the way of character development and psychological depth. Garry Marshall's film gained a bit of extra edge by making its heroine a prostitute and its hero a businessman suffering a crisis of conscience about his lessthanethical business methods. Marisa and Chris by comparison are just a bit too nice right from the beginning. Yet the film as a whole is an enjoyable one if not a particularly original one. Besides Pretty Woman it also owes a debt to the Audrey HepburnHumphrey Bogart Sabrina and to countless other films plays novels and stories all the way back to Cinderella and beyond. Yet this lack of originality does not necessarily matter in a romantic comedy the genre after all is a highly formulaic one which relies upon a few wellworn plots. What matters is the way in which the basic idea is developed and Maid in Manhattan handles its theme with wit and humour. It's not exactly a realistic film either but then romcoms were never intended to be exercises in realism. It will provide enjoyable viewing for anyone looking for something romantic and escapist. 610".

	onyx:emotionText "Was Jennifer Lopez going through an I want to be Julia Roberts phase in 2002? That was the year in which she made Enough a shameless ripoff of Sleeping with the Enemy and followed it up with Maid in Manhattan which bears a certain resemblance to another Roberts film Pretty Woman.Like Pretty Woman this is a romantic comedy based upon a poor girl loves rich man storyline. The poor girl is Marisa Ventura a divorce with a tenyearold son working as a maid in a smart Manhattan hotel. The rich man is Christopher Marshall scion of a wealthy family and senatorial candidate staying as a guest in the hotel. Chris is unexpectedly a Republican a detail presumably inserted in a bid to dispel those persistent rumours that Hollywood's main function is to act as the Democratic Party's amen corner. The two meet and are attracted to one another but owing to a misunderstanding Chris believes that Marisa is Caroline Lane a wealthy British socialite who is another guest at the hotel. Chris invites Caroline Lane to lunch but he is confused when the real Caroline shows up instead of Marisa. Further complications ensue including the real Caroline taking a fancy to Chris and Marisa losing her job but this being a romcom we know that true love will prevail in the end.Jennifer Lopez has some dreadful films on her CV especially the badlywritten badlyacted and thoroughly nasty Enough and the hilariously bad Anaconda a sort of fifties monster movie resurrected for the nineties. I must admit I have never seen Gigli widely quoted as being the nadir of her career if it is worse than either of those films it must be bad indeed. Maid in Manhattan however is one of her better performances not least because she enunciates all her lines clearly something which is not always the case with her and makes Marisa hardworking determined and caring a very likable heroine.Rather surprisingly Ralph Fiennes who is often at his best playing villainous characters as in Schindler's List or The Duchess makes an equally likable hero. The rather reserved Chris seems more like an English gentleman than an American politician there is perhaps a hint that his desire for a seat in the Senate owes more to family tradition than to ideological commitment both his father and grandfather were Senators before him. The real political animal is his frantically hyperactive spin doctor Jerry played by Stanley Tucci who had played a rather similar role the previous year in America's Sweethearts. There is an amusing if somewhat onedimensional contribution from Natasha Richardson as the spoilt bitchy Caroline. The acting honours were stolen however by young Tyler Posey utterly delightful as Marisa's son Ty who plays a key role in bringing his mother and Chris together.

Yes he had some really sweet lines but they would have been so much sweeter if delivered from a heart breaker like Matthew McConaughey Hugh Jackman or Johnny Dep. Everytime he smiled I thought he looked like he was about to slash her thoat not saying that would have been a bad thing The sweetest part of the movie was the stuffed penguin.They didn't have a drop of chemistry. But all in all it wasn't TOO bad.

Yeah it has minor flaws here and there this isn't movie of the year but over all I would say that it was pretty cute.Marisa is a single mom in Manhattan who is a working maid in one of the top hotels. She is also up for a big promotion as a manager and is hoping to help her fellow employees. When she and a coworker are just fooling around and wondering what it's like to try on over 5000 dollars worth of clothes Marisa gets caught by a politician who her son is excited to meet. She has to convince him that nothing can happen between them without letting him know what she did and who she really is but it might be too strong of a connection for both of them to let go so easily.Maid in Manhattan is predictable and I think Marisa's character wasn't really as developed as I would like her to be because she came off as kinda rude and judgmental. But over all I wouldn't say this is a 4.5 rated movie I think people were probably just jumping on the movie because it is Jennifer Lopez I would agree I'm not into her either but I can't resist if I do like a movie or not and I wanna be honest if I like a movie.

Most of the extra forceful reviews of Sweet Home Alabama are the professional and amateur reviewers that try to tell us stay away this is a waste of your time do not see it. Bulldinkey! They are just crying wolf for some unknown reason. This is a fine funny movie that relies more on an ensemble cast than just on Reese Witherspoon. The writing is smart and funny the directing fits the comedic mood of the story and the acting is just right.  Although it is a quite different film from Legally Blonde and Election I enjoyed it just as much and will enjoy it upon repeat viewings.no SPOILERS here...Critic Ebert has a good summary of the story so I won't repeat any of it here.  For those who may see the film and wonder how much the small town life is exaggerated let me tell you not much!  I grew up in a very small southern town and I go back on occasions for high school reunions. What is depicted in this film is pretty darned close to reality with some license taken for making the story a bit more interesting. Pay special attention to the story with the cat and its burned tail and watch closely at the end. The DVD is fine but the picture is not reference quality. The sound is Dolby 5.1 but surround channels are not very dynamic.  The extras has several deleted scenes and also includes the original ending that was scrapped after comments from test screenings. They had to reshoot and I think the eventual ending is very appropriate. The first and last scenes complement each other very well.Sweet Home Alabama  a fine movie for those who enjoy a good comedy and especially those who like Reese Witherspoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot envision anyone but Reese Witherspoon as Melanie a snootybutlovable upandcoming New York City fashion designer from Alabama who receives a marriage proposal from the prominent wellbred son of the mayor of New York. Of course this means that she must go back to the small town where she was raised to demand a divorce from Jake Josh Lucas  seven years after walking out on him. Aside from being a love story this film shows us that you cannot escape your past no matter how hard you try. Everywhere she turns Reese's character is beset by the people and events of her youth. Old friends seem almost compelled to reminisce about their youthful escapades. She just cannot seem to get away from it. You really get a sense of how she must feel when you see her in the honkytonk bar surrounded by rednecks with no visible exit.Witherspoon is right at home in the role as a smart sassy young woman ala 'Legally Blonde'. However the real star of the show is Josh Lucas. His expressive face lends an authenticity to Jake that transcends the stereotypical former football star and produces a charismatic likable guy who just wants to win back his girl. But if it is stereotypes that you want they are there to be found. Most prominent is the mother of Reese's fianc played by Candice Bergen. She is one tough politician who is as cold as ice and predictably obsessed with her public image. Others include the independent feminist girlfriend the redneck buddies and a gay fashion designer.Director Andy Tennant also likes to deal with some classic historical and societal conflicts in this movie such as the North versus the South. In addition to numerous Yankeeredneck jokes Witherspoon's dad Fred Ward is involved in the regular reenactment of a Civil War battle. Tennant also seems to be a fan of love's ability to prevail in the face of these conflicts. His film 'Ever After' has a similar theme  it deals with the struggle between nobility and commoner during medieval times. Specifically it is about a Prince who falls in love with a peasant girl. Despite the odds their love overcomes this obstacle. If you like romantic comedies you should like this film. Despite its flaws this movie is upbeat entertaining and it comes with a lesson about the futility of trying to escape your past that might prove invaluable to some audience members.".

But she has a bit of a bumpy past in the south where her family and old friends are she's still married to Jake her high school sweetheart. Without trying to bring up her embarrassing past to her fiance she has to get things done and settled with everyone including her husband. But she slowly discovers how much she missed her true home and how much of a wonderful guy that Jake is.A bit predictable and silly but over all I would recommend Sweet Home Alabama for a lite comedy that most could enjoy.

So sit back and just have fun! 610".

The films general message is that success and being rich in life aren't important having babies cooking getting drunk and pottering about doing not much is what life's about. I'm not so arrogant as to say it's a wrong message I am a lazy person it agrees with me! But the problem starts with the fact you are supposed to love this up herself girl who comes back and insults her former friends and you just don't find that happening. This film tries to twist and surprise you which it doesn't do and you find her transition jumpy and forced instead of a steadily realisation she just seems to wake up or click instantly into this next stage of realisation after punching a woman in the face.. hmmm.. our heroine suddenly develops a very strong south American accent and this quick transition comes across as purely ridiculous. You find yourself majorly worried by the immoral inevitable walking out on a really nice guy at the altar who is just supposed to accept that because of Witherspoon's nice smile which he does oh my heart's broken I think I am OK with you leaving bye. Classic old school romantic comedies at least had the decency to make the other man a git or at least plotting or not wanting to marry her themselves. I would comment on the blatant racist north America south America overtones but I don't really know enough about this to comment. Not bad acting performances from all the cast despite the script and plot.Life is short but not so short you should avoid watching this film after all it's a feel good film.".

While I generally love Reese Witherspoon in many movies Election and Freeway are awesome neither she nor the other good actors could rescue the bad story twodimensional characters and poor writing in this trite movie. C'mon gals do women really act like this? Would you treat good people who love you like that? No way. Why do male screenwriters decide to portray us like this anyway? At the end of the movie I said out loud This must have been written by a man. Sure enough Story By Screenplay By Directed By all men. SPOILER Additionally I am getting sick and tired of the leavethematthealterbutwecanstillbefriends? overused storyline. Why is it considered romantic to treat another good person who loves you in such a cruel manner? It seems that disregard for kindness decency and public humiliation is the best romantic story in today's vapid Hollywood boardrooms. This woman is rude and cruel to good people. She says and treats people horribly and we are supposed to believe that if she says I'm sorry y'all or gets a little weepy that this is good enough for 100 redemption? As a viewer this was a hard pill to swallow. She lies to the man she loves in both cases runs away when times are tough for good times and bad til death do us part yeah right publicly humiliates her friends several times betrays confidences that in the deep south could mean life or deathGive me a break! I believe that you should be able to empathize with the protagonist but I found that I hated her and the story. Why do we choose to be spoonfed this insipid crap? I think that as moviegoers paying good money that we need to be a little more critical when a bad story bad dialog and unbelievable situations arise in movies.".

If anything it portrays New York as a crowded dirty place...and it is..but not everyone in New York is rude...um OK maybe I take that one back.

I think what makes this movie good is that it is a story you can relate to but made with humor. Yet there are a part sadness in the story.It begins with that Melanie is asked by the son of the mayor if she wants to marry him. Then she says yes but she has things to make up and decides to go down to her hometown in Alabama to get a divorce from her husband who she hasn't met for years not after she lost her child and he was drunk on their wedding.The concept and plot is very smart when the tone is told with humour even in situations that are serious. In fact if the movie hadn't humor it had been falling apart. The humor is lifting the story to a little more than just good. It is so fun so full of genial and amusing characters excellent acting and an excellent ending. Maybe a movie that mostly girls like to watch but anyway a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweet Home Alabama is about a young woman Melanie Carmichael Reese Witherspoon who is learning who she is. She must choice between her new life in New York City and the one she left behind in Pigeon Creek Alabama. The theme of the film is that you can't be two different people you have to be who you are. You have to face your life and your past and not pretend that you are someone you're not.The city versus country motif is brought to life throughout the entire film in such actions as a civil war reenactment shooting anvils across the plantation yard and a diverse yet predictable group of characters residing in Melanie's hometown. This is far from her world in New York City where she is a fashion designer engaged to the mayor's son Andrew Hennings Patrick Dempsey and lives life in the fast lane.The city versus country conflict begins when Melanie returns home to finalize her divorce from her lovable redneck husband Jake Perry Josh Lucas. The laughs continue when much to Mayor Kate Hennings Candice Bergen dismay Melanie and Andrew decide to have their wedding in Alabama. Mayor Hennings is a stiff conservative ice queen. This makes the first meeting of the happy couples' parents Mayor Hennings and Pearl and Earl Smooter Mary Kay Place and Fred Ward incredibly predictable yet still hilarious when you see it play out.As she was in Legally Blonde and Just Like Heaven Witherspoon is sweet smart and sassy. She pulls you into the film and you want to see her happy. She has great chemistry with both Jake and Andrew which makes it difficult for viewers to decide which she should be with. Melanie herself can't decide who is for her until she decides who she is.Director Andy Tennant masterfully uses music to contribute to the theme. With the use of songs such as Sweet Home Alabama What This World Needs Is a Few More Rednecks and Marry Me he transports you into the south. This music prompts you to root for the south and the southern girl who has just returned home. Tennant also impressively did not over use the song Sweet Home Alabama. He used the song only in the situations were it would make the largest impact.Tennant shows in Sweet Home Alabama as he did in Ever After that love just happens and we can't control love any more than we can control who we really are. In Sweet Home Alabama all of Melanie's problems seem to stem from the fact that she cannot face who she really is. Her father sum's up the theme of the movie in one statement You can't ride two horses with one ass sugar bean.".

And for those objecting to the sentiments of the song perhaps you should learn a little bit more about Lynyrd Skynard and Neil Young and what that song actually said about their attitudesand how Young responded. What Skynard meant by the song and how SOME of their audience have interpreted it over the years are two different things just like Springsteen's Born in the USA has been used for political purposes that are the opposite of the song's sentiments.For people who think every white Southerner's favorite evening wear is a white sheet with burning cross as accessory they can gloat over the stupid hicks in this film. For people who want to fantasize that we can still live in Mayberry they can groove on how pretty it all is. Mostly. People see what they expect to see. Except black folks who'd better not expect to see black folks living in the Alabama of THIS movie. Reese Witherspoon herself a wellbred Episcopalian dbutante from Nashville is a negation of Southern stereotypes and an example of the Southerners we never see as characters in movies.Meanwhile the movie itself is so innocuous that it dissolves while you're watching it.

It's infuriating! Truly truly infuriating. I agree with another reviewer who wrote that this could only have been written by a man and it was. Essentially there's a girl who lives in a tiny town which would be best described as Dirthole Alabama. She longs for a different life so she leaves her husband whom she married just out of high school because she was pregnant lost the child so no baby character to worry about she trots off to NY makes a big name for herself as a fashion designer and gets engaged to the mayor's son who is not only sexy and hot but also exceedingly kind generous and nice. She has to journey back to AL to force her no good husband to sign the divorce papers she's been sending him for the past 7 years and which he has repeatedly refused to sign. While there wouldn't you know it she gets sucked back into the 'charm' of the crap hole that she left and the siren call of her ex's blue eyes. This movie totally ignores the fact that maybe this girl really does need something bigger and better than the miserable little town she came from and it also totally ignores the fact that she managed to make something incredible of her dream. For that alone the authors should be punished. Furthermore they imply that she's going to throw it all down the drain to return to Hillbilly land in order to reunite with her ex and his hound dog. WHY is what I want to know. By writing this storyline the authors suggest that Melanie's dream wasn't really a big deal and they expect us to just accept their claim that her ex Mr. Blueeyes is really the love of her life. Well I never saw it I don't accept it and it just infuriates me that Melanie's character so lightly and easily tosses away everything she worked her butt off for over seven years. And don't get me started on the abominable way she treats her fianc who is probably the most decent character in the movie. Gaaahhhh! This Melanie character makes women look either idiotic or like big fat liars.".

In that regard Reese Witherspoon is very good.  AllAmerican good looks a little attitude and that touch of a Southern accent that all guys love.

Scenes like the faux tour of her mansion finding her father in the battle and a past story about a cat.  Double Warning!! Major Spoilers Ahead!!The root problem of Sweet Home Alabama though is its simple predictability.  Almost nothing is surprising.  A few of the requisite South jokes work primarily if you've ever spent time there but for the most part they're as cliche as the movie.  If the movie had really wanted to be something Witherspoon's character would have made the nonHollywood cliche decision or at least fused career and her past better.  Would someone with such a bright future really choose to walk away from much of that?  Isn't there a compromise to be made between love and life?  Telling that story would truly have been emotional perhaps a genuine tearjerker and movie that would have connected with an even broader audience.  Bottom Line  The director takes no chances.

	schema:reviewBody "Had this movie been made forty years ago it would've starred Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward it's that kind of story a romantic and lusty foray into the human condition that takes truth honesty and love into consideration while examining the relationships of those involved.  As for the NewmanWoodward fantasy as an audience we could only be so lucky. Because Sweet Home Alabama' directed by Andy Tennant coasts with a Fast Food Generation' sense of romance and from frame One any lusty' aspects of the film would be more aptly defined as dusty' musty' or rusty.'  If this is a reflection of the sense and sensibility of romance in the new millennium then just stop the world now and let me off.Melanie Carmichael Reese Witherspoon seven years removed from her roots in Alabama has achieved success in the Big Apple.  She is The' new designer of the fashion world and the man of her dreams Andrew Hennings Patrick Dempsey has just proposed.  Life is good but there are a couple of things standing between her and the American dream.  One is Katherine Hennings Candice Bergen Andrew's mother.  But the biggest obstacle is back home in Alabama and before she can realize her dream she's going to have to resolve a few things from her past.  Which means a trip back home to the place and the life she's worked so hard to get away from.  But there's no getting around it to move ahead with her new life she's going to have to open some closet doors and rattle some skeletons.  So for Melanie it's off to her old sweet home Alabama to visit the past she'd rather forget.As a director Andy Tennant has his roots in television and for better or worse it is perhaps a subjective call he has time and again attempted to adapt his small screen sensibilities to the big screen which worked well enough in Ever After' in 1998 but achieved dismal results the next year in Anna and the King.'  This offering falls somewhere inbetween.  To be fair though the problems began before Tennant ever came on board and it falls directly on writers Douglas J. Eboch story and C. Jay Cox screenplay who cranked out a storyscreenplay that is decidedly uninspired and lacks any semblance of originality whatsoever.  As a rule I personally rail against those who deem the outcome of just about any film predictable' because it's usually in reference to plot developments that are more accurately inevitable.'  This one however is going to make everyone in the audience thinking they have The Sight. To put what Tennant has done here into perspective one must place him on the scale by which directors of romantic comedy are judged.  On the strength of her Return To Me' Bonnie Hunt shares the apex of the chart with the undisputed master of the RC Nora Ephron both of whom register at the 100th percentile.  At the nadir of the chart is Adam Shankman The Wedding Planner' with a 0' percentile.  This film puts Tennant at about 20. Granted he was handed a poor script how did this get the green light in the first place?  It's been DONE already! but he exhibits a veritable lack of vision with a truly unimaginative rendering of the material.  The story is trite and the characters are inherently uninteresting but he could have at least livened things up a bit.  He even blew the outdoor dance scene which was custom made for some good old down home Alabama rockabilly and line dancing instead what you get is a glimpse and a cutaway to a shot of the good ol' boys sitting atop a water tower drinking beer.  Make that the 19th percentile.In Election' and especially in Legally Blonde' Reese Witherspoon is a charismatic forceful presence on the screen.  As Melanie however she comes across as too selfabsorbed to be likable and there's a scene in which she's had a bit too much to drink that as they say shows her Melanie's true colors.  She has too much of an edge to evoke any empathy and overall her performance isn't that convincing.  She gets the hard' side of Melanie right but when she goes for soft' it translates to pretentious and lacks the realism that would make it believable.  In retrospect Melanie is rather unattractive and unappealing which makes this film a hard sell.Josh Lucas meanwhile though a step up from McConaughey's SteveEddie of The Wedding Planner' still comes across as a kind of thirdrate Paul Newman wannabe.  Comparing Newman's Ben Quick to Lucas' Jake Perry for example isn't comparing apples and oranges it's more like sizzle to fizzle.  Lucas is a good actor his Martin Hansen in A Beautiful Mind' but he lacks the magnetism to make Jake viable.As Andrew Patrick Dempsey gives something of an assembly line performance. In his defense he was given little with which to work but he failed to explore it for the nuance that would have at least given some identity' to his character.  Dempsey has the looks and talent and perhaps a stronger director could've exacted more from him.And what in the world is going on with Candice Bergen?  Is she destined to play a sarcastic and jaded Katherine in this one or disturbed Kathy Morningside Miss Congeniality' version of Murphy Brown for the rest of her career?  Bergen is a beautiful gifted actor who has much more to offer than what she's been given in recent years.The supporting cast includes Fred Ward Earl Mary Kay Place Pearl Jean Smart Stella Ethan Embry Bobby Ray and Melanie Lynskey Lurlynn.  With a different cast director and screenplay Sweet Home Alabama' may have had a chance but this bunch checked any pizzazz and credibility at the door on the way in and the result is a film that is flat and tedious.  This one seemingly had promise but the filmmakers simply failed to deliver.  310.".

Jay Cox screenplay who cranked out a storyscreenplay that is decidedly uninspired and lacks any semblance of originality whatsoever.  As a rule I personally rail against those who deem the outcome of just about any film predictable' because it's usually in reference to plot developments that are more accurately inevitable.'  This one however is going to make everyone in the audience thinking they have The Sight. To put what Tennant has done here into perspective one must place him on the scale by which directors of romantic comedy are judged.  On the strength of her Return To Me' Bonnie Hunt shares the apex of the chart with the undisputed master of the RC Nora Ephron both of whom register at the 100th percentile.  At the nadir of the chart is Adam Shankman The Wedding Planner' with a 0' percentile.  This film puts Tennant at about 20. Granted he was handed a poor script how did this get the green light in the first place?  It's been DONE already! but he exhibits a veritable lack of vision with a truly unimaginative rendering of the material.  The story is trite and the characters are inherently uninteresting but he could have at least livened things up a bit.  He even blew the outdoor dance scene which was custom made for some good old down home Alabama rockabilly and line dancing instead what you get is a glimpse and a cutaway to a shot of the good ol' boys sitting atop a water tower drinking beer.  Make that the 19th percentile.In Election' and especially in Legally Blonde' Reese Witherspoon is a charismatic forceful presence on the screen.  As Melanie however she comes across as too selfabsorbed to be likable and there's a scene in which she's had a bit too much to drink that as they say shows her Melanie's true colors.  She has too much of an edge to evoke any empathy and overall her performance isn't that convincing.  She gets the hard' side of Melanie right but when she goes for soft' it translates to pretentious and lacks the realism that would make it believable.  In retrospect Melanie is rather unattractive and unappealing which makes this film a hard sell.Josh Lucas meanwhile though a step up from McConaughey's SteveEddie of The Wedding Planner' still comes across as a kind of thirdrate Paul Newman wannabe.  Comparing Newman's Ben Quick to Lucas' Jake Perry for example isn't comparing apples and oranges it's more like sizzle to fizzle.  Lucas is a good actor his Martin Hansen in A Beautiful Mind' but he lacks the magnetism to make Jake viable.As Andrew Patrick Dempsey gives something of an assembly line performance. In his defense he was given little with which to work but he failed to explore it for the nuance that would have at least given some identity' to his character.  Dempsey has the looks and talent and perhaps a stronger director could've exacted more from him.And what in the world is going on with Candice Bergen?  Is she destined to play a sarcastic and jaded Katherine in this one or disturbed Kathy Morningside Miss Congeniality' version of Murphy Brown for the rest of her career?  Bergen is a beautiful gifted actor who has much more to offer than what she's been given in recent years.The supporting cast includes Fred Ward Earl Mary Kay Place Pearl Jean Smart Stella Ethan Embry Bobby Ray and Melanie Lynskey Lurlynn.  With a different cast director and screenplay Sweet Home Alabama' may have had a chance but this bunch checked any pizzazz and credibility at the door on the way in and the result is a film that is flat and tedious.  This one seemingly had promise but the filmmakers simply failed to deliver.  310.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon but at least she is consistent  she does the same sort of films over and over. You don't need to be a genius to figure out where this film is going  simply from watching the trailer I knew where this supposed 'journey of rediscovery' was leading us. The fact that it is obvious doesn't help it work any easier and I didn't feel that the film did enough to build the chemistry between Melanie and Jake. Considering they had been apart for 7 years we knew little of their past and the fact they argued for a lot of the time it was difficult to see them as a couple. They needed to show development as a couple through the film to make it more acceptable.Of course this is a minor complaint as this type of film is never meant to be perfect. Outside of this the film stutters because it simply isn't very funny or romantic. The humour mostly is drawn from the 'good ol' boy' clichs and comparing to the big city  not exactly original. One thing the film did do that I thought was brave was to expose Melanie as being snooty to her friends  this could have lost the audience but it actually helped me feel she was changing a little.Witherspoon is OK in this role but then it is similar to all her stuff so I shouldn't be too surprised. She doesn't really act here and just puts on the same expressions that she has done so often before. Dempsey is cast as 'New York' type and doesn't do anything outside of that. Lucas is the 'southern' type and is used for that until the film needs him to be a potential partner for Mel at which point he becomes very clean handsome and a businessman! Support is OK but not well used Bergen does the 'evil' Mayor in her sleep and Fred Ward is given almost nothing of consequence to do.So as predictable and clichd as I knew it was going to be you understand the score.".

The idea of the tail coat never becomes silly or gets in the way of the plot which doles out equal amounts of irony suspense pathos  comedy. The allstar cast gives worthy performances which keeps the viewer's attention right to the very end.SEQUENCE ONE An actor and his lover Charles Boyer  Rita Hayworth are confronted by her quietly sadistic husband Thomas Mitchell. Eugene Palette plays Boyer's loyal valet. An unbilled Robert Greig appears as the corpulent creator of the elegant tail coat.Most of the action in this sequence takes place at an estate outside of Manhattan.SEQUENCE TWO A shy fellow Henry Fonda tries to help his friend Cesar Romero out of a jam with his suspicious fianc Ginger Rogers. Gail Patrick appears as Rogers' nosy gal pal Roland Young plays Romero's protective valet.A quite different tail coat is the center of the plot here which can become a bit confusing.SEQUENCE THREE A poor composer Charles Laughton finally has the opportunity to conduct his magnum opus at a concert. Radiant Elsa Lanchester appears as Laughton's adoring wife. Christian Rub plays a friendly cellist while Victor Francen is very believable as the noble Bellini. An unbilled Dewey Robinson plays the bullying owner of a small caf.Laughton is magnificent as is to be expected giving another master class in how to turn a small part into something very special.SEQUENCE FOURAfter being spiffedup and accoutered in the tail coat a skid row bum Edward G. Robinson makes a poignant appearance at the WaldorfAstoria for his college's 25year class reunion. James Gleason plays the kindly parson who runs a rescue mission silent screen star Mae Marsh appears as his sweetnatured wife. Harry Davenport appears as a wise old professor George Sanders snarls his way through his role as Robinson's old antagonist.Robinson  Gleason do some impressive acting making their characters come alive.SEQUENCE FIVEAn eccentric professor W.C. Fields gives a temperance lecture to a gathering of high society swells not knowing that the coconut milk has been liberally spiked. Phil Silvers shines in the brief role of the secondhand dealer who sells the tail coat to Fields. The monumental Margaret Dumont enlivens her scant appearance as the matron sponsoring Fields.Before the film's initial release there was consternation from some of the other major stars concerning Fields' large salary. The clamor grew to the point that Fox weaseled out by simply excising the sequence entirely. Rumor was allowed to grow that the removal was due to an inept performance from Fields. This is tragic in that it was to be one of Fields' final appearances on film and he is hilarious as is Phil Silvers who has the distinction of being practically the only person in film history who ever managed to both outtalk  hoodwink Fields. After more than half a century this sequence has finally been reunited with the rest of the filmthe only problem for anyone that cares being a slight one of continuity as it is not shown how the tail coat returns to the Santelli Bros. shop in time for the burglary that opens Sequence Six.You have to be quick to read the painted sign on the Santelli Bros. window WE TAKE AN ABSOLUTE LOSS ON EVERY TRANSACTION WE'RE ECCENTRICSEQUENCE SIXIn the film's most photographically stylish sequence a shanty town full of impoverished farmers rejoice when the tail coatand its pocket full of cashliterally falls out of the sky. J. Carrol Naish plays the airborne robber who loses the coat. Paul Robeson  Ethel Waters are the couple who find it. Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson is their gently conniving preacher an almost unrecognizable Clarence Muse appears as a greedy old grandfather. Members of the wonderful Hall Johnson Choir lift their voices as the jubilant townsfolk.Once again the action in this sequence mostly occurs far from Manhattan. The short song at the very end is the only occasion Robeson and The Hall Johnson Choir ever sang together on filmand unbelievably Miss Waters isn't allowed to sing at all.Director Duvivier and stars Boyer Robinson  Mitchell would travel to Universal Studios to make another sequential film FLESH AND FANTASY in 1943.".

This is tragic in that it was to be one of Fields' final appearances on film and he is hilarious as is Phil Silvers who has the distinction of being practically the only person in film history who ever managed to both outtalk  hoodwink Fields. After more than half a century this sequence has finally been reunited with the rest of the filmthe only problem for anyone that cares being a slight one of continuity as it is not shown how the tail coat returns to the Santelli Bros. shop in time for the burglary that opens Sequence Six.You have to be quick to read the painted sign on the Santelli Bros. window WE TAKE AN ABSOLUTE LOSS ON EVERY TRANSACTION WE'RE ECCENTRICSEQUENCE SIXIn the film's most photographically stylish sequence a shanty town full of impoverished farmers rejoice when the tail coatand its pocket full of cashliterally falls out of the sky. J. Carrol Naish plays the airborne robber who loses the coat. Paul Robeson  Ethel Waters are the couple who find it. Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson is their gently conniving preacher an almost unrecognizable Clarence Muse appears as a greedy old grandfather. Members of the wonderful Hall Johnson Choir lift their voices as the jubilant townsfolk.Once again the action in this sequence mostly occurs far from Manhattan. The short song at the very end is the only occasion Robeson and The Hall Johnson Choir ever sang together on filmand unbelievably Miss Waters isn't allowed to sing at all.Director Duvivier and stars Boyer Robinson  Mitchell would travel to Universal Studios to make another sequential film FLESH AND FANTASY in 1943.";

At the start the first tale runs the gamut of intense romantic intrigue with a suave Charles Boyer drawn to beautiful Rita Hayworth and Thomas Mitchell as the husband with a few ulterior motives of his own in mind. I think the cinematography by Joseph Walker is absolutely superb in this episode. Those closeups are priceless.I was surprised to see the episode with W C Fields in it and checked IMDb to note that this was included in a restored version which is nice. Fields and his liquid edification are seldom far apart and here it appears in the guise of cocoanut milk with a few additives as you can guess which he highly recommends for ? I forget what it was.Another tale is of Edward G. Robinson who gives an excellent performance as the downandouter dressed in the tux for a special gathering of old school chums. It has fine emotional content which I consider the dramatic highlight of the film and gives one much to think about afterwards. I might add here that this movie brings to mind some of Somerset Maugham's short stories that are on film as well. The final Manhattan tale starring Paul Robeson and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson has dialogue that is both amusing and touching at times. Ethel Waters the matronly Esther shows them a firm hand in directing them to do what's right. I always like to see Paul Robeson and hear his great voice. His singing ends their episode on a note of what freedom means to so many and really brings the film to a fine conclusion. Great stuff!It is a fascinating movie to experience and one of the best of its kind in my opinion.".

The plot amounts to a series of vignettes that follow a dress coat as it gets passed around to a series of new owners. The trouble is the coat is supposed to be cursed so we expect some adversity to befall each new owner. Some vignettes of course are better than others. Personally I liked the Rogers Fonda farcical 20minutes best. On the other hand I can see why the WC Fields episode was dropped from many versions since it's not the grouchy comedian at his best. I also suspect the rather gross anatomical drawing behind his lectern didn't help.As a movie it's certainly different something of a showcase and my gosh was Rita Hayworth ever any lovelier than here. Pairing her with a pixieish Thomas Mitchell as a cuckolded husband was a masterstroke. Watch how slyly he asserts himself against the overconfident Boyer. Robinson gets the most extended screen time as a downandout lawyer trying to impress his old school chums. I'm just sorry we didn't get to hear more of Paul Robeson's wonderful bass voice in the final darktown jubilee section. Nonetheless it's a sprightly and satisfying way to end the saga of the accursed dress coat. The movie comes across today as an exception to the standard studio product but is cleverly set up with a dash of humor and a touch of timeless human interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the better multiple story movies from Hollywood though it demonstrates the limitations of the genre as well as it's strengths.  At it's best this kind of movie manages to integrate the stories in some way think of the plot of GRAND HOTEL or DINNER AT EIGHT where the problems of different groups of characters manage to intertwine in a confined space  another example though a nonHollywood film is the British horror classic DEAD OF NIGHT.  Some of the anthology films based on the stories of a particular writer O'Henry or Somerset Maugham for instance don't have to blend the stories because of the style of the writer which unifies the different stories.  But then you have a well made film like this one with a good journeyman director Jules Duvivier who had previously done the similar FLESH AND FANTASY and an all name cast to die for.  This is the only film that had Charles Boyer Rita Hayworth Thomas Mitchell Roland Young Eugene Pallette Henry Fonda Ginger Rogers Cesar Romero Charles Laughton Elsa Lanchester Victor Francken Edward G. Robinson James Gleason George Sanders W.C.Fields Margaret Dumont Phil Silvers J. Carroll Naish Paul Robeson Ethel Waters Eddie Anderson and Clarence Muse in one picture  even though they were in different stories.But the running thread is weak.  It is the passing of a monkey suit back and forth from one leading character to another  a pun on tales and tails which is what such an elaborate tuxedo is called.  That the actors who get the tails Boyer Romero Laughton Robinson Fields do not fit the same size clothes does not seem to be taken into consideration. Interestingly Laughton did lose weight for the role but he still is burlier than Boyer or Romero.  As for the final recipients of the tails Naish and Robeson the former is a crook who wears the suit briefly while pulling off the robbery of a casino and then uses the suit as a container for the stolen cash and the latter never cares about the coat but is mostly concerned with the cash that is dropped down inside it.  The tails end up being used on a scarecrow on Robeson's farm.It is a silly device  to use and the ending an all AfricanAmerican episode about how a rural town of African  Americans finds the tails containing stolen cash dropped from a plane by J. Carroll Naish. As the characters in the other stories were all whites in the upper classes even the now impoverished Robinson was once a successful attorney and Fields is a social climber fake lecturer on the dangers of drinking. The Blacks in the film are definitely in the lower classes.  What is unique about their segment is that the money that Robeson finds is not kept as he would have done by him but split into shares for every Black person in the town  a Marxist kind of solution that fits with Robeson's political views in the late 1940s and early 1950s.   Dramatically the two best stories are the ones about Robinson pretending that he is not an impoverished bum when attending the reunion of his college classmates one of whom Sanders is an old rival who suspects the truth and the first story about the purchase of the cursed set of tails by Boyer and his subsequent discovery of the unworthiness of his lover Hayworth who is left humiliated with her husband Mitchell.  The continental flavor of Boyer's sequence may be the portion of the film based on a script of Ferenc Molnar's.    The Laughton sequence is okay but nothing to rave about although the role of Victor Francken as the tempermental symphony conductor  who helps Laughton  is a clone of Toscanini down to the name of the character  ARTURO Belini.  The weakest is the Fonda  Rogers  Romero sequence which should have been better and the fine screen attraction of Fonda and Rogers makes one wish that they made a complete film together  tragically this segment was their only film together. The Naish sequence is too brief to be judged well though Naish does exude menace as a thief.That leaves the famous lost sequence of Fields and Margaret Dumont.  It really was never fully lost  for many years film societies showing Fields specialties would show that sequence like a short.  But it is not complete as it survives.  How did Margaret Dumont get her head stuck in the chandelier that she is wearing?  That is not in the final sequence that the video version of the movie includes.  It was their second movie together.  Fields own NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK included his romancing Dumont as the wealthy Mrs. Hemoglobin despite the rivalry of Leon Erroll.  That film was made in 1941 and perhaps Fields suggested reteaming with Dumont.  She is a good foil for him but nothing else and nobody else at the lecture is worthy of Fields' typical shafts of wit.  The only other to stand out at all in the lecture portion of the sequence is Chester Clute the alcoholic husband of Dumont and he does not confront Fields.  But earlier in the sequence is a worthy adversary  in fact the only worthy adversary Fields ever had in a congame confrontation Phil Silvers.  As this was one of Fields last movies it was one of Silvers first films. Television's future Sergeant Bilko had begun to perfect his style of flimflam and fast talk and it is a treat of sorts watching him con Fields into paying for the tails by putting a fake wad of bills in the coat so Fields thinks he's getting the better of Silvers in the deal.  A bit like watching the passing of a crown between champions of their days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tales of Manhattan follows the story of a formal cutaway coat as it passes from owner to owner and the consequences to all that come into possession. The original owner Charles Boyer is an actor having an affair with Rita Hayworth and husband Thomas Mitchell finds out about it with some dire consequences for Boyer. Is it cursed well the stories of the various owners would range the gamut of circumstances. All the episodes are pretty good quality although if Tales of Manhattan were made today the last one about the southern sharecroppers with Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters and a whole bunch of black players would be done a lot different now. For years a story with W.C. Fields and Margaret Dumont with Phil Silvers in it was cut from the original release. It's now restored to Tales of Manhattan and I'm not sure why it was done. It's a very funny episode in which Fields gets the cutaway to use in delivering a temperance lecture to Margaret Dumont and friends. Ms.Dumont proves to be just as good a foil for Fields as she was for the Brothers Marx. Especially when the coconut milk being served is spiked with some spirits. Fields one of the celebrated inebriates of show business reveled in his identity and that temperance lecture was a routine he did going back to his vaudeville days. We should be thankful it was preserved and restored.The other comic episode involved Cesar Romero palming off the tails on Henry Fonda who is to be best man at his wedding to Ginger Rogers. He put a love letter from another woman in the pocket and Rogers finds it. Romero has Fonda claim the cutaway was his and the contents thereof. It works only too well.Edward G. Robinson has a nice episode as a disbarred lawyer living in a mission shelter who uses the cutaway to go to a class reunion where he and his former classmates get a lesson in humility.The other episode concerns how the tails nearly undid Charles Laughton's big break in the music world. Elsa Lanchester who is playing his wife here buys the tails for her husband who is a piano player in a honky tonk dive. But Laughton is a serious composer and with a certain amount of wile and chutzpah he gets to see an Arturo Toscanini type conductor Victor Francen. Francen loves Laughton's concerto and arranges to have him conduct it.Sad to say that the cutaway is to small and starts tearing as the composer is conducting. The gales of laughter threaten to steal Laughton's big moment but Francen who was a pretty egocentric character steps up and finishes the concerto and the applause is for him and Laughton.This particular episode had minimal dialog but Charles Laughton's closeups run the whole gamut of emotions from resignation to triumph to despair and back to triumph again. The film is from French director Julian Duvivier who was in exile in America while the Nazis occupied his country. It probably could be remade but formal cutaways just aren't worn any more.".

I loved Edward G. Robinson as a Bowery drunk sent to his Harvardlike reunion by a doting Bowery reverend. I loved the plot twists in the first two stories. Anyhow I LOVE it. We see familiar actors in unfamiliar roles Thomas Mitchell a great actor usually plays character parts Irish or sailors or Uncle Billy in Wonderful Life here we see him as the real sophisticate he was. Rita Hayworth as jealous and uncertain as well as gorgeous. Henry Fonda very young and playing very dumb. Ginger Rogers as a spitfire jealous fiance. And on and on.And best of all The final sequence is incredible politically incorrect in every possible way. It stars Paul Robeson Ethel Waters and Rochester the comedy black guy from the Jack Benny radio show. It alone is worth the rental combining the worst of sharecropperRastusHereComedeLawd ethnic parody with a chance for Robeson to speak the Communist ideal at its highest and most hopeful never more to be heard and powerful to hear from someone who believed it. Probably this was the only condition under which Robeson would consent to appear in an appalling stereotype skit.The photography is great. THE LIGHTING is worth a year of film school. Too bad the director went back to France after the war. This movie has everything. As Hollywood Nostalgia it's the tops.".

The Ginger Rogers Henry Fonda Cesar Romero segment is OK. The Charles Laughton Elsa Lanchester segment is pretty good. Although I'm a big WC Fields fan this was not his best work although it had a couple of very funny moments I'm surprised that I've never seen clips from this film on any of the bios about him. The Edward G. Robinson George Sanders segment was a bit too intellectual but well acted  it was great seeing a young Robinson do scenes I've never seen before. The film ended strongly with an allblack segment featuring Paul Robeson Ethel Waters Rochester with the great Clarence Muse in a small part. As an extra treat this last segment contained a song by Robeson but the sets for this segment were Broadway stagelike  not realistic looking like the rest of the film compare the painted backdrops here with the realism of the Robinson alleyway in an earlier segment. Even if you don't enjoy the story segments anyone who likes great actorsactresses of the 1930s  1940s must see this film. I rate it 810.".

With the exception of the last one Julien Duvivier's excellent American film is a joy to watch.The film boasts a galaxy of collaborators. Twentieth Century Fox produced the film during the period of WWII as it gathered talent from the film industry that came together in a movie that should be seen by serious fans. Julien Duvivier a distinguished French director came to Hollywood during the years of the conflict in Europe. He had a natural talent for getting the best out of his cast and crew as he proves in here.Some of the best figures working in movies during those years came together in what appears to be a coup of casting. Charles Boyer Rita Hayworth Thomas Mitchell and Eugene Palette are featured in the initial sequence. Cesar Romero Ginger Rogers Henry Fonda Gail Patrick and Roland Young are seen in the second story. Charles Laughton Elsa Lanchester and Victor Francen appear in the third installment. The great Edgar G. Robinson James Gleason George Sanders and Henry Davenport make their segment one of the best ones in the picture. The last one is not too shabby either it showed performers of the stature of Ethel Waters Paul Robeson and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson in the last tale which is a bit too mawkish to end the film. All the players assembled for this project do wonders under Mr. Duvivier's guidance.The writing was not too bad either. Distinguished writers of the stature of Donald Ogden Stewart Ben Hecht Ferenc Molnar and even an uncredited Buster Keaton enhanced the stories for the viewer's enjoyment. Joseph Walker's cinematography worked wonders as did the art direction by Richard Day and Boris Leven. One of the highlights of the film is the hunting lodge of the first story full of antlers.

	schema:headline " Good looking anthology movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Anthology film that centers around a formal tailcoat and the different people who come into possession of it. The first story is about an actor Charles Boyer in love with a married woman Rita Hayworth. Her husband Thomas Mitchell doesn't like it one bit. Boyer and Mitchell are fine but Hayworth overacts big time. The story is thin but as with the rest of the picture director Julien Duvivier and cinematographer Joseph Walker make it look beautiful. The second story is also about a love triangle although lighter in tone than the previous tale. This one's about a woman Ginger Rogers who suspects her fianc Cesar Romero is cheating after finding a love letter in the pocket of his coat same coat from before which leads to her taking a second look at his best man Henry Fonda. This is probably the weakest story in the movie. Just not as amusing or cute as it wants to be. Also Ginger Rogers sports one of the ugliest hairstyles I've ever seen.The third story has a struggling composer Charles Laughton getting his big chance to conduct his own composition in front of a large audience. But the tailcoat he's wearing yup same one is too small and rips in front of everyone. What happens next I won't spoil but I thought it was pretty neat. This is my favorite part of the movie albeit for sentimental reasons. The fourth story is the most widelypraised one judging by the reviews I've read. It's a great story about a downonhisluck former lawyer Edward G. Robinson who borrows the tailcoat to attend his college reunion. Again I don't want to spoil too much because of how good this one is but it's another one that pulls at the heartstrings.Next is an interesting story in that it was originally cut to reduce the running time but has since been restored to the film despite apparently missing a part at the end that connects it to the next segment. It's a funny story about a man W.C. Fields giving a lecture on the dangers of alcohol at the home of a wealthy woman Margaret Dumont. But it turns out the woman's husband has spiked the milk they're all drinking with booze so everybody at the antialcohol meeting gets drunk. Simple story but fun. Fields is a hoot as usual. The final story has a crook J. Carrol Naish stealing the coat to help him commit a robbery at a casino. As he escapes via plane he dumps the coat and it lands in a field where a poor black Southern couple Paul Robeson Ethel Waters find it. The coat has the money from the casino heist in it which pleases the couple at first as they believe it is a gift from God. But it dawns on them God would want them to use the money to help others not themselves. It's a nice story if a little patronizing. Paul Robeson a devout communist who liked the story's 'community before the individual' philosophy was so disappointed by the finished product and its stereotypical depictions of poor blacks that he would never make another Hollywood movie.In addition to the stars I've listed already the cast includes many wonderful supporting actors like George Sanders Victor Francen Eugene Palette Roland Young Elsa Lanchester Harry Davenport James Gleason Phil Silvers Gail Patrick and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson. Julien Duvivier would do another anthology film for Universal the following year called Flesh and Fantasy. Boyer Robinson and Mitchell would also appear in that film. Dynamite cast and fine direction make this one something that I think most classic film fans will enjoy. The stories aren't all home runs but they're all interesting in different ways.".

It's a funny story about a man W.C. Fields giving a lecture on the dangers of alcohol at the home of a wealthy woman Margaret Dumont. But it turns out the woman's husband has spiked the milk they're all drinking with booze so everybody at the antialcohol meeting gets drunk. Simple story but fun. Fields is a hoot as usual. The final story has a crook J. Carrol Naish stealing the coat to help him commit a robbery at a casino. As he escapes via plane he dumps the coat and it lands in a field where a poor black Southern couple Paul Robeson Ethel Waters find it. The coat has the money from the casino heist in it which pleases the couple at first as they believe it is a gift from God. But it dawns on them God would want them to use the money to help others not themselves. It's a nice story if a little patronizing. Paul Robeson a devout communist who liked the story's 'community before the individual' philosophy was so disappointed by the finished product and its stereotypical depictions of poor blacks that he would never make another Hollywood movie.In addition to the stars I've listed already the cast includes many wonderful supporting actors like George Sanders Victor Francen Eugene Palette Roland Young Elsa Lanchester Harry Davenport James Gleason Phil Silvers Gail Patrick and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson. Julien Duvivier would do another anthology film for Universal the following year called Flesh and Fantasy. Boyer Robinson and Mitchell would also appear in that film. Dynamite cast and fine direction make this one something that I think most classic film fans will enjoy. The stories aren't all home runs but they're all interesting in different ways.";

	schema:headline " Though somewhat of a mixed bag Tales of Manhattan is well worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "So after about 35 years reading about this film in the book The Films of W.C. Fields I finally watched Tales of Manhattan on YouTube. It has several short films connected together by a black coat. First segment stars Charles Boyer as an actor in love with Rita Hayworth who is married to Thomas Mitchell. Yes you read that right. Second segment has Ginger Rogers finding what her fiance Cesar Romero does when she's not around so the latter tries to pawn his coat with the incriminating evidence to future best man Henry Fonda. Third segment has Charles Laughton leaving his honky tonk playing days behind when he gets his dream job of conducting a symphony though he has to find a coat first of which one is given by his reallife spouse Elsa Lanchester. Fourth segment has Edward G. Robinson down on his luck when his friend James Gleason offers a formal suit so he can attend his 25th college reunion at the Waldolf Astoria where everyone except George Sanders seems glad to see him. What was supposed to be the fifth segmentcut from original release supposedly because it overextended the lengthhad W.C. Fields buying the coat from Phil Silversthe only time two lovable con men met on filmbefore lecturing a hoity toity crowdof which Margaret Dumont is among themon the evils of alcohol. But nobody saw what happened before the meeting. Final segment takes place on a poor farm where the coat falls from Heaven in front of Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters. They give it to Eddie Rochester Anderson who tries to take the money found in it but ends up sharing it with his congregation. Also appearing are Clarence Muse and Cordell Hickman who is one of the kids. He plays Nicodemus. I first remembered him from the last Our Gang short ever madeTale of a Dog. Oh and Robeson and the Hall Johnson Choir sing their hearts out. Just about all of these sequences have some entertainment in them with the most hilarious one being the RogersRomeroFonda one and the Robinson one being the most touching. About the last sequence Robeson had returned to Hollywood after years of making films in England and this was only his secondafter Universal's Show Boat from 1936major studio appearance that studio being 20th CenturyFox. If you know about him and his previous films you know he would usually play dignified characters without stereotypical characteristics as well as present fine messages. While something of his point of view is here that of openly sharing the wealth he felt the entire sequence did a poor job of representing his race as being childlike hobos speaking in almost unintelligible dialect and spontaneously singing Halleujah! when a windfall go their way. At least I think that may have been his problem with it. He was appalled by it so much he tried to buy all prints of that sequence and destroy it. Anyway the end result was he held a press conference and said he'd no longer appear in films because of the way his race was depicted then and to his dying day in 1976 he never did. A shame really. Still all his films are now available on DVD well except for Show Boat though there may still be some VHS copies around so if anyone wants to be a Robeson completest be my guest. So on that note Tales of Manhattan is very much worth a look.".

Personally I preferred that one but I'm probably biased because it has a supernatural bent.  out of 4.";

	schema:reviewBody "What an unusual but never before thought of idea! It gets big points for originality by reviving the old days of 70s truckin' man flicks and updating the genre into a scifi visual feast that compares closely to STARSHIP TROOPERS! Imagine if Bo and Luke Duke were flying around in their orange coaster without jumping over obstacles and avoiding capture by Sheriff Roscoe! There has to be a good sense of fantasy surrounding this old fad. Well I'm not gonna get all hyped up about SPACE TRUCKERS which is mainly your regular dosage of outer space mayhem. The simple action looks as good as the rich visual quality but don't take it too hard. It plunges into the offbeat stage and loses its scifi luster to some needless hot sexuality added by the lack of gravity and a captivity scene. I can tell that the minds of script writers skirted around the explicit subject matter just to prevent any further boiling on the offensive side. You know the two lovebirds running and floating around in their undies. And could it be that there are two different endings? Campy as it will sound there is reason to have fun with it after all. Okay by me.".

It gets big points for originality by reviving the old days of 70s truckin' man flicks and updating the genre into a scifi visual feast that compares closely to STARSHIP TROOPERS! Imagine if Bo and Luke Duke were flying around in their orange coaster without jumping over obstacles and avoiding capture by Sheriff Roscoe! There has to be a good sense of fantasy surrounding this old fad. Well I'm not gonna get all hyped up about SPACE TRUCKERS which is mainly your regular dosage of outer space mayhem. The simple action looks as good as the rich visual quality but don't take it too hard. It plunges into the offbeat stage and loses its scifi luster to some needless hot sexuality added by the lack of gravity and a captivity scene. I can tell that the minds of script writers skirted around the explicit subject matter just to prevent any further boiling on the offensive side. You know the two lovebirds running and floating around in their undies. And could it be that there are two different endings? Campy as it will sound there is reason to have fun with it after all. Okay by me.";

Is the film badly edited and hard to follow? Absolutely not. On the contrary this side of things was very well handled and the film is very easy to follow with no errors of continuance.Did the film suffer from bad casting? Definitely not and both Charles and Dennis would be irreplaceable in my opinion. Remember Dennis Hopper's terrific one liners in Water World? Well he repeats that performance here in Space Truckers. Besides we get to see Dennis play a heroic character for a change!Does the film suffer from a lack of character development like some reviewers have said? Utter rubbish! I can't say much here that would not give elements of the outcome of the story away but I will say that if you miss character development in this movie then you didn't watch it properly.And one last thing this movie is close to the mark as far as the reality of our world is concerned. Technology has created power for some people that we should all be very concerned about and while Space Truckers is a comedy I felt it hit very close to home on a few fronts.".

	schema:headline " One of Gordon's Best...";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of this film directed and partially written by Stuart Gordon. I thought the idea of Gordon creating a space adventure was very interesting. I thought I know Gordon's films don't have 60 million budgets so I figured most of people who disliked it probably aren't used to lowercalibered scifi. Which is extremely hard to do without looking foolish. I must give a lot of credit Gordon did a very impressive job with the film overall.It takes the absurd nature of The Fi5th Element and the action of Judge Dredd into one with a dash of Super Mario Brothers and Predator. The film is geared more towards a younger audience with an apparent lighter tone. It has a PG13 rating with little gore but I forgot about that. Several surprising great actors pop up in the film Vernon Wells dressed in full Mad Max 2 outlaw mode. Charles Dance plays a very biomechanical trenchcoated villian who looks as if he stepped out of the PC game Return To Wolfenstein. The main actors Hopper Dorff and Mazar do a convincing job in light of hammy material.The special effects that are present are done impressively with a keeneye for detail. The production design is very extensive with a lot of little touches that push the film along. The direction of Gordon is truly deadon he offend used the film's full 235.1 scope to devastatingly creative effect. Some have bad mouthed the antigravity scenes as being horrid but no this provided some of the most wild camera angles and it was interesting to think of how are did it without the crutch of CGI.They just didn't have 20000 to burn on a interior spacecraft wall 20 feet behind the camera! They had to make with what they had and everything was used in a 'form follows function manner' The original musical score has a nice 'heavy handedness' to it. The action scenes are loud tense and the BioMechanical Warriors are the best fast moving 'personinsuit' monsters in quite sometime. I recommend this film as the perfect time waster.".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first heard of this film directed and partially written by Stuart Gordon. I thought the idea of Gordon creating a space adventure was very interesting. I thought I know Gordon's films don't have 60 million budgets so I figured most of people who disliked it probably aren't used to lowercalibered scifi. Which is extremely hard to do without looking foolish. I must give a lot of credit Gordon did a very impressive job with the film overall.It takes the absurd nature of The Fi5th Element and the action of Judge Dredd into one with a dash of Super Mario Brothers and Predator. The film is geared more towards a younger audience with an apparent lighter tone. It has a PG13 rating with little gore but I forgot about that. Several surprising great actors pop up in the film Vernon Wells dressed in full Mad Max 2 outlaw mode. Charles Dance plays a very biomechanical trenchcoated villian who looks as if he stepped out of the PC game Return To Wolfenstein. The main actors Hopper Dorff and Mazar do a convincing job in light of hammy material.The special effects that are present are done impressively with a keeneye for detail. The production design is very extensive with a lot of little touches that push the film along. The direction of Gordon is truly deadon he offend used the film's full 235.1 scope to devastatingly creative effect.

The other half expected a gushy MTVish droolfest out to promote the soundtrack artists including current corporate media darling 50 Cent.Resurrection is neither. The producer is not some slick Hollywood mogul with no understanding of rap except as a source for making a quick buck. Instead Afeni Shakur the late rapper's mother takes charge. As both executive producer and the dominant force in her son's short life her personal agenda impacts every frame. Like all documentaries this is an extremely onesided account and it is likely due to her input that the movie downplays the darker aspects of Pac's selfdestructive downward spiral after his move to Death Row Records. Nor is the film harsh enough on Tupac's seemingly endless capacity for paranoia and irresponsibility.Fortunately she also makes the crucial decision not to dwell on more tired hashrehash of so called East CoastWest Coast rap war which the movie clarifies as less of a reality than a media event. Nor does it choose to linger on the numerous rumors and conspiracies surrounding Tupac's murder.Shakur and director Lauren Lazin wisely decide to let Tupac's voice carry the film. Lazin wisely refrains from using the masterful propagandistic gimmicks of a Michael Moore documentary. There are no distracting interviews or massivelyedited montages. As a result the movie has a lyrical sacred tone. History has mystified Pac as a martyr for West Coast gangsta rap although during his lifetime he only released one such album. Few choose to remember that Death Row was the twilight of his life that he spent the first halfdecade of his career recording in the East where he grew up. It is here that the film takes its cue.Resurrection lays bare a magnetic arrogant charismatic spirit that immediately affirms why Pac remains one of rap's only true megastars. Though the film is not hard enough on how his growing obstinacy may have hastened his demise it does not shy away from the controversy the premonitions of death the sex abuse conviction and the inflated ego. The result is a welldrawn sketch of man aware of his genius but haunted by demons a tortured soul navigating a realm more thuggish than he was at his core a contradiction which plays as a general commentary on rap's manufactured images.This movie's production value alone easily outclasses nearly every other cinematic work that has ever pretended to be about hiphop. It bears little resemblance to How High or Belly or to the shameless selfpromotion of the vanity project 8 Mile which was so sanitized as to kill any revelations it might have made about its star Eminem the most high profile rapper to yet arise. I don't understand how someone could praise 8 Mile for its beauty and honesty it isn't and then criticize this film.By contrast the sincerity of Resurrection solidifies Pac's reputation as the only rapper that matters.' It shows why he is peerless and maybe the greatest artist the genre has yet produced whatever can be said about his music as an intelligent personality there is simply no one else in his class. He is so much more painfully relevant than all star rappers and the sharpness of his observations on everything from politics to poverty leaves dust in the eyes of all his contemporaries. He represents a paradigm that has become alltoorare in a musical form now dominated by cartoon images a constructive rather than destructive pointofview.A ball of contradictions Tupac is finally much more complex and brilliant than most people would expect. People are uninformed and uninterested in hiphop probably will get little out of this movie. Those who know will realize that the biggest tragedy is that not that Tupac died before reaching his full potential but that other young black men with similar sensibilities rarely reach his level of visibility. 9.510.".

Adding to the Sunset Boulevard feeling is that the story starts in Las Vegas where he was killed and then rewinds to the beginning of his life.

He isn't a hero or he at least didnt have enough time to transform into one but I think the message was quite clear Give black people a chance and they can do great things.  That's pretty much what this movie is about and it can be enjoyed on many levels by different races simply because of  struggle.";

I have followed 'Pac for almost 10 years now and my obsession for him has only grown deeper and deeper as the years months even days have passed since his departure from the music game.When I first heard about this film I thought it was going to be another video release accounting his legacy and mystery. I had no idea that it had a theatrical release date until a few months ago. Then I started hearing the hype behind it and really started to anticipate it strongly. I informed all my friends and anyone else who shared the same  passion of 'Pac as I of it's existence and when it was close to release. After reading some very positive advance reviews from Rolling Stone and a few other publications my anxiety only increased. It hits it's peak when I saw that ROGER EBERT gave it 3 12 out of a possible 4 stars. I saw the film tonight at an 800 showing fully prepared sportin' my 'Pac t shirt ticket stub in my hand and an unmistakable grin of happiness of things to come. One word OUTSTANDING. Afeni Mtv and Paramount were really really really seriously devoted to this project!I don't want give anything at all away to either serious 2pac devotees or casual fans but EVERYTHING you ever needed to know or wanted to know about him is presented in ACES. I rated this documentary a 9 out of 10 stars on the Imdb scale. To sum up I really and truly believe it is an enormous shame that some people just don't understand or get how iconic and influential Tupac was on both the music industry and to a certain extent society as well. He was WAY WAY more than just a rapper he was an IMPACT!2PAC FOR EVER.".

I've seen a number of other documentaries based on the Shakur's life and they make me sick. For one thing those films make him out to be some sort of prophet or messiah feeding into the myth that that's exactly who he was. However by allowing Tupac to tell his own story both his fans and detractors alike can finally get a glimpse of who this man truly was as a person. In this film from Tupac's very own words Tupac is not made out to be the monster that some people would like to easily dismiss him as but but he is also not portrayed as a saint nor are his many troubles with the law ignored. From this movie the clear conclusion is that Tupac Shakur was ultimately a good wellmeaning person whose flawed philosophies and poor choices in the people he chose to surround himself with ultimately lead to his destruction. However through tenacity and hard work he has become the bestselling hip hop artist in history even from beyond the grave.".

The film isnt about his friends and family getting interviewed and recalling facts.....It's real interviews of him in the studio in court on MTV personal interviews and live accounts of him being him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gangsta' Rap artist Tupac Shakur was gunned down on the streets of Las Vegas in 1996 the end result of the life he led and the people he knew. He was 25. The documentary 'Tupac Resurrection' takes an unusual and interesting approach to its subject allowing the deceased singer to speak to us as it were directly from the grave. The film begins with him commenting on his own murder then tracing back over the events of his life as a means of both setting the record straight and trying to make some sense out of all that happened to him in his very brief time here on earth.The film directed by Lauren Lazin relies primarily on interviews Tupac gave throughout his short career supplemented with some additional commentary from those who knew him best. Though he became a lightning rod of controversy due to both his criminal activities and his provocative i.e. violent sexist lyrics Tupac saw himself more as a 'voice of the people' using his music as a vehicle for reaching out to and connecting with the downtrodden impoverished blacks living in the kinds of ghettoes from which he himself sprang. However even many wellknown black leaders and spokespersons had trouble accepting Tupac's rather rosecolored definition of himself. What's most interesting about 'Tupac Resurrection' is the dichotomy it establishes between the violence drug use and criminal activities which played so prominent a part in Tupac's life and the genial reflective almost apologetic tone of so much of what we hear him saying. It's hard to know just how much of what has found its way into this film is really raw truth and how much is sugarcoated revisionism designed to 'resurrect' and burnish a man's posthumous image and reputation. His views on women come out particularly incoherent and unresolved. Yet 'Tupac Resurrection' is an intriguing documentary because it gives us a glimpse not only into a strangely conflicted individual but also into the even more bizarre world of corporate thuggery he inhabited. Like many artists who have attempted to speak for the 'little people' Tupac became a victim of his own success and celebrity living the kind of pampered lifestyle that most of the people he was singing about would clearly never know. It's a conflict as old as art itself and it is one that Tupac for understandable reasons was never able to resolve in his own life. Interestingly however his brutal death at the hands of murderous rivals demonstrated that he never made it quite so far from his roots as his lavish lifestyle might otherwise have suggested.As a document the film traces Tupac from his early years as the child of two Black Panther members  a pedigree that he believes set him on the path to social crusader early on through his youth in poverty his exposure to literature and drama at a performing arts high school in Baltimore his early attempts at performing his meteoric rise in the music industry his years as a controversial celebrity his burgeoning film career his continuing battles with police the first attempt on his life his conviction for rape his time in prison and finally to the rivalry between his own West Coast label Death Row Records and the East Coast label Bad Boy Records which ultimately led to his untimely death. For that little bit of history alone the film is worth watching.As someone who knew very little about the life of Tupac  and even less about his music  before watching the movie I found him to be both appealing and repellant frightening and charismatic. The film leaves the audience feeling as conflicted as the subject  which is what a truly successful documentary should do after all.".

After seeing this movie I understand that Tupac had a life worth making a documentary about but I did not like the approach the filmmakers took.  I really wanted to like this movie.  Parts of it were really well done but it was so biased that I cannot honestly recommend it.  It was more like a commercial for Tupac's image than a documentary on his life.Its amazing how many interviews Tupac gave in his life.  We can see that he was an intelligent and affective storyteller.  However a person's life cannot be understood just by the way that person sees him or herself.  A person's life also needs to be judged by other people's points of views. This could have been a great film if only the filmmakers had shown interviews with important people in Tupac's life such as his mother his sister his teachers in school the artists he rapped with his producers etc.  It was also a little difficult for a person unacquainted with Tupac's life and the world of gangsta rap music to fully understand the time line in which these events occurred.I liked the visual style of the film though especially that 3D effect a lot of the photographs had.  Those helicopter shots in Las Vegas and of the Golden Gate Bridge were beautiful too.  Overall TUPAC RESURRECTION is a flawed film that had a lot of potential.My grade5 out of 10".

Since watching it when it was first released over 10 years ago I have now seen it probably well over 20 times.This documentary takes you through Tupac's life from his days as a child growing up in poverty to his final days when he was shot. It is told in his own words using his own voice. All his old interviews have been edited and put in an order in which this story can be told it is done so well that you would not even think that it was done this way. His mother who created this film did an absolutely fantastic job.As this is created by his mother she has all the rights to his music interviews photos poems etc. The way the whole feature was put together is hard to believe that Tupac had no impact in the making of it it is truly outstanding.I don't want to say anything too much as I don't want to give anything away just go and see it! You don't have to be a massive Tupac fan or even a massive hiphop fan to appreciate this. A successful documentary will show you the whole story and more importantly both sides to a story the ups and downs and all the controversy which is exactly what this documentary does. Outstanding.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Tupac Resurrection is made such a compelling documentary because rather than a documentarian detail the life motives and opinions of the late rap icon Tupac Shakur old interview compilations poetry excerpts excerpts taken from Shakur's colorful music and much more are played in order for him to tell his own life story despite no longer being with us. This provides for one of the most personal documentaries I have yet to see especially considering that it would've been much easier to hire a narrator to analyze Shakur's upbringing rise to fame untold controversy and his untimely death in 1996.When Shakur died he left us with a plethora of content some of which had been released some of which would later see a release on his label Death Row Records. Tupac Resurrection even contains some seldomheard music from the man himself and even emphasizes on Shakur's handwritten poetry which describes his mother who was a devoted Black Panther and his father  whom he didn't know until later in his life  who was also an activist for AfricanAmericans. Growing up in an unstable home where violence was prominent and alternate living conditions were difficult to arrange Shakur would often emulate the behavior of characters on sitcoms like Different Strokes which revolved around a big happy family  something Shakur craved.Shakur had the fortunate circumstance of being exposed to the arts and the theater when we was very young and read and admired William Shakespeare throughout his entire life. He recognized his good fortune by seeing others in his neighborhood not even know who he was talking about when he would try to hold a conversation with them on plays art theater or whathaveyou. After leaving his mom's house as a teenager Shakur looked to role models on the streets which helped build the Shakur we know today.The film shows Tupac as a commanding rugged philosopher who would always emphasize the word thug and his personal motto thug life. However the way he defined thug was much different than the contemporary dictionary definition of the world. Shakur states that a thug in his mind is a prideful underdog  somebody who has nothing but still holds their head up and works to make something. What's the difference between me saying 'I don't give a f?' and Patrick Henry saying 'Give me liberty or give me death?' Shakur asks.Directly after the scenes where Shakur is defining thug show Shakur working in efforts to bring the East CoastWest Coast sides of the rap game together in a social gathering that served as a truce in the nineties. Shakur stands tall on stage rapping his heart out before imploring the people at the gathering to stop the violence and he'll continue to organize benefit concerts as a token for his appreciation.When Shakur explains his music however is when he can be a deeply contradictory figure. Despite his music both equal parts powerful and empowering Shakur's actual music and his explanations and analysis of his music frequently seemed to come at a crossroads. This isn't as big of an issue as it may seem. Shakur despite being rugged tough and thuggish the word is employed here with his definition in mind he was also incredibly vulnerable and his explanations of his work reflect a more sentimental or compassionate side of him that may or may not have been an afterthought. Regardless even his perspective on certain issues makes one think more than the average rapper today. In one scene Shakur tells us that the only reason the Vietnam War ended was because we saw the horror that took place over there with other wars we kind of just assumed people were dying in a beautiful civil way When the time comes for Shakur's brief but significant career as an actor to be discussed one can see that through his methods of preparation and focus when portraying another character that Shakur was nothing other than a method actor or somebody that invests in and studies their character for an ample amount of time in order to perfect a role. From his memorably gritty performance as the main antagonist in the streetdrama Juice to the sweeter softer side of him shown in the film Poetic Justice Shakur demonstrated a diverse characteractor mentality despite being so young and impressionable in the industry.Finally Tupac Resurrection looks at the controversy Shakur endured not in the form of concerned politicians and talking heads in terms of what music their children were listening to but how Shakur found himself wrapped up in several sexual assault cases all of which he vehemently denied. With the aura Shakur had created about himself through his music and ideas he proved that while you can be one of the smartest thinkers in a dangerous industry you're still part of a very dangerous industry which only further proved true as Shakur was shot and killed in Las Vegas in September 1996 in a driveby shooting.Tupac Resurrection is a fantastic display of documentary filmmaking by director Lauren Lazin who allows Shakur to discuss ideas and topics in his own words so the film's tagline goes and provide us access to a great deal of exceptional content from the man himself. It is one of the strongest most powerful music documentaries i have yet to see.Directed by Lauren Lazin.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll preface this by saying that I was not a fan of rapper Tupac Shakur when he was alive.  His death and yes I DO believe he is dead hasn't done anything to make me fall in love with his work.  The documentary TUPAC RESURRECTION attempts to shed some light on the young artist .  The movie was produced by his mother in connection with MTV Films.  The format used for telling his story is unique  Shakur is shown in various interviews telling his tale while incidents from his life are shown.  Starting with his childhood in New York born to a woman who was in the Black Panther movement.  He and his family then moved to Baltimore where Shakur was enrolled in a performing arts school where he took ballet and acting lessons.  Kind of a bizarre beginning for one who would become one of the leading voices in rap.  Not only that but one who seemed to embrace the violent Thug Life that he spoke of in his songs and had tattooed on his body. RESURRECTION follows Tupac from the Bronx Baltimore onto the West Coast where he began to really gain attention.  Both for his music and movies as well as his runins with the law.  As he put it I didn't start to sell records until I had a record.  Shakur claims that he was providing the voice for all of those who were in poverty and couldn't make their voices heard.  All well and good but why the violence directed at other people who were in the same boat as he was as opposed to the people in power?  There is a segment where he makes known his dislike for such artists as Spike Lee Eddie Murphy and the Hughes brothers he was arrested for an assault on them a fact that he did not deny feeling that they are sellouts and cowardly.  Needless to say Shakur's outspokenness makes him a target from both authority figures and his peers.  Of course it is believed that that inyourface attitude was what got him shot twice in separate incidents. Most of what is shown in RESURRECTION I already knew from what people had told me and what I've read.  The movie didn't shed any new light on him. My guess is that this movie is already preaching to the converted and will be a hit amongst them.  All others like me will still be out in the cold.".

Not only did he have good music but he also had a story to tell and it influences not only his fans but other rap artists. This documentary was very interesting to watch and I was amased to see what a strong minded man he was which is why I respect so even more after seeing this masterpiece. Eminem 50 cent Jada Pinkett smith and Snoop Dogg are one of the few that have expressed their feelings towards his death. It was a tragic moment that is defenately not forgotten but he has left us more music that gives most of us the impression that he is still alive. From his childhood memories to his career he explains it all in his own words. This is no doubt one of the best documentaries ever to be released.".

He told us during the film that he makes mistakes. And sometimes his mouth is too big and that he can sometimes be arrogant. However the good parts about him seem to outweigh the bad ones. And he really got to talk about being a Gemini and how we have two sides to us. A lot of folks don't understand Gemini's and think we're complex.Although I got to see it for free last night i'm definately going to go back to support it when it hits theaters on Friday. It told me a lot of stuff about Pac and even about the Biggie situation that you would have never known if you left it up to VH1 MTV or even BET. I recommend you go and check this out if you're a fan or even if you are interested in seeing an intelligent person speak. This was the best movie I've seen all year long.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to AMG.com 2Pac became the unlikely martyr of gangsta rap and a tragic symbol of the toll its lifestyle exacted on urban black America. At the outset of his career it didn't appear that he would emerge as one of the definitive rappers of the '90s  he started out as a secondstring rapper and dancer for Digital Underground joining only after they had already landed their biggest hit.This 2003 documentary film Tupac Resurrection directed by Lauren Lazin is about the life of slain rap artist Tupac Amaru Shakur and is both a testament to his career and legacy and is also an insightful look into 2Pac the man behind the controversy.There's no question of the impact of 2Pac's legacy on rap music and all of music in general. He's sold almost as much posthumous material as Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix combined. As a fan of the hiphop culture and rap music I have nothing but love for 2Pac even though my greatest admiration of him has always been his music and his message never his mediaexaggerated persona and seemingly contradictory philosophies.But at the same time it's very distressing for me to realize that he is best remembered for his death much rather than his life and achievements such as his Thug Life code and One Nation project which was aimed at squashing EastWest beef and curiously enough still hasn't gotten off the ground.Thug Life and Black Panther political rhetoric were his signature. His don'tgiveafk attitude permeated his early rap career on records like 2pacalypse Now 1991 and Strictly For My N.I.G.G.A.Z. 1993 all of this following his brief stint with rapPfunk heroes Digital Underground. His black militancy stance did of course catch the furor of every moralminded politician in America as he did also join the ranks of every other rap artist who came under fire by the antirap circles active in this country.Even after seeing this film I'm reaffirmed in my beliefs about 2Pac's depth and message as an artist. He was one of the most gifted rappers that the industry has and ever will see. His performances in films like Juice 1992 and Above the Rim 1994 were thematically deep intense and incredibly real almost too real for some people to handle.Of course 2Pac and his friend the Notorious B.I.G. had beef put their respective coasts on the map and were both killed seven months apart from another  2Pac died on September 13 1996 the day after my 11th birthday that year six days after being wounded in a Las Vegas driveby shooting the Notorious B.I.G. was killed in a Los Angeles driveby on March 9 1997. Both men came to be recognized in subsequent years as the tragic symbols of the East CoastWest Coast rivalries between artists and a lesson to future generations about not just mo' money and mo' problems but the entire industry as well.They both died so other artists could continue in hiphop. I can recall television interviews from the time with other prominent rap artists such as Nas or Lord Jamar of Brand Nubian both of whom seemed hardly overcome with any kind of grief over the murder of 2Pac but were lamenting the fact that people were now idolizing him because of the fact he was dead.Lazin's film offers some careful and thoughtful insight into the slain rapper's revolutionary and troubled life from being born a month after his mother former Black Panther Afeni Shakur was released from jail after having to face a laundry list of bogus conspiracy charges to his impoverished upbringing his rap and film careers and finally his death and resurrection as 2Pac himself narrates his own story from beyond the grave.2Pac wasn't perfect and I think that was something he frequently acknowledged and this film using hours of archive footage and his songs allows for the audience to see the different sides to his personality. Even in today's world of 2005 I'm still a bit angry with him because of the so many mistakes that he made and letting his ego and emotions get the better of him especially when he seemed to know better.He made a number of contradictory statements in his songs and image and committed a number of harmful actions against himself and others many of which may or may not have played into his death. For me it was his getting involved with Marion Suge Knight Death Row Records and the whole EastWest rivalries that brought about his downfall and 2Pac seemed to recognize that his own demise was imminent.Also his frequent court troubles like the alleged sexual sodomizing of a female fan in 1994 and his fight with the Hughes Brothers on the set of Menace II Society 1993 were also detrimental to his character and image. But again I still respect 2Pac because he took the time out to acknowledge his mistakes and at least try to correct them.Lauren Lazin has directed a skillful and poignant film that lets its deceased subject matter speak for itself. The life of Tupac Amaru Shakur is an intense study of progress and change seen through the life of a revolutionary artist who tried his best to change himself and the troubled world that he lived in.1010".

I would ask him if it was planned that the number seven was like a thread in his life and why he was that fascinated by Niccol Machiavelli. In addition I might ask what specific ideas he had about society and if he thought that there was a way out of human's selfdestruction. I would also tell him that I appreciate his work and his social commitment.He was one of the world's best but not a lot of people saw this side.

	schema:headline " Very little action but fine character study starring Christopher Walken.";
	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Walken and his girlfriend played by Cindi lauper are both New Yorkers so I'm certain they both felt right at home in their roles. Many who like fast action snappy dialog types of films will be bored with this one. However for those like me who enjoy a great welldeveloped character study carried out in about 88 minutes this is worth a viewing.Walken plays a safecracker who has served his time and trying to go straight working as a mechanic and paying for his old aunt to stay in a home run by nuns. Always on the verge of debt the sale of his car is saboutaged by someone wanting to get him to do one more job the safe at the armored car office. So pressured from all sides he agrees.In the safe his halpess helper posing as a cousin from Ireland gets Walken trapped and caught by the cops.  He gets out of it when the business owner who also runs an illegal laundering operation fails to press charges. We see walken going back into Lauper's bar presumably to live straight from then on.The story thus is sorta victimless. Although Walken and the others are helped by the one money bag that is successfully stolen by the Irish guy then split up it was money illegally gotten. We are I suppose to forgive Walken because he had no choice. The most interesting scene was where he was practicing cracking the 3 different safe combinations within 6 minutes to avoid setting off the alarm.The DVD is budget all the way  Dolby AC3 sound no menu no extras. However the sound and picture are not deficient given the formats. Just a wellacted lowbudget film and I enjoyed it.".

Cindi Lauper is good piling on a thick NYC accent first time I've seen her in a movie. She's likeable very grounded in the movie. The supporting cast is very real. The result is you don't like many of them a lot. They're average people and we see them in less than flattering scenes. To that extent you do like them because they're dealing the best way they know with events.The movie works in part because of what it doesn't do. It doesn't make us endure one of those speeches the wife or girlfriend or best pal gives the excon just before he's about to commit to one more heist. Here Lauper just tells Walken to hit the road she knows somethings up and it's gonna spoil the plans they made. Very lowkey. No need to get into melodrama everybody knows the Walken character they're not going to change his mind with wailing.I wouldn't drive across town to see the film but if it's convenient this is a good character study. It has some humor too but only as a byproduct of things going on not a goal. The tone of it reminded me of the movie Thief but only in the sense that we're watching people who live in a realm most of us never go. I'd rather see this kind of movie than another one of those idiotic grossout comedies.".

Casablanca African Queen Mildred Pierce to name a few of my favorites  That is straightforward in telling the story and no superfluous fluff. The screenwriters could have easily gone astray in this film by adding love scenes between the daughter and the boy or even Lauper and Walken's character but they deftly avoided this and stuck to the story. I enjoyed each and every performance and it is a shame that because of the Academy's focus on mainstream cinema Christopher Walkens will probably be overlooked at Oscar time. He conveyed so much with his facial expressions alone that it is easy to watch this movie again just for his low key performance.My favorite scene in the film was where the Walkens character is practicing opening safes and his cohorts are watching this. Near the end of it they are shown asleep on the couch while Vic is still hard at work on the locks. This reminded me of the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane who slept while Christ 'watched'. I am not saying Walkens character is a Christ figure. But in this he and Christ were at one they took their craft seriously. And later when the 'disciples' begin to loose faith in Walken's character he confidently parades out of the house and announces that the next day the heist will come down.One minor glitch Walkens character didn't impress me as the type who would botch an automobile repair job so at that point I felt something was fishy but I quickly forgot about that fact and rode the crest of the story. The minor characters were all equal to their roles and I was pleasantly pleased with Cindy Lauper. Give this one 9 out of 10 and hope it garners a Oscar nomination.".

All the supporting players do a fine job but this is Walken's picture and Walken is a great actor one of the greatest working today.Watch how subtly Walken plays the early scenes where he refuses to take the job and how consistently Connell has his actors play emotional scenes in a minorkey.  Connell could have written big emotional scenes could have given his characters dozens of oneliners zingers but then he would have made The Score or Heist.

After watching this movie my first reaction to my friend who watched it with me was.. wow that really sucked.. now .. don't get me wrong this movie doesn't fail because of the people in the movie its just the overall style of the movie.. now I'm a huge fan of bringing the least hollywood into a movie but this movie is a bit dry.I felt there was a few strong points to this film such as not showing silly things as a romance between the daughter and the housemate  which i'm still uncertain actually who he is   and another good job in this film is overall PLOT... although again i'll go back again and make note of how the style of this movie HAS GREAT POTENTIAL but just fails.After thinking about this movie more I would recommend seeing it once but this is not a movie with high replay value although who knows..  If walken was not in this movie for sure it would be alot worse..".

	schema:headline " WalkenThe Greatest Actor In The Universe!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah the joys of watching Walken I could  watch him read the phonebook and be captivated hey he should do that sometime This film is an excellent one. It has a very nice lowkey mood. It takes place in Queens where I live and breathe It has a great safecracking heist plot as well as enjoyable  scenes of Walken practicing his craft. see this movie when you are feeling well i don't know if i should say down but when you feel that you're miserable i guess this is a fine film to watchnot that its depressing but I mean thelowkey approach works perfectly and  the score fits in perfectly with the movie. which i for one enjoyed here more and really only noticed during the endcredits    and it has actuall characters as opposed to cardboard cutouts that the actors take and make nbeautiful music with.  . The real joy in watching this movie is in the performances and in them the way the story unfolds. It is so great to see walken acting   in a calm  role that is much more of a person then the usuall role he takes the scenestealing villian which I must admit I am a huge fan of but walken is so much more than that as witnessed in great films like this andI'm not comparing films here natrually his oscar wining role in The Deer Hunter  Ive seen him on stage in Joyce's The Dead and a play which he wrote himself some years ago called Him Ah that was a great play seriously best damn play! Ok so you know I think the world of Walken and that any and every movie could benefit form giving him a bit part in it but I don't mean to take away from the rest of the cast here  and this film is excellently acted all around I mean this is truly a character film and this movie simply could not work if they didn't have a good cast First of all Who knew Cyndi Lauper could act?? I mean I liked the three or four epiosdes she did on Mad about You but she wasn't holding her own with walken there. While she's not in that many scenes she's surprisingly good  and therefore hope to see her in something else that's good  Donal Louge who's everywhere now thoughts I once had about Walken  continues to build up his resume quite impressivelyand of course Peter McDonald as the instigator of the whole film He has a reletively thick irish accent but if you listen carefully its not hard at all to get what he's saying  and Jose Zuniga and Vera Farmiga and oh hey Tom Noonan who makes a brief return from career obscurity or is it oblivion at this stage to play that wacky supplier of safebustin materials His career should be resurrected if only briefly Ok well the characters are great and its the actors who bring the characters to life so they deserved acolades for that but the biggest accolade has to be for writer director O'Connell who made a heist film that's really a character film and how many films can we say that about.I honestly will keep an eyeout for his next film. I hope that Abel Ferrar is taking notes after The New Rose Hotel although The king of NY is awesome and The Funeral is terrific too but still I'm digressing again Its low key charm was nothing short of brillant and its running time well who needs running time was without a doubt just right. While not like a fast movie the movie moves pretty swiftly as it reaches its ending without any real lull in the procedings  Ok while the movie isnt perfect i did  find myself wishing that walken would just get to deliver a line in signature style which he does very quickly you know the whole theatric gestural thing that i loveand he does have some good lines that he gets to deliver deadpan while remainning perfectly in character. i'm beginning to think there's something wrong with you. is just such an example So in Summary as you can tell I am a huge Christopher Walken fan and even with some of the dreck he's  been inhe's always entertaining and this film I can say with the utmost confidence is not dreck and if you're in the right mood really enjoyable. So Thank You Mr. O' Connell for writing a good script for the greatest actor in the universe!!!!".

	schema:headline " Great subdued acting utterly ruined by illogical plot twist";
	schema:reviewBody "The Opportunists is finely acted. Obviously the writerdirector gave strict orders to all the actors to use a subdued style. I usually prefer movies with this style because it makes the movie more realistic although a little less exciting. This is the main reason why Rosemary's Baby is a great film while The Exorcist although more exciting is a very good film. Back to The Opportunists. The director's overall style mood and pace were excellent too. Christopher Walken's performance was the best part of the movie but that shouldn't surprise anyone. Then why does this movie go beyond failing miserably? Warning! the criticism I am about to give will give away key plot twists. The movie fails miserably because it completely falls apart during the middle of the heist scene where Christopher Walken's partner shockingly and I claim intentionally locks Walken inside the money vault of an armored car company then presses the alarm button. This act of sabotage would make perfect sense if Walken's partner either stood to gain by the act or was out for revenge. Not only does Walken's partner not gain by this treacherous deed he greatly hurts himself! At the moment when the partner slammed the vault door between himself and Walken the following facts existed  The partner had one small bag of cash the viewer is never told how much in his hand while there were many more bags and boxes of cash remaining in the money vault where Walken stood. If I had to estimate the percentage of cash in the partner's bag vs. all the cash I would say 10. In other words Walken's partner could have gotten about 25 because there were 4 partners overall of all the cash in the vault but opted for just 10. Was he blind? Did he not see all the boxes of cash inside the vault?  There was no time pressure on Walken and his partner to collect all the cash in the vault because once Walken had solved the combination lock the alarm was knowingly disabled. Also the 2 guards who were sitting just outside the vault were in on the caper. So they had hours maybe as many as 6 to collect all the paper cash we are not talking about heavy gold bars or large paintings. Walken and his partner could have transferred all the cash to a car outside the building in about 15 minutes!  By intentionally locking Christopher Walken in the vault the partner knows that Walken will be apprehended. Doesn't the partner realize that if Walken is apprehended Walken and the 2 security guards will tell the police everything they know about the partner including a physical description his accent Irish and where to find fingerprints that he left in Walken's house and business! Since the partner was clearly reducing his own chances of a clean getaway with a large take then the only other explanation for intentionally locking Walken and the money in the vault was revenge. This scene would make sense if it turned out that the partner had a secret hatred for Christopher Walken. I was expecting the movie to show that many years earlier when Walken was a steady safe cracker that Walken either stole from the partner's father or bumbled some aspect of a heist which caused the partner's father to do jail time thereby forcing the partner to grow up fatherless. But no such explanation ever came to fruition. Less than an hour after the partner runs away from the alarm with the money bag in hand he enters a train station ready to continue his getaway but never gets on the train. He just turns around exits the train station and eventually apologizes to Walken. The final 12 hour of the movie is so detached from reality that it ruins all the good aspects of the earlier part of the movie  Christopher Walken is let out of jail with no bail!  The main police investigator hires Walken to repair his own personal car this is not undercover work!  The owner of the armored car company doesn't press charges doesn't want bad publicity concerning laundered money  Walken and his treacherous partner become more friendly as if nothing happened!  The 4 thieves get to keep and spend their small take with no apparent pressure from the police!  Basically everyone lives happily ever after! Keep in mind that this movie is clearly not directed for kids who might overlook an illogical plot twist like it has. In a world where most movies fall apart at the end I nominate this one as the all time king of movies which fall apart at the end and are not science fiction. Another way of stating this award I bestow on The Opportunists is it has the highest ratio of believability in the beginning of the movie to believability in the end of the movie. This movie's only usefulness should be as required viewing at film schools to demonstrate the tendency to rush through the end of movies thereby ruining them. If the writerdirector was trying to make a study of a smart talented safe cracker surrounded by 3 incompetents as opposed to 2 incompetents and 1 saboteur then this scene still does not make sense because Walken's partner did not act incompetently when he shut the vault door he clearly acted intentionally. The words that he used and his facial expressions clearly show him closing the vault door intentionally. I finally came to the logical conclusion just to stop my mind from short circuiting that the writerdirector may have been stating that sometimes a person can be so incompetent that he appears to be acting as a saboteur even though he is not. If the director intended for the partner to lock Walken in intentionally then can anyone out there answer why the partner locked Walken in?".

The premise an excon decides to pull one last heist because he's so far in debt at the urging of a relative just didn't seem too interesting. Being a big Christopher Walken fan I decided to watch it anyway.  I was captured immediately.  You see Walken's character Vic doing his best to be an honest mechanic to pay his bills to keep his ailing mother in a decent home instead of the state hospital and make a life with his daughter and girlfriend.  The poor guy seems to destroy everything he touches the pain and selfaccusation in his face when a client makes a remark about being a screwup makes you want to cry for Vic.  Financial and emotional pressures mount until he agrees to do a final job.  Because of this he loses the most important things in his life his girlfriend and his selfrespect.  I won't spoil the rest of the movie but as events spiral out of control you want to catch Vic yourself make it all better take him out of such a cruel hopeless world.  The ending was a surprise too.  You feel sure there can be no good resolution to the whole thing but there is.  You'll have to watch it yourself.  It is a touching movie the characterization is excellent. The morals presented aren't the best but it is still a wonderful movie.".

The problems that Walken's character faces are fairly boring and the director doesn't help out by maintaining a languid pace the entire time.  There was absolutely no suspense in this film.The script was not cohesive.  There are many boring secondary characters who come and go and the whole thing feels like an overly long TV episode. There wasn't much humour.  Some of the dramatic scenes were very well done such as Lauper telling Walken to get out but others were quite bad.I did like quite a few of the shots in the movie.  I always admire a director who knows how to shoot cars and the opening shots do a great job showing off a nice Buick Riviera.  I also liked a few of the shots of Vic's van and there's an orbit shot of Peter MacDonald later on that was pretty good.Overall however I would not watch this again nor reccomend that anyone else see it.".

But there's no film I love more or more enjoy rewatching.  One caveat though I've seen both the subtitled and the dubbed print and the English dubbing frankly comes close to ruining the movie. Ron Perlman dubs himself and is fine and some of the other adult English actors are perfectly OK though they tend to be blander than the French originals. But most of the children are terrible and with her own voice it's Judith Vittet's extraordinary performance all the more extraordinary considering she was nine at the time that helps give La Cit the genuine emotional centre that some viewers don't feel it has.But I'll come back to that.  In any version at least Jeunet and Caro's astonishing visual flair and artistry come over. I can't think of a film that has such a concentration of memorable shots  time and again especially watching on DVD with a freezeframe facility you realize how many beautiful compositions JeanPierre Jeunet gives us though the cast of characters could easily fill a freak show and the sets are dark and quite unglamorous in themselves the cinematography is gorgeous and the miseenscne often strangely elegant. It has a look all of its own perfect for a modern urban fairytale.  The music too is gorgeous one of the finest scores by David Lynch's regular musical collaborator Angelo Badalamenti.Fairy tale is I think the best generic startingpoint for this film so long as you think Grimm rather than Disney. Unlike Delicatessen it isn't really a comedy though it has comic elements. And the plot works according to its own logic even if the progression from scene to scene is occasionally a bit lumpy or obscure.  Krank the astonishing Daniel Emilfork grown prematurely old because he cannot dream uses a cult of blind messianic preachers to abduct children from a decaying industrial port and steal their dreams  but they have only nightmares and Krank falls ever deeper into despair and evil.  It's up to the orphan pickpocket Miette and a nonetoobrainy circus strongman One to put a stop to him.  This rich idea is elaborated with all sorts of visual conceits and eccentric characters  Jeunet mounts for example a couple of astonishing sequences in which chains of unlikely effects proceed from the smallest of causes  but never at the expense of the central relationship of One and Miette.In a sense Miette like Krank has grown old too fast the orphaned streetchildren of this city are savvy and unsentimental and never seem to have had a childhood meanwhile there's something deeply childish in various ways about most of the adults.  Sensitively directed and never overacting Judith Vittet's Miette gradually thaws and Ron Perlman brings a lot of sympathy and pathos to what could have been an oafish cartoonish role Jeunet gives plenty of space and subtlety to their graduallydeveloping friendship and dares to do what I suspect no English director would dare to do at the moment which is to make their relationship innocently sexualized. Neither of them is really a grownup but it's still an extremely risky move exploring the first stirrings of prepubescent sexuality while trying not to be exploitative or prurient.  I do think the film pulls it off though I can imagine some viewers feeling distinctly uncomfortable with it. For me it's one of the most convincingly unsentimental and nuanced if mannered portrayals of childhood I've ever seen on the screen and there is real compassion and tenderness along the way as well as some darker twists and turns.It's a film that rewards analysis if you're prepared to surrender to its strange world with its strange rules. But it rewards the senses and the emotions too  and it radiates love of cinema as the perfect medium for sophisticated fantasy.  One elderly actress who appears towards the end Nane Germon acted  as Jeunet's DVD commentary points out  in Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la Bte about fifty years earlier there are by the way distinct references to the Beauty and the Beast story here and La Cit des enfants perdus deserves to join that film as one of the classic cinematic fairytales.  Pity about Marianne Faithfull over the closing credits though!".

The story was too confusing and the characters were extremely weird and twisted.

Speaking of visuals this movie has it in spades.  The environment that JeanPierre Jeunet created is out of this world.

The mood the soundtrack sets is perfect for the scenery and the superb acting by everybody including the kids just adds to the greatness of this flick.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of fantasy films. It's a mixed bag of a genre on all truth. Very rarely are there any great fantasy films. There are good ones or average ones that can merely get by on their looks. I do love the fact that fantasy films can paint such vivid and imaginative picturesque settings. As an example look at Legend. That was one of the best looking films ever made but the content of the film was not great. It was poorly scripted with hokey dialogue and a storyline aimed at 5 year olds with creatures and effects that would scare the pants off younger children. Now you look at the best ones and the rare ones that can be called classics with greats of other genres like Lord Of The Rings and in a more Scifi orientation Star Wars. City Of The Lost C children is a French fantasy aimed at a more mature audience member from 15 up really. It looks fantastic. The sets the costumes the effects the cinematography turn this 15 million dollar film into something looking far more epic and majestic in scope. Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro take joint plaudits and credit as directors Jeunut more responsible visually and Caro for the character and story. This is endlessly imaginative and immensely enjoyable and is very quirky.The story centres around a mad scientist Krank who is unable to dream because of this he is aging quickly and is old beyond his year. He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind. He kidnaps children from the nearby village and brings them to his lair a king of oilrig in the middle of surrounding sea. He is aided by his brothers who are four identical clones of each other unfortunately they all suffer from narcolepsy. Krank himself is a clone. His father who created them is now merely a brain in a tank and Krank was an unfortunate mistake who doesn't dream. The only clone who was right is an enigma called the original who has long since escaped the insanity of this evil lair only to be living underwater and a kind of insane junk collector. One day strong man One and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped. Thus far Krank's captives have proved unsuccessful in his quest for a cure because they all suffer terrible nightmares partly due to his own nastiness. All this latest young victim responds to is food he seems to have no fear and it seems he could be the one just as long as Krank keeps feeding him. One sets out on a quest to find his brother meeting Miete a young a troublesome orphan girl in the process. It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.The cast are great. Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy. He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act something which has held him back somewhat because people have never really cast him as a leading action man although in truth he's not blessed with good looks. The interestingly named Rufus a Juenet stalwart is also very good as the clones while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank. Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette. Anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing. The sets the impressionistic and exaggerated designs are brilliant. It is typically French in it's verve. This is a fantasy fans wet dream believe me! ".

The decoration give a baroque sensation of always being in small places yet it's a full city populated of bizarre characters as the story itself. The acting it's great. I'm quiet impressed for the flawless french that Ron Perlman show us he's just simply astounding. I cannot say less of Judith Vittet that being a child in that time she was a tremendous actress. The two have a good chemistry as a girl mature as an adult and a grow up man with the innocence of a kid.I can't say that this is a movie that everyone would like because it's not. It have a little of nonsense that might be not of the like of all the public. And all the dark atmosphere might be a little suffocating. So take the risk and watch it and then decide you love it or you hate it.".

	schema:headline " Wonderfully Bizarre";
	schema:reviewBody "Written for English class my freshman year in high school.Lights! Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet what makes a great movie?  In my opinion a great movie should include almost flawless acting a finely woven and gripping plot music that is both beautiful and suitable and great direction. Of course  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So for all the reasons above I consider The City Of Lost Children the best film of 1996.The plot of The City Of Lost Children is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called The City Of Lost Children hence the title.   Onethat is his name is a slowminded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse his wife is a midget he cannot dream and he has seven identical sons all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder.  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small but tough girl named Miette runs away from the school finds One and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief they go to Marcello a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song Who Will Take Your Dreams Away by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with youas does the movie itself long after the credits have rolled.The casting director of The City Of Lost Children PierreJacques Benochou sure knew what he was doing because there is not one poor or mediocre one for that matter performance in the whole film.  In fact I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful perhaps the best actor in the whole movie as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers yes he does play all of them and with fantastic results too.  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last but not least the children with Judith Vittet as Miette in a standout performance all carry out their roles with smashing results.Another reason for me choosing The City Of Lost Children as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caroa.k.a. Jeunet and Caro.  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are in my opinion masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and inyourface computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary the special effects of The City Of Lost Children however are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.Was the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away I do understand that this movie does have a select audience I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you it is still splendidly done.  Overall though The City Of Lost Children is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.".

It's a dark and often disturbing fairytale but nevertheless magical and childfriendly. Since this is a film by Marc Caro  JeanPierre Jeunet you simply know to expect a unique and surreal story remember Delicatessen? filled with extravagant characters and bizarre dreamscapes! It's enchanting to observe and quite challenging to follow as there's always some ingenious gimmick to distract your attention from the main plot. I got hooked on it right from the GENIUS opening sequence in which a child's dream about Santa Claus slowly turns into an eerie nightmare. The action then cuts to the main character the evil Krank who's unable to dream himself and hence kidnaps orphans in order to steal their dreams. Krank has an army of semihuman androids one brother cloned six times an uncanny midgetmother AND a malicious brain in a fish tank! Ron Perlman is a good guy for once! He portrays a simpleminded yet friendly strongman assisted in the search for his abducted little brother by a witty young girl. The City of Lost Children is an amazingly energetic and vivid adventure and no selfrespecting cinema fanatic can afford himherself to miss it! It's funny frightening emotional and intelligent all at once. The decors are mesmerizing the music is dazzling and the special effects are staggering. I can keep on mentioning good aspects but it all comes down to one thing watch this film!!! It's still regretfully underrated and we urgently need to change that!".

This is a confusing story from beginning to end it expands your mind reaches into your nightmares and creates a story that is part Dark City and part of a novel called The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman. Yes this film was everything and more. Not only visually beautiful but the creative and symbolic meaning of the actions and words of the characters are jaw dropping. Also there are so many substories in this film that reminded me of the style that Run Lola Run was done. This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens. Let me give you an example from this film There is a scene where the girl and One Ron Pearlmanalso a very biblical name are trying to escape from the two women who want their jewels. There are events that lead from a dog finding its female companion to a boat almost hittingsplitting the women in half. Wild coincidences...imagine this times ten and you have this film.Keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles so you are not only getting the true voice of the film but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input. This really shows the purpose behind making this film it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself. A movie about dreams and nightmares that takes place in a world of dreams and nightmares. Overall a heavily religious and symbolic film The City of Lost Children should be put at the top of your foreign film list. Put it in your DVD player open your mind and be ready for a wild and intense ride!!Grade  out of ".

When the gang of Cyclops kidnap Denree Joseph Lucien the little brother of the former whale hunter One Ron Perlman he is helped by the young street orphan girl Miette Judith Vittet who steals for the Siamese Pieuvre Genevive Brunet  Odille Mallet to reach the platform where Krank leaves with his cloned dwarf wife Mademoiselle Bismuth Mireille Moiss his six cloned sons Dominique Pinon and a brain and rescue the children.La Cit des Enfants Perdus is a mesmerizing movie with one of the most beautiful cinematography and music score of the cinema history. This surrealistic dark and bizarre fairytale is almost perfect and my only restriction is the quite confused screenplay. When I saw this movie for the first time in 1995 I was impressed with the stunning performance of the young actress Judith Vittet and I expected that she would become a star but eleven years later I have just read in IMDb that she quitted her promising career and now she is graduated in Economics Science. The soundtrack of Angelo Badalamenti is another wonderful work of this outstanding composer. I love the sequence that begins with the tear of Miette and ends with the ship hitting the harbor. I am also impressed with some sick twistedminded persons that can see pedophilia in the beautiful relationship of One and Miette. I have this movie on VHS but I have just bought the recently released DVD and I do not regret since this film deserves the better image and sound of the DVD. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Ladro de Sonhos Thief of Dreams".

The lastest victim is the tiny brother of a singlemindedly hunk called One  Ron Perlman  a fairground strongman who sets out in rescuing him . One was a former whale hunter who along with a little girl  Miette  Judith Vittet  pursue a way to to get his brother back . Meantime  they are pursued by the Cyclops  the deadly automatic flea  the mad deepsea diver and the evil Octopus siamese sisters  conjoined at the leg . The insane scientist Krank lives at a sea platform along with a dwarf woman  six cloned descendants  Dominique Pinon and a brain .This is a grotesque  gross gruesome and overlong fantasy with nice moments here and there . Although far too long  though  for its content an extremely fantastic flick from start to finish with some situations full of fascination and charm . Interpretations from the French cast are pretty good  but extremely rare  as Daniel Emilfork as a mad doctor who abducts kiddies to harvest their dreams and hoping they slow his aging process . Pitted against him is One well played by Ron Perlman  Guillermo Del Toro's regular player  he was the only American actor on set  Ron plays as a honest and simple bouncer  as strong as a horse . Other actors appearing and giving freak acting are the followings  Dominique Pinon Jean Claude Dreyfuss Mapi Galan  Jean Louis Trintignant  Ticky Holgado and Rufus .This one results to be a strange  bizarre  surrealist and haunting film set in a dystopian society in which several fantastic incidents take place . This peculiar movie has freaks galore  avantgarde costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier  breakgrounding special effects in charge by Pitof  and stateofart production design by Marc Caro  all of whose function seems chiefly to be as bizarre as possible .Exceptional photography by Darius Khondji  a prestigious cameraman with known titles as Seven 9th door  The beach  Wimbledon  Funny Games  The immigrant  Z lost city . It contains a magic and mysterious musical score by Angelo Baladamenti  David Lynch's usual. This is a FrenchSpanish coproduction financed by notorious producers as Elias Querejeta  Maria Victoria Herrero  Jose Luis Lopez and Claudio Ossard . The motion picture was well directed by Marc Caro and Jean Pierre Junet  though hard to follow . Caro has directed a few shorts  documentary and films as Dante 01  Delicatessen . While  the successful director Jean Pierre Jeunet has realized prestigious movies such as Delicatessen  Alien resurrection A very long engagement and Amelie played by his fetish actress Audrey Tautou . Fantasy buffs may enjoy total or partially of this  others will struggle to understand the half of it . Rating  610  acceptable and passable . Well worth watching .".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art which looked almost AztecSteampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s.But getting to the point what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably fcking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG13 and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants.Look its not that I don't get it. I understand what they were going for here its just that they fcked up In my opinion. To put it simply an otherwise chilling absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camerawork by the filmmakers. For instance the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his what I suppose you could call family scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate.In the end the film had so much potential and so much style to work with but it was wasted in favor of the film's ohsoquirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its ss into the camera lens.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sought out this film after seeing another film from the same production team that made the wonderful DELICATESSEN. However while I adored DELICATESSEN and gave it a very high score I wasn't nearly as impressed by CITY OF LOST CHILDRENmostly because this film seemed to emphasize set design and weirdness while plot seemed almost unimportant. In DELICATESSEN there were of course the weirdness and odd sets but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvementnone.In many ways the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's filmsparticularly BRAZIL. However once again BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.Now this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like itI did. But instead of an involving or funny film it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happeningand it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.Now usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100 sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.. At the same time some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this Ron Perlman who speaks no French in real life and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that but really I didn't think the story was that importantit was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.Overall I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it. I recommend it for those with an appreciation for the very weird and perhaps lovers of French cinema. All others proceed at your own risk.".

Greenaway knows how to disturb with depth. Here we have the Tim Burton syndrome. It should have been well enough known to avoid by 1995.I usually give a lot of credit to films which shoot high and fail. But these people only pretend to shoot high and so fail in an uninteresting way. Yet another example of the bankrupt system of French film subsidy you have to promote the French view.

Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story excellent acting skilled direction innovative special effects dreamy visuals and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt dismal town filled with orphans villains and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil while the kids are the heroes. However there is one good adult who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the island that is his laboratory. That is a simplified condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit I believe that the movie would have lost momentum had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly evocative and moving. It is not for everybody though some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood and complex narrative however that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability in so many areas story direction characterization visuals music and acting are all topnotch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.".

Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story excellent acting skilled direction innovative special effects dreamy visuals and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt dismal town filled with orphans villains and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil while the kids are the heroes. However there is one good adult who befriends the orphans.

No matter how different things are in the future his perspective doesn't change his wry sense of humor stays the same happily misplaced ragtime music plays over the movie and oldfashioned sight gags are employed complete with the occasional steppedup film speed.Allen has always done well playing virtually the same character in all of his movies but his talent as an on screen comedian is milestoned in this performance. He has the brilliance to mock even the most elusive and unnoticed physical conventions of screen acting for instance his whispering to Diane Keaton while they pose as doctors in the presence of several people close by. It's a nitpicky sense of humor that contributes greatly to the intelligence behind all of his manic goofiness.Diane Keaton is his match however whereas most of his leading ladies usually aren't. In fact I hold Diane Keaton's performance in Sleeper as her crowning achievement so far that I've seen of her even beyond her work in the Godfather films. She delivers great laughs. Her highlight is in what is possibly the funniest scene in the entire film which eventually involves her doing an impression of Marlon Brando. Who would think that Diane Keaton would deliver the most convincing and deadon Brando impression one has ever seen. While we're on the subject of that particular part of that hysterical scene that I will preserve for you to see for yourself I must say that most people even some of the most talented comedians and officeclass clowns can hardly come close to mimicking Brando's voice expressions and mannerisms. Diane Keaton somehow nails it. In Sleeper she gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen from an actress. She and Allen are truly one of the funniest comic pairs I've ever seen in a movie.What makes Sleeper so funny is not just the physical comedy but the outofthebox completely unorthodox creativity behind all of the physical comedy. There is a scene where someone slips on a banana peel. But the banana peel is the size of a canoe as is the banana and all of the electronically preserved fruits and vegetables in this particular place and Allen is being chased by a futuristic cop and both of them are slipping repeatedly on the peel. The film has robot butlers and maids of the future and gradually throughout the film some are introduced as robots programmed to act and speak like effeminate gay men and Brooklyn Jewish stereotypes. There is also a great amount of intellectualism and cultural knowledge in even the zaniest of humorous moments in Sleeper and that is what makes it one of Woody Allen's funniest films and a work of true comic genius.".

The sciencefiction story concerns an unfortunate Miles Monroe Allen the 1970s owner of the Happy Carrot healthfood store who goes into St. Vincent's Hospital for a routine peptic ulcer operation and wakes up 200 years later in a terrifying police state. He is revived by a subversive underground rebel organisation to help uncover the secrets of the dreaded Aries Project and to overthrow the tyrannical government and its dictator. Along the way Miles enlists the help of the neurotic and exuberant Luna Schlosser Diane Keaton who collaborated with Allen on multiple occasions most notably in 'Annie Hall 1977' and 'Manhattan 1979'.A chaotic blend of razorsharp satire and slapstick humour 'Sleeper' contains enough of Allen's and cowriter Marshall Brickmann's trademark wit to remind us of what makes their later collaborations so brilliant. Of course as Allen had yet to reach his creative peak some of the jokes in the film work the infamous Orgasmatron the Volkswagen Beetle that starts up immediately after 200 years of neglect whilst others aren't pulled off quite so well the giant chicken the mock Miss America pageant. In one memorable sequence year 2173 historians show Miles a collection of historical items and photographs and he idly gives off ridiculous explanations which they accept as fact. For example yes Howard Cosell's sporting reports were used as punishment for criminals who had committed a crime against the state!The promotional posters for the film proclaimed Woody Allen Takes A Nostalgic Look At The Future. This more than likely refers to the style of comedy which aside from Allen's witty observations very much evokes memories of the silent slapstick comedies of Lloyd Keaton and Chaplin. Much like the latter did with most of his films Allen wrote directed starred in and composed the score for 'Sleeper.' The score itself which is very upbeat New Orleansstyle traditional jazz was performed by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band with Allen sitting in on clarinet. 'Sleeper' may have been inspired by H.G. Wells' classic novel 'The Sleeper Awakes' which recounts the tale of a man who awakes from a 203year sleep to find himself in a horrifyinglytransformed futuristic London.Aside from including a wealth of instantlyquotable oneliners I'm not really the heroic type. I was beat up by Quakers Allen also has a lot of fun in his disorganised futuristic dystopia. After pouring too much Instant Pudding into a bowl the overdone dessert practically comes to life and has to be beaten into submission with a broom it is also revealed that contrary to popular agreement in 1973 such substances as deep fat tobacco and hot fudge are not only not unhealthy but probably the best thing for your body! When Miles happens upon a garden of humansize fruit and vegetables we just know that the giant banana peel is going to come into play somewhere and sure enough Miles inevitably takes a tumble.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's films are generally treasured among other comedies because of their wit and charm. Many critics would agree though that Allen's earlier films were among his best. One of those movies was a lighthearted film called Sleeper' which starred a younger version of Allen and a younger but always beautiful Diane Keaton. Although Sleeper' leaves a person in stitches from laughter its one flaw is that it lacks an ending. But don't let that stop you from seeing this comedy classic. In the end who cares where it goes because it's just flat out funny. Sleeper' is the story of Miles Monroe Allen who is cryogenically frozen in 1973 after having a procedure in a hospital. He is awoken nearly 200 years later by a group of scientists who want Monroe to help them defeat the leader of their society as America's future consists of a totalitarian state. While on his adventure through this futuristic world Monroe meets a beautiful woman named Luna Schlosser Keaton who he begins to have a love interest in. The two team up to try to oust their tyrannical government and bring about freedom and prosperity. Sleeper' was hysterical from beginning to end. The very opening scene shows Monroe covered in tin foilclearly scientists in 1973 found new and amazing uses for this wonderful kitchen product. As soon as Monroe awakens he is disoriented smiling aimlessly into space and walking backwards and into people. Allen's comical blend of intellect and charm shows up soon after. The futuristic society is comprised of people who have no historical references for the events of the past 200 years as their leader has undoubtedly outlawed certain forms of knowledge that could lead to rebellion. They use Monroe to fill in the historical gaps by showing him pictures of famous twentieth century individuals such as Joseph Stalin. Monroe provides his own synopsis of their contributions to the world in his own clever way as he does also for former President Nixon. Allen's writing direction and performance were hilarious. Rarely do we see writing as clever and sidesplitting in today's comedies. The only other comic director today that could even compare to Allen would be Christopher Guest whose mockumentary films such as Best In Show' and the recent A Mighty Wind' have a real source of comedy. Most present comedies are trivial filled with rehashed jokes that depend more on toilet humor than any form of real wittiness. The film's only problem is that after an hour and a half it doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. It ends on a clever note about love with the protagonists somehow managing to save themselves but not really the day. They realize that perhaps the only thing worth fighting for in the end is love. All in all Sleeper' was a very funny farce on science fiction stories and it cemented Allen's ability to be an engaging and funny in his films. ".

The very opening scene shows Monroe covered in tin foilclearly scientists in 1973 found new and amazing uses for this wonderful kitchen product. As soon as Monroe awakens he is disoriented smiling aimlessly into space and walking backwards and into people. Allen's comical blend of intellect and charm shows up soon after. The futuristic society is comprised of people who have no historical references for the events of the past 200 years as their leader has undoubtedly outlawed certain forms of knowledge that could lead to rebellion. They use Monroe to fill in the historical gaps by showing him pictures of famous twentieth century individuals such as Joseph Stalin. Monroe provides his own synopsis of their contributions to the world in his own clever way as he does also for former President Nixon. Allen's writing direction and performance were hilarious. Rarely do we see writing as clever and sidesplitting in today's comedies. The only other comic director today that could even compare to Allen would be Christopher Guest whose mockumentary films such as Best In Show' and the recent A Mighty Wind' have a real source of comedy. Most present comedies are trivial filled with rehashed jokes that depend more on toilet humor than any form of real wittiness. The film's only problem is that after an hour and a half it doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. It ends on a clever note about love with the protagonists somehow managing to save themselves but not really the day. They realize that perhaps the only thing worth fighting for in the end is love. All in all Sleeper' was a very funny farce on science fiction stories and it cemented Allen's ability to be an engaging and funny in his films. ";

	schema:headline " Successful Combination of Physical and Verbal Humour";
	schema:reviewBody "In this early comedy Woody Allen plays Miles Monroe a twentieth century healthfood restaurant owner and jazz clarinettist who is cryogenically frozen after surgery and awoken two centuries later. The America of 2173 is a totalitarian state ruled by an oppressive dictator and Miles has been reanimated by a group of rebels fighting to overthrow the government. For reasons too complex to set out here Miles is forced to go on the run disguised as a robot and finds himself falling in love with his new owner an attractive but intellectually vacant young woman named Luna. The film recounts how Miles wins Luna over to the rebel cause and tells the story of their fight against the regime.Unlike some of Woody's later films this is a pure comedy. It does not try to explore philosophical issues or to analyse the human condition in the same way as say Hannah and her Sisters or Crimes and Misdemeanours. Although I normally think of Woody as a master of verbal wit much of the humour in Sleeper is physical slapstick based upon and no doubt deliberate homage to the comedians of the silent era such as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton. I particularly liked the scenes where Woody is disguised as a robot and those where the villains are attempting to clone the dictator killed in a bomb explosion from his nose. The links with that era are reinforced by the musical score composed by Woody himself in a jazzragtime style reminiscent of the 1910s and 1920s. The sets by contrast are very futuristic with the clinical glassandchromium look of many sciencefiction films. The combination of a futuristic theme with a traditional style of comedy is doubtless why the film was advertised under the slogan Woody Allen takes a nostalgic look at the future.This is not however simply a pastiche of silent humour like the one Mel Brooks was to attempt a few years later in Silent Movie. This being a Woody Allen film there is also a good deal of verbal humour particularly oneliners along the lines of I haven't seen my analyst in 200 years. He was a strict Freudian. If I'd been going all this time I'd probably almost be cured by now. As that line suggests Miles is the typical neurotically insecure Woody Allen character. As is often the case with humorous sciencefiction such as Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker books the humour is frequently used to make satirical points about twentiethcentury society as seen from the viewpoint of an imagined future. Contemporary worries about our diet are neatly satirised by a joke about how the science of two hundred years hence has proved that fatty foods and smoking are actually beneficial to health whereas what we now think of as healthfoods are regarded as unhealthy. This joke has remained topical because anxiety about what we eat is if anythingeven greater today than it was in 1973. There is perhaps also a dig at seventies radical chic as the vacuous conformist Luna becomes an equally vacuous revolutionary. The plot of Sleeper seems to owe something to another tongueincheek sciencefiction film from a few years earlier Barbarella which also dealt with rebellion against a dictator and even featured similar orgasmatron machines the star of that film Jane Fonda had by 1973 become Hollywood's most famous radical chic actress.The humour of Sleeper is often directed against figures from the sixties and seventies perhaps too much so as this type of humour tends to date very quickly. Some of it is still funny such as Diane Keaton's Marlon Brando impersonation but some can now be difficult to understand particularly for nonAmericans. I had no idea for example who Howard Cosell was apparently he was a sports commentator. That is however a minor quibble. Overall this is an entertaining film and in places very funny combining successfully two very different styles of humour. 710".

Woody is cryogenically frozen after a botched operation in the 1970s and is awoken 200 years later to find himself in a repressive Orwellian future.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSWoody Allen is a genius few people will deny that. However in recent years it's been well reported of his decline in success. Skipping back to 1973 and Allen created arguably his second greatest feature After Annie Hall with Sleeper.In this film Allen plays Miles Monroe health food shop owner from the mid 70s. Awoken two hundred years later Monroe is roped into helping an underground movement to overthrow a totalitarian government. Aided by the originally unwilling talentless poet Luna Diane Keaton Allen is placed in all manner of scrapes as he attempts to acclimatise to his new surroundings.Sleeper is brilliant. Never a film to be taken seriously it has all the elements of a cult film with the exception being that because it's a Woody Allen film it's been pushed more into the mainstream. With a brilliant story which is actually relatively short on dialogue Allen shows us an obscure future where freedoms are limited but everyone is happy due to a combination of orgasm creating machines and a healthy diet of cigarettes and fudge cake.The reasoning behind the limitations of dialogue is that they just aren't necessary. Forever the master of quick witted social commentary in Sleeper Allen has created a tribute to the silent slapstick of the Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin era. One early scene in particular with Allen in a wheelchair causing trouble is excellent as the audience find themselves laughing at something which really shouldn't be funny but ultimately is.Perhaps the one criticism of this film is the suddenness of it's ending. At the very end Sleeper might conclude with a happy ending but it concludes with a very sudden one. In comparison though with a world today where endings seem to never come Lord Of The Rings taking a particularly long time to finish it feels quite a nice change.Therefore to summarise Allen's Sleepers is a brilliant film. With some cracking slapstick humour and some equally good witty comments Allen has created a gem. Whilst not as good as some of his other work who cares. This film is a fun film designed to make people laugh and it succeeds with this in tons. Enjoy.".

Diane Keaton also deserves praise for her performance that features all the necessary comical energy and makes a good pairing for the protagonist Miles. In brief I laughed out loud several times and would rank the film highly among the handful of Allen films I've seen so far. As far as scifi comedies go Sleeper is a definite winner.".

In brief I laughed out loud several times and would rank the film highly among the handful of Allen films I've seen so far. As far as scifi comedies go Sleeper is a definite winner.";

I know to not go gaga over early Woody Allen is announcing that I'm a brick a philistine or just a humorless aesthete. Well maybe not. Woody Allen can be uproariously funny and also deeply funny at the same time and that might happen here now and then but it happens more in Love and Death his next film in the same silly early vein and of course in his next film after that Annie Hall which is a terrible pinnacle to compare any of his films against. I won't even mention not later films where humor is more consistently layered with high drama Hannah or high art Stardust. The concept in Sleeper is funny to start with of course and that's ninety percent of the game. The funny ploys depend often on that single 200 year misalignment. But the slapstick and the schtick are uneven. I suppose you might love the idea and the characters and the actors so much you can laugh at Diane Keaton doing a bad New York accent is that what it was?. But either way you have to admit these kinds of ploys are fresh in Allen's hands and the movie never gets dull. Allen himself will make reference to earlier directors and usually talks about them with a reverence he doesn't offer for his own filmspart humility part truth. Following that lead it's fair to at least look at the prototypical kinds of humor in Chaplin and Keaton Buster not Diane films or even Peter Sellers vehicles that are closer to Allen's time and of some obvious influence. And we can sometimes see a gift for transcendence or timelessness in those other films that Sleeper itself doesn't have even when it might be making reference to them.Funniest scenes?

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a Woody Allen take on the scifi genre. Like Allen's other early films there's a lot of clowning around going on as well as his trademark banterlike dialog style. Perhaps taking a cue from a couple vignettes from his previous film Everything You Wanted to Know about Sex  But Were Afraid to Ask Allen develops an exploration of an other world notably the future and brings us into it using his protagonist character Miles Monroe.Like Bananas Sleeper has a bit of a rambling quality to it almost seeming to haphazardly wander from one incident to the next incident. But Allen's overall directing capacity was clearly gaining skill which you can see in both his use of the camera to mimic the stark future worlds that he must've seen in countless science fiction films as well as how he positions himself and his actors in front of the camera. Of course everything still looks Allen especially his closeups and wandering handheld camera shots.One impressive element of Sleeper is how thought out including the ironic comedic bits the future is both visually and theoretically. Another impressive element is Diane Keaton who was certainly an absolute find as a silly comic charmer.Unfortunately even though there's some amusing bickering and setups throughout the film Sleeper doesn't sustain strong comic energy throughout the film. At times I got bored even though Sleeper is a rather short film. Even though the exposition in the film is dressed up humorously the wit present is rather broad and not quite incisive on a whole and while still amusing enough to break a smirk Allen doesn't really engage in strong truthful irony but rather in lighthearted silliness. Without something to ground the silliness present like a strong dramatic or comic throughline Sleeper tends to float away as inconsequential.That's not to say that there isn't anything to enjoy in Sleeper. Allen's sensibilities are fully present here from his clowning to his neurotic monologuing to his trademark banter it's all there. But like his body of work up to this point there is still a lack of grounding in his story that keeps his work from being particularly outstanding. This would happen later of course. So if you like Allen's other films and don't require the depth he develops later you will probably get some enjoyment out of this. It's lighthearted sometimes fun and mildly funny. And it actually demonstrates a coherent vision. But because of its lack of consequence I can't say that it's for everyone. 710.".

This is a comedic routine with a long and timehonored tradition the joker and the straight man. The problem is she can't play a good straight woman she's just not fit to act the role.

While the plot is somewhat sitcomish it was still there and viewers always kept it in mind.  It was also loose enough that Allen could incorporate scenes paying homage to the early silent film stars the scene with the flying suits is my personal favorite.  Miles Monroe was also a rip off from Bob Hope's cowardly hero personalities but Allen gave it his own twist and in my opinion made it much better.  All in all Allen achieved the perfect blend of slapstick and substance for those in need of a simple comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "A health food store owner is cryogenically frozen and brought back in the year 2174 by antigovernment radicals in order to assist them in their attempts to overthrow their oppressive government.  With the help of his guide Luna Schlosser he finds that the world has changed significantly from the one he once knew.When one speaks of Woody Allen films it is common to talk of his early funnier films' and his later serious work although that is beginning to change back recently.  Love and Death falls easily into the period of early funnier films'.  The plot here is very loose and is simply an excuse of a series of observations one liners and set pieces.  The comedy is a wonderful mix  there is plenty of slapstick physical comedy.  This is complimented by a huge amount of one liners and witty monologues and a great banana skin joke!Again Allen is great in his standup persona and Keaton is comfortable and familiar despite not having a great character.  The imagination of the script gives plenty of room for Allen's surreal humour  the orgasmatronic booths are good and the robot scene allows him to pay a slight homage to Keaton.Overall this is yet another example of an early funnier' Woody Allen film. It is an excellent comedy on so many levels.".

With the help of his guide Luna Schlosser he finds that the world has changed significantly from the one he once knew.When one speaks of Woody Allen films it is common to talk of his early funnier films' and his later serious work although that is beginning to change back recently.  Love and Death falls easily into the period of early funnier films'.  The plot here is very loose and is simply an excuse of a series of observations one liners and set pieces.  The comedy is a wonderful mix  there is plenty of slapstick physical comedy.  This is complimented by a huge amount of one liners and witty monologues and a great banana skin joke!Again Allen is great in his standup persona and Keaton is comfortable and familiar despite not having a great character.  The imagination of the script gives plenty of room for Allen's surreal humour  the orgasmatronic booths are good and the robot scene allows him to pay a slight homage to Keaton.Overall this is yet another example of an early funnier' Woody Allen film. It is an excellent comedy on so many levels.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Exorcist made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering what the f just happened?!. The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! Evil Dead II makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example when Linda's head tells Ash that she is being tormented and suffering in hell you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say scared. The combination of demon possessed people EVIL sounds I love the weird noise in the movie wicked laughs and chanting dead by dawn! and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a sui generis HorrorComedy movie. Watch out for the A Farewell to Arms joke the whole situation with the evil hand and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. Groovy!. Dead by Dawn will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here. The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore. Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked solid and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a solo. Easily one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons humans objects etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him. The gore here is great glorious. You get decaps mutilated bodies a hand cut off bleeding demons etc. Blood spread all over the cabin is the common denominator. One of the goriest movies of all time. Watch Evil Dead II to witness one of the most creative brave and goriest movies of all time. It delivers something for everyone. It has action gore spectacular camera angles and some action! Check out Ash V.S. possessed Henrietta.  After it phrases like join us! swallow this! and specially groovy! will be part of your daily vocabulary. Recommended for every Horror fan in the world. This movie is an obligation to watch.".

	schema:headline " The best Evil Dead movie of all time my personal favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn 1987 is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead 1981 this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness 1992 that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kickass sequel. It has action comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun badass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the B movie genre never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb making the room glow red. The first time I watch it this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films but I just prefer Army of Darkness more because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending those two films doesn't have happy endings that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the lowbudget original under his belt director Sam Raimi reimagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writerdirector Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda played by Denise Bixler in this film and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film in a kind of horrorcomedy Groundhog Day scenario.Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse but he works in a manic breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outr black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise and that devil may care throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy Army of Darkness was the third film though there's evidently a RaimiCampbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wideeyed crazed cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and coscenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is really a sly if sometimes sinister comedy one blacker than well death but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical avert your eyes blood and guts.Ash Bruce Campbell the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead.

	onyx:emotionText "Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn 1987 is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead 1981 this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness 1992 that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kickass sequel. It has action comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun badass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the B movie genre never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb making the room glow red. The first time I watch it this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films but I just prefer Army of Darkness more because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending those two films doesn't have happy endings that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the lowbudget original under his belt director Sam Raimi reimagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writerdirector Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda played by Denise Bixler in this film and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film in a kind of horrorcomedy Groundhog Day scenario.Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse but he works in a manic breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outr black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise and that devil may care throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy Army of Darkness was the third film though there's evidently a RaimiCampbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wideeyed crazed cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and coscenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is really a sly if sometimes sinister comedy one blacker than well death but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical avert your eyes blood and guts.Ash Bruce Campbell the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok Ash is forced to single handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal  and groovy  hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!Evil Dead II referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.There's a lot to like in this kindagoofy movie nice visuals good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story a small amount of ridiculous theology compare to what usually is offered in this genre and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw a hand with a mind of it's own monstertype grandma and grandpa in the cellar chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people on and on....wild wild stuff.My main complaint is not enough lulls. There is too much action and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!There is no credibility in here but that's okay since I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times but within seconds he's back to normal. Campell by the way must have set the alltime record for making rubberfaced wild faces in a movie more than Jim Carrey. However this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it with all the gory scenes and shocking violence as not much more than just tongueincheek satire on horror movies. It's great fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having lost his girlfriend to the undead Ash is forced to face the possessed corpse of his former lover Linda and cut her up with a chainsaw to stop him becoming her victim. However the demons in the cabin are not that easy to stop and soon his hand has become possessed as well. While he battles to stop his hand killing him a group of four young people are heading to the cabin in seek of shelter for the night only to find themselves trapped in the same fight as Ash as barely managed to survive thus far.Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a proper director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film. In the UK Evil Dead earned notoriety for being one of the video nasties that the BBFC took such objection to and in doing so probably greatly boosted its cult appeal here and to rerun this film is not a major problem because it does have enough energy and good qualities going for it to be worth a watch if you're into your horror.However horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I still found it to be pretty scary and gory  certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an Alisted movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humour and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory bmovie has any right being. But here's the thing the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy is mainly due to two people  Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films.Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Hotep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kissoff lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later  they really seem to get each other here. Support from Berry Hicks DePaiva Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of bmovie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.Overall this is a gory cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it it will be a hugely enjoyable gory film with a great sense of humour. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly make the film work better than the material would suggest it should and on the basis of any of the three films it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.".

So he decided to just redo the moviejust quicker less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy the first one was dead serious. He did it cut some gore but it was STILL unrated. So it was released with the gore never put back in and like the first didn't do too well. And like the first it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!Basically once the movie gets going it never stops. It's more a comedy than a horror moviea very SICK comedy! Hands are cut off eyeballs go flying BUCKETS of blood are thrown around knives and axes are used etc. If you go expecting a horror film you'll be disappointed. If you approach it as a sick comedy you'll love it! I recommend this highly but only if you have a strong stomach!The sequence with Ash Bruce Campbell and his possessed hand is a horrific and comedic highlight. Cool ending too.".

ASH encounters some unexpected guests and now everyone must fight for the lives or become the evil that hunts them.Sam Raimi does an excellent job of keeping us scared in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with the dead surrounding us. When ASH is alone in the cabin we are alone in the cabin and every creaking sound we hear feels like it's right beside us. The eery feeling is not as terrifying as the original because the original was a punch in the face of terror. This one is more of a drench you in the face with blood instead of a punch. The touch of dark comedy is great. ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.The script of course is just one guy in a cabin against the dead but what makes it different is the great oneliners Swallow This Groovy. The movie showcases other characters that hold no emotional value to the viewer what so ever. You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed slammed by the door kicked yelled at while still being stabbed mind you dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.The ending to this film sets up the third installment ARMY OF DARKNESS which is a total turn around from the first two. The cameo of FREDDY'S glove is a classic nod to Craven's work...or a diss however you look at it. The whole idea of an evil unknown force underneath you in a cellar is scary enough not to mention the fact that we have to go down there with our hero who's armed with trademark boomstick and chainsaw.This film holds one of my all time favourite scenes. Can you guess it it's when Ash saws off his own hand with a psycho laugh while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming. If you love blood dark comedy great directing classic B movie acting oneliners and want to be scared less then check this movie out as well as the original.This is what horror is all about the gore the atmosphere the EVIL DEAD".

Raimi uses a hyperkinetic editing to make the essentially silly story even sillier  the POV of an eyeball flying into the screaming mouth of a woman is a pun intended scream  and distorting the dead into stopmotion figurines only adds to the lunacy. Looney Tunes gone berserk even the furniture becomes possessed not precisely frightening but swiftly paced and with great use of Bruce Campbell's overthetop acting and slapstick humor.

Seeing some of props used and slightly off production values the 'muppet' headless girlfriend in the shed the demon head stuck to camera attacking Ash towards the end Ted Raimi's ripped old lady from hell suit and the quickest of glimpses of set floor boards during one stage of shooting shows how Raimi was still constrained by budget issues.Seriously though who cares ... this film has 6 different colours of blood some seriously funny slapstick scenes didn't think I'd say that anytime soon and a chemistry between lead Campbell and director Raimi that let the jokes flow freely.Campbell proves himself a master of face contortion selfharm as well as flipping himself over! So many classic scenes in such a short space of time ... my favourite being when Jake is dragged into the cellar and a torment of pink blood comes pumping out. The camera work is as dynamic and as fast paced as in the first outing the shot of ash standing by the remains of the bridge at the start of film standing out for its grandness among otherwise less cinematic shots.The film leads on nicely to the 3rd installment in the series with onehanded Ash getting sucked into another dimension to face the undead in jolly olde England or something like that. It really is no wonder that the instore geekspopculture snobs of High Fidelty described Evil Dead II as the greatest movie of all time.'Groovey' indeed.".

He uses his brother in his films tooaarrgh Henrietta! nice to see as well as seeing his partner's wife in cameos in his other films great punk look xena. i understand that Bridget Fonda asked Sam to give her a small role in Army of Darkness because she is such a fan of the movies and probably of Mr Raimi as well whom she worked with in A Simple Plan. great film. my understanding is that he has written the screenplay for an Evil Dead 4. this is great news to me and makes sense considering how Army of Darkness ended. Army didn't scare me but i loved it all the same. i don't know what to expect from a fourth one....scarier than hell or campy fun or both? i say bring it on! he wont have any trouble getting real money for 4 which he didn't need in the first three to make them so truly great. so trust me on this. if you love horror films check out Evil Dead 2 dead by dawn. i wouldn't watch it alone either. i don't care how macho you are. it's an engaging rollercoasterfun ride. not for the uninitiated and not for Sleepless in Seattletype fans. this is pure classic camp with a great ending.".

The hero of the movie is Ash and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy oneliners. The campy one liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin your own hand getting possessed or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness and that is the flaws in the movie the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. This movies great for it's enjoyment horror comedy camp and all around the inspiration factor that says make your own movie to just make a movie my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is Manic inspired genius. A great time! and in my own words It's the most original and entertaining horror film ever made".

Poor Ash is getting tormented by the demons messing with his mind and himself. Sam Ramini gives out more of his classic camerawork making this movie work how it should be. The woods running the reversed footage and gory effects. I loved how ED2 completely changed from a good straight up horror movie as ED1 to a comedyhorror. Its a perfect balance for the Evil Dead trilogy. Ash from becoming a wimp in ED1 to a hero in ED2. What kind of action star has a chainsaw connected to their hand and a their trusty boomstick... Ash of course!! And forever he will be one of the greatest horror icon. This movie will live on!".

Once again they unwittingly play a dead professor's recordings of mystical summonses from the Necronomica better known as The Book of the Dead. When his girlfriend unexpectedly gets possessed by evil forces Ash becomes trapped in the cabin with no means of escape until four people show up. Now teamed up with the professor's daughter Sarah Berry Ash faces a oneman battle against the forces with only his chainsawhand and a sawedoff shotgun. Will Ash win the fight and get the girl or will he find himself in desperate peril? Evil Dead II is one of the few sequels especially in horror that managed to be as great as its predecessor. The film adapts to broader more comical characteristics such as laughing furniture a runaway possessed hand and several memorable oneliners I'll swallow your soul! Groovy! etc. As for Bruce Campbell he gives another great performance as an older but wiser variation on Ash Williams. Instead of the meek innocent Ash from the first film Campbell is now prepared armed to the teeth and a lot more muscular. Despite these additions it never managed to sacrifice some of the darker aspects that made the original a classic.Gone were the primitive makeup effects from Tom Sullivan the task for that position was handed to Mark Shostrom along with three Pittsburgh natives Greg Nicotero Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger. Their cuttingedge creations such as the Possessed Henrietta and Mr. Rotten Apple Head are brought to bloody life on a limited budget with fewer resources. The reason these effects hold so well after nearly two decades was because the less money you have the more creative you are.Off to encounter the Army of Darkness!Possessed Henrietta I'll swallow your soul I'll swallow your soul!

If no one agrees with me then write a complaint but to me a zombie is something that is slow non Witty dumb and don't talk thats not at all what is portrayed in this film.Acting is very overdramatic but it's supposed to be so don't think you've bought a rubbish film when you switch on. Great direction from Sam raimi and definitely worth waiting for EVIL DEAD IV.If you want a good hour and so of gore slash and thrash then this is a perfect film for you if you like black comedy same again if you like old films then this again is the one for you. It's a true tribute to some of the best film legends you'll see. In some way you can kinda say this is one of the best horror films made if you can label it that.But anyhow this film is definitely in my top five films of all time Buy it rent it and enjoy it 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Picking up where the previous film left off we find our hero Ash brilliantly played by Bruce Campbell in what is easily his best performance stuck with battling various demons in the cabin from the first movie and even having to battle his possessed severed hand at one point. When more people arrive and become possessed he is forced to arm himself with a chainsaw which he attaches to his arm in place of his hand and a shotgun which he carries in a holster. Ash faces off what is revealed to be the ultimate evil in this highly entertaining horror sequel. Let's break it down.I watched Evil Dead 2 for the first time when I was very young shortly after seeing the 1981 original. I thought the first film had a unique charm about it and was definitely imaginative but other than that I was never too crazy about it. With that in mind I popped this film into my VCR with fairly low expectations. Let me just say that I was blown away by the amazingly captivating story that unfolded before my eyes. The structure of the plot and the way it was told was simply extravagant. Ash quickly became one of my favorite horror characters of all time with his transition from a cowardly nerd to a heroic oneliner spitting chainsaw armed shotgun toting action hero. The solitary woods setting gives the entire film a very gloomy and hopeless mood which definitely works to its advantage. This is by far my favorite horror film and possibly my favorite film in general of all time alongside Return of the Living Dead. This is a mustsee or better yet musthave for every horror fan in existence. This gets a solid 10 out of 10! Groovy!".

They didn't force it down your throat with words a picture says a thousand words and the words were saying WHAT THE F! Well his reflection did speak some words hinting to what he was thinking but that part was awesome and ended up in a strange twist. If you're impatient and just want to get to hilarious overthetop gore then no worries the action starts 5 minutes in and there's even a head decapitation. This movie is like no other many copy cats have come and gone but no one can make a movie like Sam Raimi. Ash girlfriend gets possessed and she spins around like a ballerina awhile her head stays in place his hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him a girl is killed by a tree and a guy loses gallons and gallons of blood in a awesome scene that you'll have to see to believe. I recommend this movie to wannabe film directors bmovie fans people with a sense of humor and horror movie fans. So leave your brains at home and go see this at a friends house it's gonna be a groovy time.P.S. Bruce Campbell is awesome! P.P.S. Did I mention Bruce Campbell is awesome he has a chainsaw on his hand and a sawed off shotgun in the other!Cooper Solano".

However Evil Dead II starts to separate it self from other movies in this genre and its prequel for that matter particularly in a growing nonsense comedy style witch very smoothly sets in. Although one might think that horror and comedy don't mix Sam Raimi really pulled it off. For that purpose its clear that Bruce Campbell gets carte blanch with his character Ash.
