It seems this tour was highly thought of but at the same time this film seems to draw some heat. This was my first time viewing it and my first time seeing any Young performance from this era and I must admit that I really liked it. I agree with some of the negative press that the filming was quite poor as much of the concert doesn't go to film very well as it's dark grainy and at times the camera doesn't seem to know what it wants to focus on. There's a stage act going on but none of this is captured very well. Having said that the music is certainly the most important thing here and the performances are terrific. Young does some solo numbers which are excellent as are the stuff with Crazy Horse. Some of the highlights including a rocking version of Like a Hurricane and a very somber The Needle and the Damage Done. Even some of the lesser known tunes come off extremely well. Young's vocals are very good and the guitar playing is tops as usual. The film kicks off with some Hendrix and Beatles so that's never a bad thing.".

Nevertheless this film is fantastic because the selection of songs that Young plays are some of his finest and these selections are both acoustic and electric.This film also shows why it is that Crazy Horse is the band Young selects when he chooses to rock out. The band members accompany his guitar solos with triumph giving the music a melodic and hypnotizing effect specifically songs like Like a Hurricane and Cortez the Killerwhich are good in their own original formget a new life in this film the songs linger sometimes they stray but never in a negative way. Anyone who likes live performances particularly live performances that take on a sort of adlib aspect will not be disappointed with Rust Never Sleeps.The acoustic selections are also very fine highlighting Young's capacity and talent to not only entertain and soothe as an individual but one who can do it in grand style. Grand Style here of course does not mean someone coming across as your typical rock star because here Young doesn't but rather grand style in the sense that the man is a born musician that can strike a chord in any one's soul. Highlights of the acoustic set include Sugar Mountain and After the Gold Rush as well as such Young classics as Comes a Time and My My Hey Hey. Of course the concert would not be complete without a wicked rendition of Hey Hey My My the electric counterpart to the former and the band here accompanies Young on this track exquisitely.".

I was living in the city SF with about 12 other folks way up off California St.  It was a nice victorian on Lake St.  The album yep  12 plastic was Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.  I was immediately drawn to the countryish twang of some of the songs TLE ENTIK RRRD  I was mesmerized by Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand.I first played the RNS movie while in Japan in 1982.  I was on the vinyl CED format.  I bought it at a record store above the Yokohama train station. I was awed by the quality and choice of material.  Neil must have tapered his interaction with audiences during the midlate 70's.  Early on he was such a blabber mouth  not a bad thing  but on RNS he was courteous but focuses on the presentation.  Almost all the songs were superbly executed. This contains is my favourite Powderfinger arrangement.  The screwup on Thrasher demonstrates a professional just slyly grinning it off and rewinding a tad to recover nicely without skipping any of the lyrics.  I have always wondered how he screwed that part up?  they were...rock formations  he forgot lost in.  I only wish he had put this version of thrasher on the live rust lpcd.The roadeyes and woodstock bits were a drag but on the cd version can be effortlessly immediately bypassed.  I am 54 years on and I have a lot of concerts under my belt and many Firday or Saturday nights were at Winterland and the Fillmore West seeing the greats of the day.  imagine Led Zeppelin at the Fillmore  bumping into Janis at the Fillmore  There was no sense of star ego then.  It was a different thing.  Carlos Santana talking to myself and others on the street after a concert.  he was walking alone.  Those days are gone forever.  What the heck happened?Rust Never Sleeps is superb.  The music isn't flawlessly performed but it is real and really really good.  Perhaps some do not know that many Neil Young recordings are essentially live takes  not a bunch of crappy track takes and overdubs to create the sound some record exec wants to sell to an unsuspecting public.The simplicity of many of the RNS songs are their beauty in disguise. From the gentle acousticals to some of the blistering industrial tunes Sedan Delivery Powderfinger ... its unlike any videomoviemusical I have ever seenheard.  Neil was at his best.  The horse was up for the task.This is a mustsee for anyone who thinks live music sucks!".

	schema:headline " Beautiful profound moving";
	schema:reviewBody "Just ahead I'll tell you how to know if you'll love or hate this movie very few will be in between. But first I'm always surprised to see people reading the novel rushing to the movie and then expressing disappointment with remarks such as there are gaping holes. A 2hour movie is a 110page screenplay which means a 300page novel becomes a 6hour miniseries. Get Martin Scorcese hire Never Let Me Go novelist Kazuo Ishiguro to write the screenplay and cast it right and you'll have a shot at making a miniseries that CAN be compared to the novel otherwise let's understand the limitation and let the film stand on its own. I didn't read Ishiguro's novel and I found Mark Romanek's film screenplay by Alex Garland to be a beautiful profound and complete meditation on life. It demonstrates the best and worst of human behavior the beauty of undying love and the heroism of accepting responsibility or fate in this case. To me the story is uplifting and memorable in spite of its overall sad and melancholy tone. What's more it's seamless from the superb performances by Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield to the near perfect direction by Romanek to its gorgeous cinematography with muted color palette to its precise wabisabi production design the beauty of worn and broken things. But how can you know if you'll like this film or not?Forget the SciFi angle it's insignificant except as a steppingoff point for a story that reveals great truths That life is short your choices have consequences and at the end none of us may feel we've had enough time to love or just get things right. But I can safely say... If you interpret your movies literally you will not like this film. If you need action a fast pace explosions and special effects you will not like this film. If your idea of a great movie is Inception forget it. On the other hand if you can appreciate a fine story by Henry James Edith Wharton or Katherine Anne Porter this film is made for you. If you enjoyed Todd Haynes' lovely melodrama Far from Heaven or Oren Moverman's powerful movie The Messenger or Tom Ford's poignant film A Single Man you'll love this picture. The story addresses themes of love longing jealousy betrayal courage atonement and perhaps most important acceptance. The film also asks us to consider the morality of science and some might find this aspect chilling but to me the larger human themes overwhelm this one. When I saw Never Let Me Go the theater was about onethird full but probably onethird of these folks walked out by the halfway point. And surprisingly the couple sitting behind me got up and walked out 10 minutes before the end once they were convinced revealed by their groans that the story would not have a happy ending. Apparently they were looking for the feel good movie of the year. Sadly they missed the most extraordinary and beautiful ending  most of the emotional power comes in that last 10 minutes  but then I suppose they wouldn't have understood it. But to me Never Let Me Go is the feel good movie of the year precisely because it tells the truth life is beautiful because there are hopes and dreams love and loss tears and tragedies. One final note Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are excellent in their roles but Carey Mulligan is the standout  she shows a wisdom and weariness far beyond her years and handles difficult emotional material with a sublime restraint that makes the whole thing work. I feel we are witnessing the early work of the next Deborah Kerr Sarah Miles or Vanessa Redgrave. This is an excellent film one of the best of the year and not to be missed by those who appreciate depth and literary quality.".

If your idea of a great movie is Inception forget it. On the other hand if you can appreciate a fine story by Henry James Edith Wharton or Katherine Anne Porter this film is made for you. If you enjoyed Todd Haynes' lovely melodrama Far from Heaven or Oren Moverman's powerful movie The Messenger or Tom Ford's poignant film A Single Man you'll love this picture. The story addresses themes of love longing jealousy betrayal courage atonement and perhaps most important acceptance. The film also asks us to consider the morality of science and some might find this aspect chilling but to me the larger human themes overwhelm this one. When I saw Never Let Me Go the theater was about onethird full but probably onethird of these folks walked out by the halfway point. And surprisingly the couple sitting behind me got up and walked out 10 minutes before the end once they were convinced revealed by their groans that the story would not have a happy ending. Apparently they were looking for the feel good movie of the year. Sadly they missed the most extraordinary and beautiful ending  most of the emotional power comes in that last 10 minutes  but then I suppose they wouldn't have understood it. But to me Never Let Me Go is the feel good movie of the year precisely because it tells the truth life is beautiful because there are hopes and dreams love and loss tears and tragedies. One final note Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are excellent in their roles but Carey Mulligan is the standout  she shows a wisdom and weariness far beyond her years and handles difficult emotional material with a sublime restraint that makes the whole thing work. I feel we are witnessing the early work of the next Deborah Kerr Sarah Miles or Vanessa Redgrave. This is an excellent film one of the best of the year and not to be missed by those who appreciate depth and literary quality.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just recently finished reading Never Let Me Go. I have very rarely been so intrigued by the subject matter of a book and at the same time so bored by its style. Never Let Me Go the book was deadly dull. Still I was so intrigued as I say by the plight of these characters that I was compelled to see how the book translated to the big screen. You might say I felt this novel and original storyline deserved a second chance.All in all I give the movie adaptation a thumbs up with one big caveat I think those who did not read the book first would be left scratching their heads. While the book was slow and plodding and devoted MUCH too much detail to certain occurrences in the storyline nevertheless it offered the opportunity for reflection on the subtleties of what was taking place. Given the pacing of a typical movie if you blink you might miss something momentous and I think that was the case with this movie so it certainly helped to have read the book prior to seeing the film. The screenwriters did an excellent job of condensing the book and I felt after having read it that condensing was precisely what this otherwise compelling and poignant story required.Never Let Me Go was a lyrical and visually beautiful production. The accompanying musical score was appropriate to a sad and heartbreaking story. The acting was terrific  especially by Cary Mulligan whose sad eyes reveal the melancholy of her character and Keira Knightly especially in the hospital scene where she portrays a nearly depleted donor. I didn't care much for the male lead but his one outbreak of emotion upon having his hopes of a deferral dashed was very significant. And the character of Miss Lucy comes across as more sympathetic in the movie than in the book.My criterion for a good movie is this If it stays with me once I hit the sidewalk in front of the theater rather than evaporating like smoke well that's a good movie. Never Let Me Go has stayed with me. The ending left me with a feeling that although these fictionalized characters were little more than lab rats we all in a sense share a similar fate. Life is short loss hurts live and love while you can. It rarely happens that I enjoy a movie adaptation more than the book on which it was based but I would have to say that was the case here. Bravo.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never Let Me Go is one of the most distressing and depressing films I've ever seen so it's easy to imagine why this film despite a wealth of positive reviews failed at the American box office so badly last year. What people are missing however despite its grim subject matter including one of the most upsetting yet profoundly moving endings ever is one of the most intelligent thoughtprovoking and wellacted films in recent memory.Music video director Mark Romanek has had a somewhat easy transition into the way of feature filmmaking he made his debut in 2002 with the creepy Robin Williams thriller One Hour Photo and Never Let Me Go is easily the director's best work. Screenwriter Alex Garland adapted Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name and the plot centers on three lifelong best friends who are also wrapped up in a love triangle. Kathy Carey Mulligan loves Tommy Andrew Garfield but Tommy is currently engaged in a loveless relationship with their mutual friend Ruth Keira Knightley in what is easily her best and in my opinion most tolerable performance yet.Their tangled love affair is set against the backdrop of a revisionist history beginning in 1978 and ending in 1995 when the three are young children being raised at a prestigious boarding school called Hailsham somewhere on the English countryside. Over the course of their growing up together they gradually learn the horrifying truth about the school and the grim significance of what their lives really mean in this world because as they also discover their predetermined lives on this Earth will be short and they have very little time to understand each other and what life and love really mean.To really describe the plot any further will be a great disservice to the truetolife performances of this film's three daring young leads and the filmmakers. Never Let Me Go is a daring combination of heartfelt drama romance and dystopic science fiction. The latter film genre serves only as a backdrop and never once does the picture descend into pointless action scenes and special effects as a means for its characters to try to escape their fates or ultimately responsibilities to the rest of humankind. In fact Never Let Me Go actually has more in common with Rob Reiner's 1986 comedydrama Stand by Be than anything written by Philip K. Dick. No although these three characters have accepted the inevitably of their incredibly short lives they are still determined to enjoy what time they have left together and that is the whole point of this powerful and emotionallydriven film.Anyone who dismisses this film because of the negative reviews yes there were a few saying it's too bleak and depressing are selling themselves short. They'd also be missing one of the most powerfully acted and ultimately moving films I've ever seen. They'd also be missing one of the greatest films of 2010 that's for sure and that's the real tragedy of Never Let Me Go that so many people ignored such an incredibly great and brilliant film about life love and humanity.Never Let This Film Go.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Mark Romanek's Never Let Me Go opens with a scene of a woman staring at a man on an operating table. She stares at him through a glass wall and he stares back at her a tear streaming down his cheek. It is moments like these that work so well in Never Let Me Go a dystopian science fiction drama that is both tender and frightening all at once. Romanek's haunting imagery combined with some great acting acting really make this film work as a great adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's still greater book of the same title. While the pacing may be a bit uneven a moving story with a purposeful emotional disconnection holds together quite nicely on the silver screen.Without saying too much Never Let Me Go is a story about what it truly means to be humans. That does not mean that there are aliens involved but there are other science fiction elements that are subtly blended with complex emotions. The story revolves around Ruth Tommy and Kathy three children growing up at a school called Hailsham. Hailsham is bizarre in many ways but the children simply take it as it is. The children eventually learn a nasty secret about themselves from a teacher. Ruth Keira Knightley Tommy Andrew Garfield and Kathy's Carey Mulligan lives change forever as they suddenly learn to live their lives differently. As they grow up together they experience sex sadness and love in unexpected ways.Mark Romanek who is probably better known for his work on music videos has made this film look sad and cold. The cinematography fulfills the book's sense of depression through images of repetition. One especially beautiful shot is the closing one in which two pieces of cloth lie tethered almost trapped on a barbed wire fence blowing in the wind. The film's beauty lies in its color palette which leaves out all primary colors. Romanek said in interviews that he borrowed the color palette from the excellent 1968 British film If... a fitting place to borrow from for this movie.The acting from all three main actors is very good. The performances probably do not merit any Oscars but they are still great to watch. Carey Mulligan shines for a second time here although her performance is probably better in An Education. Andrew Garfield a fairly new actor does well as Tommy playing his character with all the strange mannerisms that he had in the book. Look for Garfield in The Social Network. He definitely will be one to keep an eye on. Keira Knightley also is quite good as the conniving Ruth although her performance is nowhere near as good as those of Garfield and Mulligan.The pacing of the movie was its biggest problem. The middle of the movie inches along a bit too slowly whereas the book moved at a constantly brisk pace. Though the movie should and did spend a little more time on character development it spent a bit too much time and could have easily lost fifteen minutes. The plot of the book has also been presented out of order with the major twist revealed a half hour into the film. This will strange for anyone who read the book for it makes the character development very different.Never Let Me Go is sad depressing and interesting in many ways. Though it is not bound for Oscar gold it is brilliant in its quietness. It may not be enjoyed by people who have not read Ishiguro's brilliant book but fans of the book will certainly appreciate Romanek's direction and the performances of Mulligan Knightley and Garfield. If any movie could make you sad for hours it would be this one so be prepared and bring some tissues.As Never Let Me Go shows coming into a person's life can be even harder than letting go.".

The performances probably do not merit any Oscars but they are still great to watch. Carey Mulligan shines for a second time here although her performance is probably better in An Education. Andrew Garfield a fairly new actor does well as Tommy playing his character with all the strange mannerisms that he had in the book. Look for Garfield in The Social Network. He definitely will be one to keep an eye on. Keira Knightley also is quite good as the conniving Ruth although her performance is nowhere near as good as those of Garfield and Mulligan.The pacing of the movie was its biggest problem. The middle of the movie inches along a bit too slowly whereas the book moved at a constantly brisk pace. Though the movie should and did spend a little more time on character development it spent a bit too much time and could have easily lost fifteen minutes. The plot of the book has also been presented out of order with the major twist revealed a half hour into the film. This will strange for anyone who read the book for it makes the character development very different.Never Let Me Go is sad depressing and interesting in many ways. Though it is not bound for Oscar gold it is brilliant in its quietness. It may not be enjoyed by people who have not read Ishiguro's brilliant book but fans of the book will certainly appreciate Romanek's direction and the performances of Mulligan Knightley and Garfield. If any movie could make you sad for hours it would be this one so be prepared and bring some tissues.As Never Let Me Go shows coming into a person's life can be even harder than letting go.";

	schema:headline " Never Let Me Go is a devastatingly beautiful film.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that you come home from a film feeling both defeated  and genuinely happy. While these would appear to be contradicting  emotions that is exactly how I felt coming from Mark Romanek's Never  Let Me Go. The film written by Alex Garland and based on the novel of  the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro is beautiful and emotionally  devastating at the same time.  The film opens in the 1970's focusing on the lives of three school  children in an English private school. Although at first sight the  setting appears normal enough we quickly discover these are not normal  children as they exist solely to have their organs harvested once they  become adults.  Never Let Me Go seamlessly combines period drama and science fiction.  The alternative reality we are shown is never fully explained nor needs  to be. The film is purely about the three main characters Kathy Tommy  and Ruth. It is the film's deep focus on the emotions and personalities  of the characters that makes it fascinating. The world they live in is  simply therereality for themno explanations needed.  A film as personal as this relies heavily on the actors and without  their strong performances the film would have fallen flat. An  Education's Carrie Mulligan stars as Abbie a girl who does not act but  rather observes. Andrew Garfrield plays Tommy who Kathy has been in  love with since they were children. Keira Knightley is provides the  most surprising performance as Ruth who jealously falls for Tommy.  Fortunately no one disappoints in fact they all exceed expectations.  As these characters are shielded from normalcy the performances we get  portray them as innocents. This is especially true of Andrew Garfield  who plays Tommy as a naive innocent teenager who wants nothing more  than to live longer than he is programmed to. It is his performance  that stands out it is understated but still emotionally heart  wrenching.  The difficulty in reviewing this film for me comes from the emotional  impact it had. Many films will tug at the heart strings manipulating  the audience into feeling a sadness that is not real. This film does  not manipulate it has a genuine sadness at its core that leaves you  devastated. No film has left me on the verge of tears as much as this  one has. In an age of formulaic films it is utterly refreshing to see  something so genuine on screen even though the characters' situations  are foreign to the audience.  Alex Garland has often been criticized for his inability to write  logical conclusions to his films. While I personally don't agree with  that Never Let Me Go proves that wrong. The final act of the film  doesn't try to trick us into feeling for the characters as we already  do. The characters reunite after years apart from each other now  closer to the end they spend what could be their last days together.  There is no twist to the film it ends exactly how we know it will and  that is where the sadness comes from. We know the fates of these  characters and the films' focus is on their struggle to accept their  fate just as we have had to.  Mark Romanek is a veteran music video director and Never Let Me Go is  only his second feature film although you wouldn't know it. Romanek  shows a maturity and patience behind the camera that is not only rare  for young filmmakers but for veteran ones as well. His use of focus  leads to one of the most beautifully shot films of the year if not the  most.  Never Let Me Go is without a doubt my favourite film of the year so  far. It had the emotional impact that I usually judge a film's quality  on. The fact it is not being talked about more is truly a bewildering  shame. I fear it will be forgotten as dramas that do not garner Oscar  attention usually do.".

I think that it really helps to read the book first because it fills in a lot of the gaps that are missing in the movie.Even if you haven't read the book the film is still worth seeing for the performances of Carey Mulligan Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightly.The only reason the film does not rate a perfect 10 is that in the scene where they are trying to get a deferral from Madame they left out what is probably the most important part of the story. In that scene in the book Madame explains to them that the boarding school they went to was paid for by donations and fund raising so that they could be brought up like normal people. Before that the clones were brought up in concentration camps and treated inhumanly. The whole point of that scene was that Madame and a few others were willing to make great sacrifices because they believed the clones had all the same rights and sentience as all other humans while the rest of the world thought of them as livestock that were being bred for consumption.Even though that scene was left out of the film the final line in the film alludes to the same message and it is a real tearjerker. Don't be fooled into thinking Never Let Me Go is a science fiction movie. It is not. It is a human drama with a science fiction premise. This is not like Logan's Run and it really does not go into the details of the science behind the premise. It is a sad and melancholy story about the human condition. If you go into it knowing what to expect it is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the book I had a mixed reaction to this adequate yet overall uninspiring adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's brilliant novel. Looking back at my viewing experience I was reminded of the early adaptation of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' from the earliest era of films in which the filmmakers expected you to have read the book and simply showed you interpretations of various scenes. Alex Garland's screenplay boasted the ambition of including a little bit of everything from Ishiguro's 300 page book in his slightly under two hour movie. The result is a simple abridgment we have time to realize the love brewing between the characters the strained friendship between Mulligan's Kathy and Knightley's Ruth and the dilemma of their caregivers at Hailsham. But the film lacks much the catharsis and the commentary that made the book so great.Romanek has proved himself to be a capable director but here he made some negative decisions which really removed much of the impact of the plot. Adam Kimmel's cinematography is a stand out here and given the competition so far I wouldn't be surprised if he receives an Oscar nomination for his work. The calm collection and stoic nature of much of the acting can be seen as insipid or uninteresting to some. But I found the acting to be quite appropriate the tight lipped proper British style of this movie provided an nice contrast and balance to a story which could have turned into a mindless melodramatic tear jerker if not handled correctly.In the end I think active viewership is of paramount importance to this movie. The film is never interested in simply handing the audience its ideas. Rather it called upon us to dig for meaning. I would say the plot itself served as a bit of a metaphor and that intrigued me. And despite some of the negative artistic liberties which were taken in this adaptation I feel that it did well enough to create an involving though provoking and sometimes heartbreaking experience.Despite its flaws 'Never Let Me Go' has been one of the few strong film that we've had this year. And if your one of those people who goes to the movies once or twice a month I'd say 'Never Let Me Go' is one of your better bets for an agreeable experience at the movies right now.".

Deep subtle beautiful and crypticNever Let Me Go is sure to instigate profound conversations after the screening. Like Dead Man Walking 1995 and Million Dollar Baby 2004 there's a social morale buried under this sumptuous love story.The film follows the friendship of three children growing up in a tightlysecured boarding school in Britain beginning in 1978. They are cutoff from the outside world a life without a choice but a life with a designated focus. The story spans almost three decades following them from childhood to adulthood. The surroundings are ever constant even though the film follows them for three decades.I would love to reveal what these special individuals are modeled and raised for but giving away that revelation wouldn't be fair to the viewers. I must say it's a very unique premise one that gives the audience a very improbable connection between images and content. Never Let Me Go struck a nerve. I felt for these characters very deeply. I wanted them to realize what these young and loving individuals could've achieved in the world they grew up in. They were brainwashed into thinking they were isolated from everyone else but in reality there were no boundaries. They could've escaped from the life they were broughtup in and should've rebelled from the establishment. Angry sad sweet longing optimisticI love it when a film channels these ambivalent emotions and allows me to ponder about an alternate direction for the characters to venture into. If a film does that then it must work.After viewing this movie I'm very curious about picking up the novel to see how the filmmakers translated the descriptions into these picturesque images. My guess is that the book is written on the same lines as The Horse Whispererwith deft metaphors and rich characterizations.As much as I wanted closure to the narrative I think the film does a great justice by leaving the audience in the dark. It gives the viewer more room to think and it stimulates an array of intelligent inquiries. Never Let Me Go dares the viewer to look beyond the beautiful imagery and delicate character interrelationships and discover a multitude of hidden meanings and themes. Above all this is an exquisitely crafted tale about love loss individuality and the boundaries of life.".

They could've escaped from the life they were broughtup in and should've rebelled from the establishment. Angry sad sweet longing optimisticI love it when a film channels these ambivalent emotions and allows me to ponder about an alternate direction for the characters to venture into. If a film does that then it must work.After viewing this movie I'm very curious about picking up the novel to see how the filmmakers translated the descriptions into these picturesque images. My guess is that the book is written on the same lines as The Horse Whispererwith deft metaphors and rich characterizations.As much as I wanted closure to the narrative I think the film does a great justice by leaving the audience in the dark. It gives the viewer more room to think and it stimulates an array of intelligent inquiries. Never Let Me Go dares the viewer to look beyond the beautiful imagery and delicate character interrelationships and discover a multitude of hidden meanings and themes. Above all this is an exquisitely crafted tale about love loss individuality and the boundaries of life.";

It's a field of study that I will suggest for the writers and director of this movie.There is one scene so memorable in the movie which is probably when the screenwriter wrote right after he got his lobotomy done. It's when they finished the 3rd organ harvesting of Ruth and she died. The doctors just pack up and left the room instead of trying to revive her as what would happen in normal world they tried to portray a message that these people are just like cattle and their life is just for the organs but if that's true won't they straight away try to harvest all other organs that can't be harvested without the person dying? heart lungs corneas we all at least those with brain still know that those organs need to be harvested as fast as possible.Sure the scenery is beautiful and the acting is pretty good and there is the yada and the blah blah like other reviewers said.

	schema:reviewBody "We are most of us pretty familiar with dystopia. An outsider or group of outsiders rises up in opposition of some malignant controlling force. Sometimes they overthrow it or at least register some level of victory however ambiguous as with Children of Men. Sometimes as in 1984 the system consumes them. But always  always  there is the fight the struggle to overturn whatever dark elements have taken hold.There is no fight within Never Let Me Go. There is no conflict no resistance no tiny token victory. The fate of the protagonists is chillingly accepted their passivity devastating.The film adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel weaves an understated hopelessness through a wellworn sciencefiction concept telling the story of a group of clones created so their organs could be harvested for medical purposes. Taking place in an alternate Britain in the late twentieth century where lifeexpectancy has risen to over 100 years we first meet Kathy Ruth and Tommy as children at Hailsham a country boarding school. At first their lives seem idyllic sunset hues and natural imagery creating a sense of a privileged rural seclusion but the edges are frayed with tension. A new teacher Miss Lucy questions the children as to why they seem afraid to leave the grounds their replies as with The Village hint at rumours and misinformation that have distorted their sense of reality.The initial impressions of privilege are quickly worn down by the faded interiors the dorm rooms sparse and colourless the classroom desks worn and cracked. The students collect mismatched tokens to exchange for junk their uncontrolled excitement at odds with ragged castoffs on display. Visitors to the school shudder visibly as they enter.For the children of course this all goes unnoticed. We're led to assume that they've experienced nothing else and whilst we're drawing dark conclusions they're growing up and falling in love. Kathy and Tommy's growing affection for each other is tracked from early concern to backward glances in assembly shared mealtimes and thoughtful gifts until finally he's stolen from her by a jealous Ruth. It's a love triangle that dominates the rest of the film as they leave Hailsham for a group of farmhouses shared with people from other institutions similar to their own. Food and supplies are delivered regularly in a van marked National Donor Programme but otherwise they're pretty much unsupervised.Which makes their inaction all the more awful. They each know what awaits them each fully aware of the various stages mapped out until their 'completion' not long hence but they do nothing to prevent it. At no point is there even the suggestion of escape. Many many questions are raised regarding the extent of surveillance and control that they are under  wristbands clock their return home their arms mechanically waving them to the sensor  but none are answered and nothing is challenged. But that's the point these are people  creatures as they're referred to at one point  who have known no other life for whom the idea of challenge would be incomprehensible. They're unable even to order food in a seaside restaurant so far from their experience is it.As a story it's horrifying our gradual awareness of their circumstance  more clearly signposted than in the prose  quickly turning to frustration at the hopelessness of it. To be sure this is not an easy watch and not one easily shrugged off or recovered from. All of the leads are excellent Carey Mulligan particularly so but Andrew Garfield the most affecting his hope the last to fade like embers dying in his eyes.Technically it's quietly beautiful long takes and nostalgic palettes suffusing every frame with an aching undisguised sadness everpresent and at times overwhelming. The soundtrack is simple a recurring motif echoing both the melancholy themes and the character's calm acceptance of their tragedy. This is lowkey filmmaking certainly but no less confident for it Mark Romanek has done menace in One Hour Photo and here he's nailing pathos.Is it Oscarbaiting? Possibly it's certainly been timed to hit awards season but it definitely deserves some recognition. Whether it gets it is another question the trailers don't sell the film right and there will be many who dislike the slow measured pace and the lack of clear exposition. But Never Let Me Go isn't a story about answers nor even really about clones  it's about our own powerlessness in the face of larger forces. And we can shout and scream and rage and try our hardest to break those forces down but ultimately the true measure of our lives is in the relationships we form however they may end.".

	schema:reviewBody "In general adaptations of prestigious or wellloved books are hard to pull off. Not only do filmmakers feel the pressure to uphold their source's reputation but they must also imbue the movie version with their own vision their own style and personal touch. For director Mark Romanek and screenwriter Alex Garland Never Let Me Go must have been as daunting a challenge as any considered by many to be among the best books of the past decade Kazuo Ishiguro's dystopian comingofage drama features the sort of quiet intimate power that rarely translates well to the screen. Much of the story and characters is revealed through narration and the action is so subtle that if it had not been crafted with such grace and skill it would have felt static almost nonexistent. However Romanek and Garland face these obstacles headon and with the help of a talented cast and crew defy the odds by making a film that  in spirit at least  stays true to the original source and still succeeds on its own merit.For the most part Romanek's direction is unnoticeable it's not the selfconscious mannered approach that plagues many indie or even mainstream dramas. Though he and Garland took some significant risks with the material some successful the reduction of the amount of exposition and narration and others less so the events and character relationships at Hailsham could have been more fully developed he largely sits back and allows the story to unfold naturally. Utilizing a score by Rachel Portman that is reminiscent of Mark Isham's swelling elegant music for 1999's October Sky and Adam Kimmel's bleak yet gorgeous cinematography the filmmakers avoid the stilted feel of many literary adaptations instead creating something that is deeply emotional and thoughtprovoking.As the three leads Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield are perfectly cast. Sporting shorter and blonder hair than in her breakout awardattracting performance in last year's An Education Mulligan manages to simultaneously convey childlike innocence and the grave maturity usually seen only in older actresses  or people for that matter. Keira Knightley was someone who even more than the other two I could instantly picture in her role. She embodies Ruth her crass selfishness her longing and ultimately fruitless dreaming and given her fairly limited screen time at least in the first half of the movie it is quite impressive that she was able to reveal the character's nuances as thoroughly as she did. Like in his other new film the fantastic The Social Network here Andrew Garfield turns in a stellar performance. Though I admittedly preferred him in the former in both movies along with a muchhyped role as the lead in future Spiderman movies Garfield cements his status as 2010's number one rising star.However what sticks with me the most about Never Let Me Go both the literary and cinematic versions is the story the way it manages to be audacious intimate and contemplative all at once. Grounded in real human relationships and emotions what could have been a mere 1984ish cautionary tale instead becomes a poignant sincere examination of friendship morality and what it means to be human. Only in the final scene where Carey Mulligan's Kathy H. bereft of all her childhood connections both human and otherwise stares out across the field that was once her beloved Hailsham only then does the real message become apparent life is precious and in spite of all the medical and technological advances humanity throws at it death comes to everyone seemingly always too soon. There are no deferrals no second chances.Romanek's Never Let Me Go isn't perfect or a masterpiece but nonetheless it has the kind of power and beauty that affects people long after the final shot fades away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite some good acting good film making and good direction the plot of this depressing film is so confusing and silly it's really hard to get into it. The confusion starts with the date of the movie1978. I guess we are supposed to believe that for years there have been boarding schools where children are raised for one purpose to donate organs to some other people we never learn about in order to keep those people alive instead of these people. More confusion starts when we realize the kids are being lied to about their real destiny then a new teacher is hired who tells them the truth one day and is summarily fired the next for outing the school but the kids don't cry or complain at all. I don't know about you but if I were told at age ten that I wasn't going to have no future and was just an organ donor who was destined to die young I think I might be a bit upset. Why this teacher from the outside was hired to begin with is also beyond me. And it seems easy enough for the kids to run away but no one even tries.It gets even sillier as they grow a whole 3 way romance thing is going on which isn't very interesting and then we discover they can come and go as they please they even have cars to use. There is this whole mentality presented that the kids now 20 somethings all really want to die as donors but then all they do is talk about not wanting to die or something. At any point any of them could have taken off and disappeared. Is there anyone to stop them? Who knows all we see is that they have wrist bands and have to beep in to a monitor when coming home. You would think someone would at least try to escape what's the worst that can happen? And the fact that they raise train and teach these people for 20 years just to have them die is not very cost efficient.Don't waste your time with this one unless you want to be depressed and bored to death like the characters themselves.".

	onyx:emotionText "Despite some good acting good film making and good direction the plot of this depressing film is so confusing and silly it's really hard to get into it. The confusion starts with the date of the movie1978. I guess we are supposed to believe that for years there have been boarding schools where children are raised for one purpose to donate organs to some other people we never learn about in order to keep those people alive instead of these people. More confusion starts when we realize the kids are being lied to about their real destiny then a new teacher is hired who tells them the truth one day and is summarily fired the next for outing the school but the kids don't cry or complain at all. I don't know about you but if I were told at age ten that I wasn't going to have no future and was just an organ donor who was destined to die young I think I might be a bit upset.

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this film. I like all the actors and the technical credits looked promising. I felt this film might live or die by its script but seeing Alex Garland's name attached was a bonus. I liked his previous work The Beach most of Sunshine and I especially loved 28 Days Later.That Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the novel this film is based on was less impressive for me. I do not know the mans literary work and regarding film work one of the better MerchantIvory films The Remains Of The Day was based on an Ishiguro novel so I was not unduly alarmed when I sat down.I also have make that HAD no strong opinion about the competence of director Mark Romanek and some films despite the auteur theory are not director made.Never Let Me Go looked like one of those. What I neglected to consider was that a director could completely unmake a reasonably good story.This film is a torturous mess. It is dull looking leaden paced and they really should have had one or two more story conferences to work out the stupendous improbabilities in the plot. Now I understand that the film takes place neither in the future nor in the past and that it is presenting a world developmentally different than our own but please this film makes no sense even if you apply the generally absurd level of sense that is standard for the scifi genre.First the surprise that these kids are being raised for the sole purpose of organ donation is stated verbally quite early in the film. But that's just for the slow members of the audience. In fact the films ending thematic point and character denouement are visually shown to us in the very first scene as a skinny scarred Andrew Garfield is wheeled into an operating room to have his last useful organs removed under the watchful eye of Carrey Mulligan the woman who truly loves him.Gee thanks Carrey I'm glad you love him. Imagine what might have happened if you hated him!But this whole organ transplant idea is just a clumsy allegory for something else because it makes no medical sense what so ever. The film makes some attempt at explanation for why this society needs so many organ donors but it is a ludicrous premise.If these kids are being used for say kidney transplants and human kidneys still work the same way and for the same reasons in their world than I can at least conclude some nominal comparability to our own world. And here the films central plot point crashes on the rocks of reality.For example in the USA last year 28000 people were saved by organ transplants out of a roughly 305000000 population. That's a very small percentage. Most of the diseases and accidents that can kill you are not fixable by simply getting a new kidney.Then there is the utter passivity of kids. I mean they adamantly don't want to die but when they are let out of their holding pens to go for a drive far into the countryside they return on time and on schedule. It almost seems like they WANT to be carved up into all their little pieces parts.I don't even want to get into the utter stupidity of the film postulating that the third grade drawings of houses and cows somehow indicates that that person has a soul.Trust me there are better ways to prove your humanity than by the creation of lousy amateur art. It's a ludicrous conceit and whoever came up with it should be ashamed of themselves.So if you want to see a film with an improbable story by Kazuo Ishiguro check out The Saddest Music In The World. But since that film was directed by the Canadian genius Guy Maddin the film has wit excessive eccentricities in filmic style and a huge number of belly laughs.Avoid Never Let Me Go unless you consider getting bored into a coma a fun way to spend an evening.".

A telling early scene has his thuggish pals terrorizing a car full of innocent folk who are driving too slowly in front of them on the highway. Martin meekly joins in the tormenting my letting air out of the front tire but feels deeply shamed when he discovers the driver is a helpless handicapped guy in braces.Martin checks in at the Hotel Venus on a prominent avenue with mysterious plans. We later find out that a major fascist leader will be feted with a parade on this route a key to the plot line.A friend of a girl he knows is impressed with Martin and moves into the hotel with him she's Ines played by Margolin who is truly lovely and glamorous this time out and convincing in her postsynched Spanish dialog. The duo's torrid sex scenes are tastefully staged not as explicit as TorreNilsson's memorable Isabel Sarli vehicle of a couple years before 70 TIMES 7 but still effective.A troupe of actors and musicians from Spain is staying on the same floor of the hotel and performing in a large ballroomtheater there. While Ines tries to befriend them including a cute child who has an animal toy bearing a human skull as its scary head typical of many odd stylistic flourishes and wakeup calls TorreNilsson dots throughout the film an obvious influence on Almodovar a couple of decades hence Martin becomes the title figure. He imagines plots and intrigues on the part of the Spaniards and becomes obsessed. Looking forward to Leo DiCaprio as J.

The cops investigate and find the Spanish are merely innocent artistes and Martin's identity as the fink is revealed. This results in a vividly staged violent climax in which our wouldbe thug antihero gets a dose of his own medicine reminiscent of the brutality by ordinary folks in an extraordinary situation that Hitchcock exploited in LIFEBOAT. This leads to an oddly romantic ambiguous denouement as Ines surprisingly stands by her man.Seeing these two fabulous talents neither of whom fashioned a career or achieved the stardom worthy of their initial films' impact is reason enough to discover THE EAVESDROPPER. Its local content and topical material TorreNilsson forecasts the style of Haskell Wexler's classic MEDIUM COOL in several scenes deftly integrating reallife documentary content with staged dramatics were a bit impenetrable for me especially viewing an untranslated Spanishlanguage print but the overriding themes carry considerable bite.".

	schema:reviewBody "The current copy of the Universal production of The Phantom of the Opera 1925 is only a shadow of what was once a great film.Originally the way the film was shot it stayed quite close to the book. Many people have complaints about the film straying from the novel but key sequences like the Graveyard at Perros and the alternate ending where Erik dies of Christine's kiss were shot then scrapped then reshot and then rescrapped.  Eventually they were just rewritten or disacknowledged altogether.The original cut was shown in Los Angeles on January 7 and 26 1925. This was the cut that used the most footage from what was shot starting on OctoberDecember 1924. Due to poor reviews the January release was pulled and Rupert Julian was told to reshoot most of the picture. Already having become a difficult director and egocentric over the fact that he was the star director ever since he replaced Erich Von Stroheim on THE MERRYGOROUND 1924 he walked out on the studio.Edward Sedgewick later director of Keaton's THE CAMERAMAN who was working for Universal at the time was asked by Carl Laemmele to reshoot and redirect a bulk of the movie.  Raymond L. Schrock who along with Elliot Clawson was the screenwriter for the film rewrote new scenes to add into the film by the request of Sedgewick.  Most of these scenes were added subplots with Chester Conklin and Vola Vale as comedic partners to the heroes and Ward Crane as the Russian Count Ruboff dueling for Christine's affection.  This cut premiered in San Fransico on April 26 1925 and also failed miserably with reviews.The final cut had to be made so Maurice Pivar and Lois Weber rewrote the final draft script which was edited to the final nine reels which debuted on September 6 1925 at the Astor Theater in New York City and October 17 1925 in Hollywood.  This cut only exists in 16mm ShowAtHome prints made by Universal for home movie use.  These prints are not top quality but watchable and even the most complete existing version of this print today is incomplete from years of splicing.  These 16mm prints sometimes make it to the underground video market and are best to watch for story but not for quality.If you think about all of the mishandling in between you realize how much has been tampered with the film so far.  To add insult to injury most prints circulating today including Kino's and the Kevin Brownlow restoration are actually from a rerelease in 1929.  When sound came around Universal immediately redubbed Phantom in sound and reshot about 40 of the film whatever Lon Chaney was not in since he was unavailable. The only quality 35mm print today is a copy made in 1950 for Eastman House in Rochester NY of the silent cut of the sound rerelease to distribute to theaters that didn't have sound systems.So as you can see it is really almost impossible to truly critique THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 1925.  It is a semilost film.".

Alas his plans to become a good husband are interrupted by the need to bump off a few of his pursuers using elaborate boody traps and alarms throughout the dungeons.The final minute of the movie is perhaps the best with Erik's final gesture proving that his mental ability far outweighs that of anyone else in the film. He goes out in style leaving the dimwitted Raoul and his amoral girlfriend to live happily ever after.The two best things are Chaney's overthetop performance as Erik and the spectacular sets. Chaney had a way of making any other actors in a film appear flat and lifeless and this is no exception. The elaborate set of the opera house and the gothic appearance of the dungeons are still impressive and the tinting and twostrip technicolor in the Bal Masque sequence look great.Phantom is rousing horroradventure while Hunchback was a touching allegorical film. The latter is better and more serious but Phantom is still some of the most fun it's possible to have before a movie screen.".

Christine keeps hearing a compelling voice behind the walls of her dressing room that gives her encouragement to perform. Her career soon takes a turn for the better when the lead performer is mysteriously unable to go on and Christine is called to take her place. The voice later summons Christine to the cellar five flights beyond the opera house where she follows this sinister man whose face is covered with a mask. Although she fears him not Christine becomes very curious about The Phantom but curiosity gets the better of her when she decides to creep up from behind the phantom and remove his mask only to get the surprise of her life. The Phantom agrees to release Christine from his underground cellar consisting of a coffin bed where the Phantom sleeps at a promise that she not only devote herself to her opera singing but to never see or speak to her fianc again. Only after Christine has a secret meeting with Raoul during a ball masque does the Phantom who shadowed her to make Christine his prisoner of love.In true Universal fashion this Gothic presentation has all the elements of a suspense thriller. From its opening shot shows a cloaked figure creeping about the underground cellar of the opera house. The storyline immediately gets down to basics in which there's a discussion amongst the staff regarding a mysterious figure roaming about followed by the sudden appearance of another mysterious character Arthur Edmund Carewe walking about the opera house saying nothing but observing everything. In between these key scenes leading to the purpose of the movie title there are ballet and opera sequences intercutting the plot along with a stage hand Snitz Edwards supplying some comic relief.. This being a silent film the compositions from FAUST cannot be heard but are usually heard through the underscoring which accompanies the film. Besides the now familiar story and its just famous unmasking sequence it's Chaney as Erik the mysterious phantom with his skulllike appearance who makes this one of the most intense characters ever played on the screen. The movie itself fails to explore the background to Erik's character as to why does he choose Christine as his selected one. Only late into the story is it realized through the investigation in the police records by Christine's fianc Raoul that Erik is not only a selfeducated musician having escaped imprisonment from Devil's Island but is actually insane. Other than being insane he's a genius for that he has decorated his underground chambers with certain traps including a room that can fill with water or become filled with intense heat for his intruders. While Erik being insane might explain certain aspects as his intent to kill certain individuals at the opera house with one scene finding one man left dangling from a noose but fails to answer the question Was Erik born this way or was he a rejected creation of Doctor Frankenstein? So popular upon its release THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was reissued in 1930 a shorter print with added talking sequences and new orchestral score. Universal remade THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in 1943 with Claude Rains and in 1962 with Herbert Lom each performed differently from the Chaney carnation but with some explained detail to the Phantom's background of character.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has achieved cult status over the years due to constant revivals ranging from theaters to television. It was one of the selected twelve movies shown on public television's 1975 presentation of The Silent Years hosted by Lillian Gish. During the era of home video in the 1980s THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA not only became a public domain title but consisted of various versions and different scores. The Kartes Video Communications print features no scoring but a different opening introducing Raoul de Chagny Kerry and his brother Philippe John St. Polis through title cards and other scenes detailing the character of Carlotta Virginia Pearson. There's even a conclusion with Christine and Raoul kissing on their honeymoon in Viroflay a fadeout that's nonexistent in most prints. BLACKHAWK Video later Republic Home Video included an excellent organ score by Gaylord Carter and clear picture quality of 79 minutes the standard length of many video copies but excluding the brief honeymoon closing. This similar print can be found from KINO Video. In one of the Turner Classic Movies cable TV presentations of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights a few years ago the station having broadcast with a traditional organ score in years past presented Halloween night one of the worst reproductions and bad orchestrations ever presented for a silent movie making this 97 minute version appear endless. Eventually TCM went ahead and a more soothing copy and organ score afterwards.As it stands THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA can be seen numerous ways on video and DVD at either 97 minutes or longer with orchestral scoring but it's Lon Chaney's cloak figure that will remain in lasting memory long after the movie is over.

	schema:headline " The first remains the best";
	schema:reviewBody "The Phantom of the Opera is a tale that's been oft told but all too often it's told poorly. The storya grand melodrama like much of opera itselfrequires a fine balance of terror and tragedy with perhaps a bit of camp humor to lighten the proceedings and finding the right tone is a task which has defeated many a director and actor. But it can be done as this first of the many film incarnations proves.For anyone needing an overview of Gaston Leroux's tale the premise is briefly thus during the latter decades of the Victorian Era the great Paris Opera is troubled with whispers of a ghosta frightening specter which visits misfortune on the company should they fail to please him. Upandcoming singer Christine Daae Mary Philbin meanwhile is more preoccupied with her singing tutora disembodied voice she believes to be an emissary from her dead father who guides her to new heights but demands she put her music above all else including and especially her handsome childhood sweetheart Raoul Norman Kerry. Neither Phantom nor tutor is a spirit in truth but are two different sides of the same mana horribly disfigured unnaturally gifted and frighteningly passionate man but a man nonetheless.Despite dated acting techniques and some extremely overwrought title cards You must save me Raouloh save me! Christine pleads at one point the silent film version of Phantom has held up remarkably well thanks to some evocative scenes and an unforgettable turn by Lon Chaney in the title role. The moment when the Phantom driven by his allconsuming desire for Christine lures the girl into his home beneath the Opera is every bit as eerie and compelling as it should be. An Escherlike series of ramps descends into the earth leading to the sort of black subterranean lake Charon would feel at home on and an underground apartment that seems fairly normal until you see the coffin in the master bedroom and the mirrored torture chamber adjoining.Any version of Phantom though lives or dies by its title character and Chaney does not disappoint. Even in his early scenes where he appears almost solely as a shadow on the wall he has a remarkable presence his gestures expressive and elegant in silhouette. The audience first sees him in physical form as Christine first sees hima masked and cloaked figure disturbing yet with an aura of weary sadness about him. When that mask finally comes off in the film's landmark scene Chaney's makeup genius is instantly in evidence. The wildeyed cadaverous skull remains the most frightening interpretations of the Phantom's disfigurement and also the one which hews closest to Leroux's description.

	onyx:emotionText "The Phantom of the Opera is a tale that's been oft told but all too often it's told poorly. The storya grand melodrama like much of opera itselfrequires a fine balance of terror and tragedy with perhaps a bit of camp humor to lighten the proceedings and finding the right tone is a task which has defeated many a director and actor. But it can be done as this first of the many film incarnations proves.For anyone needing an overview of Gaston Leroux's tale the premise is briefly thus during the latter decades of the Victorian Era the great Paris Opera is troubled with whispers of a ghosta frightening specter which visits misfortune on the company should they fail to please him. Upandcoming singer Christine Daae Mary Philbin meanwhile is more preoccupied with her singing tutora disembodied voice she believes to be an emissary from her dead father who guides her to new heights but demands she put her music above all else including and especially her handsome childhood sweetheart Raoul Norman Kerry. Neither Phantom nor tutor is a spirit in truth but are two different sides of the same mana horribly disfigured unnaturally gifted and frighteningly passionate man but a man nonetheless.Despite dated acting techniques and some extremely overwrought title cards You must save me Raouloh save me! Christine pleads at one point the silent film version of Phantom has held up remarkably well thanks to some evocative scenes and an unforgettable turn by Lon Chaney in the title role. The moment when the Phantom driven by his allconsuming desire for Christine lures the girl into his home beneath the Opera is every bit as eerie and compelling as it should be. An Escherlike series of ramps descends into the earth leading to the sort of black subterranean lake Charon would feel at home on and an underground apartment that seems fairly normal until you see the coffin in the master bedroom and the mirrored torture chamber adjoining.Any version of Phantom though lives or dies by its title character and Chaney does not disappoint. Even in his early scenes where he appears almost solely as a shadow on the wall he has a remarkable presence his gestures expressive and elegant in silhouette. The audience first sees him in physical form as Christine first sees hima masked and cloaked figure disturbing yet with an aura of weary sadness about him. When that mask finally comes off in the film's landmark scene Chaney's makeup genius is instantly in evidence. The wildeyed cadaverous skull remains the most frightening interpretations of the Phantom's disfigurement and also the one which hews closest to Leroux's description. To be fair it's doubtful Chaney's makeup would have been practical in a sound film the distortions of his nose and mouth would have made speakingand singingvery difficult indeed. The movie's greatest weakness is its ending a chase scene complete with the standard Angry TorchBearing Mob that feels wedged in probably because that's precisely what it is. The original ending stuck with Leroux's novel where the Phantom moved by Christine's compassion releases her to marry her young suitorbut the first audiences apparently not as empathetic for the character as his creator was found this ending an unsatisfying one.

The exaggeration in the actors gestures and expressions the early camera technology that's not quite fluid and not quite clear the tinted colors and an artificially overlaid soundtrack  it all combines and adds up to paint an abstract and unnatural picture.Cinema has evolved so far since the Silent Era that watching these films is almost like glimpsing into another world completely unrelated to the one most of us grew up watching. And I find it fascinating that this is indeed the ancestor to many horror films that I adore today. So like with other classics I viewed Phantom of the Opera with the delight of discovering our cinematic horror roots  seeing the predecessor to Jack Pierce Rick Baker and Stan Winston in action watching the precursor to John Carpenter Mario Bava and David Cronenberg.From the opening scene Phantom of the Opera makes great use of shadows. A character with a lantern wanders the labyrinth below the Paris Opera house ducking into an alcove as the shadow of the Phantom passes. Barring a handful of shots showing a cloaked figure from behind or from a distance this motif continues as Erik the Phantom is represented as a shadow calling to Christine from the catacombs behind her dressing room mirror until she inevitably comes face to face with the mask which she will inevitably remove. Even though I'm quite familiar with the face of Lon Chaney's Phantom from the numerous stillshots out there I still felt the pulse of anxiety and suspense when that famous moment drew near. Though blatantly exploitive in its camera angle the timing the expression on Chaney's face though it aims purely for spectacle and shock for the audience of 1925 it carries something newer spectaclesshockfilms lack charm.I couldn't help but smile watching Chaney's haunting performance beneath that famous makeup seeing it animated for the first time the sadness and tragedy that underlines the phantoms soul. He moves with a precision and deliberateness that's not entirely natural but remains paradoxically sincere. The rooftop scene in particular where Christine and Raoul plot oblivious to the presence of the unmasked phantom who listens in with great intensity from his perch above  gripping his cape in his heartbroken state eventually throwing himself back into the grasp of the statue in disbelieving defeat.There's something both awkward and poetic to the movements of the actors as they express their emotions not in subtleties but rather in exaggerated body language that almost feels at home here almost but not quite. Early in the film frightened ballerinas spontaneously spin in place one revolution as a visual representation of their anxiety. Somewhat silly but simultaneously delightful in its approach.Later in the film Christine rejects the Phantom arcing her back to its limit her face turned as far away as possible with her hands outstretched as if the very air around Erik would prove toxic. A single still frame presented to an audience completely isolated from the context of the rest of the film would leave absolutely no room for misinterpretations.The film goes on to a larger scope and bigger thrills with the inevitable fall of the chandelier the Phantom's many tricks and traps in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House and the final pursuit where the mob chases Erik through the streets of Paris  the film strains itself to outdo all the silent films that came before. However it strains too far and I find myself liking the film in its quieter more personal exploits the phantom in the shadows the unmasking the rooftop. I do have to comment on the end of the film though Erik has been cornered and surrounded on all sides by the angry mob. He raises up a closed fist threateningly as though within his grasp lay one final card that could level the playing field  an explosive of some type  and the crowd visibly hesitates backing off. After a dramatic pause the Phantom opens his hand to reveal he's holding nothing at all.Then we realize the film itself has done the very same thing. For the length of its running time it convinces you it held something  some kind of aweinspiring trick up its sleeve. Thus the problem with all exploitation films but you have to admire Phantom for how it sustains so little for so long and makes you smile after you realize the truth.Like a good magic trick.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most eminent horror films ever made and perhaps even the most famous silent horror movie from that time. Lon Chaney starred in over 150 films most of them silent ones but he'll always be remembered best for his personification of Erik the Phantom. And justified! Even though this role was played by many respectable actors afterwards like Claude Rains Herbert Lom and Robert Englund Lon Chaney is  and remains  the one and only Phantom of the Opera. The film itself is depressing and dark with terrific photography and settings. Deep down the catacombs of the Parisian Opera building the phantom reigns in forgotten dungeons and underground lakes. After all these years of dwelling in the opera he has fallen in love with the unsuccessful singer Christine. He helps her career a little and threatens to kill the prominent singer Carlotta if she doesn't hand over the her role in Faust to Christine. The until then unknown singer is thankful and meets her master' in the catacombs. Her appreciation soon turns into fear when she finds out her benefactor is the horribly scarred Phantom of the Opera. The biggest difference between this first version and the later remakes lies in the roots of the Phantom. Here Erik is said to be an escaped madman whereas he merely only was a hurt romanticist in later versions. His deformed appearance isn't explained and neither is shown how he falls for the beautiful shy Christine. At least 3 sequences in the 1925 Phantom of the Opera are legendary and still astonishing after almost 80 years. The masked bal which the Phantoms attends as the Red Death' is an outstanding horror sequence and truly atmospheric. The grimaces of Chaney seem to look right through the other partygoers and his search for Christine is relentless. Immediately after this scene the crew moves to the roof of the Opera building and Chaney takes place on top of the Apollo statue. A breathtaking piece of early cinema that stands the test of time like no other. The climax of Phantom of the Opera is an extended series of chasings and battues resulting in the dramatic and gruesome death of our protagonist. Rupert Julian's classic silent has got everything! An actor capable of carrying the toughest role ever written beautiful scenery reallife drama sentiment and romance. And last but not least an unbearable tension Throughout the entire film you're looking at it with your eyes wide open.".

	schema:headline " Seeing this one with Mary was an unforgettable experience!";
	schema:reviewBody "My goodness...close to fifty years ago I saw this film in the company of its leading lady Mary Philbin.  She was a friend of an unforgettable lady our family had met when we moved from New England to southern California.  Our mutual friend was constantly prodding Miss Philbin who had become quite reclusive after retiring from the screen to get out and enjoy life.  They took a trip to Europe one summer for instance.  One evening she persuaded Mary who was extremely reluctant by the way to accompany us to the silent movie theater on Fairfax Ave. not far from Hollywood Blvd. and the site of Grauman's Chinese Theater and other firstrun movie palaces to see a revival of The Phantom of the Opera.  That old theater not in the least luxurious and quite small was a virtual shrine for lovers of silent films. Management had obtained a print of this film in acceptable condition though I don't recall that the Technicolor sequence had been preserved in that print and on that evening anyway there was no musical accompaniment.Mary dreaded the experience of seeing one of her old films amid a midFifties audience which she feared would find the film a subject of comical curiosity rather than a piece of genuinely enthralling entertainment.  We joined the rest of the audience that night in enjoying the experience of seeing the film however and Mary was relieved that she had consented to accompany us though she insisted that we shield her from any possible recognition not too easy to do since she had hardly changed in appearance in the quartercentury since that classic's production.  I for one remember being amazed at the care and expense that had obviously been lavished on its production. Not very long after that evening we went to a neighborhood theater in Pacific Palisades Calif. to see James Cagney in the 1957 UniversalInternational biographical film about Lon Chaney Sr. Man of a Thousand Faces again with Mary Philbin in our company.  The unmasking scene from The Phantom of the Opera was rather perfunctorily recreated with an actress playing Mary who did not resemble her.  As we exited the theater Mary and our family friend who had quite a few early Hollywood associations She had once been married to Ernst Lubitsch the legendary director when they first came to Hollywood from their native Germany. regaled me with reminiscences about Irving Thalberg played in the film by a young Robert Evans whom they had both known and for whom they had quite a high regard.Mary remained a family friend over the years until her death more than thirty years later.  She led a very quiet life for many years occupying a house she had owned since the days of her stardom only a few blocks north on Fairfax Ave. from that silent movie revival house!  I remember her with great fondness for her modesty and extraordinary sweetness.".

One evening she persuaded Mary who was extremely reluctant by the way to accompany us to the silent movie theater on Fairfax Ave. not far from Hollywood Blvd. and the site of Grauman's Chinese Theater and other firstrun movie palaces to see a revival of The Phantom of the Opera.  That old theater not in the least luxurious and quite small was a virtual shrine for lovers of silent films. Management had obtained a print of this film in acceptable condition though I don't recall that the Technicolor sequence had been preserved in that print and on that evening anyway there was no musical accompaniment.Mary dreaded the experience of seeing one of her old films amid a midFifties audience which she feared would find the film a subject of comical curiosity rather than a piece of genuinely enthralling entertainment.  We joined the rest of the audience that night in enjoying the experience of seeing the film however and Mary was relieved that she had consented to accompany us though she insisted that we shield her from any possible recognition not too easy to do since she had hardly changed in appearance in the quartercentury since that classic's production.  I for one remember being amazed at the care and expense that had obviously been lavished on its production. Not very long after that evening we went to a neighborhood theater in Pacific Palisades Calif. to see James Cagney in the 1957 UniversalInternational biographical film about Lon Chaney Sr. Man of a Thousand Faces again with Mary Philbin in our company.  The unmasking scene from The Phantom of the Opera was rather perfunctorily recreated with an actress playing Mary who did not resemble her.  As we exited the theater Mary and our family friend who had quite a few early Hollywood associations She had once been married to Ernst Lubitsch the legendary director when they first came to Hollywood from their native Germany. regaled me with reminiscences about Irving Thalberg played in the film by a young Robert Evans whom they had both known and for whom they had quite a high regard.Mary remained a family friend over the years until her death more than thirty years later.  She led a very quiet life for many years occupying a house she had owned since the days of her stardom only a few blocks north on Fairfax Ave. from that silent movie revival house!  I remember her with great fondness for her modesty and extraordinary sweetness.";

I like it I own it I watch it again from time to time.But this 1925 silent version with Lon Chaney as Eric the Phantom is actually a much better film to tell the story. Sure it is silent so we have to interpret facial expressions and body language plus read occasional subtitles. But during the climax when Christine is down in the catacombs and comes face to face with Eric the first time and sees his disfigured face. And when Raol is in the dark wet complex tunnels looking for her these are much more dangerous looking scenes than in the modern movie.For all practical purposes the story is the same. Eric is the disfigured but insane genius who tries to force Christine to love him. As has been widely reported Chaney did his own makeup and succeeded in making his character look almost skulllike. In all a fine older movie. Saw it on TCM channel.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1925 Phantom of the Opera widely regarded as the best film adaptation of the story ever starts off with the explanation that the Paris Opera House rises nobly over torture chambers and hidden dungeons which is a great way to start a story about a disfigured man living in the torture chambers and hidden dungeons under the Paris Opera House. It not only establishes the setting as a classy playhouse built on the ruins of past torture chambers and dungeons but also provides a level of creepiness necessary in a movie in which Erik the Phantom is able to live down there in vast recesses which have become unknown.Lon Chaney delivers a stunning performance one of the most famous in film history. Indeed the scene where Christine pulls off the Phantom's mask is still scary 80 years after its release. People in 1925 must have been nearly frightened out of their seats. This film is indeed the Exorcist of the 1920s. The very simple story is presented with stunning effectiveness especially since the now very recognizable music is not even in this version.In the cellars under the Paris Opera House lives the Phantom who demands of the new and understandably skeptical management that the lead role in the play be given to Christine Daa under penalty of devastating punishment. The new owners laughed off a warning that they might hear rumors of ghosts so it's the fact that they similarly ignore the Phantom's warning is to be expected. In this version that Phantom takes the terrified Christine into his dungeon because he loves her so that which is good within my aroused by your purity might plead for your love. As is also stated in the film man's hatred made him into the Phantom and he needs her love to redeem him.The Phantom is constantly making gestures with his hands that give the appearance that he is about to pull off his mask which is one of the brilliant ways the film adds to the suspense of Christine pulling it off. There is an impressive psychological subtlety here as the film makes a comment on mankind's need to see and touch our inability to leave things unseen even when we know that they are better off unseen. Everything must be touched experience and in this case corrupted even to theirs and our own detriment. Christine is humanity.The infamous chandelier is indeed one of the stars of the film and the story itself as it is the Phantom's instrument of his most extensive murderous damage but its effects are almost immediately forgotten. Even though the scene after it falls is the one where Raoul and Christine meet against the Phantom's instructions is the only one that really shows that they truly love each other this takes place the night after presumably dozens of people were killed or injured in that very room. I would think that the Phantom would have been upset as much by the lack of remorse shown by the people that he intends to punish and frighten as he was at the reunion of Raoul and Christine.The Secret Police officer is one character that has been removed for the 2004 version which is too bad because he added a great element of possibility to the movie as he is initially thought to be the Phantom in disguise but ultimately reveals himself to be an officer who has been studying the Phantom for months in his attempts to capture him. The character makes for a great chase sequence of sorts late in the film in which he and Raoul attempt to capture him in his dungeon home. In the climactic scene Raoul and the officer are in some sort of an ovenroom being baked by the Phantom who demands Christine's love in order to save them the 2004 version of this scene again is strikingly different but they escape into a nearby room full of gunpowder. Nevermind the influence this must have had on National Treasure the important thing is that this shows that the Phantom had some explosive plans. He is a character for whom we are meant to have limited sympathy.Although Chaney's powerful performance is the biggest aspect of this film production Christine is the star of the story in this movie. She doesn't love the Phantom obviously but needs him to bestow upon her the talent necessary for her to achieve the stardom the she so strongly desires. Once she sees his disfigured face she immediately calls upon Raoul to save her from him. It is important that she seeks Raoul's help only after seeing the Phantom's face calling into question the realness of her love for him. Both men love Christine but she loves neither of them. Her desire for fame turns to a desire to be saved from a man of whom she is terribly frightened but who is in love with her and her only savior is a man who will similarly expect a lifetime of love and devotion from her but with whom she is certainly not in love either. The tragedy is Christine's not the Phantom's.I was initially wondering about the point of having Christine turn a scorpion or a grasshopper to indicate her answer rather than simply saying yes or no but it allows a great opportunity to have a deathly hazard befall the police officer and Raoul as a result of Christine's actions. The Phantom redeems himself by helping to pull them out the trapdoor which finally brings sympathy to the fate that he ultimately suffers which is similar to that suffered by Frankenstein's monster in James Whale's unfaithful 1931 adaptation which was invented for that movie as is this one. Nevertheless the reputation that this film has as the best Phantom adaptation ever made are richly deserved. This is a milestone in film history.".

However when she meets the man he is the phantom  horribly scarred and insane.  He demands her love but Christine plans to flee with her real lover  a plan that the phantom cannot allow.I'm not sure it if makes any great difference but the version I watched was a restored version of this film with a new score and some colour treatment on the film stock.  The main thing that struck me about the film was the sheer grandeur and scale of the film.  The story is simply told but doesn't lose the tragic elements even if they are silently told.  The cast are to be praised for the job they do telling the story without words  it is a very different style of acting from today but they do it well.  Each actor has to exaggerate their expressions and movements but not do so to the point of being comical they all do well.  Philbin is excellent as the woman with an unwanted admirer and Chaney is a great phantom  tragic and hideous throughout.The film benefits greatly from a superb series of sets each large gothic and foreboding.  These wonderful sets are made even better by the cinematography which makes excellent use of shadow and light the film has a great atmosphere to it and this is almost entirely created by the lighting and sets.  The film has had a helping hand in the restored version the phantom's appearance as the Red Death is colour treated to give him a blood red cape which stands out in scenes of full colour or as on the roof where his cape is the only colour.  Even without this help the direction is great and the film feels rich in darkness to suit the material.The score is really great in the version I saw and is well designed to help the mood onscreen and compliment the emotions of the characters at any given moment.  I'm a protg of action movies and multiplexes and am supposed to need things exploding to hold my attention however this film hooked me throughout with it's tragic tale and lavish design.".

	schema:headline " Chaney's performance of an outcast as always is unmatched!";
	schema:reviewBody "Before the famous Andrew Lloyd Webber musical there was the masterful work of cinema that continues to frighten and enthrall to this day. Before Michael Crawford there was the legendary Lon Chaney. Before this day and age of heavy reliance upon CGI and explosions there was a time when silence was golden and muted gestures spoke a thousand words. Outcasts who deviate from the norm is a subject which has been explored countless times in cinema. Lon Chaney The Man of a Thousand Faces was born for the silent movie era having been forced to master the art of physical communication because his parents were deaf. He was the ideal actor to portray a misfit character thanks to the harsh environment in which he spent his youth a childhood in which his peers did not so easily accept him. The Phantom of the Opera is one of Chaney's many iconic roles. Adapted from the French novel of the same name the story is set in Paris France within a haunted opera house. The central focus is the relationship between the beautiful young singer Christine Daa and the Phantom mysterious apparition who Christine refers to as The Angel of Music. Under the Phantom's influence Christine excels in the art of singing and rises to fame but little does she realize how deeply the Phantoms obsession with her runs. The Phantom is no angel but rather a deranged madman master of the Black Arts and hideous in facial features brought to us by the makeup talents of Chaney himself  hence Man of a Thousand Faces. The Phantom is the classic example of human deformity but as monstrous as the phantom may appear at first sight there is a sympathetic side to him as well. Looking past the revolting features it's plain to see that the Phantom is a poor misfit who desperately longs to be accepted by another. Within Christine the Phantom finds his chance and upon being denied his happiness by her rejection the humanity that remained inside the phantom is overcome by a storm of rage which would lead to his death at the hands of an angry mob. Chaney's performance of an outcast is unmatched. Although devoid of any dialogue the emotions are so vivid in his physical communication that the lines write themselves affecting viewers deeply in the process. This is all enforced with the haunting atmosphere and musical score that the movie provides. The unmasking sequence said to have caused fainting in theaters the Phantom entering the ballroom in the guise of the Red Death and later looking down upon Christine and Raoul from a statue while in a state of betrayal jealousy and rage are impossible to forget. Everything conveyed without a word spoken. The production value is a marvel to look at. The magnitude of the sequences involving great crowds is well captured by the cinematography and there are closer focuses upon the characters for the sake of enforcing emotion. The Gothic scenery and costumes elevate the film to another level of artistry that emphasizes its dark tone. In all respects the visuals have an exquisite quality. I count the Phantom of the Opera among the most accomplished films of the silent genre with its chilling atmosphere moving story and the remarkable visual performance that Lon Chaney is rightfully renowned for. The mark Chaney has left upon the world of cinema will undoubtedly last for all time and as irony would have it the silent era would die with him.".

Obviously the silent era produced an amazing number of names and images that last to this day. Charlie Chaplin Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino come to mind but for me it will always be The Face. The face of...The Phantom of the Opera! Is there a film image that can conjure up such horror as the unmasking of Erik The Phantom? Played by 'The Man of 1000 Faces' himself Lon Chaney we have to remember that this film was made in 1925 and that Chaney's characterization has remained as potent and vital in 2012 as the day it was first seen. Surely there are precious few performances of any kind that can stand the test of time as well as Chaney's has. Taking place in the late 19th century the story concerns the haunting of the Paris Opera House by the famed Phantom a hideously disfigured madman who from his underground lair deep beneath the stage fills the theatre owners with dread. In love with opera understudy Christine Daae the phantom terrorizes the theatre owners and performers when his object of affection is not given the lead role in the latest performance. Luring Christine to his lair while disguised he confides in her his unrequited love. The phantom has only one request that she never attempt to peer behind his mask. In love with another man Christine cannot give herself to the phantom and cannot resist the urge to peer behind the mask...As a silent film the viewer is treated to three aspects that make this film great. One is the performance of the actors. They are so expressive and so natural at the same time. Second is the amazing score. A PERFECT complement to the Gothic atmosphere of this movie. And third is your own imagination. Without speech and sound effects we have to imagine them for ourselves which makes this film even more special. A masterpiece by anyone's standards 'The Phantom of the Opera' deserves your attention. Highly Recommended!".

The Ultimate Edition is your best bet because seriously some people out there slapped awful orchestrations onto this public domain film and utterly ruined it.The only thing stopping this from being an easy 10 star movie is the ending where a film that has otherwise stayed admirably true to the book suddenly slips into a parallel universe worthy of the internet's worst fan fiction. I understand that they had to do this because audiences of that day were enraged at the thought of this villain not getting his due justice and in defense of the film Mr. Chaney plays through the horrid rewrites like the pro he was.Strong 9 stars.".

Living alone and presumably lonely in a subterranean maze beneath the Paris opera house the phantom known as Eric Lon Chaney sets his desires on Christine Mary Philbin a singer. Though there are secondary characters the story centers on Eric and his actions to claim Christine for himself.Is Eric for real? We're given no backstory. He has no apparent means of survival. All we know about him is that he wears a mask desperately wants Christine and has enormous technical skills that allow him beyond all reason to furnish his lair with a large organ to set traps for his enemies and to control his underground world via remote control. I don't think we as viewers are supposed to ask too many questions about how all this works.Nevertheless a big part of why this film appeals to me is its hidden subterranean physical spaces a kind of labyrinthine cave so close to the opera house yet socially far removed the perfect abode for a disfigured human reject.With his grotesque makeup and expressive body language Lon Chaney gives a fine performance actually much better than the other performers who overact in a melodramatic way. I thought the film's ending could have been a little more imaginative.The introduction of crude colors in a few scenes conveys a welcome Gothic tone to the film. Several scenes like Eric's unmasking and the Masked Ball are quite famous. Even if a viewer doesn't normally care for silent films he or she needs to see The Phantom of the Opera. This 1925 film is one of the most well respected of the silent era.".

He has lurked in the background for some time but when he sees his heart's desire Christine he emerges and wreaks havoc on the opera house if they do not make her the star. Opposition arises.The film's quality for its time period is very impressive far greater than the Hunchback film just a few years prior. Everything is crisp and clean very much a modern film though with a lack of sound. I saw this on the big screen with live organ accompaniment the only real way to see a silent film. The music is phenomenal and only heightened the greatness of this classic.One must also point out the architecture. I am unclear where this was filmed but the underground arches and tunnels were beautiful Gothic and looming. At times I found myself distracted from the action to admire the craftsmanship of the background. I am curious about this.Lon Chaney's makeup in this one is celebrated and with good reason this is probably his best disguise. Again in Hunchback he was good but somewhat silly. Here he is creepy ugly and indeed terrifying. Some have written of the intense process Chaney put into this look and I have no doubt of these tales... he looks as disfigured as a man could look without real facial destruction.Chaney is praised by all from the claim that this is the star's best vehicle by Howard Maxford to the thought that this was one of Chaney's most impressive acting jobs by Mike Mayo. I am at no liberty to disagree. The way the man uses body language and his hands to portray emotion since he cannot speak in a silent film is incredible  and not just here. Anyone who wants to see Chaney's skill should check out The Unknown where he was an armless knife thrower.As I said above the only way to see this film is on the big screen with live organ accompaniment. However since this is not possible for most people I suggest the next best thing the Bluray from Image Entertainment. This disc is unbelievable with three versions of the film to watch three unique scores to listen to... and even an audio commentary from movie historian and Lon Chaney biographer Jon Mirsalis. I listened to it and even if you think you know all there could be to know about this film... you will learn from Mirsalis. All fans of horror or classic cinema must must must own this disc.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I was watching the first 30 minutes of the bio flick Bronson I thought it had a death wish or something. It does take a while to let this movie hit you. Bronson is based on the true story of who is called England's most notorious prisoner that would be Michael Peterson better known by his alias Charlie Bronson. He has been incarcerated for 36 years and 31 in solitary confinement. He never killed anyone just was convicted of armed robbery a few times but it was his feisty ways in the prisons and psych wards he did time in that got him all that time. Instead of trying to breakout Bronson wanted to stay in prison but not exactly as a Solitary Man. He relished on physically brutalizing prison guards and other cellmates not to mention taking a few as hostages. Bronson also had an artistic side that is also highlighted in WriterDirector's Nicolas Winding Refn movie. Refn's screenplay with Brock Norman Brock did escape the rules of viewer engagement from time to time with its extreme bizarreness but somehow it boldly  bloody worked. Kudos goes to Refn for orchestrating those powerpunching scenes where Charlie B. is refn so many up. Also I must commend his direction of the comedic scenes of observing Charlie readapting to social civilization upon being released after his first prison tour of duty. But Bronson would not be a brawny feature without the tourdeperformance of Tom Hardy. This Hardy Boy sure did not lack a punch with his deadringer Bronson transformation. It will be hard to knock out Hardy as a surefire grand actor for years to come. It is hard to fathom that this is the same actor who played The Cleaner in Inception two exemplary performances but diverse in so many ways. Bronson is worth putting in the time for no better reason just to witness Tom Hardy's extraordinaire hard work. So pass Go and matchup with Bronson.  Excellent".

Born Michael Peterson he quickly realized that he wanted to make a name for himself. It is unclear why he chose the path he did. He had a normal upbringing a nice home good parents yet he just liked to fight. And he was good at it.After robbing a post office for what can be only described as chump change he was given a seven year sentence. Since that sentencing in 1974 Bronson has seen a little over a few months as a free man. He is still in prison to this day.What Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn gives us is a stylized version of one of the most bizarre and intoxicating stories I've seen in a long time. Bronson played wonderfully by Tom Hardy loves what he does. At least that what he wants us to believe. I was never really convinced that Bronson truly enjoyed what he did. Then again I can't see the pleasure in pummeling prison guards bare knuckle fighting fighting dogs and bringing others close to death. That said it was something else to watch.Hardy gives a rock solid performance. He fits the part both physically and mentally. He has the right edge to let us know how intelligent and hostile Charlie Bronson can be. It's hard to imagine playing someone as energized and mentally perturbed as Bronson who gets his jollies from beating up innocent prison guards and inmates but Hardy does just that in style. He never falters and gives 100 percent in every scene.I can see a lot of similarities to A Clockwork Orange. It has similar accents violent images an insight into the criminal mind. Things very much associated with Kubrick's masterpiece. Still Bronson offers something different. It's more theatrical blending both the real world with a more dramatic and exaggerated story showing Bronson as a prisoner a performer and storyteller.Bronson is filled with stunning startling images and a gives us a very original story the likes of with we have seldom seen or will see. Charlie Bronson is a unique case of a man that nobody will ever truly understand. Whether you like the glorification of criminals or not it's hard to deny that this film and the people involved doesn't offer great entertainment. I expect more from Hardy and Refn.".

It's a term applied to James Fox's gangland enforcer in 'Performance'  and it could also be applied to Charles Bronson aka Britain's most violent man as portrayed by Tom Hardy in this bizarre and bracing character study.We know Bronson if at all through tabloid headlines chronicling his hostagetaking rooftop protests and distinction as Britain's 'longest serving prisoner'. But even those who thought they knew Bronson might be surprised to learn that the man born Michael Peterson couldn't have had a more respectable start. Born into an uppermiddle class family in Aberystwyth his uncle was mayor and his parents ran the local Conservative club.But the bright gentle boy fell in with a bad lot he became a bareknuckle boxer he robbed a post office for 26.18p. The bungled armed robbery put him in jail for seven years. Initially. For many a lengthy prison stretch would be the undoing of life as they knew it. But it was the making of Bronson. In prison he discovered his calling a gift for chaos.The opening scene a tableau which will be repeated over and over again features him spattered in blood feral and naked playing human pinball with terrified prison warders until he's eventually overpowered a bound Promethean. He travels from prison to prison as if on eternal vacation. Parkhust is well worth a visit. At Wormwood Scrubs the staff ensure your stay is as memorable as possible. Hostagetaking is just a prescription against boredom although the matter of whether prolonged incarceration exacerbated his behaviour institutionalised him is never addressed.So far so BritCrime. But anyone expecting another 'Rise Of The Footsoldier'  even 'McVicar'  will be in for a shock. Refn first came to prominence with the 'Pusher Trilogy' gritty and unflinching pseudodocumentaries focusing on the criminal underworld of notso wonderful Copenhagen. Yet stylistically Bronson is a universe away from those movies it's far plainer to see the influence of DP Larry Smith who also photographed Refn's hyperreal 'Fear X.' Refn has delivered a weird and wonderful antibiopic that explodes the conventions of the genre a fittingly anarchic approach to linear progression of which the eponymous jailbird would surely approve. Most of these scenes could be shuffled around any which way which is appropriate when you've been banged up for as long as Bronson has 34 years 30 of them in solitary confinement time probably ceases to have much meaning.With a classicallyweighted score married to scenes of ultraviolence this not only pays homage to Kubrick but also to mavericks like Lindsay Anderson Peter Greenaway and John Maybury 'Love Is The Devil' in its picaresque digressions and painterly aesthetics a cinematic palate of reds and blacks. Hell colours. Compared with most of the wannabe badboys clogging up the arteries of British cinema this is practically an art installation or contemporary performance piece.And Charles Bronson of course is a firstrate performer from that attentiongrabbing Hollywoodpurloined name actually foisted on him by a boxing promoter to his way with his fists  and striking artworks which bear comparison with those of that other outsiderartist Daniel Johnston and which sell for small fortunes Bronson has worked as tirelessly as Max Clifford to keep his reputation intact and name in the papers for decades.Refn even has him orating to us from an Edwardian music hall stage and miming songs Dennis Potterstyle while painted like a harlequin or moustachetwirling circus strongman. It's disturbing and recalls Rupert Pupkin in 'The King Of Comedy' and Jonathan Pryce channeling Grock the clown in Trevor Griffiths' play 'Comedians'. Also Freddie Starr in the infamous 2001 Channel 4 documentary 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster' in which Starr berated an empty auditorium and laid a wreath onstage to symbolise 'British comedy's passing'.Starr came across as desperately unhappy but also largely selfdeluding. Bronson is equally deluded and naive. A prison governor tells him You're ridiculous. He is. But really he's just a little boy incarcerated inside endlessly replicating walls of muscle a selfmade prison of gristle and bone.Hardy gets that and his performance is astonishing proper Stanislavski. Whether gazing into the distance with a thousandyard stare as if awaiting the muse of mayhem to tell him who to hit next or gleefully cavorting in the theater of Bronson's imagination the man's magnetic. 'Peep Show's' Matt King also lends sterling support as Bronson's comically seedy upperclass boxing promoter Paul a Withnail in the underworld sporting black leather gloves.In a movie filled with startling nearhallucinatory moments  drugged drooling asylum inmates dancing woozily to The Pet Shop Boys Bronson caged in a tiny medievallike restricting device like something from a Francis Bacon  there is a truly remarkable scene toward the end that attempts to throw speculative light on the man's motivations what really makes him tick. Perhaps unsurprisingly the filmmakers suggest the answer lies in the creative impulse.Having taken his prison art teacher hostage Bronson demands to hear music. As Delibes' 'Lakm' is piped over the Tannoy a swooning naked Bronson smeared in charcoal and grease gently body paints Phil to resemble a living Magritte with a bowler hat and apple in his mouth. Might Bronson's violence simply be misdirected creative passion? Is prison really an ersatz canvas onto which he drips warders' blood like a sociopathic Jackson Pollock? Well alright. There's probably an argument for suggesting Bronson's nothing more than a pretentious thriller kitted out with the greatest hits of Classic FM. You could say the same of 'A Clockwork Orange.' Detractors might say it appeals to those who hold that violence is art and viceversa but would flee from a street fight. Which would be to truly underestimate such a smart funny and stylish film. Bronson appeals to the antiauthoritarian in us all.".

	onyx:emotionText "To be a performer in British underworld slang is to have a flair for violence to be particularly skilled at putting on the frighteners. It's a term applied to James Fox's gangland enforcer in 'Performance'  and it could also be applied to Charles Bronson aka Britain's most violent man as portrayed by Tom Hardy in this bizarre and bracing character study.We know Bronson if at all through tabloid headlines chronicling his hostagetaking rooftop protests and distinction as Britain's 'longest serving prisoner'.

	schema:reviewBody "Bronson is the story of a very violent man a man with clear mental issues that have gained him the infamous title of the most violent criminal in the UK he is undeserving of attention on the scale this film gives him and the idea that he is somehow pleased with the film or that it has earned him fame is something that sat uneasy with me while watching and continues to sit uneasy with me afterwards. Morally I wondered why I came to the film and also why it was made director Refn certainly doesn't seem bothered by this though and indeed did himself no favours by famously illegally taping the real man's comments on the film for broadcast at the premiere. So with this in mind it is hard to swallow a film that doesn't seems to have a certain apathy towards the central character  not a great choice of word perhaps but while the film doesn't go as far as admiring Bronson it certainly doesn't condemn him or present him in a way that will revile an audience.Having said that though what Refn seems to have done is created this film where Bronson tells us his own story. This allows for a soft touch as it is his own but also for this violently compulsive mind to create and fill the film so that he is equally a larger than life character while also being quite terrifying in his snaps and swings. The result of this approach is not a film that is to be relied on for the facts of the story but it is one that really delivers a quite dizzying film in terms of borrowed styles impact violence and sheer overthe top bravado. It is hard to really process because on one hand this was a problem for me but on the other it actually worked very well to produce a film that is as much a monster as its subject  and the kind part of me wants to believe that this was the point.If it was then it is successful in some way because it is a beast of a film that comes at you violently and persistently. This is not all praise perhaps but this is what it does. Depending on your point of view Refn's direction either pays homage or rips off plenty of others as he throws visual styles and flairs at the screen as if he never thought he's make another film. There are countless reference points are in here if you want them but for sure Clockwork Orange is what he is going for and I suppose in some way the sheer energy with which he goes after it is commendable. It is not his style and it doesn't make you forget the failings in substance but it is engaging as pure style. Matching him step for step in this regard is an incredibly ballsy performance from Hardy. It is worth noting that I do not think it is great when it comes to character or intelligence but these failings are in the material not with Hardy  he follows his director and he deserves a lot of credit for not flinching from anything. He is intense but yet flamboyant disturbed but yet disturbing a nice bloke but yet a hideous monster  and it is all done with 100 conviction. His Bronson is not a wellcrafted character but rightly or wrongly he isn't meant to be and Hardy hammers home what he has been given.Bronson is not an easy watch. For one reason it features strong violence language and nudity that may put some off but the much bigger reason for me was the lack of morality within the construct of the story. The lead character is allowed to tell his own story and as he twists it with his ego so the whole film is twisted by his ego  Bronson as a man doesn't deserve this done on his behalf and it sat uneasy with me. The saving grace though is that the whole thing is excessive and fullon from the director an approach which in turn draws an intense and bravely excessive performance from Hardy that makes this really worth watching even if it has a lot of problems in it and around it.".

Bronson doesn't give you any answers other than he was simply born that way despite loving parents. His inability to deal with society starting as early as his school years.What I did enjoy was Hardy's performance. Sure to be compared to Bana's Chopper which I think was far better  but I am an Aussie and therefore biased and also A Clockwork Orange. Hardy is impressive as the hulking and impulsive brute. He occasionally shows us Bronson's vulnerable side but mostly it's about the rage that drives him from one prison to another.The prison system and Brit government are seemingly helpless to come up with solutions at dealing with Bronson's violence. The man himself also seems way beyond rehabilitation. That would be a big understatement.I thought it was a shame that Bronson didn't get into boxing or some other type of physical sport like Rugby league when he was younger as it might have given him an outlet for his anger.Anyways it's ultimately pretty grim viewing but certainly packs a punch no pun intended. I would have like to see Winding Refn offer us a little more insight into the man.".

His eerie voice hulking frame and dead eyes all combine perfectly to make him one of cinema's most memorable villains in recent years and with most of the scenes consisting of him speaking monologues in solitary cells the film belongs to him.Which is good because the story isn't up to much. It's a loose dramatisation of the life of Michael Peterson a man who robbed a post office and ended up becoming Charles Bronson one of the most famous convicts of all time. To be honest the events aren't all that interesting and in other hands the continuous brawls with prison officers could become repetitive. Thank Heaven then for the presence of Nicolas Winding Refn VALHALLA RISING as director.

	schema:reviewBody "Can you really produce a biopic about the theatrical brutality of Britain's most dangerous prisoner and not incite comparisons to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange? The trailer for Nicholas Winding Refn's Bronson spouts the likeness triumphantly with a quote attributed to Damien McSorley for the publication Zoo. Surely Kubrick is a flattering filmmaker to have your humble work compared to though like American director Wes Anderson who borrows all the style of the man but none of the content Bronson is a film with an air of grandiosity and very little in the way of actual story. Kubrick's film based on the novel by Anthony Burgess has a Dickensian plot that doubles back on characters and scenarios established in the first act leaving nothing unchanged by the end of the third. It's a comparison under which Bronson unfavorably suffers well directed impeccably performed but completely devoid of structure.I don't mean to undersell the above compliments however. Tom Hardy as lowly criminal Michael Peterson and his imprisoned superstar alter ego Charles Bronson displays a remarkable feral intensity in the role spitting meaty cockney chunks of dialogue with a truly disquieting voracity. And Hardy makes a perfect match for Refn both share a larger thanlife approach to their craft. The director's visual audacity is never more sublimely paired with Hardy's performance than during Bronson's intermittent narrations snippets of a surreal oneman stage show for some great unseen audience. The cutaways recall the feel of Alex's presentation following the successful administration of the ludovico technique in Clockwork Orange. Swooping crane and sweeping dolly shots along with some fantastic locations also evoke Kubrick's directorial sentiments as does the more obvious accompaniment of classical score to key sequences.Unfortunately the failure of Bronson is not only that there's very little dramatically to be done with a man who spends the better part of his life in solitary confinement but that beyond a vague notoriety Peterson's ultimate goal is never particularly clear. The ending of the film is startling in its abruptness given that the scene seems interchangeable with any number of the fights Bronson picks over the course of the film. It doesn't feel a particularly epic brawl and by that point the tedium of Bronson's outbursts battles and increasingly severe punishments had worn me though it could maybe be called a statement on the nature of desensitizing cinemain that respect a reverse Clockwork Orange into a sleepy passivity.The film is nevertheless a step the right direction for the usuallyschlocky and hyper masculine Refn but Bronson still wants for the substantiality that makes great films great films. It isn't likely to inspire any further meditation on its subject beyond perhaps provoking a curiosity about the man himself in those intrigued but unsatisfied with the screenplay's frugal allocation of hard data and social context. But despite the film's inability to make clear its greater thematic intent I don't think Bronson is a perversely violent film or that it exists solely as a fetishistic idol to counterculture as some will likely label it and have labeled Kubrick's masterpiece. Its beautiful cinematography courtesy Larry Smith interestingly enough the lighting cameraman for Kubick's own Eyes Wide Shut and stellar lead may make it a worthwhile rental next year but as it stands Bronson is a precautionary tale. It's a film that has everything going for it except the the thing that matters most its story. And you don't need to be Stanley Kubrick to figure that out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure exactly what this film wants us to learn about Michael Peterson or Charles Bronson. All I learned about him was that he is an extremely violent self absorbed sociopath who lives in a tragic deluded fantasy world. Nothing else was offered no hidden depths revealed. In the end he was just a violent sadistic idiot. The heavy handed stylisation of the film was overly self conscious and blatantly copied from Clockwork Orange amongst other films. There was a clumsy attempt to turn scenes of violence into artistic aesthetic moments by using Stanley Kubric's method of showing them in slow motion with classical music playing in the background. The shear amount of extremely violent scenes grow painfully tedious. The way the film dealt with the hostage taking of Phil Danielson was offensive and totally disrespectful to Danielson himself who's life was ruined by the experience. Danielson was shown as a foppish idiot who deserved everything he got from Bronson. In reality Danielson was held captive for over 40 hours and was made to walk around the prison like a dog and was told by Brosnson that he was going to die. Bronson apologised in court to Danielson and his family which Bronson's supporters see as proof of the fundamental decency of the man. I don't buy into the Bronson supporter's propaganda. Bronson is artistic they tell us. Yeah and so? I actually checked out his so called art online and it's talentless childish rubbish. Even if it wasn't I don't see why that means he should be released. Perhaps his supporters should try being held hostage by him for 40 hours. Bronson is warm hearted and funny they tell us. Yeah Bronson and every other psychopath. Warmhearted until they take a dislike to you and use that as a justification for stamping on your head. I don't see why this man should have had a film made about him especially one that didn't seem to have any point to it. Having seen the film I hope he stays where he is locked up safe and sound.".

All I can claim is that I just know what I like as an innocent appreciator of what I see. Tom Hardy is amazing in his role as Bronson. As is purportedly said by Charles Bronson himself nobody else could have played the part except Hardy. The way the film demonstrates Bronson's state of mind as well as his life story is extremely well portrayed. The music score is haunting appropriate and wonderful. I love the way the film shifts from an almost innocent and seriously unique personality to a tragic comedian who is misunderstood. It highlights the terrible situations Bronson created by his antics and also his vulnerability as a human being his creativity his individuality and his naivety. To everyone who contributed to this film especially Tom Hardy for his amazing portrayal thank you. I say this is the best film I've seen in a lot of years 1010 as far as I'm concerned.".

He bungled a robbery of a postoffice in 1974 at the age of 22 took twentyodd pounds and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He managed to stretch that term to life in confinement having spent over 30 years in solitary through a series of offences including assault criminal damage kidnapping blackmail and climbing up on the roof of Broadmoor prison and lighting it on fire.Nicolas Winding Refn's biopic stars Tom Hardy as the titular Bronson a shavenheaded mustachioed dynamo tense and stalking in circles inside cells. The film cuts between jarring startling theatrical monologues in which Bronson directly relays his history his desire to be famous and infamous and scenes from the man's grim terrifying and hilarious journey through seemingly every prison cell and mental hospital in England. It's a showcase for a spectacular performance Tom Hardy's and he is allowed to express the full range of Bronson's very real idiosyncrasy  he is by turns menacing and engaging capable of hairtrigger violence but never without seeming cause and never on terms favouring him. He doesn't fight a guard caught alone in a cell he strips naked and greases himself and fights the four that enter to save their comrade. And loses. Again and again. Hardy absolutely seizes the role and invents from a unique subject an utterly unique completely believable character and masters him in voice poise and gesture a breathtaking technical performance.Had he been in a film made by a director more concerned with commercial appeal it'd be the buzz performance of the year but had that been true it would also be true that the performance itself couldn't have been as strong. Refn constructs a film whose every frame supports its central character's refusal to ascribe meaning or choice or reason to any of his actions. It's mannered and considered and as reminiscent of Kubrick's composition and sets as Bronson's call for music in exchange for a painted hostage is of Alex's love of ultraviolence and Beethoven in that director's A Clockwork Orange.In making such a film though one in which a character whose strength and smirking power obliterates the chance or hope or possibility of there being a solution or a cause or an avoidable mistake having been made and noted Refn has made a film that's curiously cold. We marvel at Hardy's Bronson but the relationship he builds with us and with the audience for whom he performs his vaudeville routines is one of love and admiration but completely bereft of empathy or concern. As Bronson tosses himself at the feet of angry guard after angry guard caring not at all about what happens to him or them our awe neuters our ability to feel concern and to worry at all about what will happen to the man. Like the film the man is impressive colossal and utterly unmoving.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has much to recommend it and its reputation will probably go up in time as more people see it. It looks fantastic and the performance by Tom Hardy is compelling. There is no attempt to sentimentalise this character or depict him as a victim. The dialogue is taut and authentic and contains many lines which may in time become as familiar as those in say Get Carter. My favourite is you just ped on a gypsy in the middle of nowhere. Its hardly the hot ticket. My slight problem is that the film sometimes tries too hard to impress. This is most noticeable during the long literally operatic scenes. These scenes become especially prevalent towards the end when Wagnerian music accompanies Bronson's drawings with an illfitting cartoon sequence and the warden slowmo strolling down the corridor. I did not see what the music added here. In the violent climax the music actually detracted from the physicality of the scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicholas Winding Refn's film doesn't for a second let us feel anything for Bronson except that he truly does deserve the title of Britain's Most Violent Prisoner. The tone of the film is that of a life abstracted from itself a man who views himself from a stage and from a confessional black space and just as he was and it's an experimental feat that will remind some of A Clockwork Orange cause you know violent bloke plus classical music and others of Lola Montes for the kaleidoscopic view of a life lived as a showbiz personality or wouldbe one. Much of the film is meant as pure entertainment not a psychological breakdown of this guy. Maybe there isn't much more to tell and that Bronson or Mickey Peterson was just a brutal fed up thug who should stay behind bars. But then I started to think really what's the point then? There's also a kind of disconnect with the experimental form very loosely structured though in a linear timeline in Bronson's life in and sometimes not in prison and Bronson as a character. Refn's talent extends out like a cage rattler but it should have gone even further. After a while it gets a little tiring actually to return to that image of a clownfaced Bronson on stage giving a packed audience a show and a half. It becomes predictable despite how radical Refn does or thinks he does filming the Bronson from his 'dramatized' scenes to his innerlandscape of wanting fame and notoriety. I knew it would come back around to it and it becomes more of a gimmick a plot device stringing along the narrative as opposed to the narrative working hard for itself. Or if this doesn't make sense frankly the film's structure and change in moods made me feel uneasy and not always in the good intentional queasy way of underground independent cinema.But don't get me wrong Bronson does have a lot to recommend for it. Some scenes are just flatout funny like when Bronson does a rather poor job stealing a ring from a jeweler or he gets away but explains wait ten minutes to call in such a calm deadpan vice or stick out as being really compelling and perfectly strange like when Bronson is put in a mental asylum as a means to tame the beast how he gets out of it by the way is a wicked kind of genius. It's also thrilling to see an actor like Tom Hardy take on the role with such mania and skill. This is not a person one can like much and only one or two moments is sympathy allowed or possible and otherwise we see him just as the monster he was. For any actor this is a challenge but when done right such as here it's enlightening. It's not quite as great as the performance or just character everyone's comparing it to Alex in Clockwork Orange but on its own terms it works as a contained force of rage and madness. He's an antihero that would make Jake La Motta cringe.Oh there's also plenty of scenes showcasing some wicked cinematography wicked in a complimentary sense I mean and a fine strange mix of classical tunes and 80's synthpop music. But by the end something just didn't sit totally right with me with Bronson. It's audacious and cleverly filmed but it doesn't take off from the promise of its opening minutes drifting along on the a story that is actually shorter than expected and after a while the sameness of the structure is what kind of gets it down. This should either be a straightforward narrative or something so gonzo it would make Takashi Miike run for the hills. Instead it's in a semicomfortable middle. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing is for certain Bronson invites you to admire its protagonist as a pure muscular embodiment of anarchy. And perhaps you will but you will also be glad that he is still behind bars. The film opens with a man on stage proclaiming My name is Charlie Bronson and all my life I've wanted to be famous. The auditorium appears to be empty but later a still unseen audience provides the approval he so desperately covets. Born Michael Peterson Tom Hardy in a British suburb in 1952 he first went to prison at the age of 22 for burglarizing a post office. He stole 26.18 and received seven years for the crime but that sentence was quickly extended as Peterson's infractions inside began to pile up insubordination violence blackmail and multiple hostage situations. Michael is gradually swallowed up by the prison system seemingly an environment that suits him best. It is during this time that Michael Petersen the boy fades and 'Charles Bronson' his superstar alter ego takes over. Bronson occupies any territory in which he exists by sheer brute force. Bronson's first and only instinct is to fight to capture and to win. He never makes it to phase two of planning. He has now spent more than three decades in jail with the majority of those years in solitary confinement and has become a tabloid sensation as the most violent prisoner in Britain. The film is impressively structured and edited shot in dark tonesillustrating his theme that Bronson is an artist looking for a canvas whose search is frequently violent crazy and erratic. The director is Nicolas Winding Refn most famous for the movie Drive 2011 and his Pusher trilogy of films about Copenhagen's violent multiethnic underworld. Refn himself is something of a rebel who brings a sharp surreal foreign eye to the film. The film solely rests upon the astonishing performance from an almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy. Bronson never asks for our sympathy for his situation but somehow at times he is able to do just that. Hardy brings a raw physicality to the role leaping naked about his cell jumping from tables and hurling himself into half a dozen guards. Unfortunately the film never gets under the skin of Bronson and his motivations. It omits other facets of his life including the Muslim woman he married in jail his conversion to Islam and the subsequent renouncement of the awards he won for his art and poetry.Enduring the egotistical ramblings of a psychopath may not sound like a particularly entertaining prospect but Bronson delivers on all fronts. Gripping visceral ugly and beautiful Bronson is simply unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first viewed Bronson it was the day after Drive opened in theaters. I was utterly blown away by its style and technical perfection and the actors' performances so I decided to investigate director Nicolas Winding Refn's earlier films. Perhaps Drive was the wrong film to start with. Bronson radically different from Drive sports a much more avant garde style I'd go as far as to say it's very similar to Kubrick. I was caught off guard. I enjoyed the style and Hardy's brilliance but I wasn't quite in love with it. I gave it a 610 and moved on. Now here I am having recently fallen in love with Refn's Valhalla Rising giving Bronson a second chance. And I'm glad I did.Bronson is about a man Michael Peterson Tom Hardy who is bored with life. Maybe not even boredfrom the start he's a nonconformist. He goes about his early years committing petty crimes until he one day robs a post office gets arrested and it's history from there. I'll avoid summary as you may read that elsewhere if you wish. So Peterson seeks an outlet for his pent up boredom. His rage. Naturally assaulting anyone near him is a viable passtime! Adopting the stage name Charles Bronson Peterson becomes a celebrity of sorts. Tom Hardy is absolutely menacing as Bronson. At times you're convinced he's absolutely insane and he is pretty crazy while others he's simply flamboyant and overthetop. But the times where he unleashes his anger and insanity are truly heartstopping. Presenting his inner thoughts to us literally the audience of the film Bronson is a one man show giving his heartfelt take on his own feelings and inner thoughts.And I think that's what I missed about the film the first time around. I sought a storyline I could cling to a beginning middle and end. Structure. Bronson both the film and the man is the opposite of structure. He's raw anger incarnate. The film is about his rage and his expression of anger and how he sometimes suppresses it. There is no structure when a mad bull charges. That is the equivalent of this film. Hardy's mustached grinning madman is our guide through his own uncontrollable anger.So yes Hardy is absolutely perfect in the title role. According to the real Bronson no one else could've played him! But the other half of Bronson's brilliance comes from behind the camera. Refn has a true talent for framing shots and often gives the film a surreal and colorful palette. Not only are the images mesmerizing but they are accompanied by music that is both appropriate and the complete opposite of the images we see. Classical music playing as Bronson charges prison guards or thumping electronic beats as he enters the underground fight scene I particularly love the song that recurs throughout the film and plays over the credits. The music adds a sort of order to the disorder and creates a soothing scene that would be shakycam intensity with another director. That is Refn's brilliance calmly displaying violence.So I hope my change of heart spurs you to revisit Bronson if you were unsatisfied initially. It's an odd film but I found that it became more enjoyable once I allowed Bronson's chaos to overcome my concept of what a film should be.".

From the introduction of Largo  saving a girl from very large soldiers  Salle keeps the story and character beats strong throughout his action sequences. And the way he frames his shots truly shows off the beauty of the world wide setting of a Largo Winch story.The story is very well done both in writing and as shown on the screen concentrating on Largo's life as he searches for his place in life as oppose to action sequence after action sequence.Tomer Sisley is spectacular as Largo Winch. Playing the role with passion wit and cockiness. He owns the screen when he's on it and doesn't give an inch to any of the extremely strong actors he's playing against. Kristen Scott Thomas is deliciously slimy as Group W's number two. She needs to play villains more often. My personal favourite scenes are every one with Tomer Sisley and Karel Roden together. Two fantastic actors that both went for it and didn't give an inch to the other.This is a fantastic action film that has more heart and story then most north American films. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys well written actionespionage film.".

You liked District 8  strange camera views and shaking hands You like Tarantino with his time jumping scenes and You are complain about movie that has both features. For me Largo Wintch is real. It isn't a guy who uses laser weapons and flying cars loaded witch tons of explosives. He can't fly  it's an issue. He is in jail and doesn't want to be rescued by cash  money isn't everything  movie says at least few times. That movie carries a huge emotional load. I think that this film is voted so low because it doesn't fit to classic Hollywood scenario of action movies like Superman Xman e.t.c. Largo is to real so any complaints are about his way of getting out of trouble.I was enjoying this film from the beginning to the end. It was unpredictable well played and well showed. At the end i didn't know that comic book was precursor.".

Sleek enough to hold your attention and telling a story that doesn't insult your intelligence but won't really tax it eitherthe movie works well enough while its going but once its over you'll either have trouble believing what you just saw or you won't really care what you just sawyou'll just wanna see another movie asap.Requiring a daring man of action to save the day but really just a continuing series of action sequences barely held together by a continuing storyline ironically not unlike district b13 which while an awesome movie is much much more of an example of new school french action film that's more in vogue right now. The Heir Apparent is supposed to be more of an old school french action movielike this could've easily been made with jean paul bellmondo in the 70's.Largo Winch is the adopted heir to the CEO and founder of this gianormous companywhen the ceo is found deadits up the adopted heir to find out why who when and if possible save the rest of the company. Largo is a guy who loves breaking out of placesyou see him as a kid running out the window of his bedroomhe hates being cooped up in one place...naturally a break out of jail sequence is included here but with the nice twist that largo really really doesn't want anyone to help him with it....he's also apparently fiercely independent which just makes you wonder why he's doing what he's doing but no matter. Anyways the bulk of the plot is basically Largo being recruited by the board of the company to do whatever he can to keep the company from being swallowed up by its main competitor. this requires basically getting the majority of stock in the company back from the guy who owns the competitive company but of course there's so much more to that then just going up to the guy and making him hand over the shares of stock That's really all you need to knowanything else is stuff that comes up throughout the story that you just kinda roll your shoulders and go withotherwise you'll have too many questions and to question what's happening here is besides the point.Some of the action scenes are pretty cool...and the lead actor has an appealing what me worry? attitude that matches the tone of the movie perfectly. The reversals and double reversals that happen throughout the movie don't really add anything besides obstacles for the main character to hurdle overbut hurdle them he does and well. Kirsten Scott Thomas appears but adds nothing except maybe a sense that something significant is supposed to be happening here but its pretty clear its not. Ummmm the movie was entertaining enoughlike it was fun to watch but after an hour or so it gets kind of dull like you start to wonder what the point is why is Largo Winch so perfectly willing to be used by his father's board members when he himself has no interest in running the company at all anywaysthere are flashbacks of him talking to his father that are meant to give depth to largo's character but only serve to remind us that we could be watching a much better movie if Largo could just somehow get out from his father's company's shenanigans. Anywaysit was an OK moviebut there were hints that it could've been something more. As it is its not bad its actually pretty fun to watch but i'll prob forget i saw it in a day or two.".

After reading the 14 reviews that preceded mine and doing a little digging I was able to find out the origin of the character specifically that it is a character from illustrated or graphic novels created by Jean Van Hamme and Philippe Francq. I also noticed that there was a television series based on the same work. Well that being said I admit enjoying Julien Rappeneau and Jrme Salle's scenario adaptation. I am not in any way attempting to critique or compare the movie adaptation to either the graphic novel or the TV series. The movie as a standalone work was most entertaining.The pace is fast but has necessary slower scenes allowing us to get to understand the characters and the circumstances instead of being driven solely by action and special effects both of which are not lacking in the least. I was unfamiliar with most actors in this movie and I thoroughly enjoyed the performances particularly the one of the lead role. Familiar only to me was Kristin Scott Thomas who plays the key character Ann Ferguson which based on the later scenes in this movie will certainly and sadly for me not be back in the 2011 sequel which I look forward to seeing also a Jrme Salle written and directed movie.I don't like to read reviews that affirm either Hollywood or Euro made action and thriller movies being better than the other it's a matter of taste not opinion which means those who can enjoy both have the best of both worlds. I am very happy to see Euro made action and thriller movies as a welcome change of perspective and culture. Pity for those who only want to eat fried chicken and potatoes they are missing out on all the other culinary delights. So it goes for movies and books. The graphic novel The Heir  Largo Winch is not one of a super hero like so many American ones are instead it is a novel based on a regular person living an extraordinary life and that type of adventure put to screen is one I hope you will like as much as I did.".

And the only one time where he was weakened is when Mlanie Thierry shaved his beard !

For the first time in France since Belmondo can a movie be both well crafted and rooted in Bgenre without blushing over its performance.

After a first  and failed attempt with a TV show the real thing begins.First of all and that's what most of the fans didn't get the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. Some essential parts characters and actions of the original are missing. The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st classfan of the comic book I must confess I was nicely surprised. The actors are good so is the scenario though it might seem too fast. I thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financialpolitical thrillers but it is clearly not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne series as I could read over the internet.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this movie during breakfast in my holiday.. Turned on the TV and saw Micky Manolovic in an international movie. I love this actor and know him from excellent performances in especially Underground and When father was away on business.. This movie being very different than the Kusturica movies as I later realized still kept me watching. I love movies which contain different languages. Bosnian Croatian French English.. it was great. OK so I understood from other reviews that the languages weren't always correct.. One person talking Bosnian while the other replied in Servian annoying for the people who actually understand it but for me its always better than bad Russian accents in English representing Eastern European languages. Right? Having no knowledge of the original comic book I went totally free in the movie and found it very niceintelligent and fastpacked with slick slight liked Bourne identity action scenes. Locations were beautiful especially the magnificent island later in the film. And the business deal scenes were interesting as well. I also understood that the movie wasn't at all in comparison with the comicbook and lots of things were not as they should have been.. This could also be annoying IF you red the graphic novel.. But as I described with me this wasn't the case so I could enjoy it. Have to say that Manolovic for me played an important role for keeping my attention in the beginning because I didn't know were I was going into.. I really like the actor and truly recommend almost all his movies So don't expect much of it if you like the graphic novel but if you don't know it this french movie will certainly entertain you while waking up on your free day having breakfastlunch whatever.. I rate it somewhere between 6 and 6.5".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a real mixed big. On the other hand it's one great looking and well directed movie with a pleasant pace and some good action but on the other it's being a real average one with its story and suffers from some weak acting as well.It's actually a movie based on a Belgian novel and comicbookseries. And it's not really hard to see why they wanted to turn it into a movieseries as well. It has a very typical movie style and way of storytelling to it that reminds you of movieseries such as the Bourne Identity and James Bond ones. It has a thriller type of plot hot women plenty of action and handtohand combat and some exotic locations as well. Yet as a movie this one does not really work out quite successfully. Also financially it was a disappointment but that didn't prevent them from making a sequel with the poetic title Largo Winch II in 2011 which was not much of a success either. So it seems that the series is already over before anybody had really heard about it unless some big Hollywood studio decides to pick it up and turn it into a movieseries since the potential is all definitely still present in it.It's a movie in which a secretly adopted son has to proof his legitimacy in order to take over his murdered father's company that is worth billions and prevent it from falling in the wrong hands of some shady business people. Doesn't sound like the most interesting perhaps and you're right to think so. It's mostly being a Industrial espionage thriller with backstabbing characters and ones with double agendas with some action thrown in it to spice up things. It just isn't really the most exciting concept to begin with and besides the movie its story offers little new or surprising really. It all has been done before and better as well. It's all quite predictable also in the way it's progressing.But the filmmakers didn't seemed to be stopped in their ambitions to still create a great movie despite of its story. It's a real slick looking movie with a great visual style to it. They also handled the action really well with some good camerawork and nimble editing. I'm a fan of some good old fashioned handtohand action and this movie has plenty of that. Really I can't say anything bad about the directing approach of this movie. It also provides the movie with a pleasantly fast pace which ensures that the movie despite of its story won't ever start to bore you.And the movie also needed a fast pace since it seemed to be covering lots of ground. It's set in many different countries at many different places with many different people. Yet they managed to fit it all into a 100 minutes short movie. It might cause you to loose track at times though. I mean it's quite hard to understand at times why our main character is suddenly in a different country or how he got there in the first place.But something that really truly brings this movie down is its acting. Most of the actors really got poorly cast in this and seem to belong on TV or soap operas only really. Kristin Scott Thomas is an exception and Benedict Wong also does a decent enough job but the rest were really struggling to get their lines out convincingly. Perhaps this was also partly due to it that most characters have to speak in many different languages. The movie mostly consists out of French English and Serbian dialog while some of the actors themselves aren't even French English or Serbian. And hearing a French person utter some English words just never really sounds convincing. The lead actor Tomer Sisley was also really struggling with this and only seemed to be in his element during the action sequences.Not a great movie by any means but still worth giving a go when you have run out of anything else to watch.610 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Full Throttle ripoff with Largo Winch background";
	schema:reviewBody "Sorry Largo Winch fans but this is no 10 movie. I will tell you why.The basic idea about this movie is sound the Largo Winch comic is pretty good violent enough by far for making an action movie of and has a unique theme the secret stepson pulled into the world of economy against his will.I actually like the mix of English and french. It just adds flavor.Many scenes are visually good. Much nice scenery.But there are a whole bunch of things that are questionable and a few that are downright bad.I don't really mind that the hero doesn't look like Largo Winch but it seems strange that they have replaced the hero with someone who looks very much like his sidekick Simon who is missing in the movie.I like the comic and I have seen much worse movie adaptations of comics as well as books. Judge Dredd Modesty Blaise. It seems to me that too many adaptations are really made by someone who wanted to make a totally different movie. Judge Dredd was made by someone who wanted to do The Godfather Modesty Blaise was made by someone who wanted to to Hair. And ironically I Robot was made by someone who wanted to to Judge Dredd!Largo Winch is a mixed bag in this respect. Much of the Winch concept is used good! but they also mixed in a whole lot of another story and that story is Full Throttle! Yes the video game with Mark Hamill as the villain! That story is also about a company takeover and unlike the original Winch Full Throttle has the same basic plot as this movie and more.Much of the movie follows the plot in album 14 but somewhere along the line the plot switches into another one. Several characters are added to build a whole new plot and the ending is a straight ripoff from Full Throttle. Actually too much of the story is just that a Full Throttle ripoff a story that was also about taking over a company from the inside. Did we really need that when the original plot was not a ripoff? Big minus!Many interesting and central characters are dropped and forgotten. Where are Simon Ovronnaz Cochrane Sullivan Fenimore Cotton... Only a few characters are kept Hannah and her husband and Pennywinkle and instead a whole bunch of new characters are added. Although the concept is not totally ruined a few of the new characters can be identified as direct replacements to the old ones too much of the foundations are removed and replaced by something else which is not better.Then we have the script and tempo. In many cases the suspense is lacking the tempo and scripting is bad. This is where Largo Winch makes itself comparable to newer Bond movies. On several occasions it makes the jump up suddenly and say boo stunt which is all too common in the new Bond movies. This is not good it is a sign of amateurish scripting. We have known for years that only poor horror movies work on scaring the audience in such a way. NEVER do that! Instead of the boo stunt you should let the viewer know that something is coming and build suspense. Hitchcock knew this but all too many new movie makers don't. Largo Winch makes it almost right in the beginning but later it goes totally off here. The first case is the killing of a guy during the board meeting. A few seconds of warning music see an unknown assassin picking up a gun... would guide us help us see that something nasty is coming so we get time to prepare. But the movie makers were not professional enough to know that but make this cheap mistake several times! Wham! Boo! I scared you!The movie is better than the newer Bond movies but rather because the new Bond movies are utter garbage very much based on trying to drop its own concept and replacing it with a committee construction while this at least has some positive merits especially its own concept which is mostly follows. But it could have been a lot better.I have looked briefly into the TV series and it looks superior in so many ways. Better casting all those central characters are retained.Summary Uses the basic theme and background of Largo Winch fairly well. Hence quite a bit of action. Mixes in a lot of french. I like that this is a french movie. Many scenes are visually good.Poor suspense good opportunities wasted on boo! scenes.Underuses the character gallery of the original.Casting is unimpressive.Obvious Full Throttle ripoff in plot and ending!".

Although the concept is not totally ruined a few of the new characters can be identified as direct replacements to the old ones too much of the foundations are removed and replaced by something else which is not better.Then we have the script and tempo. In many cases the suspense is lacking the tempo and scripting is bad. This is where Largo Winch makes itself comparable to newer Bond movies. On several occasions it makes the jump up suddenly and say boo stunt which is all too common in the new Bond movies. This is not good it is a sign of amateurish scripting. We have known for years that only poor horror movies work on scaring the audience in such a way. NEVER do that! Instead of the boo stunt you should let the viewer know that something is coming and build suspense. Hitchcock knew this but all too many new movie makers don't. Largo Winch makes it almost right in the beginning but later it goes totally off here. The first case is the killing of a guy during the board meeting. A few seconds of warning music see an unknown assassin picking up a gun... would guide us help us see that something nasty is coming so we get time to prepare. But the movie makers were not professional enough to know that but make this cheap mistake several times! Wham! Boo! I scared you!The movie is better than the newer Bond movies but rather because the new Bond movies are utter garbage very much based on trying to drop its own concept and replacing it with a committee construction while this at least has some positive merits especially its own concept which is mostly follows. But it could have been a lot better.I have looked briefly into the TV series and it looks superior in so many ways. Better casting all those central characters are retained.Summary Uses the basic theme and background of Largo Winch fairly well. Hence quite a bit of action. Mixes in a lot of french. I like that this is a french movie. Many scenes are visually good.Poor suspense good opportunities wasted on boo! scenes.Underuses the character gallery of the original.Casting is unimpressive.Obvious Full Throttle ripoff in plot and ending!";

But I heard it's a pretty cool superhero flick so I decided to check it out. The thing is it's a decent B action movie and also fast paced. But some parts are just skimmed over really quickly without much development. I know the direction is more getting to the core of everything but there is little to no attachment to any of the characters. They are just mainly there to move the story forward and nothing else for the most part. The movie started off alright but started to lose it's flare after a while in fact almost a hour of this movie revolves around bunch of people bickering about the company. I don't know if it's because this movie caught me off guard cause this just wasn't the the type of movie I was expecting and that isn't a positive. This is also a adaptation from a comic book but just didn't have any of the comic book vibe to it. I don't know if the budget for this movie was really low but from what I heard it's a poor adaptation to the comic and just didn't go in the direction it should have. For a superhero flick or just a comic book adaptation it just seemed like they didn't have the resources to make the adaptation work and make it good. Some even say the adaptation from this comic to a movie if done by Hollywood would have been terrible. I disagree yeah stuff blowing up constantly gets old after a while but this is one of those movies that needed at least some resources. It also has noticeable plot holes and sequences that make absolutely not sense. This was suppose to be a adventurethriller but didn't find anything adventurous or thrilling it's basically below mediocre action movie at most. I am giving this movie a 5.8 because the last 30 minute was sort of entertaining and I liked how almost everything got put together.5.810".

From the start to the last minute it has you wondering which way it will go. It's filled with twists and surprises. It has some great action some erotic scenes but mostly lots of suspense. Direction is first rate and the locations are great. Truly an international thriller filmed all over and in several languages. Just like the guy who bought the rights suspected Largo Winch would make a fantastic franchise that could surpass the BondBourne films. At least this movie is so much better than many of the goofy and preposterous Bond flicks and with a much more human lead character who isn't busy striking poses making snouts for the camera and coming up with lame oneliners.".

Kindly Jewish tailor George E.

And the battle lines are getting drawn in San Francisco isolated as it is from the rest of America preoccupied with slavery and the Civil War.Director Lloyd Bacon had a sure feel for the mood and look of Gold Rush San Francisco. Besides those mentioned you'll see some good performances from Donald Woods Lili Damita Barton MacLane and most of all Ricardo Cortez. His death scene and attitude towards the vigilante mob is may be the highlight of the film.Warner Brothers more than most of the other major studios liked to recycle plots and situations.

	schema:headline " Cagney rises above rather mediocre material";
	schema:reviewBody "This film starts out rather implausibly. Sailor Bat Morgan James Cagney wanders into a Barbary Coast saloon and almost gets shanghaied by a trio dedicated to that business. He does manage to escape and is helped by a kindly Jewish tailor George E. Stone as Sully Green. What's rather implausible is that Sully basically has to teach a sailor that has docked in the port of San Francisco what shanghaiing is and that the Barbary Coast is dangerous. Really? A seasoned sailor docking in San Francisco has never heard of the Barbary Coast or shanghaiing or why it is profitable for criminals? You'd think Bat Morgan was a common tourist from the Midwest with a defective GPS. What happens next was a little offputting for a Cagney fan like myself. Naturally Cagney's character decides to go back to the bar and teach those three thugs a lesson. How he did it left a bad taste in my mouth. Bat shanghais the shanghaier as he is getting ready to take yet another unconscious victim to a ship. But he also shanghais the poor unconscious slob that was just a victim like he had been a couple of hours ago! Now I'm prepared to see Cagney's character rough up and victimize fellow bad guys in a film but he usually shied away from making victims of innocent bystanders.At this point the film makes a distinctive turn from where it's been going the first 15 or 20 minutes and becomes less surprising and more of a conventional action picture. Bat Morgan  who never goes back to his ship  begins to make his fortune on the Barbary Coast by more conventional methods. At first he works for Barbary Coast saloon proprietor Paul Morra Ricardo Cortez then he works his way up by enlarging the take of corrupt San Francisco officials and uses his part of the pot to build an upscale establishment on the Barbary Coast himself.Meanwhile the beautiful owner of a newspaper dedicated to wiping out corruption Margaret Lindsay as Jean enlists an editor to help her in her goal of cleaning up The Coast and outing the corrupt officials that protect it. Donald Woods plays the honest editor she hired who never has a chance with Jean once Cagney's Bat Morgan gets a look at her and starts batting his baby blues. So here you have a corrupt guy and a beautiful classy girl dedicated to wiping out corruption falling in love. Rather predictable complications ensue.High points of this production are most obviously James Cagney George E. Stone in an endearing role as Cagney's mild mannered and loyal friend the tailor and Fred Kohler in a minor role as the aptly named Shanghai Duck who looks like he hasn't bathed in a month of Sundays. Ricardo Cortez gives an overly restrained performance as Barbary Coast big shot Paul Morra and Lili Damata is wasted here as his wife. Unexpected is the viewpoint that a mob on horseback is lawlessness but a mob sitting down in a large room is an acceptable form of government and that common criminals going to the opera is an unspeakable breach of etiquette. Watch the film to see what I'm talking about. This one is a takeitorleaveit proposition largely made so because studios had to turn to period pieces like this one immediately after the production code took effect in order to blunt the interference from the censors without really knowing what to do with the material.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terrible title for a watchable Cagney vehicle which seems like so many of his early films to move at breakneck speed. Like so many of his major roles there's a duality at play with his Bat Morgan character initially winning viewer sympathy by fighting back against bullying gangsters in San Francisco's notorious Barbary Coast quarter and loyally looking out for his Jewish sidekick only to be seduced by the lure of power and money to rise to the top of the greasy pole by being bigger and badder than the competition and getting onside with the corrupt bigtime politician Big Jim Daley.There's love interest too in the prim and proper person of Margaret Lindsay the managing editor of the crusading local paper whose handsome daily editor Donald Woods serves as uneasy ally love rival and straightandnarrow example to Cagney before invoking one of a series of murdered decent citizens which causes the lawabiding majority to turn to vigilantism in a literally riotous finish with Cagney naturally rejecting the darkside and even getting the girl.How true the story here is to the growing pains of the real San Francisco will have to wait until my next visit to the reference library but the story suffers from Cagney's character whose rise and fall and rise again is too unlikely to seem credible. You feel a better more straightforward film would have concentrated on the zealous editor's story rather than Cagney's flawed hero. There also seem to be just too many characters incidents and plot developments telescoped into the film's short playing time which the editing can't bring together coherently.For once I couldn't believe enough in Cagney's character and felt he gives an untypically mixed performance although the problem here could be in the writing. Better are Lindsay as the posh proprietor who unconvincingly crosses the tracks for Cagney and Woods as the socially conscious but doomed editor Ford. The mobscene finale calls for the marshaling of large crowds of actors which is accomplished believably and effectively but in the end the alllooseendstied up optimistic ending let's down the preceding drama.For me this was a welcome chance to see the young Cagney in a rarelyscreened film. To be fair it's just too fastpaced to really hang together though better roles better written and to be honest better acted lay ahead for him.".

Cagney with a funky little haircut is in good form but this is certainly not one of his greatest roles. The supporting cast is in good form and includes Margaret Lindsay Ricardo Cortez Donald Woods and George E. Stone. Cortez steals the show as the top guy in town but Stone adds some very good comic relief as Cagney's buddy. The highlight of the film is a terrific fight sequence between Cagney and a large man with a hook for a hand. The final twenty minutes deal with the city getting tired of the thugs and deciding to take the law into its own hands. We get another mob scene where they want to hang the bad men and this here is where the film should have taken off but things stay pretty bland and never get too exciting.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1854 San Francisco rowdy sailor James Cagney as Bat Morgan is almost shanghaied to China. Rescued by affectionate tailor George E. Stone as Solomon Solly Green Mr. Cagney is inspired to open a successful saloon on the Barbary Coast. Frisco lives up to its reputation as the wickedest city in the world with gangster types like Ricardo Cortez as Paul Morra operating in vice. Cagney caters to a more swell crowd and becomes chummy with both underworld and high society types. The mixture initially makes money but politics and murder threaten Cagney's newfound fortune...Director Lloyd Bacon and the crew do a good job in capturing and contrasting the various character types especially in the opera setting. At the story's center Cagney in introduced as a ruffian who becomes a welldressed dandy. Resembling a young Liberace the star manages to look both dapper and uncomfortable in a series of flashy suits and extra tall top hats. It works for Cagney's tailormade character...There is an interesting hint at a romantic interest between Cagney and Mr. Stone. Just when you think you're reading too much into it Mr. Bacon or one of the actors leads you astray. The two are very hands on throughout even when Stone is ironing pants. Their last scene together has Cagney giving attractive newspaperwoman Margaret Lindsay as Jean Barrat a knowing look as he gives Stone an extra more personal squeeze.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1854 San Francisco rowdy sailor James Cagney as Bat Morgan is almost shanghaied to China. Rescued by affectionate tailor George E. Stone as Solomon Solly Green Mr. Cagney is inspired to open a successful saloon on the Barbary Coast. Frisco lives up to its reputation as the wickedest city in the world with gangster types like Ricardo Cortez as Paul Morra operating in vice. Cagney caters to a more swell crowd and becomes chummy with both underworld and high society types. The mixture initially makes money but politics and murder threaten Cagney's newfound fortune...Director Lloyd Bacon and the crew do a good job in capturing and contrasting the various character types especially in the opera setting. At the story's center Cagney in introduced as a ruffian who becomes a welldressed dandy. Resembling a young Liberace the star manages to look both dapper and uncomfortable in a series of flashy suits and extra tall top hats. It works for Cagney's tailormade character...There is an interesting hint at a romantic interest between Cagney and Mr. Stone. Just when you think you're reading too much into it Mr. Bacon or one of the actors leads you astray. The two are very hands on throughout even when Stone is ironing pants. Their last scene together has Cagney giving attractive newspaperwoman Margaret Lindsay as Jean Barrat a knowing look as he gives Stone an extra more personal squeeze. In this scene it seems like the baton is being passed to Ms. Lindsay. Apart from the subtleties and double takes Frisco kid is ordinary but satisfying. Frisco Kid 113035 Lloyd Bacon  James Cagney Margaret Lindsay George E. Stone Ricardo Cortez";

Her scenes with Cagney become more an interesting example of star quality and naturalism versus posturing for the camera than believable love scenes. In their closeups he is animated and alive and she seems to be waiting for him to finish talking so she can flatly deliver her lines. Woods is even worse but his role is smaller so he is less irksome but when he's not on screen you don't miss him. As far as the film's storyline it's standard stuff about the clash between the Barbary Coast and Nob Hill society.

Morra is hanged but Bat Morgan gets a last minute reprieve after the intercession of his newspaperowner girlfriend.The plot is patchy and gets silly towards the end but is rescued by tight direction catchy background music and some pretty good performances by some of the cast. Although in my opinion Margaret Lyndsay is not up to much as the newspaper owner and Damita has very little to do as Morra's livein girlfriend Cagney gives his usual 500 per cent in the leading role. The biggest surprise is Ricardo Cortez once regarded as a Valentino lookalike in the silent films he makes a superb villain. The fight to the finish with the Shanghai Duck has just got to be Cagney's greatest screen fight.Very watchable.".

So Cagney better be a human dynamo or he'll be overwhelmed by sheer numbers whether it's crowds in big watering holes or lynch mobs hurtling down streets. It's Gold Rush Frisco of the 1850's. On the low end of town is the Barbary Coast about as sinful and noisy as waterfronts get. On the high end of town are the swells and welldressed folks and by golly never the twains shall meet. That is until Cagney's ambitious lowborn Bat Morgan schemes his way into both worlds and criminally networks them. Seems he's good at everything except winning the hand of the classy Miss Barrat Lindsey who won't buck the social distance lying between them. So what will happen once his contrived empire starts to sprout holes.The flick's typical WB from the periodfast tough and not too sentimental. Cagney's Cagney a pintsized dynamo if ever there was one. He's about as dominating a character as Hollywood has had and perfect for the part. The plotline itself is not too plausible but the spectacle does compensate. I wish more time was spent on the details of Bat's scheming and social climbing. After all that was Cagney's movie appeal his lower class drive against all odds.On the other hand catch Ricardo Cortez as the one truly slick crook of the bunch. But what about Solly's Stone relationship with the domineering Bat. They're buddies sure but catch Solly's expressions when the two get close to one another. Too bad about the facile ending which is typical Hollywood of the Code period. Had the movie been made a preCode two years earlier I wonder if the ending would have been the same.All in all the storyline is pretty disjointed really needing a longer runtime for its networking and class themes to develop. There's also the antilynching element that doesn't really grieve after all the victims are hardly innocent. However it's really crowd atmospherics and Cagney that's worth catching up with. Anyway I expect every extra in Hollywood got a welcome WB payday along with a chance to shout their lungs out.".

This movie reuses elements from 'Barbary Coast' another and better Warners film made the same year! The barroom brawl in 'Frisco Kid' seems to be inspired by the climax of Rex Beach's popular novel 'The Spoilers' which had been filmed before 'Frisco Kid' and would be remade afterwards.James Cagney  always dynamic onscreen yet not quite at the top of his form here  stars as Bat Morgan a hustler who came west during the gold rush of 1849 and now finds himself a year later in San Francisco's notorious Barbary Coast. Which got its name due to the lawlessness that prevailed a reference to the real Barbary coast which was controlled by pirates. Morgan proves his mettle early on in a spirited brawl with pressgangman Shanghai Duck who has a hook for a right hand. We find out just how tough this community is when Ricardo Cortez gets killed by a lynch mob due to a misunderstanding.Morgan soon sets himself up as proprietor of a Barbary Coast saloon with a crooked casino. He makes deals with the local politicians offering them a share of the profits from his prostitution and gambling businesses to avoid being raided or arrested. I found this absolutely plausible the San Francisco city government was notoriously corrupt from Gold Rush days right until the 1906 earthquake. He also befriends Jean Barrat the lady owner of the local newspaper. This is one of those movies in which the virtuous heroine is attracted to a crooked hero fully aware that he's crooked and we're expected to approve because the crook is such a charming guy. The newspaperwoman is played by dull unattractive Margaret Lindsay so the romantic subplot of this movie isn't worth much.Eventually Judge Crawford  the only honest man in town  gets murdered and the mob mistakenly decide that Bat Morgan is guilty. This whips them into a lynchmob frenzy. Why the San Franciscans should be provoked to lynchlaw over this particular crime  while ignoring so many other crimes in this movie  is never made very clear. We're meant to sympathise with Bat Morgan who is genuinely innocent of Crawford's murder even though we know he's guilty of many other crimes.In 1935 when 'Frisco Kid' was made lynching was a real and widespread problem in the United States. The tendency of white mobs to lynch black victims is well known but at this time plenty of white victims were lynched too. The makers of this movie were probably more concerned about the white victims than the black ones. 'Fury' an antilynching movie made at MGM at this same time is a much better film addressing the same problem. The torchlight climax of 'Frisco Kid' degenerates into a bathetic payoff that's clearly intended to mollify the critics and the moral guardians.As is usual for Warners in the thirties there's a fine assortment of supporting players on offer here. Barton MacLane is hissable as Spider Burke little George E Stone is touching and the woefully underrated actor John Wray is splendid as an underworld character named Weasel. John Wray played another underworld character named Weasel in 'Boys Town' he had a talent for rodentlike roles. Charles Middleton Walter Long and Wilfred Lucas are onscreen just briefly enough to disappoint their fans. Does Wilfred Lucas have any fans? 'Frisco Kid' was made at the beginning of the Warner studio's greatest period  and at the beginning of the greatest phase of James Cagney's career  but it's neither firstrate Warners nor firstrate Cagney. I'll rate this movie 5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "With most of James Cagney's early films his character portrayal is generally a bit flamboyant even over the top at times. In Frisco Kid it appears that Cagney found a way to take command of his role with some reserve as his character rises from itinerant sailor to one of the most powerful men in San Francisco of the mid1850's. He does it with both his fists and his charm and at times it's easy to overlook the fact that he's the main villain in the story.The setting is the three block section of San Francisco known as the Barbary Coast at a time when the proper citizenry is just about fed up with the way the local underworld bosses rule their corner of the city. Early in the picture it appears that Bat Morgan Cagney might actually convert to the good guy side when he first meets Jean Barrat Margaret Lindsay managing editor of the San Francisco Tribune. But it becomes clear enough that they live on opposite sides of the tracks even as Morgan's interest in Barrat becomes more than social.What makes the picture a bit troublesome for me is the lack of accounting for the story's chronology. While Morgan states that he'll build the biggest and most lavish gambling house in San Francisco it seems like the 'Bella Pacific' virtually appears in the very next scene. His rise to the top of the Barbary underworld also seems like it happened overnight. Granted the events are compressed for the sake of the story but it's hard to imagine how all of a sudden a sailor takes over an entire town just because he set his mind to it. One might also wonder why he hadn't done something more on a grand scale before arriving in San Francisco but then I guess there wouldn't have been a movie.There were some interesting casting decisions made for the film particularly Ricardo Cortez as the suave but menacing saloon owner Paul Morra. Barton MacLane appears as a roughneck named Spider Burke and George E. Stone is effective as Morgan's best friend Solly Green. It was also cool to see a number of character actors that one usually finds in the era's Western pictures like Addison Richards Joe King and Fred Kohler.The one thing that struck me some time into the picture had to do with the story taking place in 1854. I had to keep reminding myself that it was still a few years before the outbreak of the Civil War with no context in the story as to what was taking place in the rest of the country. It was just a bit disorienting especially when most of the scenes played out like they would have been from the latter part of the century.".

Granted the events are compressed for the sake of the story but it's hard to imagine how all of a sudden a sailor takes over an entire town just because he set his mind to it. One might also wonder why he hadn't done something more on a grand scale before arriving in San Francisco but then I guess there wouldn't have been a movie.There were some interesting casting decisions made for the film particularly Ricardo Cortez as the suave but menacing saloon owner Paul Morra. Barton MacLane appears as a roughneck named Spider Burke and George E. Stone is effective as Morgan's best friend Solly Green. It was also cool to see a number of character actors that one usually finds in the era's Western pictures like Addison Richards Joe King and Fred Kohler.The one thing that struck me some time into the picture had to do with the story taking place in 1854. I had to keep reminding myself that it was still a few years before the outbreak of the Civil War with no context in the story as to what was taking place in the rest of the country. It was just a bit disorienting especially when most of the scenes played out like they would have been from the latter part of the century.";

And along with this character the production values are very high and the film is quite entertaining. However at the same time the film is a bit unusual because the character Cagney plays isn't purely larcenous and midway through the film he starts to change his stripes and goes from bad guy to good guy! And the ending is one of the strangest of the era! Cagney arrives in the Barbary Coast portion of San Francisco in the 1850safter the Gold Rush has begun and it's in full swing. Cagney is almost shanghaied when the film starts but because he is the hero he wakes up in time and escapes. Seeing the evil of the town he decides if you can't beat 'em join 'em...or maybe organize them into a union of sorts. And very quickly he goes from newbie to boss of the underbelly of society. But the good people of San Francisco are tired of the sleaze and corrupt government so they resort to the great bastion of freedom and decencymob rule complete with executions! At least that's the message I seemed to get from the film. Since Cagney sees the light just in time he tries his best to stop the corruption before the crowds exact vengeance but for most it's too late. When the mob does assume control everyone not executed seems pretty happy and the film ends! ODD ODD ODD!!!".

It plays with reality refuses to adhere to conventions and tells a story that only completely makes sense when you get to the end of it... and in my case its the sort of thing I know I need to see again to get a handle on. I have no idea if I liked it or not. I know that my insistence that the film be a certain something had me working against it. Thats not the way to enjoy this film its something that you have to let take you where it wants to take you. Can I recommend it? Certainly if you're willing to let it go and do. I do like bits of it and there are bits I'm not crazy about but at the same time any film that makes me want to watch it again even if its to work out what I just saw is worth a shot.".

Almost every scene from beginning till ending is full of action and tension sequences which are done by good camera work. Its way of storytelling is very smooth. I watched it with subtitles even though the script is very substantial it isn't necessary to follow up each conversation. The dialogue and connection which Pablo and Malena established together magnetizes the full attention from the viewer since their body language and gestures were complementary with the screenplay.The story takes place in August 2001 in Argentina. Pablo and Malena who are in their mid20s' are siblings from a dysfunctional family. Their father whom Pablo never seen in his life before is in coma. They visit him and Malena introduces him to Pablo. Malena has grown hatred for his father for he served under AntiCommunist Dictatorship of the Argentinian army to quench the communist movement torturing thousands of innocents instead of looking after his family. There is a huge question mark here Why are all the communists introduced as innocents in this film? The frightening fact here is that when Pablo and Malena think that their father is helpless in coma he turns out to be more powerful than he was alive. His spirit continues to torture the restless souls of the dead innocents. He has written a detailed diary including how he tortured the families of communist vanguards when he was young. In return to his weakened body he bargains with one or more daemons to continue on his dictatorship mission. One of the daemons in the look of a little girl finds this diary from where he hided away. Then Pablo the curious and adventurous one of the siblings gets this diary from that daemon assuming that it was something the little girl lost. So the daemon begins to bugger around Pablo and Malena. The diary which has the curse of the daemon brings only trouble to them.Aparecidos has the meaning for Seen versus Disappeared. Who is seen is the Dictatorship regime runners and who is disappeared is the slaughtered rebels against this regime. Soon Pablo and Malena read the diary and start a journey to save the victims of the murderers. One of the communist vanguards who has never been captured by the police due to the lack of evidence has been killed with his pregnant wife and little daughter in the hands of Pablo and Malena's father. Daemon completes the bargain with continuously torturing the wife and the daughter's souls.When you feel like you accomplished something you think that you must be happy and be proud. Then suddenly you realize that you didn't accomplish anything the confusion in your mind and senses leads you realize the fact that you just decoded something hidden. That was Pablo's confusion in the movie. When he was explaining to her sister what he was really trying to do he says that he was gone out of his mind and trying to save someone whoever is dead already. Every night at the same hour in the same motel in the same room the same murder takes place involving the same dead corpses continuously for the last 20 years. Who are you going to save? Save a dead tonight. Amazing concept isn't it?".

	schema:headline " The Better Half";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill is better. Let's end the argument right now David Carradine doesn't even appear in Volume 1. Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of Kill Bill released only a few months before Vol. 2 in the tail end of 2003 we met Uma Thurman one peededoff superassassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time with the occasional megaposse thrown in for interest. Vol. 1 had a lot of blood violence and wisecracks and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.Vol. 2 is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie the tone is such a departure from Vol. 1 in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chopfu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys but in Vol. 2 he doesn't go as overboard as he does in Vol. 1. He pulls back and lets the plot breathe rather than filling every spare second with a homagecumparody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its Vol. 1style comicbook treatment. Throughout Vol. 2 the emphasis is on storytelling and characterbuilding which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. Vol. 1 is okay for what it is but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of Vol. 2.This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly the opening part of Vol. 2 tests the viewer's patience a bit there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered selfdiscipline like with Thurman's graveyard struggle but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her facetoface showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen certainly the best Tarantino has directed playing off the mythology we've been taught in Vol. 1 and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual buttkicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of Vol. 1 where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic not sadistic and its a powerful revelation that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing his pauses the tired glint in his eye or the way he says Kiddo. You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish but real human pain.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is slowmoving and needs Vol. 1 in a way few sequels do since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure Esteban Vihaio and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good though and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin Gordon Liu as Pei Mei and especially Perla HaneyJardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note there's four or five that hit the right mark and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman at once grippingly suspenseful hilarious and lifeaffirming. Still it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you as Bill and his former pupil work out their unfinished business and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.Kill Bill Vol. 2 may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires the level of The Good The Bad And The Ugly quoted in its score but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment.

	onyx:emotionText "It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill is better. Let's end the argument right now David Carradine doesn't even appear in Volume 1. Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of Kill Bill released only a few months before Vol. 2 in the tail end of 2003 we met Uma Thurman one peededoff superassassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time with the occasional megaposse thrown in for interest. Vol. 1 had a lot of blood violence and wisecracks and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.Vol. 2 is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie the tone is such a departure from Vol. 1 in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chopfu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys but in Vol. 2 he doesn't go as overboard as he does in Vol. 1. He pulls back and lets the plot breathe rather than filling every spare second with a homagecumparody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its Vol. 1style comicbook treatment. Throughout Vol. 2 the emphasis is on storytelling and characterbuilding which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. Vol. 1 is okay for what it is but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of Vol. 2.This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly the opening part of Vol. 2 tests the viewer's patience a bit there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered selfdiscipline like with Thurman's graveyard struggle but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her facetoface showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen certainly the best Tarantino has directed playing off the mythology we've been taught in Vol. 1 and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual buttkicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of Vol. 1 where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic not sadistic and its a powerful revelation that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing his pauses the tired glint in his eye or the way he says Kiddo. You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish but real human pain.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is slowmoving and needs Vol. 1 in a way few sequels do since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure Esteban Vihaio and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good though and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin Gordon Liu as Pei Mei and especially Perla HaneyJardine as a girl named B.B.

Westerns scifi comedies dramas etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I of course was premature in my prediction. The movie was by all means a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone subtly Akira Kurosawa very subtly and I'm stretching it here Ridley Scott to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great almost forgotten actors Daryl Hannah Micheal Parks and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality actually liked the whole movie. That in itself is an endorsement. Well done. Mr. Tarantino you will be hard placed to match this gem.".

Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies with delightfully overthetop splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue more twists n turns and the antichronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time as far as I can remember Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods like a completely black screen Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. The actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared filmprojects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them! Over and over again.".

Uma Thurman is back as The Bride and we get to know her real name finally.  Also Daryl Hannah comes back as Elle Driver the oneeyed killer Michael Madsen plays Budd Bill's babyloser brother and the infamous Bill is played by David Carradine.  The performances are just great Uma Thurman delivers a great performance as The Bride we finally get to know her character a little better and the true reasons why she wants to Kill Bill.  I also have to say that David Carradine was perfect to play Bill.  He has great charisma and he's so smooth it's impossible not to like him.  Daryl Hannah's performance was great too and Michael Madsen's too. Once again the music plays a key factor in this movie is very well selected and for every single scene the music fits perfectly.  And of course the dialogue.  In this movie we get a lot more dialogue than brutal fighting like in Vol.1 this movie is more centered in explaining what led Bill to do what he did it pretty much focuses in the past explaining the whole thing. I especially liked the dialogues between Bill Carradine and The Bride Thurman I thought they were clever and just great like all Tarantino's dialogues.  Also the locations were excelent I have no idea where they shot the film but the landscaping was great I truly enjoyed it.Well it would be better to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one movie not different because in the end you must see them together to understand.  So I give this movie a 1010 I loved it it was great great dialogues great performances great fighting sequences everything was great! And I think that Uma Thurman andor David Carradine at least him should be nominated for an Oscar they were perfect and they deserve that international film makers acknowledge that. Tarantino you are the best!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Awful boring slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap se rubbish or just plain retarded.Now I admit I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's nonstop action has been replaced almost entirely by nonstop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact I'll coin a new term here  direlogue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibberjabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then instead of getting on with the movie the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!Nor do the pointlessly long and in fact just pointless extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example we learn that Bud Bill's brother lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser  a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes it only serves to remind you that whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei the sensei that he taught her the hand of death trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride but by Elle using a Black Mamba we know it's a Black Mamba because as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake. Elle isn't killed by the Bride but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill who is killed by the Bride after endless boring dialogue about superheroes in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing final encounter scenes I've ever witnessed.The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra halfhour that they had to cut from the first film padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are  due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However KB2 is little more than selfindulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those I liked soandso but the sequel was rubbish type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills I'd say he needs to be evicted from postproduction facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in.".

Quentin Tarantino once again demonstrates a mastery of dialogue in this homage to the great western and kung fu movies that inspired him from his video clerk days.Simply this film is as entertaining as hell. Tarantino unabashedly takes the viewer for a joyride and the end result is a movie with intense action tempered with some of the best dialogue I have ever heard.Some have pointed to this film as inferior to the first volume of Kill Bill I disagree. Whereas Tarantino is a great action director the scene in the first film with the crazy 88s is one of my top five favorite battle scenes of all time he even surpasses this talent in his ability to write witty intriguing dialogue and this film really delivers it. One scene in particular with David Carradine as Bill near the end speaking with Uma Thurman's The Bride while he makes a sandwich is unforgettable and insightfully interesting. There are few points where the film drags and the movie ultimately creates the impression of a visceral experience. 1010. Go see this film it is by far the best film released so far this year.".

I'll go ahead and mention spoiler alert now since my comments may spoil it for those who enjoy this type of movie.  I nodded off a few times so they might have answered the only question I had which was how Bill got the daughter from the pregnant mother he tried to kill.  By the time they showed the daughter I really didn't care.  At least 30 minutes of useless dialog should have been removed.   It even took an eternity for Bill to die.  And why was Uma crying after striking the fatal blow???  It was about as dumb as her going after everyone with that sword even though she was an expert marksman with a gun.  Although LadyKillers wasn't as funny as I had hoped it was the better movie of the two.  My recommendation is that you skip both of these and read a good book if you want some real entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "So the second half of Tarantino's epic Kill Bill promised to be the pick me up the first required to stand up and be validated.  It failed miserably in that attempt.  Beware there may be some spoilers.Kill Bill 2 suffers from a shift in directorial tone so drastic that much of what Tarantino so effectively did in the first one was lost.  In the second installment the audience is shown the softer side of Thurman's character. Instead of the spectacle of Thurman out slaughtering hundreds of people in enacting her heroic vengeance we see her succumb to the psychological trauma that would naturally follow from what she had just participated in. The empowered woman of the first installment which is a problem in itself giving a woman a sword and implying that she's empowered had all together fallen apart and assumed the role of the helpless and weak.Kill Bill 2 lacks the elaborately sarcastic violence that made the first volume close to palatable.  The second is filled with an overtly sadistic misogyny that is disturbing to watch for example Budd shooting Thurman in the chest with rock salt and burying her alive after threatening to fill her eyesockets with mace.  All of this in an uncomfortably close quarters with Thurman so that we can watch her suffer.  Where the first movie had fun with its overblown violence the second relishes in a much more terribly painful place.Kill Bill 2 does however include some instances of rich dialogue.  There is a scene where Carradine and Thurman discuss superheroes and why it is that they are popular.  The audience learns the appeal of superman where he differs from other super heroes.  Instead of a human that changes to an alter ego superman is an alter ego that changes into a human.  This conversation is reminiscent of Tarantino's older works but is shortlived.One of the problems with the Kill Bill movies may actually be with more than just the movie.  Tarantino champions the middleclass white male perspective and this perspective becomes visible if we consider the stereotypes adopted by each character.  For example in the first movie we see a juxtaposition of two kinds of stereotypes imposed on Japanese women by American men.  The first is the school girl adopted by Oren Ishi's body guard and the other is Oren herself dressed in traditional Japanese garb for the final battle with Thurman.  In the first installment Tarantino effectively wrapped these stereotypes and issues into a sardonic and nearly humorous violence.  In the second Tarantino disregards that tone.  So what the audience is left with is a plot that very subtly declares a deeper malaise beyond the movie.  It exposes an unspoken evolution in American racism and sexism and I believe it does so unintentionally.Half of what made me feel ill when I left the movie theater last Sunday was the movie and the other half was its being so popular".

It exposes an unspoken evolution in American racism and sexism and I believe it does so unintentionally.Half of what made me feel ill when I left the movie theater last Sunday was the movie and the other half was its being so popular";

I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga revealed itself to be wild imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified not despite but because of the radical shift in tone possesses a strong dramatic ark and above all stands as quite possibly the most passionate loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers part two cites among many others JeanLuc Godard Sergio Leone and Robert Siodmark.But that's far from all.In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool' Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion with this piece he has done so. Those merely seeking the bloodsplattered brokenbone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2 which is infinitely more thoughtful pondering the nature of violence both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great comic book fun here it becomes severely unpleasant cringe inducing and never without consequence. If anything it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa's work. Remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although as a film buff myself having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it's direct and of course unconventional in style Tarantino pays homageborrows or depending on your point of view steals from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par but it's not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of Bmovie spaghetti western shawbrothers kungfu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before i.e. the whole bloodcoated style of the climax in vol. 1 and things you recognize right away i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style.What's there to say about the story except that it picks up where it left off? Sort of as usual the nonlinear story aspect kicks in and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd and Daryl Hannah's most vindictive role as Elle Driver. At first we get a stark black and white view of what the Massacre at Two Pines was like and right away we're introduced finally to Bill played by David Carradine one of the most calm affecting film villain performances in recent memory. The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride's training by the heavyduty Pai Mei Gordon Liu in one of his performances in the whole KB saga. This could be counted as the funnest part of the film aside from a few key moments as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so. In the acting department as I've said Tarantino gets a big boost this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine's career but Thruman's as well. They elevate the mood of Tarantino's sometimes tongueincheek dialog but they're also pro's that do their best when it comes time to the showdown with monologues that come close to being QT's most memorable although not his best as cool as it all sounds it doesn't hit the Pulp Fiction marker. When it does end the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment. It is at least the most ambitious actioncomedydramakungfuwesternromance film this is referring to Vol. and both volumes together in many a moon it's a lot like opening up the filmmaker's skull and getting a scrambled up dosage of his memories and references and it works much more often than not. Oh and how about a bit of applause to Bob Richardson and Michael Parks! A".

	schema:headline " The Moose Hole  Review of Kill Bill Volume II";
	schema:reviewBody "Revenge is a dish best served cold.'When we last left off Quentin Tarantino has reemerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor Miramax Pictures to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious moviegoers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the Hollywood elite' in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shellout double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted in the end that turned out not to be the case as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the footsteps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous . In this situation one shouldn't question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence namely Kill Bill did what it claimed it would accomplish by delivering moviegoers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.Kill Bill Volume II is the second and possibly final installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment here is a slight recap of previous eventsA woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin he made one big mistake he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is ORen Ishi aka Cottonmouth and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list all the way to Bill.The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off leaving The Bride heading to her next target Budd aka Sidewinder who happens to be the rundown and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But for at least a few moments Budd gets the upperhand on the film's lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the makeshift grave The Bride duels with her contemporary rival Elle Driver aka California Mountain Snake who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise her daughter. The story for Kill Bill Volume II is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by backtracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.As was said with the previous installment a relative bunch of lowprofile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a deadon no pun intended performance as Budd a rundown and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hitman business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully overthetop performance given when her character's eye was plucked out. Granted having one's eye plucked out isn't a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman's role in the second installment can't be complimented more then her role in the first . She gives an absolutely brilliant witty and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine best known for his Kung Fu television series gives a sweet' vibrant and utterly perfect performance as the title character Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman . There isn't much to say other then Bravo'!Overall Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself  actions and instincts engulf us at first but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system  maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the moviegoing public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary Kill Bill Volume II serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino's near perfect masterpiece . a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films his cult audience is more then willing to wait.".

What were you thinking man? This is 1st year film student stuff. I watched this last night with my partner. We were hard pushed to stay awake! Neither of us could believe just how slow this film was. The story could have been told in less than 15 minutes!! What gets my goat is that you took 15 minutesworth of story blew it out of all proportion and then sold it to us poor slobs as a fitting sequel to KB1. Man I have lost a lot of respect for you.Oh and before you other losers on here give me a hard time about The Art or that Action isn't everything get a grip! This film didn't have any art and bogall action!! It had no substance. It did not Grab you and make you want to stay in your seat. We only stopped to the end because we had paid to see it.QT if you ever read this  you should be ashamed of yourself. I want my money and the time you took from me returned.To anyone reading this review if it ever gets posted up  beware there are going to be a serious number of disappointed people out there and you may be one of them. QT said it would be different. What he did not say was just how different from Good that it would be. This is QT's worst film. EVER.".

Hans has considerably more difficulty dealing with his Father who is opinionated and authoritarian in regard to his son and with his sister Elle who is hospitalized in a mental institution.

This is march 2006 and Brontosaurus has only received a vote from 8 people none of whom bothered to write a comment. Granted it is not a groundbreaking masterpiece we're dealing with here I myself gave it a 610 but I would like to think there's other people out there who LOVE this film like I do i.e. not so much LOVE as in it's a great film go and see it rather LOVE like you love an old friend or that forest where you built a treehouse as a kid. All the main characters in this film are children and teenagers and it is definitely meant to be enjoyed by children only the script is pretty poor even silly if watched from an adult perspective. It is set in a very small Czech town and the main character Toms is a nature lover and a birdwatcher. The movie shows his struggle to keep the forests he loves clean. And there's a lovehate subplot there too this girl in his class is secretly in love with him while her brother is his archenemy. I first saw the film when I was eight and it had a huge impact on me. It made me realize that nature was what i felt most passionately about. I became a birdwatcher and fifteen years later I got a degree in zoology at Aberdeen university. Therefore needless to say I am incapable of being objective about Brontosaurus but I think it is a heartwarming and heartfelt little film and I wish it was available for children to see all over the world. In a way its candor and innocence are its greatest merits. With today's film industry churning out flicks that not even the directors care about and this is specially true of kids films an old little movie that distills genuine love for its subject matter naturechildhood is to be treasured. Let your children watch it if they get the chance. It may stay with them forever. It certainly is still part of me. Five years ago I got the chance to see it again on the big screen thanks to the Filmoteca of Catalonia and hearing the Brontosaurus song again at the end of the film as sang by all the children in the movie brought tears to my eyes. It was time travel a unique and wonderful experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "ROAD TO BALI Paramount 1952 directed by Hal Walker reunites the famous trio of Bing Crosby Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in another wild and crazy adventure for their sixth Road outing. Having traveled through Singapore 1940 Zanzibar 1941 Morocco 1942 Utopia 1945 and finally Rio 1947 with a lot of other territories to explore such as Borneo Venice or even outer space the writers came up with Bali as their next stop. With newfound surroundings added Technicolor and surprise guest stars along the way the material supplied though hardly original was no doubt quite popular in its day.Opening with a commentary and visual over the map of Australia leading to the city in Melbourne the story gets underway in a vaudeville house where American entertainers George Cochran Bing Crosby and Harold Gridley Bob Hope longtime pals are performing. Back stage are a couple of angry fathers with their daughters to whom these guys proposed but each having no intention of marrying. Making their getaway they soon end up on a train from which they jump out to avoid another angry father ending up in a far away place surrounded by sheep. Arriving in another city as part of a cargo of sheep the bearded George and Harold agree to accept jobs from Ken Ahok Mervyn Vye working as deep sea divers with Harold doing the underwater job to help locate buried treasure. Upon their arrival on an island paradise the boys encounter Ahok's cousin Lalah Dorothy Lamour a princess of Scottish descent. Because Ken Ahok happens to be responsible for the deaths of his previous divers with intention of doing the same for these Americans Lalah warns them that their mission means certain death. After Harold dives for and acquires the buried jewels the trio break away from Ahok's murderous cutthroats and set sail out for Bali. While on the tropical island further danger and numerous surprises awaits.A movie being more fantasy than its intended South Seas island spoof the film's best moments are its opening 20 minutes. In spite of every effort made turning out a great 91 minute comedy in the tradition of ROAD TO MOROCCO or ROAD TO UTOPIA this latest Road installment grows tiresome long before it's all over.

	onyx:emotionText "ROAD TO BALI Paramount 1952 directed by Hal Walker reunites the famous trio of Bing Crosby Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in another wild and crazy adventure for their sixth Road outing. Having traveled through Singapore 1940 Zanzibar 1941 Morocco 1942 Utopia 1945 and finally Rio 1947 with a lot of other territories to explore such as Borneo Venice or even outer space the writers came up with Bali as their next stop. With newfound surroundings added Technicolor and surprise guest stars along the way the material supplied though hardly original was no doubt quite popular in its day.Opening with a commentary and visual over the map of Australia leading to the city in Melbourne the story gets underway in a vaudeville house where American entertainers George Cochran Bing Crosby and Harold Gridley Bob Hope longtime pals are performing. Back stage are a couple of angry fathers with their daughters to whom these guys proposed but each having no intention of marrying. Making their getaway they soon end up on a train from which they jump out to avoid another angry father ending up in a far away place surrounded by sheep. Arriving in another city as part of a cargo of sheep the bearded George and Harold agree to accept jobs from Ken Ahok Mervyn Vye working as deep sea divers with Harold doing the underwater job to help locate buried treasure. Upon their arrival on an island paradise the boys encounter Ahok's cousin Lalah Dorothy Lamour a princess of Scottish descent. Because Ken Ahok happens to be responsible for the deaths of his previous divers with intention of doing the same for these Americans Lalah warns them that their mission means certain death. After Harold dives for and acquires the buried jewels the trio break away from Ahok's murderous cutthroats and set sail out for Bali. While on the tropical island further danger and numerous surprises awaits.A movie being more fantasy than its intended South Seas island spoof the film's best moments are its opening 20 minutes. In spite of every effort made turning out a great 91 minute comedy in the tradition of ROAD TO MOROCCO or ROAD TO UTOPIA this latest Road installment grows tiresome long before it's all over. Crosby the con man Hope the stooge and Lamour the sarong girl in the middle revive their past Road adventures with much familiarity continue acting like overage kids with their one paddy cake routine along with an assortment of adlibs. Injokes are put to the maximum this time around some at a total loss for viewers today. Best bits however are Hope and Crosby surrounded by beautiful maiden girls.

	schema:reviewBody "For some strange reason this film was allowed to slip into the public domain. This is odd because it is the only one of the HopeCrosby road pictures to be in the public domain AND the only one filmed in color. Not surprisingly however because these are public domain prints the color is very washed out and the prints I have seen are a bit fuzzy. It must have looked great in 1952...my how times have changed.This film finds the boys playing pretty much the same characters they played in most of the other films in the series. Once again they are broke scheming for money and fighting over women. Also just like most of their other films the natives and native dances look like they stepped right out of a Hollywood sound stage...which they have. This makes for an odd film that bears as much resemblance to Bali as it does to Cleveland well actually less.Because Bing and Bob are broke they accept jobs as divers to retrieve a sunken treasure. What they don't know is that the job is practically suicidewith a horrible giant squid waiting for them. It already has killed several other divers and the boys are next. But in typical road movie style the Princess Dorothy Lamour falls for the boys and doesn't want to see them risk their miserable lives.As for the quality of the film it's a mixed bag. Because the plot and so much about the formula of the movie is the same old same old it certainly isn't a mustsee movie. However it's pleasant entertainment and the film does have an even higher number of jokes that pokes fun of itself and cultural references than usual. This is how they get little cameos of Humphrey Bogart and Martin  Lewis in a film supposedly set in Bali and the South Seas. It also has gorillas in Indonesia?!.For fans of the series it is a nice return to the past but to someone wanting something different you're gonna be disappointed.".

There's just enough plot to move things along some nice musical numbers and a winking nudging attitude toward the audience best exemplified by a scene where romantic music starts playing and Hope turns to the audience and says  He's gonna sing folks now would be a good time to go get the popcorn and proceeds to put cotton in his ears as Crosby begins to serenade Lamour.Road to Bali may be dated and corny but it was meant to be just silly fun even when it was new.

I do think that Hope and Crosby have very good energy on screen together and they play off each other well. I also enjoyed the tiki atmosphere of the sets which were top of the line for Paramount.The plot barely exists. Basically Hope and Crosby are guys on the lam from marriage proposals who become involved with a beautiful native princess who employs them to dig for treasure. When they find the treasure all their lives are in danger and they must escape to another exotic island.A fun film suitable for children but basically it made me chuckle but no belly laughs if you know what I mean.".

Fortunately the presence of the gorgeous Dorothy Lamour helps matters a lot and there are a couple of fun silly moments featuring the giant squid and an amorous gorilla but with such dreadful gags and unmemorable songs the hour and a half really felt like a lot longer.According to other comments here on IMDb 'Bali' is one of the weaker Road movies.

There are so many funny lines and wisecracks that you will have to watch it more than once. The lunatic plot has our heroes innocently taking a job as deepsea divers for a baddie who is trying to recover a lost treasure and take over the island paradise ruled by his beautiful cousin played by gorgeous Dorothy Lamour. One thing leads to another and well you'll have to see the picture to see what the screenwriters came up with. The songs are lovely as is the Technicolor. I got this for 2.00 at a second hand DVD store on a 2disc set from Vina. I expected the usual mediocre bargainbasement print but was surprised to see a firstrate copy with vivid and beautiful Technicolor and excellent sound. This film is just the thing to pick you up. The guest cameos Martin  Lewis Bogey Jane Russell etc. are an added bonus. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Antoine and Quentin are twin brothers. They're both young determined and stubborn. Planning to assist to their mother's funeral they embark on a journey to Spain. Hitchhiking walking illegally breaking their way into cargo trains their trip becomes longer and harder than expected.Antoine however manages to find some pleasure thanks to the girls he finds on the road. Sexual intercourse seems to be Antoine's privilege as Quentin remains isolated and totally immersed in his drawings. Even so the twin brothers seem to share a special bond. Closeness and intimacy at first seem to come natural to them.They almost embody the idealized brotherly relationship as seen in Sophocles Antigone. Antoine and Quentin are 'autadelphos' to the extreme not only have they shared the mother's womb but they also share every physical trait identical to one another in physical appearance they are completely different in everything else. According to Saussure's linguistics these brothers would only be able to articulate themselves into the symbolic order by functioning as mutually supplementary properties. Here the signifier the body is the same but the signified the personality is completely different.The hardships of the excursion take a toll on the brother's already strained relationship. But even after constant fighting they agree on working in a farm the necessary days to pay for a train ticket to Spain. One night Quentin finds in the fields a young man that looks very interested in him. They go skinny dipping and afterwards they have sex in the middle of the woods. Antoine worried about his brother's absence goes out looking for him and finds him naked with the other boy.With a mindset conquered by the heterosexual normativity Antoine is unable to cope with the fact that his brother is homosexual. In the classic Greek tragedy Antigone confirms that she loves her brother despise he was a traitor to Thebes she reaffirms My brother is what he is and she loves him even more than life itself. He is what he is. And she accepts him for it. Antoine however cannot accept homosexuality he can't see his brother as he is. And so a few hours after the fateful encounter he betrays his brother.While eating in town a man approaches Antoine trying to seduce him. He quickly tells the man that for 100 euros he can have his brother who is already waiting in the bathroom. The man pays and goes into the bathroom and abusively tries to undress Quentin who defends as best as he can. Antoine leaves the place and returns afterwards only to find his brother's backpack on the bathroom's floor. He is nowhere to be found and it's only then when Antoine realizes what he has done.Relationships amongst brothers are always complicated there is much love and hate constant conflicts but usually nothing escalates as dangerously as it happens in PascalAlex Vincent's film. Antoine has a ghastly nightmare he sees Quentin covered in blood. He starts feeling guilty and he starts remembering other occasions in which he had purposefully neglected his brother.He has but one choice to keep traveling to Spain. Just before reaching his mother's town he runs into Angel a young man that tries to help him curiously Angel is played by Fernando Ramallo famous for his interpretation of a gay teenager in Krampack finally he arrives on time for the memorial. It's only fitting that the possibility of the brother's death is bound to the mother's funeral. It all boils down to Lacan's symbolic death. The burial place is the first symbol in which humanity can reorganize itself. Animals live and die anonymously so to speak. For humans unity and irreplaceability must be protected and remembered through language that's why we speak of the dead why we erect monuments and place tombstones thus creating what Lacan called a second death that pertains to the order of the symbolic.The final scenes of Donnemoi la main are unforgettable because of the lack of communication loneliness and true desperation that the director transmits with strong images. At the beginning of the film we had two brothers trusting in each other sharing their frustrations and joys expressing their feelings not through conventional language but rather through gestures physical contact silences and movement. At the end of the film all that remains is bereft loss rage and violence.".

For humans unity and irreplaceability must be protected and remembered through language that's why we speak of the dead why we erect monuments and place tombstones thus creating what Lacan called a second death that pertains to the order of the symbolic.The final scenes of Donnemoi la main are unforgettable because of the lack of communication loneliness and true desperation that the director transmits with strong images. At the beginning of the film we had two brothers trusting in each other sharing their frustrations and joys expressing their feelings not through conventional language but rather through gestures physical contact silences and movement. At the end of the film all that remains is bereft loss rage and violence.";

I highly recommend it for those who are interested in character development and not a splashy trashy film. The two brothers were extremely well played the violence between the two of them seemed to indicate an unspoken attraction between the two of them. What is interesting that until it is made clear that the two are brothers one could easily assume that they are lovers.

The movie could be entirely improve but then the whole screenplay for me it becomes a bland mime. Most of the scene are understandable by gestures no lines no words.

How Quentin escape from the man whom paid Antoine 100 euros? how did he reach the cemetery first before Antoine? The woman who rescued Antoine whom abused him? What was clear to me is at the end scene they were reunited at last but their relationship has been damage already. They fought to relieve their hatred with each other but then Antoine drowned. The cries of Quentin in fear to lost his brother means compassion that whatsoever at the end they are still brothers and love still remains.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't expect much going into this movie. I found it on a list of gay films and when I got my copy I did a little flip through like I always do to make sure that it was good and as a result stumbled upon the solicitation scene. I'm not into incest personally but I have seen a few films where the topic was handled delicately and beautifully so I have an open mind towards the genre if nothing else. This is NOT a gay film however. Still I was intrigued by the twins. They're very striking in a nonclassical kind of way.The overall premise of the film is that the boys ran away from their father's home in France to attend the funeral of their mother who lived in Spain and whom they had no relationship with. The film follows them on their journey. As other reviewers have pointed out what dialogue there is is minimal but I don't think the film suffers as a result. If anything it builds the tension because something is almost always just around the corner. Usually a fight because we see within the first few minutes that the boys have a very combative relationship a juxtaposition of the sweet relationship implied in the animated short at the very beginning of the film.As I watched I started thinking of them as the good twin and the evil twin but truly the good one isn't without his own faults and the evil one isn't that evil. Well...at first anyway. It becomes obvious early on that the evil one Antoine who bears a scar to make him that much more sinister looking was the more dominant of the two and Quentin the good one was used to him handling matters and taking care of him. We see Quentin whining about being hungry and also getting a piggyback ride from Antoine when he didn't feel like walking. Those scenes cement the nature of their relationship and the differences in their personalities. However things change whenever someone new comes into the picture and it's interesting that on two occasions first with the girl from the gas station and later on at the farm Antoine finds himself on the outside looking in literally spying on Quentin as he has sex. There's no actual incest in the film and no confirmation of sexual desire on either of their parts but the possessiveness that Antoine exhibits towards Quentin marks him as his own just as plainly as if he were his lover. In fact his anger and jealousy spur him to do something that ultimately leads to their separation.I consider this film a study in human behaviour specifically relationships and how you can love someone and hate them at the same time knowing that they're poison and no good for you but you still need them all the same. It's you can't live with them but you can't live without them at its very core and I appreciate that it's not a stereotypical romantic pairing though it still comes across that way to an extent.It's not a perfect film by any means but it's not a terrible way to spend 76 minutes. The scenery is beautiful and the action when it comes is gripping. My biggest complaint is that I would've liked more backstory into their estrangement from their mother and I wish they'd shown what happened to Quentin after he ran off. The film is primarily seen through Antoine's POV and once Quentin runs away from his wouldbe rapist we don't see him again until the funeral which left me with some questions that we never got any answers to because the film ended 10 minutes later. How did he make it to the funeral when he left all of his possessions behind?The twins were brilliant in their portrayals though. They did an excellent job of establishing the polarities in the twins' personalities. I couldn't have asked for more from them.Overall I enjoyed it even wished it was longer if only because I wanted more Quentin and his silent brooding.".

I'm 26 years old big fan of all sorts of movies no matter if they adrenaline pumping action flicks deep emotional love dramas intelligent satire or plain silly dumbness as long as I get anything out of a movie I'm satisfied.About Dorm Daze 2 then I saw Dorm Daze a couple years ago and I recall enjoying it. Nor more or less than any regular teen movie but it had the whole door slamming Shakespeare thing going on which was really nice to see nicely incorporated into the American Pie format. This movie however tries to be as intriguing as the other one with a huge cast of people you never really get to understand who why or what they are. The movie is a mess but you can follow it if you really try dispite all the errors in the plot. My main concern about this movie though is that its not funny and I'm a guy who found Benchwarmers hilarious for its plain and simple stupidity. There wasn't one single moment in this movie that I found funny and I'd say I know funny when I see it all categories. They were really trying for laughs but failed miserably. The plot work is much better then the comedy of it but unfortunately that doesn't say much about the plot either.Therefor I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Its not funny and if you're into those plot things you better go with the first Dorm Daze instead and stay away from this one.".

The American Pie films which are the same genre are far superior and I was expecting a similar product.

Still the chicks involved were hot and I'm not complaining.Acting direction etc are not really important in such movie and due to the nature of the film many characters plots and subplots ensure that any lapses on these fronts are easily ironed out.Even though I didn't think it were possible this movie actually had the potential to exceed expectations but the good amount of Strictly OK scenes ensured that this movie only met my expectations.The DVD extras were nothing special and not worth mentioning.The movie is a mixed bag and we have a few money moments hot chicks nudity and a couple of absolutely hilarious scenes mixed mostly with a fair amount of not so funny moments failed attempts and over the top scenes.In all an OK movie thats worth a rent if you are are a fan of such movies and are desperate to watch a movie of this type.s fair amount of OK and not so OK scenescast strictly OK no nudity from the stars.s caricaturish characters DVD extras.s 2 absolutely hilarious scenes especially the captains wifea mixed bag of funny jokes.Total 610 absolute and factoring in expectations".

There are so many situations that are bound to make you crack up we were laughing nonstop the entire time and reference the movie in our conversations on a frequent basis. The movie is a actually pretty well written and not nearly as predictable as expected. The only negative is the frequent showing of the male rear end although the 2 scenes with it are absolutely hilarious. Also i wouldn't suggest watching it with girls your girlfriend if you haven't noticed.".

	schema:headline " Frankenstein's Daughter 1958 12";
	schema:reviewBody "12 out of My earliest memory of seeing FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER was somewhere back in the early 1970s when I was very young. I was living in Queens New York and back in those sweet days I used to bounce between TV stations to catch a Saturday night horror film on either Channel 5's Creature Features or Channel 11's Chiller Theatre. Well Chiller won out on that particular evening. It was the heart of summer and my street was having a festive block party. I can still hear the sounds of music and kids laughing and playing as someone would frequently run inside and ask me why I wasn't outside joining in all the fun. As much fun as I knew the family and neighbors were having outside I couldn't have cared less I was riveted to an oldfashioned television set watching FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and adding this night to my memory banks. I'm sure they've all since forgotten their block party...It's strange to think that this film was only a dozen or so years old when I first saw it! Since we weren't yet too jaded by gore and splatter I found some genuinely powerful moments in FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER There was blood on some of the the victims we got a glimpse of a dismembered hand and we were also treated to mangled and meaty body parts. The icing on the cake was a shot of a character's face virtually melting away after being splashed with acid. Pretty potent stuff compared to what I was already accustomed to.The 1958 feature seemed very relative to me at the time. My Queens block looked very much like the residential streets in the movie and the basement laboratory could very well have been my own cellar had I dressed it up with some test tubes and a large table. The added fact that the story was about teenagers okay so they looked more like thirtysomething's also gave me a point of identification. A backyard barbecue scene again struck a chord and was particularly appropriate on this festive evening where a noisy shindig was actually occurring a few feet away just outside my own screen door.The movie starts with a precredits sequence Sandra Knight is prowling the neighborhood in cheap but effective monster makeup with bushy eyebrows and decaying buck teeth. One of her girlfriends the sultry Sally Todd is just getting home from a date with her boyfriend and screams at the very sight of her. The next morning Knight awakens as a normallooking girl with no memory of what went on the previous evening though when she meets Sally for tennis her friend insists that she saw some sort of monster last night. This strange revelation triggers memories of bad dreams for Knight and she soon thinks that she could have been the creature in question.Meanwhile Knight's elderly Uncle played with hilarious ineptitude by the alwaysfunny Felix Locher is experimenting with a formula to render man ageless. He has acquired a young assistant named Oliver Frank short for Frankenstein of course who is supposedly aiding him but who would rather see the old man dead so he can gain full use of the laboratory to concentrate on his own masterful experiment. Donald Murphy plays Oliver and he's one of the most detestable snakes ever to slither down the Frankenstein Family Tree. He's a joy to watch at work using the nutty old man's formula on his own niece by spiking her nightly glasses of fruit punch thereby turning her into the grotesque monster from the opening sequence! Later Oliver connives his way into a date with Sally Todd and tries in vain to make out with her only to be slapped across the face by the stuckup vixen... Hey Oliver protests from Lover's Lane you agreed to park here with me! Soon he has a better idea he gets even by mowing her down with his car as she tries to run away! Then taking her body to the basement lab Frank decides to use her head on the hulking carcass he's assembling behind the old doc's back. When the automation comes to life it's actually a male actor Harry Wilson who portrays her with a toastylooking face reportedly nobody bothered to tell makeup artist Harry Thomas that the monster was to be female so he solved the dilemma by smearing some lipstick on its kisser! Amidst the rampages of Frankenstein's Daughter we are treated to the aforementioned evening backyard barbecue. Still wondering where their friend Sally Todd vanished to the other teens ease their pain between hamburgers and frankfurters while enjoying the live music of Page Cavanaugh and His Trio. The band treats us to two '50s gems Daddy Bird and  my own guilty favorite  Special Date. I have since memorized all the words and it's a riot! With lovable horror clichs gooey monsters and funny dialog this is a cult classic of its type from director Richard Cunha. It's a lightlypaced thrill ride from start to finish and one of the best teenage monster movies of them all. It's easily Cunha's masterpiece if such a word applies here. At its worst FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER is a harmlessly funny exploitation farce at its best it's one of the most underrated monster classics of the 50s. I'd love to give it three or four stars just based on sheer cheesy enjoyment value!".

	onyx:emotionText "12 out of My earliest memory of seeing FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER was somewhere back in the early 1970s when I was very young. I was living in Queens New York and back in those sweet days I used to bounce between TV stations to catch a Saturday night horror film on either Channel 5's Creature Features or Channel 11's Chiller Theatre. Well Chiller won out on that particular evening. It was the heart of summer and my street was having a festive block party. I can still hear the sounds of music and kids laughing and playing as someone would frequently run inside and ask me why I wasn't outside joining in all the fun. As much fun as I knew the family and neighbors were having outside I couldn't have cared less I was riveted to an oldfashioned television set watching FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and adding this night to my memory banks. I'm sure they've all since forgotten their block party...It's strange to think that this film was only a dozen or so years old when I first saw it! Since we weren't yet too jaded by gore and splatter I found some genuinely powerful moments in FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER There was blood on some of the the victims we got a glimpse of a dismembered hand and we were also treated to mangled and meaty body parts. The icing on the cake was a shot of a character's face virtually melting away after being splashed with acid. Pretty potent stuff compared to what I was already accustomed to.The 1958 feature seemed very relative to me at the time. My Queens block looked very much like the residential streets in the movie and the basement laboratory could very well have been my own cellar had I dressed it up with some test tubes and a large table. The added fact that the story was about teenagers okay so they looked more like thirtysomething's also gave me a point of identification. A backyard barbecue scene again struck a chord and was particularly appropriate on this festive evening where a noisy shindig was actually occurring a few feet away just outside my own screen door.The movie starts with a precredits sequence Sandra Knight is prowling the neighborhood in cheap but effective monster makeup with bushy eyebrows and decaying buck teeth. One of her girlfriends the sultry Sally Todd is just getting home from a date with her boyfriend and screams at the very sight of her. The next morning Knight awakens as a normallooking girl with no memory of what went on the previous evening though when she meets Sally for tennis her friend insists that she saw some sort of monster last night. This strange revelation triggers memories of bad dreams for Knight and she soon thinks that she could have been the creature in question.Meanwhile Knight's elderly Uncle played with hilarious ineptitude by the alwaysfunny Felix Locher is experimenting with a formula to render man ageless. He has acquired a young assistant named Oliver Frank short for Frankenstein of course who is supposedly aiding him but who would rather see the old man dead so he can gain full use of the laboratory to concentrate on his own masterful experiment. Donald Murphy plays Oliver and he's one of the most detestable snakes ever to slither down the Frankenstein Family Tree. He's a joy to watch at work using the nutty old man's formula on his own niece by spiking her nightly glasses of fruit punch thereby turning her into the grotesque monster from the opening sequence! Later Oliver connives his way into a date with Sally Todd and tries in vain to make out with her only to be slapped across the face by the stuckup vixen... Hey Oliver protests from Lover's Lane you agreed to park here with me! Soon he has a better idea he gets even by mowing her down with his car as she tries to run away! Then taking her body to the basement lab Frank decides to use her head on the hulking carcass he's assembling behind the old doc's back. When the automation comes to life it's actually a male actor Harry Wilson who portrays her with a toastylooking face reportedly nobody bothered to tell makeup artist Harry Thomas that the monster was to be female so he solved the dilemma by smearing some lipstick on its kisser! Amidst the rampages of Frankenstein's Daughter we are treated to the aforementioned evening backyard barbecue. Still wondering where their friend Sally Todd vanished to the other teens ease their pain between hamburgers and frankfurters while enjoying the live music of Page Cavanaugh and His Trio. The band treats us to two '50s gems Daddy Bird and  my own guilty favorite  Special Date. I have since memorized all the words and it's a riot! With lovable horror clichs gooey monsters and funny dialog this is a cult classic of its type from director Richard Cunha. It's a lightlypaced thrill ride from start to finish and one of the best teenage monster movies of them all. It's easily Cunha's masterpiece if such a word applies here.

Of course that was before things like FRANKENSTEIN '80 or FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE OF FREAKS came along.  I grew up watching this film on Chiller Theatre and now I have a beautiful sepia tinted print on video so it is indeed a pleasure of mine and not a guilty one either.  I like this film and I am not ashamed to admit it so there! What a cast Felix Locher real life father of actor Jon Hall as a dedicated but misguided scientist Donald Murphy as yet another last of the Frankenstein's the third one the movies offered us in the space of a single year! Harold Lloyd Jr as the comedy relief Sandra Knight future Mrs. Jack Nicholson as both the girl in distress AND the fillin monster and last but not least John Ashley as the hero.  Two men played the title monster  mostly he she? it? was played by Harry Wilson former stunt double for Wallace Beery you can see Mr. Wilson briefly in THEM! in the hospital scene.  He is in the bed next to the one occupied by  Olin Howland and for the scene where the Monster is on fire stuntman George Barrows takes over. Ms. Knight is memorable as the crusty faced bug eyed monster who dominates the first half of the movie.  If she had just gone on one date with Mr. Murphy perhaps he would not have experimented on her but of course the plot had to advance.  It's the title monster that gets me.  An ostensibly male body with the  severely mutilated head of a female hitandrun victim grafted on talk about gender confusion!  Mr. Murphy gets a classic bit of male chauvinism when he declares The brain of a female is conditioned to a man's world therefore it takes orders.  Wanna bet?  The first thing the monster does after it wakes up is wander out on its own and kill someone!  It is polite enough to knock when it returns home at least. You have to love the party scene.  Harold Lloyd Jr backed by Paige Cavanaugh and his Trio a jazz combo trying to ease into rock and roll sings Special Date and Daddy Bird and nearly steals the second half of the movie. Oh and for your trivia folder that burned face makeup on Mr.Murphy that was immortalised in the opening credits of Chiller Theatre was accomplished in less than 5 minutes thanks to some clear gel lens paper and chocolate syrup. Director Richard Cunha made other features but I do believe this is his best.".

It is 1958 Los Angeles and he is living with Dr. Carter Morton Felix Locher and assisting him with his experiments. Unbeknownst to Dr. Morton Oliver is using the lab for not just legitimate experiments but to try to carry on the family business creating a human being from body parts.Sandra Knight portrays Trudy Morton Dr. Morton's teenage niece. John Ashley is her good guy boyfriend Johnny. To make a long story short Oliver creates a woman monster using the head of Trudy's va va voom friend Suzy played by 1957 Playmate of the Year Sally Todd who was killed by Oliver in a jealous rage and various other body parts mostly male. The resulting monster with a female head all be it butt ugly and male body is hilarious to say the least. There is also a side story where Oliver is drugging Trudy with a drug that turns her into a monster because she won't play hide the salami with him. The monster make up on both monsters is not scary but laughable.All teen oriented movies in the 1950's had to have a few dancesong sequences with that new music rock and roll and this movie is no exception. Surprisingly enough John Ashley doesn't perform he was a singer and sang in several 1950's movies most noticeably to 50's scary movie fans in the movie How to Create a Monster. Instead Harold Lloyd Jr. sings two songs with the Page Cavanaugh Trio. The songs are funny although I think they were meant to be serious back when the movie was released.This movie has everything you would expect from a 1950's low budget horror movie...cheap sets grade b actors crapola make up and cheezy song and dance routines. In other words everything for a fun movie!".

This film runs 86minutes and I can't help but think it would have been much better had twentyminutes been edited out. As it stands this is a mildly entertaining film that has a few 'so bad it's good' laughs but in the end there's just not enough going for it to be rewarding in its running time. What does work are the monsters which includes the one the doctor is making but we also have a second one involving a young woman Sandra Knight who is being drugged by the bad doctor which transforms her into a beast. The make up effects are rather silly looking but they do create a couple interesting monsters although it's very hard to believe that actress Sally Todd is behind the main one. Now what really kills the film is that the two monsters get very limited screen time as most of it focuses on the doctor the young woman and her boyfriend. All the teen drama stuff just doesn't work and I'm not sure how many scenes we need with people not believing who or what the monster is. John Ashley Knight and Murphy turn in decent performances but quite often they garner laughs due to the rather weak screenplay they're working in. Harold Lloyd Jr. has a small role here but doesn't impress too much either.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the movie that almost killed me. Watching it many years ago at NYC's Thalia Theatre as part of an amazing double feature with The Monster From Green Hell I laughed so uproariously that I really thought I was going to rupture my spleen. It has been my favorite bad movie ever since and I love it to this day for many reasons. First of all we have to wait a mere 20 seconds or so before we see one of the film's two impressive monsters. That first one is Trudy who when we first see her is an ugly bucktoothed bushybrowed horror in a nightgown. Come morning Trudy is as pretty as can be but retains memories of the previous night. Could all this have something to do with the presence of her uncle's research assistant Otto Frank nee Frankenstein in the house? What would you think? As it turns out ol' Otto the grandson of the original good Dr. is using Uncle Carter's lab for some projects of his own. The creature he ultimately creates looks like a wrinkled mass of toadstools while the monster's female brain is conditioned to a man's world therefore takes orders where 19th century ones didn't. This line always brings the house down in theatres! Fifties stalwart John Ashley provides his usual sturdy support to the befuddled Trudy director Richard Cunha remarkably brings in his fourth awesome film of 1958 She Demons Giant From the Unknown and Missile to the Moon being the others and the Page Cavanaugh Trio performs two swinging rock 'n' roll numbers. Indeed the song with the refrain Shabalabbalop bobbalobba lobbalop which I now know to be called DaddyBird was the one that almost killed me back at the Thalia. This really might be the most entertaining teenhorrorrock 'n' roll movie ever made nicely presented on this crisplooking Image DVD.".

It was the first time I ever saw a horror movie in a theater. It was a double bill with Frankenstein's Daughter and The Man Without a Body. My cousin who was six years older than me took me. I was 8 or 9 I think.I was absolutely terrified. I had just barely enough guts not to put my hands over my eyes and show my cousin what a coward I was. I never saw the movie again till I was in my 50's. Hmmm no so scary but when I let my imagination go I could still remember the night in the theater and how I felt.The best advice I can give others on this film is that my 5 was generous. It is however not just bad. It is wonderfully bad! If you want to have your own Mystery Science Theater invite some friends over serve plenty of drinks and laugh your way though the film. But watch out that there are no little ones in the room because they may react as I did in the theater all those years ago.".

Trudy is the niece of his employer Carter Morton a tottering mad scientist with a perplexing Germanic accent. played by Felix Locher who portrayed Frenchmen Spaniards and even Sitting Bull  twice  during his long career.Oliver adds a whole new dimension to sexual harassment by slipping Trudy fruitpunch mickeys laced with Digenerol an apparent early version of Rohypnol.Trudy keeps waking from nightmares where she's been running around the suburbs in her bathing suit or blue nightie with bug eyes Bubba teeth and a profuse amount of facial hair.When other members of the community begin to describe seeing the same scantilyclad creature Trudy deduces that she must be the monster and proceeds to tell just about everyone she knows. They all poohpooh the notion because after all the movie still has 65 minutes to fill.At this point we get to know a little more about Trudy's close friend Suzie played by February 1957 Playmate Sally Todd. Seems Suzie is still sore because Trudy stole her boyfriend Johnny. Suzie can see that livein employee Oliver has a thing for Trudy so she plans to get a piece of that action for herself.Date night comes and Suzie gets more of Ollie than she wants. Slapping a Frankenstein is a capital offense and the mad scientist salvages Suzie's brain for his brand new monster.Exposition ensues as Mad Doctor Frank explains to his henchman Elsu that he is placing a female brain in his male monster's head because the female brain is conditioned to a man's world and therefore takes orders .... Ollie forgot that this particular brain just got done slapping the snot out of him.Elsu who must be older than dirt also assisted Granddaddy and Daddy Frankenstein when they brought their own creatures into the world and gets the notion that Oliver's motives are less honorable than his predecessors. Not good at taking constructive criticism Dr. Frank tells his henchman From here on in I decide what's evil.While the mad scientist works hard to spark life in his creature old man Morton picks that inconvenient moment to have a heart seizure. Hearing his cry for help and needing to keep him from staggering in on their secret experiment Oliver and Elsu rush out to aid Morton. As Trudy runs downstairs to see what's the matter Morton makes a miraculous recovery.Wouldn't you know it just when the mad doc is out of the room the monster gets the jumpstart heshe needs and shambles out of the laboratory. We get our first good look at the new Suzie and wish we hadn't. Androgyny wasn't in vogue in 1958 so instead of giving us a Prince or a Sting the director resorted to the old sideshow freak trick of putting lipstick and makeup on the right side of the monster's face while the scarred left side is that of a man specifically Hollywood tough guy Harry Wilson.Apparently genderconfused the monster makes a point of ripping the frilly curtains off the window before busting through the front door into the night.Cut to the two unluckiest dockworkers since Abbott and Costello met Dracula. Suzie the monster does a Mummy shuffle along the dock and catches the attention of one of the workers who demands to know Who are you?. Suzie tries to use her new monster vocal chords to say Miss February 1957 but it all comes out as a grunt. Frustrated that she can't make the crowbarwielding worker understand she leans on her best feminine wiles and repeatedly bitchslaps him. In this new monster body though Suzie bounces him all over the dock.Tired of killing for the night Suzie heads home to her mad doctor. A little humanity shines through as the monster stops and politely knocks at the very same door heshe had smashed through just an hour before.Expecting boyfriend Johnny the hapless Trudy answers the door and collapses in a total wiggins at the sight of her new dead best friend Suzie.The monster gets whisked away by hisher maker Trudy is revived and duly convinced by concerned loved ones that she's nuts and Uncle Carter urges her to have a teenage rocknroll dance party barbecue by the backyard pool just to calm her nerves.The viewer is invited along as the fourman ? Page Cavanaugh Trio plays jazzy hep hits for the comeasyouare teen partygoers. This is the way life should be. There should always be combos playing in the backyard while newspaper headlines scream WOMAN MONSTER MENACES CITY! Not even Godzilla should keep us from grabbing a little gusto. Hollywood filmmakers should resurrect the tradition of musical interludes in horror movies so we can relive great moments like this and the barn dance in 'Giant Gila Monster'.This movie adds a timeless tune 'Daddy Bird' to the teenage horror movie hit list  right up there with 'Beware the Blob' 'Ghoul in School' from 'Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory' and 'Kiss My A' from 'Zombie High'. 4 out of 10.".

They play their roles fantastically.This film reminds me in some ways of Ed Wood's type of films.  Just why in the middle of this horror ? movie do they have a wild party in the backyard where the monster lives and our heroine has had some traumatic experiences with the monster. She looks as though she is really enjoying the party and there are no monster problems affecting her or her group of friends. To me this party just doesn't fit it with the atmosphere that the writer is trying to obtain for the movie.Dr. Oliver Frank Donald Murphy.  Now there is a character!! He is also a very dedicated scientist with quite an itinerary on his plate.  He will go to no ends to try and make his monster come true. He first of all experiments with Sandra Knight our heroine then Susie Lawlor.  He also has to get rid of his boss and wants to kill him so that he can have free access to the lab to do his experiments. He has got all the answers to give to the police and anyone else who will listen so he can attain his goal.The monster oh yes the monster. There is something to be talked about. She is supposed to be Susie Lawlor but if you remember Susie was maybe 5 feet 3 inches or there abouts and when she went out on a date with Dr. Frank she only came up to maybe his shoulders.  This monster is taller than Dr. Frank and is built like a Sherman tank. There is the problem. Who is the person behind the ugly mask??One thing I like about these type of monster and horror movies is that the good guys always somehow defeat the monsters.  So now I know that if I see a monster like Dr. Frankenstein has created I know how to dispose of it.Now I can sleep a lot easier!!".

To me this party just doesn't fit it with the atmosphere that the writer is trying to obtain for the movie.Dr. Oliver Frank Donald Murphy.  Now there is a character!! He is also a very dedicated scientist with quite an itinerary on his plate.  He will go to no ends to try and make his monster come true. He first of all experiments with Sandra Knight our heroine then Susie Lawlor.  He also has to get rid of his boss and wants to kill him so that he can have free access to the lab to do his experiments. He has got all the answers to give to the police and anyone else who will listen so he can attain his goal.The monster oh yes the monster. There is something to be talked about. She is supposed to be Susie Lawlor but if you remember Susie was maybe 5 feet 3 inches or there abouts and when she went out on a date with Dr. Frank she only came up to maybe his shoulders.  This monster is taller than Dr. Frank and is built like a Sherman tank. There is the problem. Who is the person behind the ugly mask??One thing I like about these type of monster and horror movies is that the good guys always somehow defeat the monsters.  So now I know that if I see a monster like Dr. Frankenstein has created I know how to dispose of it.Now I can sleep a lot easier!!";

The Monster trying to comfort the dead Oliver it's creator catches fire from an open flame in the lab that was heating up the testtubes and burns to death. So ends another episode in the adventures of the Frankenstein Boys. You can take Frankenstein's daughter for what it is and enjoy watching it instead of throwing a chair through the TV screen an unintentional funny ripoff of the Frankenstein story this time set in 1958 in the USA. I have to say the girls Trudy  Suzie were very pretty and kept you interested watching them whenever they were on the screen. The movie also had some wild songs and music by the Page Cavanaugh Trio  Band. John Ashley was his usual goodguy ladykiller not in the criminal sense of the word self and Donald Murphy did over do it a bit as the crazed Oliver Frank Frankenstein with his insane actions as well his groping Ollie just couldn't keep his hands off both Suzie and Trudy of the girls in the movie. It was the two oldsters Felix Locher  Wolf Barzell who stole the acting honors in the picture. Both came across as if they really took their parts in the movie seriously and acted as if they were Caesar and Mark Anthony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since Universal's classic in 1931 starring Boris Karloff Frankenstein has continuously been one of the most filmed stories ever. There literally exist hundreds of versions remakes re imaginings parodies spinoffs sequels and variants on Mary Shelley's legendary tale and there probably will follow hundreds more. Only a small portion of these films can be considered as classic whereas the vast majority can be considered as inferior. Frankenstein's Daughter is something entirely different and quite unique. This is epic trash! Up until now I thought only Andy Warhol's Flesh For Frankenstein fell into this category but now there's two. Hooray because there can never be enough trashycampy horror in this world. Frankenstein's Daughter is absurd but massively amusing rubbish from start to finish with awkward plot twists demented characters gruesome for 50's standards makeup effects inane dialogs and completely irrelevant but swinging poolside dance sequences. The brilliant but naive and elderly professor Morton is working on a breakthrough medicine that will prevent the further ageing of human cells. His unbalanced assistant secretly serves this still malfunctioning potion to Morton's attractive young niece Trudy which turns her into a horribly deformed monster that terrorizes the streets at night. Now this given alone is quite awesome already but it's only a small part of Oliver Frank's hidden agenda. For you see he's actually the grandson of THE baron Frankenstein and determined to further optimize the mad science family business. Oliver has the luminous idea to plant a female set of brains into the body of the creature. Why? Well because females obey orders much better. These aren't my words naturally but just one of the many bonkers and politically incorrect quotes from the movie. Frankenstein's Daughter is quite heavy for a 1958 flick. The monstrous makeup effects are hideous but nasty and there are multiple sadistic implications like an aggressive hitandrun scene and various dismemberment. Donald Murphy's psychotic and madraving character Oliver Frankenstein is sheer opposite to the boneheaded and typically 50's teenagers who like to play tennis and dance to atrocious song. Truly one of the most epic trashcamp movies ever made. Recommended to the right audiences.".

The issue is other than the fact that these alleged teens look like they are past college age that it becomes completely obvious that one of the girls swearing she saw a monster is actually the haggard looking creature going in and out of monster makeup as if she was the daughter of the werewolf not Frankenstein. Here Sandra Knight is really the doctor's niece and somehow his experiments have impacted her. The presence of creepy Donald Murphy reveals that the Frankenstein legacy did not end when Abbott and Costello met the monster as well as Dracula and the Werewolf and when somehow Murphy is cured the very buxom Sally Todd becomes the next patient to get the big bolts on her neck. The film is extremely silly throughout with Knight and her boyfriend John Archer trying to figure out what is going on and at one point the bikinimask clad Knight being shot at by the police while she runs around trash cans like a duck in a shooting gallery. As the film goes on Murphy becomes more and more unglued sicking the plaster of Paris covered Todd on intended victims including Knight's uncle. There's a few songs as well one of them sung by silent film actor Harold Lloyd's son Harold Lloyd Jr. playing an annoying friend of Archer's. This results in the usual fiery finale that is only climaxed by a truly ridiculous add on segment involving Lloyd. Films like this played better at the driveins when they came out because audiences weren't paying attention to every detail like they do today. The horrid script is overshadowed by the even more horrendous acting glued cereal like makeup jobs and an attempt at horror that is never even remotely scary.".

Working with him is his assistant Oliver Frank Donald Murphy who has very little regard for either Professor Morton or the experiment he is working on.

So although he works with Professor Morton during the day he secretly uses the laboratory at night to continue the legacy his grandfather by attempting to create life from death. Since he already has a dead body what he now needs is a brain from a subject freshly deceased. Unfortunately he has experienced great difficulty in obtaining one until one night he takes matters into his own hands. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say this movie initially started off rather well. However things fell apart after the introduction of the socalled monster which looked extremely ridiculous for a supposed member of the female gender. Conversely Sandra Knight as Trudy Morton looked quite nice and her presence was definitely most welcome. Regrettably it just wasn't enough. Below average.".

If he use different story I bet he would signed a signature on better movie.Sener Sen was artistic indeed he can play every kind of character with an accomplishment. I got astonished with the performance of Kenan Imirzalioglu. I did not think that he would play successfully bad tempered characters bu he proved that he could. As always Rasim Oztekin did great performance. Performances of Ismail Hacioglu Asli Tandogan and Sleyman Turan were not on the attic I can say that they were distributed in the middle level.Typical from 1970's Turkish movies clich's were used in Kabadayi. There were humor also in the body of the movie. When the action goes on we can hear funny jokes from characters. That makes smoother the story.On the whole Kabadayi is a good movie but do not build your expectations on the peek.".

	schema:reviewBody "After some glorious reviews I was very curious to watch this movie. I must say I was quite disappointed all in all but there were some positive elements as well Sener Sen is fantastic in his performance very convincing and his character truly shines. But that does not save the movie. I thought the main problem was an unfortunate mix of genres which weakened the movie it is supposed to be a drama but there are mainly unintended almost ridiculous slapsticklike scenes or moments in it that makes it like a caricature of itself. Of course drama and comedy can be very close but I am not talking about true comedy here. Slapstick elements in such a serious piece of work just simply ruins it. Since I felt like laughing in some of the supposedly most serious moments the drama in it did not truly catch my full attention. The homosexual character was so exaggerated like a persiflage sympathetic but very calculated jokes then Devran is still talking and saying odd stuff whilst he is almost about to die generally people have very dramatic expressions in there faces once they are shot dead this could be slapstick truly! or the girl's comment about Devrans best male piece not being as big as Murats and Devrans reaction to it slapstick pure! and this unfortunate mixture just took so much away from the movie. I got distracted and even noticed some minor imperfections in editing or logic of sceneswhich I normally don't tend to notice. For example Ali Osman uses Murats mobile phone to call his friend and just presses one button like a repeat call but it is impossible that his friends number is saved in Murats phone as he does not even know him! Karaca is seriously injured by the shooting in the bar she is in hospital etc and suddenly the injury seems to be gone she is back to normal! All of this is a pity as Sener Sen truly shines in his role but alas this is not a solo performance.".

Yavuz Turgul writerdirector of Eskiya is also responsible for this script. However where Eskiya managed to convey serious social messages within a rousing tale of violence and its consequences Kabadayi never rises above the level of a second rate Hong Kong tale of revenge. Kenan Imirzalioglu a reliable if limited leading man overacts to the point of caricature as the villain of the piece Devran. A number of stalwarts of modern Turkish cinema bravely try to inject some individuality into their clichd characters without success. Young leads Ismail Hacioglu Murat and Asli Tandogan Karaca look good but act with the vivacity of a couple of shop window mannequins that were given temporary lives. Editing is a disaster and the script appears to have run away from its writer to be completed during the shoot. There is plenty of unintended comedy  especially during the final climax If it weren't preceded with fanfare that raised expectations and invited obvious comparisons to Eskiya one of the most involving Turkish films of recent times the disappointment would not have been that great. As it stands the film is a disgrace on all fronts. Comparisons to works of Coppola and Scorsese would have been insulting if they weren't so outrageously comical. 110.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know the subject line is very much pretentious. I must tell this two movies The Godfather and Kabadayi have two completely different stories yet they both are about tough guys. I've chosen this subject because Kabadayi holds the same place in Turkish cinema what The Gotfather holds in Hollywood.Before I tell you a little summary of the plot let me explain what Kabadayi means arknn buras turistler iin. I think English word for Kabadayi is rowdy but I'm not absolutely sure of that since it holds some cultural meaning in Turkey too. Nowadays we all know the mafia is everywhere. They do all the dirty business drug dealing blackmailing and so on. But in the old times they were guys who were called Kabadayi. Those guys were big brothers of the neighborhood they solve the problems among people in their own way but they were honest and kind. They also support the poor and the weak.You might call them sort of Robin Hood that is actually mentioned in the movie ironically.Ali Osman played by Sener Sen is a Kabadayi. He's old now taking care of his legal business but still helping the poor and sometimes getting together with old mates who were kabadayis once. They chat and have jokes about good old days. Ali Osman recently suffering from shorttime memory losses. He knows his and his friend's time has passed.One day he learns that his love of life Afetplayed by Selma Kutlu is in deathbed. He hasn't seen her for years but never forgot her. He goes to visit her to learn surprise of a lifetime. She tells Ali Osman that he's got a son from her that he never know.She never told him that before because when they were in love Ali Osman was actually married to another woman whom later died and Ali Osman also lost his other son from his wife  Ali Osman considers all these loses as a punishment of god because he did so many bad things in the past. Afet didn't want to disturb Ali Osman's family life. When she learned her pregnancy AliOsman was in jail she didn't visit him and they never seen each other afterwords. Afet raised her son and told him that his father is Surmeliplayed by RasimOztekin who is actually a gay man who was Afet's helper when she was a famous singer.Ali Osman goes and finds his son Muratplayed by Ismail Hacioglu and tells him that I'm your father your mom just told me that and now she is dying. But Murat is denying his mother and doesn't want to see her let alone his new father. He's working at a barnight club as a DJ together with his amazingly beautiful girlfriend Karacaplayed by Asli Tandogan.Here we're introduced to villain Devran played by Kenan Imirzalioglu. This guy is a full featured modern mafia. Drug dealing blackmailing and taking tribute from nightclubs is his business. We later learn that he's actually serving to much bigger boss while playing doublesided with secret service. The nightclub that Murat works is one of places which Devran wants to take. But real trouble is that Devran loves Murat's girlfriend Karaca like crazy. This love is the key of the movie actually.Devran tries everything to get Karaca will Murat cope with that is there a last clash waiting for Ali Osman before he leaves the underground world ?Well I'm not going to tell you the whole story line by line here I just wanted to give you sense of it. This is actually ground building parts of the movie. Later on it develops quickly and give you as much action as drama.I like the movie mainly because it never makes you think hey this is stupid why heshe did that ?? pointless..... It's plot is very well written. Nothing more nothing less. Characters are quite believable. Cast and acting is awesome. The movie never tries to hide anything and reveal it later to shock you or something like that you just watch it and enjoy it. At first it looks like a clich story but it is very well suited to Turkey's life style and doesn't look awkward. There is even very nice sense of humor placed smartly in the movie piece by piece. Sener Sen Ali Osman giving another great performance supporting cast deserves real appreciation too.One could argue that there are very few battleskirmish scenes as a mafia story I should have said Kabadayi movie  you'll know why when you watch it. And those scenes are not emphasized. I mean guns shooting scenes and blasts could have been much better. The quality of these scenes actually reminded me Eskiya another great movie also featured Sener Sen and Yavuz Turgul. I think director and story writer didn't want the action scenes to steal the movie. That's why those scenes are not very strong except the last slamming scene pls see Osmanli Tokadi.Camera man's work is above the average but at some scenes we see a little bit of raw lighting. Editing is OK long runtime is not a problem here. Story telling is flawless. At no point I lost the story line or felt bored. If you push it hard you can find some small holes like how on earth you cut someone's throat and even one drop of blood doesn't splash on you suit? The movie delves into mafia torture at jails politicians's corruption even the secret service's work. At the end of the movie we learn some interesting stuff like what has driven Devran so out of his mind and he is just the outcome of what have done to him.If you have chance to see it don't miss.Thank you everyone who made or contributed to this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I know the subject line is very much pretentious. I must tell this two movies The Godfather and Kabadayi have two completely different stories yet they both are about tough guys. I've chosen this subject because Kabadayi holds the same place in Turkish cinema what The Gotfather holds in Hollywood.Before I tell you a little summary of the plot let me explain what Kabadayi means arknn buras turistler iin. I think English word for Kabadayi is rowdy but I'm not absolutely sure of that since it holds some cultural meaning in Turkey too. Nowadays we all know the mafia is everywhere. They do all the dirty business drug dealing blackmailing and so on. But in the old times they were guys who were called Kabadayi. Those guys were big brothers of the neighborhood they solve the problems among people in their own way but they were honest and kind.

	schema:reviewBody "Bruno Dumont does not like expressions on people faces. The characters in his films do not act with facial expressions. Instead they move and talk and look around like any real live person might do except with no emotion. This is called minimalism. Dumont directs his actors to portray as minimal emotion reaction sensation as possible. This does not mean he does not take the face into consideration. No no. It is in the face that we can see the person what they have been through how much they might have suffered experienced etc. In fact Dumont chooses faces well. And what Dumont does better than choose the faces of his actors is he creates a sense of emotions internal confusion and unguided motivation in a world that exists solely between the boundaries of our vision and the outermost layer of our eyes. We see this in Flandres.What could and usually is in cinema a way to convey emotions is by framing facial expressions which usually follow orand precede dialogue. Dumont simplifies this process and leaves any emotional identification more up to interpretation and consequently having us rely on our own feelings as viewers to understand the characters depth rather than understanding the characters feelings  for as it seems for Dumont feelings are a rather difficult thing to express.Dumont does this by montage. The main character Demester a weird but thoughtful looking guy is with the girl he does not call his girlfriend Barbe on the day before he leaves to war. They are sitting before a bonfire in the French country side during winter. They are met by the guy who the Barbe recently met at a bar Blondel a pretty looking boy. Barbe and Blondel have sex right away in the parking lot. Demester watches this happen but does not react. Both Blondel and Demester are going to war and will be in the same brigade. Barbe is sitting between them. They simultaneously lay back in the grass. Barbe takes turns kissing them leaning from one side to Demester then to Blondel telling them how much she will miss them both. Demester sits up. He stares off in the distance detached from the situation. After seeing his blank face for a while we cut to a silhouette of a tree in the distance with the flat and frozen winter country in the background. The tree has no leaves it's branches reach out wildly in all directions. A few moments pass. And cut.Sex in Dumont's films is often brutal and sad and is always short. The girls never appear to get pleasure out of sex and the guy is always mechanical and numb. Demester and Barbe walk silently for some time to an isolated grassy area where they do not kiss Barbe only pulls down her pants and says do you want me? at which point Demester gets on top of Barbe. It is as though the characters in Dumont's films are simplified to their basic animal needs and that sex is the only means to some deeper connection. In The Life of Jesus the main boy and his girl are often in the background of a scene kissing at a slugs pace with no elevation of excitement receiving no reaction from friends nearby frozen in a suction like mouth to mouth. Likewise in a scene in Humanity sex is shot from a wide angle in a long take revealing the banality of the act.Shots of repetitive motions often last for awkwardly moments. As Demester is plowing though a field  he is a farmhand  with a tractor a close up of the blades slicing through mud and dirt underline the mere ugliness and mechanical repetitive nature of things. Shots and repetition like this persist in all Dumont's films. In The Life of Jesus it is the sight and sounds of the Scooters the monotone kissing of the young couple and in Humanity it is the legs of a man riding a bike among others which the viewer is forced to watch obsessively.Above all Dumont is a moralist however subtle. He shows us the thoughtlessness of our actions. Flandres is in short about a guy who does not know if he loves a girl. He leaves to war and there he rapes kills witnesses killing leaves behind a fellow soldier in order to save himself gets lost and is himself nearly killed in a few situations. His life is spared not by any of his good deeds for there are few instead his life is spared by none other than blind luck. He is not special. He is just lucky. And after having returned home to his little simple life in the French countryside unable to verbalize this experiences to Barbe the only words he is able to conjure up after some difficulty is I love you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether you like the films of Bruno Dumont or not one thing is certain  you never forget them. Films such as La Vie de Jesus and L'Humanit have an elemental power that challenge us to confront the sickness of the soul that comes from denying our capacity to be and act human. Dumont's latest film Flanders winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2006 has the same acute powers of observation slow and careful revelation of character and insight into the human condition that characterized his first two films. Like La Vie de Jesus Flanders is a film that deals with sexual and racial tension and marginal young people whose lives mirror the emptiness of the rural countryside in which the film is set.The first two words of the film are the f word and the s word which set the tone for what is to follow. Demester Samuel Boidin a burly local works on a farm and is having a passionless relationship with Barbe Adlaide Leroux a girl from a neighboring farm. True to Dumont's oeuvre sex is joyless and mechanical and neither partner expresses affection. There is little dialogue and no musical score only sounds of nature the clumping of boots through the forest and the grunting and pumping that suggest the sex act. The expressions on the faces of the characters are as vacant as the surrounding countryside and no director in the world can better convey a sense of pervasive emptiness than Bruno Dumont.At a local pub Demester matteroffactly denies that he and Barbe are a couple prompting Barbe to react by going off with a stranger Blondel Henri Cretel to have sex and it soon becomes apparent that she has a reputation in the village for promiscuity. Demester and Blondel's fate will intertwine however. Both are in the same regiment called up to fight an unnamed war in a distant country that looks like the North Africa of Claire Denis'Beau Travail. It is not clear if the fighting is meant to reflect the War in Iraq the French adventure in Algeria or perhaps a European war yet to be fought. When the soldiers arrive they walk through a trench possibly a vision of World War I in Flanders field immortalized in the poem by Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae a legacy of the terrible battle in the Ypres salient in the spring of 1915.Dumont shows us war in its ultimate depravity including rape murder of children castration and other brutalities. It is as if years of the soldier's sexual tensions and lack of emotional connection has exploded in a callous way reflective of the torture of Iraqi's at Abu Ghraib. As his buddies die one by one at the hands of darkskinned guerilla fighters it becomes obvious that Demester will not lift a finger to save or protect them a witness to his inability to access what FDR used to call that quiet invisible thing called conscience. As the guerilla fighting in the streets and houses intensify there is a war going on at home also. Barbe becomes pregnant and has a mental breakdown that lands her in a psychiatric hospital. Soon the war will be fought on two fronts.Flanders has been called an antiwar film but the war seems to take place mostly on an internal level. It is expressionistic and poetic a film that unfolds as if in a dreamscape that has no past present or future. You cannot appreciate Flanders by thinking about it but only by feeling it viscerally in your blood. After showing mankind at its most vile in order to in the director's own words relieve us of those urges Dumont grants us a catharsis. Like unemployed uneducated and epileptic 20year old Freddy in La Vie de Jesus whose vision of the sun after a brutal murder heralded an awakening in his barn after the war's end Demester recognizes the truth of the gaping wounds in his own soul and opens himself to the possibility of grace.".

	schema:headline " Genuinely challenging let down by a slight lack of coherence";
	schema:reviewBody "It's clear from other reviews that more or less everybody is agreed about the director's rather tricksy filmmaking and the lack of conventional narrative drive. It's just a question of whether you think these things make for a good film or a bad film.For me the good outweighs the bad the deliberately nonemotional characterization slow pace and powerful use of landscape push viewers out of their comfort zone and force us to confront some pretty basic realities about life and war.It's the parallels  not the contrasts  between home life and the war that are most interesting. On many occasions the film seems to have a deliberately timeless ahistorical feel so that the characters feel tremendously elemental the word medieval springs to mind too in their behaviours and concerns. Despite a slight lack of coherence not necessarily in the plot more in the overall conception we do genuinely somehow care for the characters  quite an achievement given the overall tone of the movie.The use of Flanders as the setting and title reinforces this sense of historical continuity of war recurring down through the ages  not for nothing is the region known as the cockpit of Europe. And by the way a big chunk of historical Flanders is now in France the Frenchplated cars with 59 indicating the North department which includes most of French Flanders are a giveaway. French Flanders is by definition not in Belgium as one reviewer has suggested. However one of the female characters Barbe's friend appears to have a strong Flemish i.e. Dutchspeaking accent  a nice touch and not entirely implausible in this border region where a few people still speak Flemish on the French side of the border visit Hondschoote and you'll see what I mean.This film should make everybody rethink their approach to war and the impact of sending young men and women although not in this film from more or less every generation off to fight and die remember that Flanders was scarred by war twice in a lifetime in the 20th century. Not necessarily a particularly easy watch on the face of it but a powerful and worthwhile one.".

It's just a question of whether you think these things make for a good film or a bad film.For me the good outweighs the bad the deliberately nonemotional characterization slow pace and powerful use of landscape push viewers out of their comfort zone and force us to confront some pretty basic realities about life and war.It's the parallels  not the contrasts  between home life and the war that are most interesting. On many occasions the film seems to have a deliberately timeless ahistorical feel so that the characters feel tremendously elemental the word medieval springs to mind too in their behaviours and concerns. Despite a slight lack of coherence not necessarily in the plot more in the overall conception we do genuinely somehow care for the characters  quite an achievement given the overall tone of the movie.The use of Flanders as the setting and title reinforces this sense of historical continuity of war recurring down through the ages  not for nothing is the region known as the cockpit of Europe. And by the way a big chunk of historical Flanders is now in France the Frenchplated cars with 59 indicating the North department which includes most of French Flanders are a giveaway. French Flanders is by definition not in Belgium as one reviewer has suggested. However one of the female characters Barbe's friend appears to have a strong Flemish i.e. Dutchspeaking accent  a nice touch and not entirely implausible in this border region where a few people still speak Flemish on the French side of the border visit Hondschoote and you'll see what I mean.This film should make everybody rethink their approach to war and the impact of sending young men and women although not in this film from more or less every generation off to fight and die remember that Flanders was scarred by war twice in a lifetime in the 20th century. Not necessarily a particularly easy watch on the face of it but a powerful and worthwhile one.";

	schema:headline " Powerful return to form for Dumont";
	schema:reviewBody "In a way Bruno Dumont's Flandres is no more realistic than Cuarn's Children of Men. It doesn't exactly seek to depict real people or a real war. Dumont's people are laconic but the powerful filmmaking tells a clear and moving story. Using simple economical means and focusing on a few individuals presenting scenes that follow a logical universal progression Flandres is able to tell a profound story about war's ravages at home and on the front. Dumont's storytelling is simple and sure. So is the cinematography of Yves Cape and the editing of Guy Lacorne. And so is the acting especially of Samuel Boidin as Dmester and of Adlade Leroux as his girlfriend Barbe  but also of Henri Cretel as Dmester's friend Blondel and of JeanMarie Bruveart Briche David Poulain Leclercq Patirce Venant Mordac David Legay  Lieutenant and Inge Decaesteker France.The film focuses on a young farmer and his girlfriend. He and some other locals are going off to war. Last sex last drinks with friends last campfire gatherings last work in the field with a tractor.Then the departure roll call near a truck a few people waving goodbye. Next Dmester is in the desert. In an attempt to take a building a scene we know well through documentary news footage from Iraq one of their officers is blown up. A helicopter takes away the body. They enter the building and kill a couple of youthful partisans  fighters clearly but also mere pitiful boys.Each of the scenes is iconic and vivid. This is lowbudget war but it feels real enough. How big is the budget of a few men fighting out in the bush? There are tanks and explosions aplenty. Most of all there is sweat and dust and blood. Two other things happen. The squad captures a woman fighter and some of the men rape her. Later on a hillside they trap a farmer on a donkey loaded with firewood and they shoot him. They are subsequently captured by members of the enemy who are North Africanbut their dialogue isn't translated and they could be Iraqis who know what they have done and they are severely punished.Meanwhile Andr's Dmester's girlfriend Barbe at home grows more and more unstable and after a violent psychotic break she is hospitalized but later released.Andr escapes with his friend Blondel but when Blondel's shot he runs off to save himself.Dumont uses the inarticulate country talk of the people to underline the universality of the events. How did Blondel die his girlfriend wants to know later? Balle dans la tte Dmester says a bullet in the head. That's all he wants to say and all we need to know. Dmester is a brute in a way. But he's also got a sweet smile. He's childlike. He is the child sent off to kill that all war builds upon.Next we see Dmester back home. The final sequences convey how damaged he and his girlfriend and his friend's girlfriend are now. Andr suffers from survivor guilt. Their state is pitiful but the last shot is positive. Andr is lying on the dirt with Barbe and telling her over and over Je t'aime...je t'aime. I love you.This is classic Dumont style if on a bolder and grander scale than before. His people are none the less noble pathetic and human for being reduced to simplicity even crudity. Dumont has told a story as energetic and forwarddriven as the Dardennes brothers' L'Infant but more universal and even more concise 91 rather than 100 minutes. As in Dumont's L'Humanit and La Vie de Jsus there's a grandeur that emerges from the strippeddown minimal scenes and people. Everything works. It's surprising that Variety's usually canny reviewer made it sound dull and offputting. There is still resistance to Dumont's style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flandres won the grand prize at Cannes so somebody must have liked it. I didn't much. The film takes a depressed and depressing look at the life of a French peasant who becomes a soldier in a nameless war somewhere in the Mideast. At the beginning of the movie we see him doing farm chores wandering around the muddy barnyard with a pig a heavyhanded metaphor Eisenstein would have loved and having Hobbesian sex with his girlfriend nasty brutish and short possibly the least erotic scene of consensual sex ever filmed. Later he denies that they are a couple so she takes revenge by immediately going off with another man. Good for her and too bad she can't stay away from this brute.Both of the heroine's lovers are drafted and sent to some faraway desert land where they join a small platoon. The men know nothing about the war and seem to care less. They fight when they have to and some of them including our hero rape a lone woman when they get the chance. The woman turns out to be a rebel officer and when the men are captured she has one of them castrated and shot. He turns out not to be one of the men who raped her. No justice here just chance and random cruelty  we get the point.Our hero eventually escapes after leaving the girl's other lover who is wounded to be killed by the rebels. Not that any heroism on his part would have helped they would merely both have been killed. He has been moved enough by his experience to mutter I love you as they have sex again. This time the sex is just as boorish but the sun is shining and the girl has an air of resignation rather than frustration.The film is well made in a minimalist sort of way for which its director has been much praised. However I felt that the points have been made before and more effectively. I also thought I detected a whiff of condescension the Paris intellectual looking down his fine long nose at the dirty peasants and their humdrum lives devoid of any real consciousness. I don't personally think that's fair.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure how Flanders came to my attention but I am certainly glad that I had the opportunity to see it and I intend to seek out more of director Dumont's work. The film takes a cold hard look at nature of humanity love and war. The work of Bresson and his effective use of nonprofessional actors came to mind for me.War is brutal. People are capable of doing very bad things in the name of love and war as this film so well demonstrates. I was disgusted by Blackhawk Down when it was released to feed the blood lust in the run up to the war in Iraq. I found Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan dishonest. The pro war message of that film was much stronger than any anti war theme it presented. If the old and wealthy had to fight wars instead of the young there would be a hell of a lot fewer wars.Dumont's view of humanity is not very positive nor is his view of war. People are not very caring and are capable of evil. Sending people to kill others is not a glorious thing. I'm tired of being told war is hell and that things like the killing of women and children and the torture and killing of POWs is the cost of doing war and has always been done.The characters in Flanders seem appropriately dead to their own existence and that of others. Dumont's visuals add to the sense of a brutal inhospitable world. His is an effective and affectless view of the world as I experience it as a kind of a horror show. I recently heard a statistic that in addition to the 54000 soldiers we lost in combat in Vietnam 200000 veterans have committed suicide. I'm not sure how accurate that is but the stories I am hearing about the physical psychological and mental trauma to the troops returning from Iraq makes war seem a luxury humankind cannot afford. I am grateful that for this work by Bruno Dumont. It is not an easy film to watch but it is I think an important one.".

	schema:headline " Another Lighthearted Fable From Bruno Dumont";
	schema:reviewBody "Pusan Film Festival Reviews 3 Flanders Bruno Dumont Dumont provides the downer of the festival as three rural farm fellows sign up to go to war in an unnamed Muslim country. Back at home the town slut pines over the two she was having sex with and eventually has a mental breakdown. Thousands of miles away the boys find their squad decimated and the survivors drifting around the desert raping local women looting and shooting kids. It all makes one wonder what Dumont is getting at  the director has a background in philosophy but chooses to center his films on inarticulate neanderthal types but to illustrate what? The film is certainly powerful and Dumont can pull a great tour de force but there's a deep strain of nihilism that runs through each of his films that I find distasteful. The director draws parallels between life on the farm where a couple of the lads have a turn rutting the pretty local girl who unflinchingly gives herself to them and their war outpost where they drag a woman out of her house and take turns with her in a kind of redneck hoorah.

	onyx:emotionText "Pusan Film Festival Reviews 3 Flanders Bruno Dumont Dumont provides the downer of the festival as three rural farm fellows sign up to go to war in an unnamed Muslim country. Back at home the town slut pines over the two she was having sex with and eventually has a mental breakdown. Thousands of miles away the boys find their squad decimated and the survivors drifting around the desert raping local women looting and shooting kids. It all makes one wonder what Dumont is getting at  the director has a background in philosophy but chooses to center his films on inarticulate neanderthal types but to illustrate what? The film is certainly powerful and Dumont can pull a great tour de force but there's a deep strain of nihilism that runs through each of his films that I find distasteful. The director draws parallels between life on the farm where a couple of the lads have a turn rutting the pretty local girl who unflinchingly gives herself to them and their war outpost where they drag a woman out of her house and take turns with her in a kind of redneck hoorah. But Dumont is almost comically lacking in any kind of warmth good graces or humor and his relentlessly bleak view of an animalistic humanity gets to be too much. At least The Optimists made me laugh.";

Any of you who saw 'The Life of Jesus''97 andor 'Humanity''99 can expect much of the same in terms of style and to a certain extent themes as well. This is by no means an easy film to watch the war scenes shot in Tunisia are at times just dreadful. And even the storyline which takes place in Flandres in the north of France where Dumont is from and his first two films are set is full of emotional pain. A very French film but not of the condescending intellectual sort but rather of the realistic naturalistic and yes minimalistic variety. To be seen on the big screen for full effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Truly one of the worst films I have ever had the intense displeasure of watching. Bruno Dumont and his hyperminimalist style is an affront to anyone who takes film seriously. What he does is to remove everything that makes cinema work acting dialogue music editing visual language. He reduces what I think could be an engaging story to a pseudodocumentarist look at characters that I ultimately don't give a sh about! You see that's what happens when you refuse to use any of the tools of the trade to form a connection with your audience you don't get one. In the rape scene where Demester and his friends come upon an Arab girl and gangrape her I didn't feel anything. When Demester leaves his friend to die i didn't feel anything. And when Demester returns home and tells his for lack of a better word girlfriend that he loves her I didn't feel anything. That's what I took away from the film Nothing except of course the overwhelming feeling of having wasted an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back. I won't deny that Dumont has an eye for images. His montagetechnique is quite good although his belief that it can carry an entire movie is preposterous to say the very least. Especially the first ten minutes of the film demonstrate this. However because it never moves beyond that I can never quite bring myself to care about what happens to the characters. If you like minimalism which I'm not opposed to by principle I suggest to check out film by Carlos Reygadas or some of the Italian masters. At least save yourself having to sit through 90 minutes of some pseudointellectuals director's formalistic experiments. Shun it! Shun it as you would a rabid dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flandres is a depiction of what happens when simple people are placed into complicated situations it is a quite shocking although stirring warset drama which is more about the tragedy of how human beings can slump to the depths we're able than it is about the tragedy of war itself. The folk in the film are unassuming uncreative and with little to say nor do during their days in an undetermined mostly rural French speaking nation the sorts of scenarios they eventually come to find themselves in are very much the opposite  the film playing out like a perverse circus of what happens when a test gerbil is placed in an environment it has littletonohope of conquering and all for our viewing displeasure as we sit back and witness the experiment.People in Flandres make love without emotion they live life without empathy and find it difficult to react to levels of deplorable violence. It is to this extent that Bruno Dumont's film is more a burning nihilistic drama than a war film per se a film that weeps for mankind a film depicting a desensitisation that the species has for love violence fellow man and attitudes towards life. The film follows a young man named Andr Boidin an ugly man a simple man a farmer in the wooded plains of what could be France what might be Belgium or what might even be somewhere as seemingly disassociated and arbitrary as Luxembourg. Farm life is routine it snows in the winter and a lot of walking is generally required in a zone cut off from urbanised living. These people other farmers and the young females living in close proximity rarely speak with whatever communication required between them done so via glances and meagre actions. Since there is nary an awful lot that needs getting done in the first place it is all that these people need to amass in their communication in order to get things done. So rarely do things happen in the lives of these people that a crude seemingly random sexual relationship between Andr and young Barbe Leroux strikes us as almost illegitimate.It is on one of these days that one of Andr's few friends relays to him that he will be going off to war in the near future. In their leaning up against a barn wall while appearing to systematically stare off into the distance beyond a nearby gate at what's beyond we sense that this might very well be a jump for this character greater than it might be for others nary do these people treads beyond into the wider unknown and what has just been spoken of would be a drastic change. Sure enough Dumont's cut from the ice cold European territory to the flat arid deserts of this unspecified place engulfed in a war between Europeans and Arabs is the sort of jump in composition that can only emphasise this.Andr has clambered aboard in the drafting process the idea that where they're headed is the unknown and the ambiguity surrounding what the war is for as well as you might say the specific name of the country is supposed to encapsulate most of what's going on in the Middle East as Caucasians from most nations vie with locals in a place of which they've probably not previously heard for surface means of which they think they're aware. Trying to work out where exactly the warzone is acts as a pleasing distraction once all the warset nastiness kicks off where the clear inflection is Iraq or Afghanistan Dumont appears to tie in the jungles of somewhere like North Korea to add to the idea this foreign war might just as well be anywhere. The wartime sequences are as harrowing as any from most war films while the film itself is often constructed as if not even a war film in the first place but some sort of survival horror piece wherein folk have wondered into a Hellish bloodbath where one can only how did Mr. Blonde put it in Reservoir Dogs? Pray for a quick death you aren't going to get.Dumont doffs his cap to the likes of Full Metal Jacket with a sequence involving a sniper a confrontation which eventually leads onto the encountering of a child soldier and the nastiness which comes with that. His greatest achievement however is how he constructs this idea of life on the homestead and life at war being more intrinsically linked than one might think  principally the merciless disregard for young life in the executing of these child soldiers as well as the domestic termination of an unborn as well as the desire to instigate casual sexual intercourse with the women of where one happens to find one's self. This whole idea of white Western men few of whom are bright in the first place arriving on the shores of what is otherwise a stark change in climate and way of life in the form of a foreign country before instigating their attitudes and ways of life upon what's around them also feels apparent if not the primary focus. With a steady eye for agonised detail Flandres is the painful piece of cinema I wasn't expecting heading in  its topical nature combined with its grizzled aesthetic demonstrates a real talent at work while the experience as a whole stays with you for some considerable time all of which adds up to something worth tracking down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps when we were raping her we looked at her as a woman. But when we killed her we just thought of her as a pig.  Unknown SoldierBruno Dumont preaches to the converted with Flanders a film which merges Brian De Palma's Casualties of War with Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.The film's first act takes place in a monotonous world of rural villages and lifeless arable land. Using static shots Dumont spotlights various listless expressionless characters. Significantly when energy is expended it is only to have sex. Dumont's cast resemble livestock as they copulate in the mud.Like Kubrick and De Palma conflict stems first from the phallus. Here a Belgian farmhand called Andre has sex with a local girl called Barbe. It's a pathetic act a moment where animal drives and emotions confusingly conflate. Afterwards they're left unfulfilled the social and biochemical allure of sex giving way to something more banal. It is only when Barbe sleeps with another man in her village that Andre reassess his relationship with her. We don't yet realise it but revenge fantasies and feelings of psychosexual humiliation are bubbling in Andre's head. Now aware that Barbe is desired by others and that he has no claim over her Andre acquires a newfound desire to conquer dominate and spread his seed. The film cuts to an unnamed Middle Eastern country the playground of Andre's psyche. Here he witnesses men killing children and soldier's forcing themselves upon a young woman a scene which echoes not only De Palma's war as rape narratives but Kubrick's symbolic snipers and hookers. Andre then witnesses the raped woman's vengeful response. Back home Barbe is aborting a baby.The film's final act is where it breaks free of most war movie conventions. Andre returns from war not traumatised but with a newfound sense of humanity. Realizing the dark contours of his desires his own libidinal drives Andre sees Barbe for the first time in a new light. Whilst throughout the film everyone views Barbe as a whore he sees her now as something else. Film's first words st and fk. Film's last words I love you. Like Dumont's Humanity Flanders paints an exodus away from the corporeal the bestial the crude wants of the flesh and toward what at first seemed like a spiritual impossibility. The film's title alludes to the killing fields of World War 1 but its imagery conjures up modern images of Iraq Afghanistan and various American Crusades across Latin America and the Middle East. Scenes in which soldiers travel on horseback evoke the legacies of Western expansion.Typical of Dumont the film is a work of extreme minimalism. Every action gesture shot movement and line of dialogue is stripped down to an almost Bressonian essence. Only the essential remains. Viewers unwilling to read the film's whispers will find nothing to hold their interest. Some have said that the film is contemptuous and disgusted by humanity. This is not true. One can argue however that Dumont like most New French Extremists hates his medium. That he holds the belief that cinema can convey truths only by first rejecting the medium's aesthetic possibilities and gifts for enchantment. The film's distancing effects thus feel smug and selfcongratulatory.Sexual drives and issues of warrape tend to be left out of most war films despite sex being at the core of most violence as I write this it has been learnt that hundreds of Sri Lankan women were raped by soldiers during the 2009 Civil War a fact which the local government subsequently covered up similar things continue in Iraq. Rape is a form of transgenerational revenge and punishment. It is an extension of misogyny the genocide mentality the wish to extinguish the enemy and feelings of nationalistic superiority. The undermining of the enemy's familial social and national bonds by humiliating females by creating lifetime scars in women's bodies and minds and by socially stigmatising the enemy does not only comprise psychological warfare but is a direct extension of the gun and the phallus. In a patriarchal society each rape symbolises not only abject defeat but the impotence of the Other male or female now rendered submissive. The term rape is also used to denote the occupation of a territory or a town e.g. the rape of Nanjing and has even leaked into the computer gaming vocabulary of children raping opponents. Feminist explanations of sexual torture stress that men abuse power and engage in games of sexual dominance humiliating and subjugating women etc as a means of reinforcing their masculine identities. Under such assumptions men stripped of civilisational inhibitions reveal their inner desires with and during warraping. This view is supported by the fact that the vast majority of rapists in war are not mentally disturbed. They are 'normal' men drafted or volunteers. But while it is true that male sexuality is potentially more aggressive than female sexuality also in times of peace one must realise that this aggressiveness is cultivated and intensified through the institutional misogyny of the military establishment and exploited during racist wars. Under such circumstances many more men rape even those who would never consider raping a woman during normal times. Here the responsibility for atrocities lies with leaders who engender or outright sanction such acts. Flanders is far too esoteric and will alienate those most requiring its message. Dumont fails to capture the sparse spirituality of a Tarkovsky Bresson or Antonioni despite channelling such a tone well with L' Humanit. The film is somewhat derivative of Full Metal Jacket a film which better conveys the sheer misogyny of bootcamp and after and which better points to the future landscape of wars a world of humane clean kills sexism murder and racism rationalised away by brainwashed men and women as ethics administered via trigger.7.910  Worth two viewings.".

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps when we were raping her we looked at her as a woman. But when we killed her we just thought of her as a pig.  Unknown SoldierBruno Dumont preaches to the converted with Flanders a film which merges Brian De Palma's Casualties of War with Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.The film's first act takes place in a monotonous world of rural villages and lifeless arable land. Using static shots Dumont spotlights various listless expressionless characters. Significantly when energy is expended it is only to have sex. Dumont's cast resemble livestock as they copulate in the mud.Like Kubrick and De Palma conflict stems first from the phallus. Here a Belgian farmhand called Andre has sex with a local girl called Barbe. It's a pathetic act a moment where animal drives and emotions confusingly conflate. Afterwards they're left unfulfilled the social and biochemical allure of sex giving way to something more banal. It is only when Barbe sleeps with another man in her village that Andre reassess his relationship with her. We don't yet realise it but revenge fantasies and feelings of psychosexual humiliation are bubbling in Andre's head. Now aware that Barbe is desired by others and that he has no claim over her Andre acquires a newfound desire to conquer dominate and spread his seed. The film cuts to an unnamed Middle Eastern country the playground of Andre's psyche. Here he witnesses men killing children and soldier's forcing themselves upon a young woman a scene which echoes not only De Palma's war as rape narratives but Kubrick's symbolic snipers and hookers. Andre then witnesses the raped woman's vengeful response. Back home Barbe is aborting a baby.The film's final act is where it breaks free of most war movie conventions.

I seriously don't know where to start with what's wrong with this title maybe because there's nothing really right about it save for one single subplot set...in a war either in Afghanistan or Iraq see we don't know which war it is involving Belgian soldiers and a female enemy combatant.

Now from a technical point of view whoever recorded and mixed the sound probably won't find another production to work on in the next 20 years. Also I thought about it real hard but I couldn't come up with a rational explanation as to why the producers thought it would be a good idea not to have ANY music in this film. Especially given the fact that there's a huge gap created by the severe lack of dialog in there. Moreover...since when do Flemish people speak French? This would cause a riot in Flanders. And how is it that a bunch of soldiers are left on their own in IraqAfghanistan without any supervision or contact with their base andor commanders? Where are the PEOPLE? Military operations are conducted in strategic spots e.g. populated areas...so why do we have one bad guy popping randomly out of nowhere every once in a while? And the military using horses alongside tanks and Hummers? You can't be serious.

	schema:reviewBody "Good picture and efficiently made by Robert Aldrich in which a bunch of twofisted characters confront deadly on a survival game during postWWII . An intense portrayal of elite soldiers who have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world  disarming bombs in the heat of Berlin . It depicts a microcosm of a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst a violent aftermath . At the end of the Second World War six German exsoldiers return to Berlin and set up as a bomb disposal group to carry out their dangerous assignments and a subsequent bet . They are led by Karl Wirtz Jeff Chandler in a strange villain character  a selfish renegade for who the thrill of the dismantlement seems to be the ultimate goal regardless of the safety of his fellow team members  Karl's true role reveals itself in a way that will change each man forever .

They  then  agree a wager  If a man dies in the course of the job  his share is to be divided among the others and if only one survives he takes it all . As two tons of buried bomb and now two men must pit their lives against its treacherous fuse  two artificiers who had only one thing in common  the same woman Martine Carol .This is an exciting blockbuster about to explode dealing with German demolition workers after WWWII  in which there are thrills  intrigue  suspense  sometimes stirring scenes and a loving triangle between ChandlerMartine CarolPalance . A fulltilt intriguing picture in which director Aldrich turns the discipline of action filmmaking into a kind of visceral visual poetry . Thus  this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of German history  showing an interesting studio of engaging characters  too . While the members face their own internal issues  they have to make safe the place and to be aware of any person at the bomb sites . This is a flick where role development plays second fiddle to inbuilt intrigue as well as emotion  concerning a similar plot to subsequently Oscarized The hurt lock 2008 by Kathryn Bigelow  in which some armorers to defuse bombs  make safe location and people  however some of who may be bombers themselves . It was realized by the British HammerSeven Arts Company presided by Michael Carreras  made by American Aldrich and being filmed on location in a destroyed Berlin and with Brits  French  German and American players in the cast . It stars by Jeff Chandler and Jack Palance as bomb disposal experts  both of whom give excellent performances . As Jeff Chandler slowly reveals the strength  confidence  unpredictability and finally badness of his role . Jack Palance enjoys himself throughly in a rare character . This motion picture of mixed origins was well directed  here Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction . However  director Aldrich had his name taken off the credits as Producer because the studio cut a halfhour out of the picture without telling him  and he believed that unless they put that footage back in  the film made no sense . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s  and made his first feature in 1953 Big Leaguer  1953 . Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films  collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . Robert shot various different actors in Oscarnominated performances  Victor Buono  Bette Davis  Agnes Moorehead  Ian Bannen  Jack Palance and John Cassavetes . Two of Aldrich's movies  Veracruz 1954 and Deadly kiss 1955 are now considered to be among the most influential films of the 1950s . He was an expert on warlike genre Dirty Dozen  The Angry Hills  Attack  Ten seconds to hell and Western The Frisko kid  Ulzana's raid  Apache  Veracruz  The last sunset . Rating  Above average  it's a must see and a standout in its genre .".

This is a flick where role development plays second fiddle to inbuilt intrigue as well as emotion  concerning a similar plot to subsequently Oscarized The hurt lock 2008 by Kathryn Bigelow  in which some armorers to defuse bombs  make safe location and people  however some of who may be bombers themselves . It was realized by the British HammerSeven Arts Company presided by Michael Carreras  made by American Aldrich and being filmed on location in a destroyed Berlin and with Brits  French  German and American players in the cast . It stars by Jeff Chandler and Jack Palance as bomb disposal experts  both of whom give excellent performances . As Jeff Chandler slowly reveals the strength  confidence  unpredictability and finally badness of his role . Jack Palance enjoys himself throughly in a rare character . This motion picture of mixed origins was well directed  here Robert Aldrich gave a tense and brilliant direction . However  director Aldrich had his name taken off the credits as Producer because the studio cut a halfhour out of the picture without telling him  and he believed that unless they put that footage back in  the film made no sense . Aldrich began writing and directing for TV series in the early 1950s  and made his first feature in 1953 Big Leaguer  1953 . Soon thereafter he established his own production company and produced most of his own films  collaborating in the writing of many of them . Directed in a considerable plethora of genres but almost all of his films contained a subversive undertone . Robert shot various different actors in Oscarnominated performances  Victor Buono  Bette Davis  Agnes Moorehead  Ian Bannen  Jack Palance and John Cassavetes . Two of Aldrich's movies  Veracruz 1954 and Deadly kiss 1955 are now considered to be among the most influential films of the 1950s . He was an expert on warlike genre Dirty Dozen  The Angry Hills  Attack  Ten seconds to hell and Western The Frisko kid  Ulzana's raid  Apache  Veracruz  The last sunset . Rating  Above average  it's a must see and a standout in its genre .";

I had no idea what it was about. But I was curious about a Hammer film that starred Jack Palance and Jeff Chandler so I decided to rent it. I did not regret it. I at first thought it would be a British crime thriller. Little did I expect it to be a post WW2 drama about a group of former German soldiers in charge of a bomb disposal unit. I won't go any further into the plot since the previous reviewer says most of whats important to know. The first half of this film is a bit slow but then picks up speed and becomes really interesting. It was also interesting to see a reversal in roles for the two leads Jack Palance who usually played villains plays the hero here while Jeff Chandler who usually played heroesplays the heavy in this one.     The one thing that intrigues me about this film is how an American director a mostly American cast ended up making a film produced by a British film company with a British crew shot on locations in Berlin with interiors shot at Berlins UFA studios.".

	schema:reviewBody "The answer to that question is You can't! I saw this film when it first came out in 1959 and I recently had the opportunity to see it again after 49 long years on Turner Classic Movies. I think the thing that makes this film so memorable to me is that the two leading actors Jeff Chandler and Jack Palance were given the opportunity to break the mold so to speak. Chandler who always played the good guy and Palance who always played the bad guy got the opportunity to switch roles. Earlier in their careers Chandler played a Roman Soldier good guy opposite Palance's Attila bad guy in Sign of the Pagan. Chandler appears to be having a ball with the role of Karl Wirtz. His speech about how his Uncle Oscar taught him how to look out for number ono is reminiscent of the Burt Lancaster Joe Erin speech about the man who raised him Ace Hannah and how he double crossed him as well in Vera Cruz. Interstingly enough both films Ten Seconds To Hell and Vera Cruz were both directed by Robert Aldrich. The film's plot is about a German Bomb Disposal Unit working for the British after WWII which make a pact that the survivors will split the spoils of their labor after the job is finished. The texture and mood of the black and white film adds to the suspense of the film. One of both Chandler and Palance's best films.".

Along the years Katadreuffe is bullied at school and called bastard by his mates and his mother never talks to him. One day he is involved by other kids in a theft of bread and arrested by the police.

	schema:reviewBody "How is it possible for a boy whose parents are devoid of normal humanity to grow up to be loved and respected? The film Character presents a credible demonstration. It has the darkness of Ingmar Bergman or Charles Dickens is slowmoving thoroughly engrossing and it left me emotionally drained which always elicits a high rating from me.Dreverhaven is apparently an evil man a bailiff who is quite willing to evict people in a terrible storm. He embodies two Nietzschean concepts 1.the will to power he entered into power struggles with anyone whom he felt he could dominate and 2. that a life becomes better by becoming stronger through adversity he did everything in his power to bring adversity to his son believing that that would strengthen himand in many ways it did. His internal struggle between the will to power over his son and his desire to strengthen him is the prime mover of the film his son's reactions to that are the core. Dreverhaven is also totally fearless the question arises whether it is caused by bravery or just being tired of life.The film opens with his son Jacob Katadreuffe Fedja van Hut coming home all bloody only to be arrested as a suspect in the murder of Dreverhaven. He then tells the two interrogators a most amazing story. Since he is describing his own life one might suspect that he is embellishing the story in his own favour but I believe that he was totally candid. The story is too complex to dwell on but certain aspects must be mentioned. Jacob's mother Joba Betty Schuurman was a servant to Dreverhaven. On one and only one occasion he may have raped her it is not made clear if she resisted. As soon as she discovered that she was pregnant she left him and tried to sever all ties. For a long time however Dreverhaven repeatedly proposed marriage and was refused. His motivation is ambiguous propriety or affection and Joba was apparently determined not to allow Dreverhaven to beat her in a power struggle. Because of his Mother's silence young Jacob believed that she did not like him and being a pariah because he was illegitimate he turned to books for solace. Through this he developed a love of learning and a willingness to work hard and he advanced rapidly in a law firm winning the respect and admiration of most of his colleagues especially De Gankelaar Victor Lw who hired him. De Gankelaar a man with a huge underbite and a heart to match became Jacob's mentor adviser and protector.Denied access to his son Dreverhaven began a game of terror against Jacob through legal channels. The film is a study of character and characters. Their motivations are subtly hidden by consistent and superb acting. In my attempts to understand this dysfunctional family if it can be called a family I was forced to think. The slow movement allowed time for that. I want to see the film again expecting that each viewing will bring a closer understanding. Even the evil Dreverhaven was more an object of pity rather than despicable his actions were caused more by ignorance of human sensitivities a dogmatic respect for the law and an unusual philosophy rather than by malice. The film is openended. What will Jacob do with the rest of his life?".

The story is quite beautiful and Mike van Diem created a very solid screen play based on well known Ferdinand Bordewijk's novel.The film has some extraordinary moments I must say that the one that impressed me most was the final scene of the film a scene of great visual impact and also of an incredibly big narrative content it is the scene that reveals the mystery behind the cruel A.B. Dreverhaven's behaviour.The performances given out in this film are simply spectacular especially Jan Decleir's as Dreverhaven. I also think Betty Schuurman as Jacob's mother and Victor Lw as De Gankelaar are terrific. One more thing the art design is beautiful the image the film gives us of the 1930's Amsterdam is very powerful and very beautiful.Not only is it a great film then but it is a story that carries a lot of feelings and will take you on quiet an emotional ride.

	schema:reviewBody "Many people describe the movie as distant and cold. But that's exactly what the makers were aiming for to stay congruent with the 2 novels of Bordewijk where Karakter  Character is based upon. Bordewijk's style is often described as Nieuwe Zakelijkheid best translation New Objectivity think Sinclair Lewis a counter movement to the upcoming Expressionism in the 20s of the last century. Instead of the idealism of Expressionists more emphasis was put on reality objectivity and facts in a sober and distant form with little room for frivolity superficial beauty sentimentality or explaining behavior. Not only does the style of the novels reflect this the world the characters inhabit has the same characteristics. Viewed from this standpoint they made an amazing adaptation from a novel correct in both style and content. But the movie defines more than an art movement because the characters portrayed tell a lot about the Dutch in general and this in a way also defines Dutch national identity.The story itself is about perseverance. Jacob is the son of a relation without love. His parents never marry the mother leaves soon after she finds out she is pregnant. His mother is stubborn his father a man without compassion working as a bailiff. Both parents push their son in their own way his mother almost drives him out of her home his father lends him money thus starting a battle over the upper hand in their relationship. The father brings adversity to his son in the hope to make him stronger. In line with the style of the novel none of the characters ever experience love. In fact the whole movie contains not one passionate scene. The only character showing emotion De Gankelaar an excellent role played by Victor Lw leaves the country. It has a Nietzschian philosophical angle with the debate of lightness and weight Jacob's burdens give his life a meaning but are the sacrifices worth it? Location scouts did a wonderful job here because Karakter recreates prewar Rotterdam a city almost totally flattened by the Nazis There is a harrowing photo of the city after the bombardments with only the main church still standing. The production and art departments made the sets with their darkish colors fitting the form and content of the movie. The camera is used in a way to create some fluidity in the scenes It almost never is static as with so many character dramas.Fedja van Hut as Jacob and Jan Decleir as Dreverhaven seem to understand what's going on here and act accordingly. Tamar van den Dop as Lorna is probably the greatest weakness in the movie with a terrible diction and limited body movement she's miscast here.Mike van Diem makes only one movie wins an Oscar and disappears almost from the earth. Although rumor has it he does some script doctoring in Hollywood with his current production rate he will surpass even Malick. As for now this is by far the best Dutch movie ever made.".

Bordewijk's style is often described as Nieuwe Zakelijkheid best translation New Objectivity think Sinclair Lewis a counter movement to the upcoming Expressionism in the 20s of the last century. Instead of the idealism of Expressionists more emphasis was put on reality objectivity and facts in a sober and distant form with little room for frivolity superficial beauty sentimentality or explaining behavior. Not only does the style of the novels reflect this the world the characters inhabit has the same characteristics. Viewed from this standpoint they made an amazing adaptation from a novel correct in both style and content. But the movie defines more than an art movement because the characters portrayed tell a lot about the Dutch in general and this in a way also defines Dutch national identity.The story itself is about perseverance. Jacob is the son of a relation without love. His parents never marry the mother leaves soon after she finds out she is pregnant. His mother is stubborn his father a man without compassion working as a bailiff. Both parents push their son in their own way his mother almost drives him out of her home his father lends him money thus starting a battle over the upper hand in their relationship. The father brings adversity to his son in the hope to make him stronger. In line with the style of the novel none of the characters ever experience love. In fact the whole movie contains not one passionate scene. The only character showing emotion De Gankelaar an excellent role played by Victor Lw leaves the country. It has a Nietzschian philosophical angle with the debate of lightness and weight Jacob's burdens give his life a meaning but are the sacrifices worth it? Location scouts did a wonderful job here because Karakter recreates prewar Rotterdam a city almost totally flattened by the Nazis There is a harrowing photo of the city after the bombardments with only the main church still standing. The production and art departments made the sets with their darkish colors fitting the form and content of the movie. The camera is used in a way to create some fluidity in the scenes It almost never is static as with so many character dramas.Fedja van Hut as Jacob and Jan Decleir as Dreverhaven seem to understand what's going on here and act accordingly. Tamar van den Dop as Lorna is probably the greatest weakness in the movie with a terrible diction and limited body movement she's miscast here.Mike van Diem makes only one movie wins an Oscar and disappears almost from the earth. Although rumor has it he does some script doctoring in Hollywood with his current production rate he will surpass even Malick. As for now this is by far the best Dutch movie ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that grips right away. While it has a dark setting sparse but classic the characters are rich. The love and care that Mike van Diem and the actors put in this film is visible. Thanks to significant contributions from both Dutch and Belgian TV stations this movie is a rare treat which is for once not spoiled by overly commercial requirements from demanding advertisers... As i understand the film company First Floor Features had this film for decades? in the planning and it is a happy coincidence that it was realized the way you can enjoy it now. It has thus become a monument honoring the fabulous writer F. Bordewijk the Dutch life and mind of the beginning 1900's the craftsmanship of a dedicated cast and a generous producer. Jan Declair as the stonyhearted usher Dreverhaven is a character you won't forget for a long time. His softer side is time and again rejected by taciturn Joba his former housekeeper who became pregnant in one lonely weak moment of them both. For several years he offers her to marry her or at least to contribute for the upbringing of his illegitimate son Kattedreuffe. She as many times rejects 'We do not need anything.' On a precarious occasion Dreverhaven denounces Jacob Kattadreuffe nevertheless and from that moment on father and son have a harsh relation as well. Masterfully fate intertwines their lives as the story unfolds. Real gems are present everywhere the scenery is breathtakingly picturesque partly filmed in Rotterdam harbor and in other places like Poland. The movie constantly plays with time but in a plausible way. As an example when Kattedreuffe has an appointment at a bailiff's office after being framed into bankruptcy the name plate blinks at once with his own name on it. And indeed he starts a career in this very office that same day. For a while the lives of father and son seem only occasionally to coincide but it is a silence before the storm. Every picture draws to the dramatic end which was glimpsed as the opening scene Did Kattadreuffe murder Dreverhaven? Many instances shown would allow this conclusion as the two fatally attract each other to fulfill their inner tragedy. Dreverhaven as this hard and desperate 'keeper of the law' who can not express love and Kattadreuffe as the one who had to fight his whole life to arrive in a higher position and then stands emptyhanded his love unreturned through his own stupidity even his mother sees that Lorna Te George  Tamar van den Dop was an exquisite relation missed. To kill ! each other would suddenly seem like the best possibility and a liberation in such a dark hour but the end has a surprise. The last minute smooths all the giant waves and allows for a satisfying and ingenuous end scene.  Maybe you have to see this movie more than once to uncover the many hidden treasures i strongly recommend to get it for yourself on DVD. The music of 'Paleis van Boem' enhances perfectly the impressive scenery. It is an artwork that has more than earned the Oscar it has got as best foreign film in 1998 along with several other awards.And i am proud to have been asked to participate with calligraphy and handwritten material although it is only clearly visible in the last half minute when my hand writes the last words of the testament undersigning with  see for yourself!.".

However the father seems to do everything possible to disrupt the young man's life as his mother becomes more and more detached and uncaring. It would seem that Dreverhaven is playing out a reallife game of chess around his son Jacob as if trying to corner him into submission and apathy but which the young man manages to survive. The psychological impression is that one or the other would undo his bitter foe' but that despite the father's vast fortune and power the struggle of will would rebound against him.But as the Dutch saying goes De n zijn dood is de ander zijn brood'This is no thriller' in the ordinary sense more a psychological suspense which requires attention throughout. The acting is magnificent both Fedja van Hut and Jan Decleir play out their parts with just the right touch especially Decleir and Lou Landr as Rentenstein is almost spellbinding not to be missed.Here is another example of the unarguable fact here in Europe we make cinema not blockbuster boxoffice hits.".

Katadreuffe leaves the place covered in blood. On the next morning he is arrested by the police for the murder of Dreverhaven. He claims that he is innocent and discloses the story of his life to the Chief of Police. His mother Joba Betty Schuurman was the maid at Dreverhaven. One night she is raped by him and a couple of weeks later she learns that she is pregnant. Dreverhaven proposes to marry her but Joba quits her job and leaves his house. Along the years Katadreuffe is bullied at school and called bastard by his mates and his mother never talks to him. One day he is involved by other kids in a theft of bread and arrested by the police. When he calls his biological father to help him Dreverhaven tells the police that he does not know who Katadreuffe is. The boy is intelligent and learns English reading a superseded and incomplete edition of encyclopedia that was left behind by the previous tenants of his apartment. Katadreuffe is also ambitious and asks for a job in a law office where he becomes the protg of his mentor De Gankelaar Victor Lw. Soon he falls in unrequited love with the secretary Lorna Te George Victor Tamar van den Dop. Along the years Dreverhaven uses his power to harm him. When he concluded his course he decides to pay a visit to Dreverhaven to tell him that he has wined their dispute. May Katadreuffe have killed Dreverhaven? Karakter is a dark film about a young man needy of fatherly love. The intercourse between his parents is never clear whether it was a rape as per the trailer or consensual sex. In the view of Katadreuffe his mother has always been mute. But maybe it could be a trauma for her only intercourse since she is a stubborn woman. Dreverhaven is a mysterious and ambiguous character. Is he only cruel or is he trying to harden his son to face the challenges of the brutal society where they live and be a winner? The screenplay is very wellwritten and keeps the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The cinematography set decoration and art direction are perfect and bring the viewer to Netherlands in the middle 20's. The cast has magnificent performance highlighting Jan Decleir. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Carter Character".

Jacob probably could have borrowed money from others  but NO! he had to make a as bad deal as possible.If you can stomach poverty and hearts with no love in them  watch this film  a gripping fantastic story  Id say it needs several viweings for full understanding of the story.

Yet and this is a paradox in the sense of the looks like a contradiction but actually isn't his motivation for this is to show his father he can stand up against him trying to make his father proud of him getting acceptance.And at the same time his father Dreverhaven wants to make his son strong and this is also a paradox he does this by opposing him. I'll strangle him for 910ths that 110th of him that survives will become stronger of it. The son will only be worthy of his pride will only be accepted once he can stand up against him. But what's the price of all this? What will be left for the father who made his son hate him to get him where he is?Nietsche might get credit for the that which does not kill makes you stronger philosophy but I think it's actually a very basic male instinct just about every fatherson will recognize it I don't say it's an instinct to be proud of though. Maybe that's why males give this film significantly higher votes? Because they can relate better to the material? But I digress.The movie starts in a such way that it makes you choose the side of the son. It's only natural since the father takes on the role of a tyrant. So according to the classic stereotypes he must be evil which implies that the son must be the good guy. But as the movie progresses as you get to see more and more of the personalities and the motivations of the characters you will start to doubt those assumptions. And when it ends when the whole story is told no plothole is left and everything makes perfect sense... you'll still be left wondering.There are only two flaws this movie has. The first is that that it'll probably be lost on those who aren't through their growing pains yet. Fatherson relationships aren't even fully understood by those who have been both let alone by those who are still struggling with their own personality. The second flaw is it requires its viewer to think and I mean THINK about its the story and characters. If you don't do the latter the slow pace will bore you to death. But if that's not a problem for you it's actually a boon and you'll greatly enjoy the movie. A masterpiece Especially for Dutch standards. Granted those are quite low.".

But since I'm obligated to write a 10line review I guess I'll go ahead and bore you with my supercilious cinematic spiel. Feel free to skip the rest of the review and go watch the movie.I was particularly surprised that France was capable of making a movie in the 50s that wasn't some desultory experimental existential ramble. Not that I have anything against all that but after watching my 3rd Truffaut film and my 5th Godard film I was ready for a breath of fresh air. And this film definitely delivered.It's silly and mostly predictable but in the most charming way like an old Cary Grant flick. But of course Brigitte has better legs than Cary Grant. And she can dance like a water nymph ballet acrobatic provocative or hippy. Her acting style is genuine and impish much like Audrey Hepburn however Brigitte adds a powerful sensuality to the presentation.It helps to know French but if not here's what you do. Watch it once with subtitles on. Then watch it with subtitles off. The 2nd time you'll get much more of the humour by simply watching their gestures and listening to their tones of voice. Have fun with it!".

Mischa Auer has a funny bit as a bumbling dance choreographer. Raymond Bussieres easily cops the top acting honors with his excellent and engaging portrayal of Jean's loyal befuddled butler Jerome. The song and dance numbers are a lot of merry fun. Moreover a sassy sharptongued parrot provides some of the film's best and biggest belly laughs. Kudos are also in order for Joseph C.

However it is far from a great filmand one for which you have to make some allowances due to poor direction and an occasionally goofy script.Brigitte plays a lady in her early twenties whose father is in involved with shady illegal business. However she is oblivious and thinks he's rich from a legitimate shipping business. When the father gets in trouble with the law he asks his friend Clery to the small college where Brigitte is enrolled and bring her to him in Switzerland. The father figures that if the girl isn't brought to him quickly the police will take her in custody and try to use her as leverage. In fact shortly after Clery arrives the police DO show up as well and the two barely make their escape.The rest of the film concerns Clery and Brigette hiding out from the law. And how did he get the girl to agree to hide? He told her that her father is being pursued by spied who are dressed like policemen! But having this radiant young woman with him causes a lot of problemswith Clery's fiance because Brigitte is a bit of a klutz and problems follow her and because the police are bound to show up sooner or later.This film has many enjoyable and cute moments. Brigitte is simply wonderful and it's hard to dislike hereven when she manages to burn down Clery's apartment! She's just so cute and sweet and likable. This is THE reason I liked the film. Plus SOME of the plot is very good. But sadly the film also has a lot of problems. The biggest one is that the film plays at times like a Three Stooges filmwith 'funny' sound effects and the worst overacting I have ever seen Mischa Auer do it was simply embarrassing. A romantic comedy should be funny but not like this! In addition there seemed to be a lot of paddingsinging and dancing that often distract from the nice relationship that was blooming between Brigitte and Cleryit was very sweet. As a result it's very watchable but you can't help thinking that it could have been better if the director hadn't been an idiot and had exercised some restraint.".

	schema:reviewBody "''LE CRIME DE MONSIEUR LANGE'' is a film that Renoir made as part of the Popular Front sympathies of the mid30s when a coalition of various organizations banded together in a show of collective solidarity under Leon Blum's leadership. It was this film which cemented Renoir forever after in the ranks of leftwing filmmakers much to Renoir's bemusement years later and the film has been variously seen as a calltoarms towards collective organization as a film about the class conflict and oppression of workers and about creating a new social utopia. Such reductions do the film little justice because what seems an agitprop actually becomes murky.LE CRIME DE MONSIEUR LANGE begins with a flashbacka device Renoir rarely used at a Frontier Hotelwhich frontier is unspecified where a guard brings in a wanted poster informing the bar patrons about Amedee LangeRene Lefevre a fugitive on the run from the law. Lange and his sweetheart ValentineFlorelle arrive at the hotel and are recognized by the patrons. Valentine decides to explain why Lange committed the crime of the title as he sleeps from exhaustion in his room. The film then begins and is set in a courtyardbrought to vivid life by beautiful set design and superb circular panning shots where writers of a publishing firm reside. This publishing firm is run by BatalaJules Berry in a great performance a corrupt fabulist of an employer who loves sleeping with his female employees and crushing the spirit of his males.Berry's Batala is a caricature par excellence of a bourgeois businessman who will promote Lange's Arizona Jim stories in his magazine to make up for swindling his sponsors only to sabotage Lange's vision by inserting absurd advertisements into the mouth of his idealized and poorly researched Western hero. The film moves without a plot smoothly scripted by the legendary poetscriptwright Jacques Prevertwho worked with Marcel Carne and Jean Gremillon but this was his only work with France's best filmmaker driven by the actions and interactions between the workers of the publishing firm and their relationships with the girls who run the neighbourhood laundry. It's a portrait of class relationships like few others in film history making room for such expert caricatures as a old war veteran of an IndoChina conflict whose racism and colonialism is presented starkly.The film's key movement happens midway when the publisher Batala seemingly perishes in a train crash leaving the publishing firm in disarray...the sponsors want their money back the workers want to keep their jobs. By mutual agreement and mutual interests they form a cooperative and in this phase class distinctions fall apart middleclass businessmen eat side by side with writers and businessmen corrupt reactionaries alongside progressives women with men. The publishing firm which had been in tatters because of Batala's pretentious detective magazine Javert rejuvenates itself by making pulp fiction of Arizona Jim novels fumetti and even discuss making a filmalthough Lange disagrees noting the impossibility of faking the American West in France....The film's vision of cooperative society isn't one of classlessness but class coordination. The firm's major support comes from a dandy son of a bourgeois businessman it passes into their hands through the aegis of an unconvincing distant relative of Batala who inherits the place when he dies. Much of the film's strength comes from Renoir's effortless blocking of actors in group with direct sound creating a palpable sense of place.The film's finale climaxes in a stunning coup where the line between Lange and Arizona Jim blurs. Batala returns from the dead to take over his firm and rub out the work done without him and in an act of inspiration Lange commits himself to assassinate Batala. This act is carried in two successive spellbinding tracking shots. The first is a crane shot of a high angle which follows Lange walking through three rooms down a stairs the other is a breathtaking semicircular pan in which Arizona Jim Lange defeats the bad guy and rescues his girl and then of course heads to the frontier.".

	schema:headline " Humanist look at communities in prewar France  and it's a mystery!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest almost lost films I've seen is Jean Renoir's The Crime of Monsieur Lange. Renoir made it in 1936 prior to the invasion of France by German forces and just before his two wartime masterpieces Rules of the Game and Grand Illusion which both have overshadowed it critically and in terms of popularity. But I consider Lange to be richer in irony political bite and even humanity than its more famous followers.It relates the story of one Amedee Lange a pulp writer for a weekly paper published by the womanizing and ever scheming Batala played with delicious gregariousness by Jules Berry. Lange writes the continuing western serial Arizona Jim for the paper but his prose suffers the indignity of having advertising blurbs inserted into it to by Berry. When Berry in an effort to avoid creditors fakes his own death in a train wreck Lange and the other workers for the paper rally and take over the publishing themselves creating a popular and commercial success continuing Arizona Jim sharing in the tasks and rewards and even staging a rather stagy and unconvincing film version of the western for the local cinemas.Renoir creates a potent political subtext by defining this community  the workers neighbors and friends  around a single courtyard. His camera glides through doorways and peers through the windows of apartments and shops to eavesdrop on all the personal and professional intrigues in a way that at the time was considered outrageously overdone. Lange himself has never been outside Paris and when people comment on the apparent authenticity of his western serial he constantly corrects them  but to no avail. He is soon taken for the lover of the laundress whom his bedridden friend has a crush on another misunderstanding. Lange's a fake  but he barely suspects as much as he's too concerned with trying to explain facilitate his friends or going along for the ride to ever express much more than a sense that he finds the situation ironic. His misunderstood almost aggressively passive existence becomes the catalyst and center of this selfforming community a new populist collective that's practically communist.When Berry unexpectedly returns dressed in a priest's outfit he's appropriated he intends to reap the benefits of the commune's success publishing and filming the serial. Lange realizes Berry's capitalist worldview and intent to dictate over them again threatens the wellbeing of the community indeed will destroy it. After a drunken party that night in which Marcel Lvesque gives a speech in a way reprising his role as the goodhearted sidekick in Feuillade's 1917's Les Vampires! Lange leaves Berry's office and the camera follows him outside through the windows of the office. With a bravura camera pan of a full 360 degrees to take in all the elements around the central courtyard considered quite selfindulgent then but now practically invisible to our jaded eyes Renoir returns to Berry who's now lying on the cobblestones bleeding  Lange has stabbed him  offscreen  yet the camera move signifies a profound emotional event has transpired and transformed the community...Lange was made during the period that the Popular Front was gaining political ground in France when there was optimism that people could band together and conquer the threat that Hitler was manifesting. Renoir's political themes have always been background texture rather than text  The Rules of the Game is considered one of the best antiwar films ever made and yet the topic is never brought up in the film. Even Grand Illusion taking place in prisonerofwar camps concerns itself primarily with the classbased relations between the Germans and their captured prisoners.Lange's positioning as the reluctant center and catalyst for the commune as well as its inadvertent savior by eventually committing murder the crime of the title is played in ironic setups. Berry is dressed as a priest for his ignoble return. Earlier Berry mentions to a priest on the train he must be able to get away with anything and this returning sheep in wolf's clothing is another resonance with how people put up fronts that are misunderstood. The film also manages to address redolent in its subtext the vagaries of pop culture verisimilitude of representation and personal responsibility. None of the handful of pregnancies in the picture seem to enjoy the benefit of being in wedlock  it's likely that Berry is responsible for all of them.My favorite moment occurs at the train station when Berry is about to flee the office for the first time. He's saying goodbye to one of his smitten secretaries who doesn't realize what a cad he truly is. Renoir allows Berry a moment of wisdom as he tells her how to capture the sympathies of some passing young man speaking perhaps from personal knowledge so she won't be lost abandoned once he leaves her  by suggesting she pretend to cry over a departing lover on the station platform. Indeed as Berry's train leaves her sobs capture the attention of a passing man whom she begins to walk with. The shot fades out with the hint of a slight smile on her face as she begins to warm to her new conquest. Amazing.Truffaut called Monsieur Lange Renoir's greatest work. The film was issued by Interama on laserdisc in 1988 now way out of print of course. It was recently issued on VHS from Kino now OOP as well and could use a Criteriongrade upgrade and reissue.".

Renoir made it in 1936 prior to the invasion of France by German forces and just before his two wartime masterpieces Rules of the Game and Grand Illusion which both have overshadowed it critically and in terms of popularity. But I consider Lange to be richer in irony political bite and even humanity than its more famous followers.It relates the story of one Amedee Lange a pulp writer for a weekly paper published by the womanizing and ever scheming Batala played with delicious gregariousness by Jules Berry. Lange writes the continuing western serial Arizona Jim for the paper but his prose suffers the indignity of having advertising blurbs inserted into it to by Berry. When Berry in an effort to avoid creditors fakes his own death in a train wreck Lange and the other workers for the paper rally and take over the publishing themselves creating a popular and commercial success continuing Arizona Jim sharing in the tasks and rewards and even staging a rather stagy and unconvincing film version of the western for the local cinemas.Renoir creates a potent political subtext by defining this community  the workers neighbors and friends  around a single courtyard. His camera glides through doorways and peers through the windows of apartments and shops to eavesdrop on all the personal and professional intrigues in a way that at the time was considered outrageously overdone. Lange himself has never been outside Paris and when people comment on the apparent authenticity of his western serial he constantly corrects them  but to no avail. He is soon taken for the lover of the laundress whom his bedridden friend has a crush on another misunderstanding. Lange's a fake  but he barely suspects as much as he's too concerned with trying to explain facilitate his friends or going along for the ride to ever express much more than a sense that he finds the situation ironic. His misunderstood almost aggressively passive existence becomes the catalyst and center of this selfforming community a new populist collective that's practically communist.When Berry unexpectedly returns dressed in a priest's outfit he's appropriated he intends to reap the benefits of the commune's success publishing and filming the serial. Lange realizes Berry's capitalist worldview and intent to dictate over them again threatens the wellbeing of the community indeed will destroy it. After a drunken party that night in which Marcel Lvesque gives a speech in a way reprising his role as the goodhearted sidekick in Feuillade's 1917's Les Vampires! Lange leaves Berry's office and the camera follows him outside through the windows of the office. With a bravura camera pan of a full 360 degrees to take in all the elements around the central courtyard considered quite selfindulgent then but now practically invisible to our jaded eyes Renoir returns to Berry who's now lying on the cobblestones bleeding  Lange has stabbed him  offscreen  yet the camera move signifies a profound emotional event has transpired and transformed the community...Lange was made during the period that the Popular Front was gaining political ground in France when there was optimism that people could band together and conquer the threat that Hitler was manifesting. Renoir's political themes have always been background texture rather than text  The Rules of the Game is considered one of the best antiwar films ever made and yet the topic is never brought up in the film. Even Grand Illusion taking place in prisonerofwar camps concerns itself primarily with the classbased relations between the Germans and their captured prisoners.Lange's positioning as the reluctant center and catalyst for the commune as well as its inadvertent savior by eventually committing murder the crime of the title is played in ironic setups. Berry is dressed as a priest for his ignoble return. Earlier Berry mentions to a priest on the train he must be able to get away with anything and this returning sheep in wolf's clothing is another resonance with how people put up fronts that are misunderstood. The film also manages to address redolent in its subtext the vagaries of pop culture verisimilitude of representation and personal responsibility. None of the handful of pregnancies in the picture seem to enjoy the benefit of being in wedlock  it's likely that Berry is responsible for all of them.My favorite moment occurs at the train station when Berry is about to flee the office for the first time. He's saying goodbye to one of his smitten secretaries who doesn't realize what a cad he truly is. Renoir allows Berry a moment of wisdom as he tells her how to capture the sympathies of some passing young man speaking perhaps from personal knowledge so she won't be lost abandoned once he leaves her  by suggesting she pretend to cry over a departing lover on the station platform. Indeed as Berry's train leaves her sobs capture the attention of a passing man whom she begins to walk with. The shot fades out with the hint of a slight smile on her face as she begins to warm to her new conquest. Amazing.Truffaut called Monsieur Lange Renoir's greatest work. The film was issued by Interama on laserdisc in 1988 now way out of print of course. It was recently issued on VHS from Kino now OOP as well and could use a Criteriongrade upgrade and reissue.";

There's a lot here about workers 'rights' a subject that still 70 years down the line still preoccupies Robert Guidiguian but given that Prevert IS Prevert there's also a lot of poetic touches and subtle dialogue. Indeed it is tempting to think that the Batala he wrote for Jules Berry was a rough draft for the real Devil that Berry would play a few years later in Les Visiteurs du Soir. Arguably one of the earliest uses of 'flashback' it is also full of holes  the flashback is related by a laundress who has fled with Amedee Lange to a small inn on the border realizing that the proprietor and customers have recognized Lange as a man wanted for murder she offers to tell his Lange's story and then let them decide whether or not to turn him in. However roughly half of what she relates is stuff of which she herself had no direct knowledge conversations to which she was not privy etc. If we make allowances for this we are left with a fairly engrossing story verging on a morality play of good Lange versus evil Batala and workers banding together and unlike La Belle Equipe remaining bonded via the glue of Lange's humanity. In many small ways it feels earlier than nineteen thirty six but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Now available in a boxed set of 3 Renoir titles of which La Grande Illusion stands out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Renoir is one of the classic French directors and films like La Grande Illusion and The Human Beast show that. This film The Crime of Monsieur Lange is not one of the man's best films but it's still a more than adequate example of French filmmaking in the 1930's. Adapted from a story by Jean Castanyer the same man that wrote the story for Renoir's earlier film 'Boudu Saved from Drowning' The Crime of Monsieur Lange tells the story of a man and woman that bed down in a hotel for the night. The man is recognised by the patrons as being the same man that killed another man but before they can turn him in the woman decides to tell the story of exactly why her man is a murderer and then let the customers decide whether or not he should be convicted. This premise offers an interesting base for a film as themes of justice and morality can easily be tied in but this is the film's main problem. While Renoir presents the story behind the murder in an interesting way we never really get into whether or not the protagonist should be convicted.The film is left open ended probably so that the audience can 'make their own minds up' about the events but this idea is never really explored and it's a shame because it could have presented a very interesting backbone for the movie. Quite what Renoir's intentions were for this film therefore are rather quite muddled. The film is never exciting enough to be considered a straight thriller the story isn't deep enough for it to be a deep and complex drama and we're not presented with enough themes for it to be viewed as a cross section of justice and morality. Jean Renoir seems to have been too much of a complex man to have simply intended this film as a quick Saturdaymorning style drama and themes of living in France at the time aside that's pretty much what this is. The actual drama in the film is good however with the actors giving life to their characters through realistic acting. Renoir's direction is as assured and as vivacious as ever and you really get the impression with this man that he really puts his back into making films. This certainly isn't a bad movie but it's not great either. Most people like me would probably expect a little more from Renoir...but it's still worth seeing.".

The narrative frame introduces the story through straightforward exposition. Great depth of field and uneven stagingblocking of characters constructs a space unobtrusively in order to make room for the free interchange of political positions of everyday people. It is difficult to deny that M. Lange isn't a call for French citizens to become politicized but one cannot overlook the contribution of Prevert to that end. Mobile framing is employed once Florelle's character introduces the past events that led her and M. Lange into the provincial regions. The mobile framing operates to connect lives that might otherwise require the conjuring of contrived connections by the audience. The fact is that these people live and work together  that is the essence of their connection and for Prevert and Renoir such a connection is enough to create a demand for respect dignity and autonomy. Batala throws a wrench in all that good stuff and provides the catalyst for politicization. Is murder condoned in this film or is it representative of the sacrifice that will be made to take up a firm political position? a massive issue at the time of the Popular Front M. Lange is all about context but in the most selfreflexive manner. Even the Arizona Jim storyline has a direct conversation operating within the French film industry at the time. M. Lange isn't anachronistic but for a contemporary audience the concept of group responsibility has distorted and perverted into an amorphous hideous blob cranking up the volume of the latest tech trinket to drown out the screams of a Kitty Genovese in the alley below. This makes M. Lange a refreshing take on politics but a depressing one given the contemporary spectator has the foreknowledge that WWII happened and that international corporate conglomeration Batala's wet dream has become so dominant that an Occupy Movement on Wall Street looks more like a corporatesponsored HoedowncumPowWow... and just wait for the time management game version to be released on iPhone in the next three months. If M. Lange were real life in 2013 we can be sure that Batala getting his would mean getting the highest amount of profit participation and controlling the creative accounting end of things when the box office closes on the film's run. It is beautiful to see a world fighting for what is right. Prevert was unabashed in that regard. Renoir was fighting for something else  both more personal and universal. In a true Renoir film Batala would have been a more complex character... likely something between King Louis in La Marseillaise and Dede in La Chienee. That is to say his return would be announced and his escape would be ensured at the expense of some poor bugger's own life... in a kind of reprehensible accident. What does the 360 shot mean to me? I believe that it represents a political statement about the deferral of responsibility. The Lange and Batala roles are a clever reversal of the real issue... where do you stand against the threat of fascism that will soon begin stomping faces which it did in abundance.".

The story is about a decent but meek French man who writes cowboy stories though he has never even been to the American West. He has no dream of having them published but feels a strong need to put his fantasies on paper.

However truly rough it can be if you're old live in the Himalayas and need to spend a couple of weeks taking your yak and salt to get some grain for winter survival. Photographer Eric Valli's beautiful epic film Himalaya' is the first Nepalese film to be nominated in 1999 for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It is also a heroic fable of a small community's struggle to change the guard from old to young and retain the respect of the gods. The simple plot told in every culture that has any notion of the grandeur of place and power may deceive some into thinking this a small cliched film.  It is rather a grand design of human struggle and triumph figuratively and realistically represented in the salt caravans that still traverse the majestic Himalayan Mountains in Tibet.When one of the caravans tries to cut off 4 days by attempting a route reserved for the devils the ensuing danger as yaks and humans walk the narrow path is so beautiful and harrowing that my glacier experience looks now like a picnic. Blue sky above blue water below and a path so dangerous indeed the gods themselves would have second thoughts. Valli's cinemascope is the perfect medium to catch the overpowering mountains and miniscule stones both instruments of the terrible powers those gods still wield in this other world.The actors are handsome locals and the story is right out of Shakespeare and Howard Hawks. See this film before you get too old to breathe its artistic air.".

These were real people of that area! They also faces you won't soon forget.As for the story the treks don't begin until 45 minutes has gone by in the film. You have to be patient. Much of that first part people argue back and forth on the merits of making the trip and who would and should be going. Finally we wind up with two separate camps the younger guy Karma and his crowd and the older man Tinle who takes his son grandchild and his motherand mainly older friends of the stubborn old coot of a leader.Old man Tinle does nothing but bitch and moan most of the movie but people do their share of complaining to him too.

Rent a Hollywood spawn with phony chases lots of CGI and godawful writing. This is a simple story but one basic to the human condition.  Loss death coming of age transition love and resurrection.  This film is full of archetypes but without the contrived devices found in so many Western films.  The adventure is that of the daily lives of these people who live always on the edge.  It is most unfair to judge this simple tale and its depiction from the same viewpoint of another mythic journey.  There's only the violence of nature and the triumph of human will to survive not happily ever after but just for another day. As an anthropologist who spent over 25 years working with pastoralists nomadic herders in Africa Central Asia South America and the Middle East I was delighted with this unpretentious story.  I never worked with yak or reindeer I highly recommend the exceptional Pathfinder for an excellent view of the Lappsherders and the presentation certainly squared with everything I've read about these dynamic wonderful people.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilersIt stands as a sweet poignant story of a simple life of hardship strife and the necessity of growing up and enduring.  Against a backdrop of superstition vs. pragmatism a village elder's Tinle's hatred and need for revenge stem from the death of his first son  a death he blames on the son Karma of another family whose ancestors had bad blood with him and his own.  In his stubbornness he consults the star charts for guidance on when depart on a caravan through the mountains to trade their livelihood salt rather than following the urging of Karma who departs with most of the young men of the village 4 days before him in an effort to avoid late season storms.  Tinle asks his second son  a lama who knows only how to paint and pray  to help the rest of them voyage over the mountain pass to trade for their livelihood.  Initially refusing the priest later reconsiders remembering something he was once taught when presented with two paths always choose the harder one.  This speaks to me of the value of life as a journey rather than a destination the value of striving and failure even it does seem ludicrously impractical as general advice.Though some of the members of the second caravan are too old or too young to make the journey stubbornness and need drive Tinle onward even through a treacherous shortcut through a winding trail high above a mountain lake as well as stormy snowdrifts in a high mountain pass.  Tinle's grandson Passang? orphaned now and destined to be the chief in the future learns much from his mother and Tinle before and during the journey.  He takes comfort in the knowledge of the afterlife that lives are ended and reborn in an eternal cycle.  This story while to me not a tragedy has a similar fiery cleansing effect because it presents life with such purity and urgency  that of an ancient legacy.  There is need and striving pain and endurance and compassion. Most of all there is reconciliation and epiphany Tinle breaks his circle of hatred and manages to forgive before he dies finally coming to terms with his grief and putting the good of the tribe ahead of need to blame someone for his son's death.  He is healed.  Karma having never really returned Tinle's spite learns that there may be more to the superstitious old ways than meets the eye sometimes there are hidden merits to tradition even though they seem pointless on the surface.The most memorable moments are at the end of the film.  When Tinle collapses his life spent Karma says I've sometimes dreamt that you were my father.

	onyx:emotionText "Some spoilersIt stands as a sweet poignant story of a simple life of hardship strife and the necessity of growing up and enduring.  Against a backdrop of superstition vs. pragmatism a village elder's Tinle's hatred and need for revenge stem from the death of his first son  a death he blames on the son Karma of another family whose ancestors had bad blood with him and his own.  In his stubbornness he consults the star charts for guidance on when depart on a caravan through the mountains to trade their livelihood salt rather than following the urging of Karma who departs with most of the young men of the village 4 days before him in an effort to avoid late season storms.  Tinle asks his second son  a lama who knows only how to paint and pray  to help the rest of them voyage over the mountain pass to trade for their livelihood.  Initially refusing the priest later reconsiders remembering something he was once taught when presented with two paths always choose the harder one.  This speaks to me of the value of life as a journey rather than a destination the value of striving and failure even it does seem ludicrously impractical as general advice.Though some of the members of the second caravan are too old or too young to make the journey stubbornness and need drive Tinle onward even through a treacherous shortcut through a winding trail high above a mountain lake as well as stormy snowdrifts in a high mountain pass.  Tinle's grandson Passang? orphaned now and destined to be the chief in the future learns much from his mother and Tinle before and during the journey.  He takes comfort in the knowledge of the afterlife that lives are ended and reborn in an eternal cycle.  This story while to me not a tragedy has a similar fiery cleansing effect because it presents life with such purity and urgency  that of an ancient legacy.  There is need and striving pain and endurance and compassion. Most of all there is reconciliation and epiphany Tinle breaks his circle of hatred and manages to forgive before he dies finally coming to terms with his grief and putting the good of the tribe ahead of need to blame someone for his son's death.  He is healed.  Karma having never really returned Tinle's spite learns that there may be more to the superstitious old ways than meets the eye sometimes there are hidden merits to tradition even though they seem pointless on the surface.The most memorable moments are at the end of the film.  When Tinle collapses his life spent Karma says I've sometimes dreamt that you were my father.  It's touching that his shield of love never let him be deeply wounded by Tinle's longstanding grudge and unrelenting hatred.  And Tinle reconciles showing that his eyes are open at last with true insight You're too much like me to be my son.  A real chief always starts by disobeying.

Since then I have seen it 3 more times and it still gives me an emotional high each time.  It's not quite like seeing it with 500 Nepali natives in Kathmandu where I was the only person who knew what was going on since no one else could read the English subtitles nor understand the Tibetan dialogue.The French director Eric Valli made this incredible film nominated for Academy Award as Best Foreign Film in 2000 in the Dolpo region of northwestern Nepal on the Tibetan border using native people instead of professional actors.  It is a fictional account of how those people actually live there in extreme isolation and is documentary in the sense that it records a way of life which will gradually disappear as more modern influence comes to the area as it has in so much of Nepal.  The filming is extraordinary the scenery is spectacular the action is lifelike the characters are real and the mysterious music is intriguing.

	schema:headline " Please try not to miss this masterpiece of the cinema.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a superb example of the film genre which originally did most to establish cinematography as an important new art medium  it is a visually very striking tribute to a traditional lifestyle that is most unlikely to be able to continue for very much longer and that would be lost forever if not recorded on film. Even back when feature films were still regarded as only poor shadows of stage presentations such films had already established themselves as a unique and irreplaceable adjunct to written or hand drawn records.For many years documentaries were probably the type of film most extensively made and although the development of lightweight equipment that could be used in all weathers only took place very slowly many anthropologically important works such as Nanook of the North or Legong  Dance of the Virgins began to appear soon after WWI. Some were true documentaries where the photographer tried not to interfere with the normal activity pattern of his subjects whilst in others the cast are deliberately acting out such activities for the exclusive benefit of the camera. Nanook of the North is an example of the former group whilst Dance of the Virgins has a story line built around the traditional ritual dances that are the principal cultural activity of the Balinese villagers who acted in the film. Himalaya is also an example of this latter type of documentary. It features the people of the Dolpo region a high altitude plateau situated on the border between Nepal and Tibet in the Himalayas and so remote that its population appears to have only been estimated somewhere between 5000 and 18000 according to Wikipedia. At an altitude of around 4000 m this is one of the highest agricultural areas in the world with poor mountain soil extremes of weather and a very short growing season so not surprisingly the communities living there need to supplement their own food production through trading. For many centuries the traditional method has been to take salt plentiful in Tibet to Nepal by an annual Yak caravan trek across the mountains following the primitive trails developed to permit such trade and to exchange this salt for grain. When Eric Valli made his documentary in 1999 this traditional practice was still being followed in a way unchanged for many centuries but he appreciated that it was a fragile lifestyle and wanted to capture it for the world in case it came under threat. Since then a two prong threat has developed  the absorption of Tibet by the Peoples Republic of China has led to attempts to close the Nepalese Tibetian border which makes it harder for the Dolpo people to acquire the salt needed to continue this form of trade and alternative sources of salt from other parts of the world have reduced the dependence of the Nepalese on the Dolpo caravans. It is hard to be optimistic that major changes will not become inevitable  a poignant concern whilst watching this beautiful film..Valli's team must have spent a long time getting to know the community and achieving a concensus on the story which would be presented. The final product is so realistic and documentary in effect that one almost feels it must be autobiographical but I believe this is unlikely as it would then have threatened to reopen the conflicts shown with potentially disastrous effects. It is much more likely to be a recreation of legends and oral history from sometime in the past. It features an aged tribal leader Tinli whose family has held this position for many generations ready to hand over to his son just when the young man is killed in an accident. We learn that the role of tribal leader is not quite the hereditary right of this family being subject to community approval which is based on proved ability to provide strong leadership  most effectively demonstrated by successfully leading their vital annual yak caravans. The old man's grandson is only a child  his other son is a monk in a Buddhist monastery with no experience to match the communities needs. He decides to once more lead the caravan himself and determines the departure date ordained by the gods. The community is split many supporting another leader who spurns supernatural guidance and plans to leave earlier. Ultimately two caravans leave four days apart. They rejoin near their destination the old leader dies of his exertions and the split in the community is healed.  this simple but very effective story provides a framework upon which Valli has created a memorable film that can be recommended unreservedly. The Himalayan scenery is unsurpassed and creates a mustsee for all mountain lovers but the most memorable sequences are those where we see and experience the vitality of the community when discussing the wisest course of action to follow..The ultimate triumphant success this almost unique movie achieves is the way in which its viewers come to feel they really know Tinle the aged leader and his contemporaries  this is an experience which is truly not to be lightly passed over. .For me the climactic sequences were those showing Tinle's followers waist deep in snow battling their way through a storm which had created whiteout conditions.. One could not but reflect that even the short time interval between the grain harvest and the onset of winter is always subject to storms which would render mountain travel hazardous or even impossible Over several centuries many of the caravans must have just disappeared in such storms without trace. Every time this happened it would have been a very traumatic loss to the community concerned. What determination and trust in their gods must have contributed to their survival on such occasions. There are lessons for us all in this!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a superb example of the film genre which originally did most to establish cinematography as an important new art medium  it is a visually very striking tribute to a traditional lifestyle that is most unlikely to be able to continue for very much longer and that would be lost forever if not recorded on film. Even back when feature films were still regarded as only poor shadows of stage presentations such films had already established themselves as a unique and irreplaceable adjunct to written or hand drawn records.For many years documentaries were probably the type of film most extensively made and although the development of lightweight equipment that could be used in all weathers only took place very slowly many anthropologically important works such as Nanook of the North or Legong  Dance of the Virgins began to appear soon after WWI. Some were true documentaries where the photographer tried not to interfere with the normal activity pattern of his subjects whilst in others the cast are deliberately acting out such activities for the exclusive benefit of the camera. Nanook of the North is an example of the former group whilst Dance of the Virgins has a story line built around the traditional ritual dances that are the principal cultural activity of the Balinese villagers who acted in the film. Himalaya is also an example of this latter type of documentary. It features the people of the Dolpo region a high altitude plateau situated on the border between Nepal and Tibet in the Himalayas and so remote that its population appears to have only been estimated somewhere between 5000 and 18000 according to Wikipedia. At an altitude of around 4000 m this is one of the highest agricultural areas in the world with poor mountain soil extremes of weather and a very short growing season so not surprisingly the communities living there need to supplement their own food production through trading. For many centuries the traditional method has been to take salt plentiful in Tibet to Nepal by an annual Yak caravan trek across the mountains following the primitive trails developed to permit such trade and to exchange this salt for grain. When Eric Valli made his documentary in 1999 this traditional practice was still being followed in a way unchanged for many centuries but he appreciated that it was a fragile lifestyle and wanted to capture it for the world in case it came under threat. Since then a two prong threat has developed  the absorption of Tibet by the Peoples Republic of China has led to attempts to close the Nepalese Tibetian border which makes it harder for the Dolpo people to acquire the salt needed to continue this form of trade and alternative sources of salt from other parts of the world have reduced the dependence of the Nepalese on the Dolpo caravans. It is hard to be optimistic that major changes will not become inevitable  a poignant concern whilst watching this beautiful film..Valli's team must have spent a long time getting to know the community and achieving a concensus on the story which would be presented.

So I was a little apprehensive about Himalaya. Fortunately French director Eric Valli knows the Himalayan Dolpo people he's filming he has been living with them for years and speaks their language. So what we got here is a true movie with true cinematic characters a true plot and no condescending stuff. It's actually amazing to behold a story where the people have problems so remote from the ones someone from Paris France can have like having to set up a 2weeks cattle drive across Himalaya to trade salt against barley and however these problems and emotions are made more real than say a comedy about bourgeoisie with sex trouble. Not that the plot is truly original  it deals in a rather classic way and not unlike some war movies with the essence of leadership the original French title is Himalaya the youth of a chief. What makes a leader and how and why can leadership be challenged ? Why people do follow some leaders and not other ? From what we see in the film these are questions that people who live in such extreme conditions find of extreme importance. Add a magnificent scenery no need for filters for clear blue lakes there and talented actors who literally inhabit their complex roles partly because they've been in situations like this or know people who have and here is one impressive adventure movie.".

The end result is that you can watch the scene unfolding as if you were looking through Nachtwey's own lens. Watching as he transforms scenes of violence chaos and noise into breathtaking still photographs is fascinating. Any shutterbugs out there will enjoy this movie for that aspect of it alone.It's also a very moving filmvery intense. I certainly can't get through it without tearing up and when I looked around the theater I saw the same shock and grief on the faces of my fellow moviegoers. The ethos of the film seems to reflect the sentiment behind Nachtwey's own photographs that is you don't get the New York Times explanation of who the victims are who the perpetrators are or what the sociopolitical context is. The violence and suffering are presented simply this thing happened to this person at this moment and it was awful.It's not too preachy the viewer is left to ask her own questions about why and how these things happen. Sometimes all those explanations can obscure the individual lives that are contained in a word like collateral damage. Nachtwey's photography and this film clarify that fact simply by observing it. That's the essence of the best documentary photography and it's a great reason to see this film.".

He has to come back to experience it all over again to feel alive. It's vampirism all right but not from the material or the moral angle. He simply needs that sense of purpose to live and to fulfill his life with higher aims to reach.

One of the comments he makes is that he sees himself as a conduit and it is his monklike dedication to being a passive photographer that I think is somewhat problematic in having a film about him.As such while I have profound respect for Nachtwey's efforts his results and evidently his civility in the face of brutality this film I think is not an essential watch.

A pet peeve of mine is why kids are allowed in harms way in such settings.People in Jakarta are living near the train tracks  and one family is given specific focus. The message is that these people are just like you striving to support their children...But again the video makes me wonder about that family some more. The father has lost an arm and a leg to the trains that he now keeps his family living near by and unlike the other families in leanto's off to the side of the tracks they are shown sleeping right between the tracks.These questions pop up with video whereas I think a few photographs and Nachtwey's words voiced over or written in an article would not.In conclusion I feel somewhat conflicted giving this less than a 6 especially as I am more than likely aligned with the general beliefs of Nachtwey. His stated belief in the importance of one life is something that I think as individuals we have to try and assert knowing that governments and companies understand how cheap human life is.That's a tricky balance and one hard to put on video possibly better left to a photo and then meditated upon by each one us. We do see many photos here but then as they are embedded in video they are tainted by that. It happens with embedding I think...the meter is running and the demands of the film must be met. Maybe I should have hit the pause button for each photo?With hope soon Nachtwey will be well from his wounds and again able to document the wounds of the world for us.510".

	onyx:emotionText "In the extras on the DVD there is a short interview with Nachtwey that is perhaps as telling about him as the entire film. One of the comments he makes is that he sees himself as a conduit and it is his monklike dedication to being a passive photographer that I think is somewhat problematic in having a film about him.As such while I have profound respect for Nachtwey's efforts his results and evidently his civility in the face of brutality this film I think is not an essential watch.

	schema:headline " A very interesting Mummy the character";
	schema:reviewBody "The Mummy Lives is an American directtovideo flick from 1993 starring Tony Curtis in the titular role when he was 67 yearsold. The plot's typical to older mummy movies Forbidden love in the ancient Egyptian world results in the guilty guy getting entombed alive usually with the object of his desire. In the modern day the tomb is desecrated by archaeologists and the mummy seeks vengeance. The refreshing twist here is that when Curtis' character is resurrected he looks like his normal self at least his face anyway his hands look like death itself. Leslie Hardy plays a woman interested in Egyptology and she may be the mummy's beloved Kia reincarnated. Greg Wrangler plays a psychologist who takes interest in her.This is a dramamystery with light horror elements so don't expect heavy gore and scares. While it's clearly lowbudget it has numerous strengths particularly the basic fishoutofwater plot with the ancient mummy becoming a pretty interesting character in the modern world. I'm not sure how he knows how to speak English though but I assume the god he prays to gives him the knowledgepower.In any case the Mummy's offended by the desecrations of Egyptian crypts and points out the obvious How can archaeologists justify desecrating burial sites? How much time has to go by for such activity to be deemed acceptable in the name of research and science?

For one the three main characters are effective and like I said the Mummy is an interesting character and you'll find yourself rooting for his cause. Although Hardy is too thin for my tastes she's a likable and worthy protagonist and Wrangler is an excellent masculine costar. Secondly you can't beat the authentic Egyptian locations. Compare this with Hammer's The Mummy 1959 which was shot entirely in England with lame Egyptian sets. Speaking of which people criticize Tony Curtis for being miscast in this movie and yet Christopher Lee played the same character in the Hammer film and no one seems to criticize him as being miscast not to mention that film is regarded fairly well while this one is typically lambasted which is odd because  lowbudget or not  this is the better film. Thirdly the score is diversified and allaround excellent.The film runs 97 minutes and was shot in Egypt and Israel.GRADE C or B keeping in mind that it's a lowbudget directtovideo flick".

	onyx:emotionText "The Mummy Lives is an American directtovideo flick from 1993 starring Tony Curtis in the titular role when he was 67 yearsold. The plot's typical to older mummy movies Forbidden love in the ancient Egyptian world results in the guilty guy getting entombed alive usually with the object of his desire. In the modern day the tomb is desecrated by archaeologists and the mummy seeks vengeance. The refreshing twist here is that when Curtis' character is resurrected he looks like his normal self at least his face anyway his hands look like death itself. Leslie Hardy plays a woman interested in Egyptology and she may be the mummy's beloved Kia reincarnated. Greg Wrangler plays a psychologist who takes interest in her.This is a dramamystery with light horror elements so don't expect heavy gore and scares. While it's clearly lowbudget it has numerous strengths particularly the basic fishoutofwater plot with the ancient mummy becoming a pretty interesting character in the modern world. I'm not sure how he knows how to speak English though but I assume the god he prays to gives him the knowledgepower.In any case the Mummy's offended by the desecrations of Egyptian crypts and points out the obvious How can archaeologists justify desecrating burial sites? How much time has to go by for such activity to be deemed acceptable in the name of research and science? The Mummy also makes a great point to the woman The modern world is scienceoriented but passionless and without passion there is no life.

The move is in response to Connex losing a number of oil fields in the Persian Gulf region as Prince Nasir AlSubaai his country's foreign minister and the oldest son of the Emir and thus the heir apparent to the throne signed a contract with the Chinese instead. As Killen somehow managed to get the contract for the oil fields in Kazahkstan the merger would give ConnexKillen additional control of the industry in the Middle East. Connex's retained law firm headed by Dean Whiting assigns Bennett Holiday to demonstrate to the US Department of Justice that due diligence has been done to allow the merger to proceed i.e. that the merger would not break any antitrust regulations. The US government is unhappy with Prince Nasir's decision to award the contract to the Chinese and in combination with issues around illegal weapons the CIA assigns field agent Bob Barnes who has ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Syriana is a blistering powerful film about the degree to which governments and corporate conglomerates place the ambition to control the world's oil supply above the well being of their citizens and employees. In this game there are only bad guys and what separates the villains from the protagonists is not a question of who's good and who's bad but rather how bad each is willing to be.So maybe Syriana doesn't tell us anything new. But that doesn't mean its points aren't worth making again and again. And though it is complicated and I'm not going to pretend I followed every detail of its intricate plot it's not that hard to follow. Stephen Gaghan is a good writer and he provides a nice summary of the film's action in its final moments.What emerges from this tangled puzzle is a web of corruption and selfinterest all fueled by the need for oil. In one plot thread the men behind two soontomerge oil companies will stop at nothing to make the merger go through since the new company will be one of the most powerful in the world. In another thread the law firm representing the company proves that it's eager to cash in on the company's new economic success. Meanwhile a power struggle between the two sons of an aging king in an unspecified Middle Eastern country though Saudi Arabia is obviously suggested has attracted the attention of the American government operating through the CIA. America read American business has a vested interest in which of the king's sons succeeds him to the throne It doesn't want the reformminded eldest son whose priorities will be building a country to benefit his own people it wants instead the younger son who will continue to relegate his country to a cosy spot in America's hip pocket and take its orders directly from the president of the USA. And in the film's most chilling plot strand we see how the struggle for oil feeds the radical Islam movement in the Middle East providing young men with a feeling of brotherhood and righteousness in the face of a region they feel has turned its back on them in favor of big business and Western corruption.Syriana is tense fast and furious. Following it can admittedly be somewhat exhausting but if you pay very close attention to the first hour or so as each story is introduced and the relationships between characters become clear the second half of the movie is easier to digest.I disagree with other comments here that the characters aren't developed or that the acting is unimpressive. On the contrary I think all of the actors create extremely nuanced compelling characters a challenging task given the fact that none of them are allowed more than a minute or so at a time to feed us information about themselves. A movie like this could easily fall prey to filling itself with a bunch of stock villains all cocked eyebrows and facial mannerisms rather than fullbodied characterizations and the fact that it avoids this is a tribute to both Gaghan and the cast. And hats off to the editor on this movie who had perhaps the most daunting task of the year.2005 has been full of terse important films fresh in their immediacy. There have been a small number of sensational tough thoughtprovoking films instead of a larger batch of more mediocre ones as has been the case recently. Syriana is one of the best movies of the year it's angry yet it's not hopeless. I hope Americans see this movie. At this time of year when people are trampling each other in malls in order to be first in line for Christmas sales I hope they remember that the vast wealth of America frequently comes at the sake of people all over the world who will never have a fraction of the comfort those in our country take for granted.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Gaghan penned Traffic which was the best film of 2000. Now with Syriana he has developed a companion piece with the oil industry as the backdrop rather than the drug trade. The irony of this is that the films show that both industries are corrupt to the core but only one is legal.In fact by the evidence of these two films one could argue that the drug trade is the less sleazy of the two because it does not exist with the facade of legitimacy that surrounds the oil industry. If I was to make a list of the 10 best films of the decade so far these would both be there.It is tough if not impossible and perhaps even foolish to try and apply one thesis to this film but for me it is that what we as civilians call corruption is simply the culture of the oil business one supported and nurtured by government business traders and lawyers. Noone knows why it exists but it does and if you cannot wade in it you are out of the game.Syriana does not have a plot or a storyline but it throws character and story and information at you by the bucketful. There is no warm up time. Gaghan goes out of his way to show that the people involved in this business are surrounded by a normal world with normal hopes and dreams. This is evident from the opening shot. A title card tells us we are in Tehran but not a some stereotypical open market selling figs. It is a hip hop club.The main story of the film involves a possibly corrupt merger of two major American oil firms. From there everything else fans out. THe story of Jeffrey Wright the government official investigating the merger George Clooney the CIA operative with missions with no apparent goal the Arab Emir from an unnamed oil producing country and his two sons each wanting to take over his reign the industry analyst Matt Damon who will use any situation to advance his firm and the young broke angry Arab youth who look for meaning in life and find it in the most dangerous way.Syriana is not a left wing movie it is surprising apolitical. It is not antiAmerican but it most certainly lays blame on the US and the west for putting oil ahead of all other priorities. It is not sympathetic to terror but its most compelling plot line tell us how a terrorist can be made from a bad combination of hopelessness unemployment anger and poverty.If you are looking for a neat and tidy ending you will be frustrated. The film ends like a truck running into a brick wall with all but one or two plots left hanging. It does not answer any questions because I believe that Gaghan is trying to show that noone is really in charge and that noone really knows what is going on.The acting is near perfect from everyone in the cast including a small two scene brilliant cameo by William Hurt and Oscar worthy work from Clooney and Alexander Siddig as the frustrated Arab prince.This is an important film and it is not to be missed.  out of .".

	schema:reviewBody "The interesting novel by Robert Baer seems to tell it all about Syriana. It is a tale that is driven by the ambition of a few unscrupulous people who will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. In a way Mr. Baer's novel as well as the film seems to be reaffirming Niccolo Machiavelli's The ends justify the meansStephen Gaghan's first major directorial job presents the story in multiple settings running at the same time which for a great majority of the public will prove disorienting. Mr. Gaghan has adapted for the screen material like the one in Syriana before so he wasn't a stranger working in that format. What Syriana presents is a sort of rat race for the control of the oil in the Persian Golf by whatever means necessary. Ultimately the ones in control of that commodity will dominate the world. We are given about five different narratives in the film that interplay one another in the most unexpected ways. In fact all these different subplots have a lot more in common than really meets the eye. One could almost recommend the viewing of the film a couple of times in order for all the different parts to come together in our minds and by doing so the viewer will see the inner mechanisms of this intricate tale of corruption greed and power.The cast is enormous. There are a lot of different acting styles in the film. An almost unrecognizable George Clooney plays Bob Barnes the CIA operative fallen from grace who is instrumental in set the story in motion and who reappears at the end at the climax of the action. Jeffrey Wright does a tremendous job as the lawyer who discovers the hidden mystery in a performance that is completely different from whatever he has done before in the screen. Matt Damon plays the ambitious young man who is at the top of his profession and can help Prince Nasir with his revolutionary views about changes in his country and the Arab world. Ultimately Wasim the poor Pakistani guest worker makes the case for the displaced youth of that world that is willing to go ahead and commit the ultimate sacrifice.There are also good appearances by some seasoned actors that only appear shortly. Tim Blake Nelson Chris Cooper Jayne Atkinson Akbar Kurtha William Hurt Christopher Plummer Robert Foxworth and the rest are seen briefly.Robert Elswit photographed the film in the different locations and makes it look better. The music score by Alexandre Desplat is heard in the background without interrupting the action. The editing by Tim Squires works well with the action. Stephen Gaghan shows he can do well working with Mr. Baer's material and made an interesting film that while it will irritate some viewers on the whole he had the right idea in the way to tell this story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it. I suppose it's one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. I don't consider myself unintelligent I've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it's a 1010 are lying because they think they look better. This film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble I have seen in awhile...Especially considering the critical acclaim the Oscar nods and the cast. Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again. His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he's just trying way too hard. I can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay. On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. I had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what. It was a disaster.Because I don't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think?? Bob Barnes. Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character. Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore.The cast is intense if only the story made sense. I'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb. A missile disappears in Iran but the CIA has other problems the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract. The Department of Justice suspects bribery and the oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat. The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emirapparent fails. Agent Bob Barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross. An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead. The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group. All roads start and end in the oil fields. WHAT!?!? Say who now?? Syriana might be the thinking man's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it. I suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but I promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour. 110".

This is the first film I've seen that illustrates the diversity of clashing Islamic cultures and interests despite that I couldn't keep their interests or motives all quite straight. Though the English subtitles which are commendably outlined in black for unusual legibility wipe out some of the distinctions we can infer that Iranians are speaking Farsi Pakistanis' Urdu and others speaking Arabic all with varying fluency and mutual cultural comprehension let alone manipulators who can speak anything besides their native tongues. We've seen immigrants and guest workers in films critical of Western countries but not the resentmentbrewing conditions of badly treated noncitizens in the oilrich Persian Gulf states like the fictional one here which looks a lot like Dubai or Brunei where clusters of modern skyscrapers contrast with Bedouin goat herders.

While Alexander Siddig seems to have the monopoly on naively idealistic Arabs as his similar character in Kingdom of Heaven against another Crusades history is littered with the interim modernizing liberal tragically caught between powerful forces. Though the proliferation of Westerneducated Arab intellectuals in movies is beginning to sound like all those Japanese generals in World War II movies who went to USC or whatever at least he went to Oxford and not Harvard.

While Christopher Plummer's Ivy League senior partner type has been seen as a shadowy force in countless paranoid thrillers Jeffrey Wright is completely unpredictable and tightly wound though the point of his relationship with his cynical alcoholic father isn't exactly clear except maybe as his conscience. We see before our eyes he goes from as his mentor says a sheep into a lion. Most films have prosecutors like David Clennon's U.S. attorney as a hero against corruption instead of being chillingly dismissed as trust fund lawyers. But the script is so full of such epigrams like In this town you're only innocent until you're investigated that one character calls another on issuing them too brightly.While from the beginning I couldn't quite follow all the machinations around George Clooney's character he is wonderful at transforming from his usual Cary Grant suave to harried dedicated midlevel bureaucrat who literally won't toe the Company line in a dangerous hierarchy that's shown to be a bit more competent than in real life that reminded me both in the gut and guts of Russell Crowe's Wigand in the tobacco wars in The Insider. It recalls how benign corrupt spooks looked in their personal lives as there's much conversation here about houses cars and college tuition. Indirectly the film implicitly shows the dangers to Valerie Plame from her outing as a CIA operative as families and personal connections are constantly used as threats and bargaining chips.Significantly there is not a single mention amidst all these Mideast chicaneries plots and plans of the Zionist entity proving that pro or antiIsrael policies are smoke screens around the main draw  oil.Moviewise these characters seem a lot like the gangsters and their conseglieres in The Godfather carving up Cuba and drug rights let alone Gordon Gekko extolling Greed is good as the ultimate ideology and fits right in with this year's other geopolitical thrillers The Constant Gardener and Lord of War and those weren't even about natural resources. It works better than the remake of The Manchurian Candidate because even though the focal point is a fictional country the issues are real not science fiction. So does this make you ready to get out of your car and onto the train? Because until then we'll still need lots of that oil from the Middle East.".

	schema:headline " Foreign and domestic intrigue";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a complex film that tries to get the audience to connect the dots to see that control of the Middle Eastern oil fields is the goal that is at the heart of so much of the political process both in the Middle East and in the West and that it is also the catalyst for much of what we call terrorism.To accomplish its goal the film introduces a number of characters and a number of seemingly separate story lines in the beginning then tries to weave them all together by the end. That makes for a challenging first hour or so in which the film jumps back and forth from one storyline to another. It can be confusing but not too confusing if you pay close attention.And it does weave them together in the last half hour so the pay off is there. But the conclusion it reaches is not a happy one for many Americans for what the movie seems to say is American oil companies use any means necessary including double crosses and outright murder to protect their access to Middle Eastern oil.Well enough for the political message. But does it work as a movie? The answer in my view is yes but its a qualified yes.The plot centers around the merger of two American oil companies one a industry giant which has just lost a big contract in Saudi Arabia to the Chinese the other a small independent Texas outfit that has just won a lucrative contract in a smaller Mideast nation and is now going to be very cash rich. But there's a hitch. Did the Texas outfit bribe foreign officials violating the US Corrupt Practices act. Fearing a Justice Department investigation that could block the merger it hires a high priced Washington law firm to conduct its own investigation to see what Justice might dig up against it.At the same time the Emir of a Persian Gulf oil kingdom is about to retire to Europe and has to pick between two sons to succeed him. One is a pool shooting playboy the other a serious reform minded idealist. Problem is the idealist might not be so anxious to allow US troops to continue to garrison on his soil while his fun loving brother wants nothing more than to have the Americans there to protect his privileged lifestyle from Islamic radicals. And as all this unfolds a young Palestinian refugee thrown out of work by a shift in control of the oil fields is recruited by alQaida or something like it and becomes involved in a terrorist bombing plot using a weapon originally delivered by a CIA covert op to the Middle East.But where the movie falls down is that it fails in someways to weave a human story into this and human stories after all are what the movies are all about. George Clooney does a fine job as a sort of world weary CIA agent caught up in the skullduggery. Although not particularly introspective he does on occasion give you the impression that he's trying to figure out if he works for the US government or the Houston Petroleum Club. Matt Damen plays an oil industry analyst who is an adviser to the idealist candidate for emir and he is given the task of adding the human element to the story after his young son drowns in a swimming pool. Unfortunately Damon falls completely flat registering almost zero emotion in his role as an exasperated advocate of democracy and reform or even as grieving dad. The talented Amande Peet ties her best as his wife but gets little screen time and also delivers a weak performance.And these only partially successful performances and outright failures are where Syriana fails as a film. What Syriana lacks is a clear cut central character whose fate is linked to the complex story lines. Clooney's character is as close as we get and he does not get enough screen time to really get us involved with him and the moral questions he faces. He at one point is directly involved in an assassination plot then tries to stop it. The lead up to that is the most suspenseful of the film but Clooney's out of nowhere insertion in the payoff scene is the movie's weakest moment as if the filmmakers had to recast his character as a born again good guy despite the silliness of his actions.In the end movies rise and fall not by their political message but by how their central characters grab us. The Grapes of Wrath one of Hollywood's greatest political films works in the end because the complex multicharacter story is really the story of Tom Joad and Henry Fonda's portrayal of this character will forever haunt us.That simply doesn't happen in Syriana. While we might feel for George Clooney's character he is not one who we can fall in love with. Clooney's CIA agent comes off as a tool discarded by his handlers when he is no longer useful. But the fact that he did not see until the end that he was working not for his country but for big oil makes him a kind of sad dupe and that does not a movie hero make. Actually had he gotten more screen time he might well have been a more sympathetic character. But that would have given us less time to ponder the role of the oil companies in all this.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a complex film that tries to get the audience to connect the dots to see that control of the Middle Eastern oil fields is the goal that is at the heart of so much of the political process both in the Middle East and in the West and that it is also the catalyst for much of what we call terrorism.To accomplish its goal the film introduces a number of characters and a number of seemingly separate story lines in the beginning then tries to weave them all together by the end. That makes for a challenging first hour or so in which the film jumps back and forth from one storyline to another. It can be confusing but not too confusing if you pay close attention.And it does weave them together in the last half hour so the pay off is there. But the conclusion it reaches is not a happy one for many Americans for what the movie seems to say is American oil companies use any means necessary including double crosses and outright murder to protect their access to Middle Eastern oil.Well enough for the political message. But does it work as a movie? The answer in my view is yes but its a qualified yes.The plot centers around the merger of two American oil companies one a industry giant which has just lost a big contract in Saudi Arabia to the Chinese the other a small independent Texas outfit that has just won a lucrative contract in a smaller Mideast nation and is now going to be very cash rich. But there's a hitch. Did the Texas outfit bribe foreign officials violating the US Corrupt Practices act. Fearing a Justice Department investigation that could block the merger it hires a high priced Washington law firm to conduct its own investigation to see what Justice might dig up against it.At the same time the Emir of a Persian Gulf oil kingdom is about to retire to Europe and has to pick between two sons to succeed him. One is a pool shooting playboy the other a serious reform minded idealist. Problem is the idealist might not be so anxious to allow US troops to continue to garrison on his soil while his fun loving brother wants nothing more than to have the Americans there to protect his privileged lifestyle from Islamic radicals. And as all this unfolds a young Palestinian refugee thrown out of work by a shift in control of the oil fields is recruited by alQaida or something like it and becomes involved in a terrorist bombing plot using a weapon originally delivered by a CIA covert op to the Middle East.But where the movie falls down is that it fails in someways to weave a human story into this and human stories after all are what the movies are all about.

	schema:reviewBody "Syriana starring Matt Damon and George Clooney reveals a possible honesty in foreign political corruption. The movie starts out a bit discombobulating but the ending unleashes a truism in our society. Directed and written by Stephen Gaghan Screenplay for Traffic 2000 the script for Syriana shows not only a smart liberalapproached storyline but also how much the American and Arabian lives becomes juxtaposed by oil politics. Based on the nonfiction book See No Evil by Robert Baer Syriana takes its viewer step by step through the birth and processes of terrorism and tears at the roots from where all violence and corruption derives.The movie starts with the introduction of a character Bob George Clooney an American CIA agent who works in the Middle East for years witnessing the destruction of social injustice. The movie then turns light to the American governmental affairs and its due process to make oil business proposals and governmental decisions to promote oil driven businesses in the Middle East. Bryan Matt Damon struggling to survive in America's capitalistic society thrives to introduce business opportunities in the Middle East but before completing any deals with reformer and leader Prince Nasir all the characters including a young Arabic man suffering from American politics and social injustices end up experiencing sacrifices beyond comprehensible. The movie leaves its audience stunned with a raw realism that the world we live is not a pretty picture and all the beliefs you trust can be questionable. Although the movie definitely wouldn't exactly be a feel good movie its thought provoking and enlightening and I don't think it was ever meant to be a feel good movie. The movie shows a perspective worth learning considering and understanding. And although the movie takes the viewer through a rollercoaster of different lives and people objectives at the beginning of the film the movie ties in brilliantly to connect not only the characters lives but the lives of the audience and everyone's lives who have capitalistic motives.".

It starts out with a bang and never lets up but all too often it overplays the technicalities of political lingo in lieu of focusing more on the personal story lines so the only story that gets the full treatment is not that of CIA operative Robert Barnes but of a Pakistani immigrant Wahid Khan Mazhar Munir who evolves from being a man who cannot get a job because he does not know the language to a man on a suicide mission not unlike many suicide bombers who have left videotaped messages for those to listen and ponder.SYRIANA never takes active sides with anyone because of its attempts to expose a massive oil conspiracy by our own governmental interests which makes us as a Nation seem scarier than anything shown in 1984. We freely invade other countries and lead them by their noses pretending to be their aides using up their resources until there is nothing else and kill those who have honest interests in advancing their povertystricken nations such as the MiddleEastern prince Alexander Siddig who in wanting to form an alliance with China had his assets frozen and was declared a terrorist. America has developed such a leeching presence in the Middle Eastern area and SYRIANA like MANDERLAY paints an unflattering picture of us as a nation of greed.As in the case of most Stephen Soderbergh produced or related projects the same team brings forth a compelling but somewhat abstract picture that runs the risk of running away from the viewer at any moment due to its very complexity. However all of the stories presented here are terrific if a little incomplete and everyone is equal in exacting performances which portray the people on display. George Clooney is excellent as Robert Barnes Matt Damon is deceiving as Bryan Woodman the man who sells his soul to oil Jeffrey Wright is understated as the lawyer investing a series of discrepancies between two merger oil companies. Amanda Peet Christopher Plummer Jamey Sheridan Chris Cooper and William Hurt round up a great cast.".

An expert in this region he speaks Farsi is tight with Hezbollah and even infiltrated alQeada.Story 2 Energy expert and financial consultant Bryan Woodman Damon lives a great life in Geneva with his lovely wife Julie Amanda Peet The Whole 10 Yards and his two adorable little boys.Story 3 Attorney Bennett Holiday Jeffrey Wright Broken Flowers is hired by a Connex Oil Co. bigwig Christopher Plummer The Insider to find out any dirt on Connex's proposed merger with the small Kemmer Corporation before the Feds do. It seems that Kemmer has procured a deal with the vast oil fields of Kasakistan while Connex has just lost a big Saudi contract to the Chinese.Story 4 A young Arab Olivier Yglesias despondent and unemployed because of the merger is recruited into a radical Muslim terrorist organization.And Story 5 A Saudi king passes up his oldest son Prince Nasir Alexander Siddig  a reformer and visionary who desires to bring progress and civil rights to his country  in favor of his lessqualified younger brother Sam Georges said who conveniently supports keeping US troops in his country.That's basically the plot setup. Now the wheels begin to turn. Barnes is assigned by the CIA to arrange the assassination of Nasir instead he is subjected to brutal torture by a rogue terrorists led by Mussawi Mark Strong Oliver Twist. Woodman becomes Nasir's chief financial adviser after his son's tragic death. Holiday working with Kemmer honcho Jimmy Pope finds a crooked connection in that company's big deal and offers to cut a deal with the US Attorney's office. Later after some bungling the agency distances itself from Barnes who heads to Saudi Arabi in an attempt to stop another plot against Nasir. Competently written and directed by Stephan Gaghan who won a screenplay Oscar in 2000 for Traffic another complex multilayered film this time about the drug trade Syriana can be seen as either a cerebral thoughtful intelligent complex motion picture or a convoluted confusing mishmash of a movie.To me it's a little bit of both with the overriding message that oil ruins everything it touches and the United States with its secret dealings underhanded alliances and shady involvement in other governments is pretty much evil. Many people however may run out of patience before the movie ends which seems to be almost glacial at times.Evidently Gaghan did a lot of research here especially with Saudi royalty and the intricate plots show this likewise the many location shots give a true gritty feel to the picture. Use of Arabic and Farsi along with English subtitles also gives the movie a realistic look.The acting on the other hand leaves something to be desired. Damon is his usual cute boy self Peet is nondescript Plummer is menacingly devious and Clooney bloated and bearded for the role seems to sleepwalk through the role. It is a huge contrast to his dynamic work in the terrific Good Night And Good Luck. I cannot say I enjoyed the film but it was a decent effort which deserves a look. Whether that mild recommendation means anything I can't say. I have a feeling though that it will not translate into very big box office.".

Having seen the trailer and being a thrillerlover I expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policymaking and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle. Well I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don't care. Save your money save your time choose another movie.Robi Chernitsky".

The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.".

I had to wake up the people I was watching it with several times. After it was over I felt bad for having woken them up. Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does. It was easy to loose track of people's motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing. By the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died. Everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three. And worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are. If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching. I was brought in expecting the excitement of '24.' I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman.".

Syriana was one of those times and I left after about 70 minutes just after a very unpleasant torture scene. The film started out somewhat confusing but that is not uncommon in the actionthriller genre. I stuck with it thinking the plot would gradually develop and all the threads would come together well I waited and waited and it just got more and more confusing so after an hour or so I was still not really sure what it was all about.As far as being an Oscar nomination for best screenplay  thats amazing  the screenplay is the foundation of a movie on which everything else is built so its hard to see how this could have been viewed as being in the top 4 or 5 scripts of 2005. Given that George Clooney has the script as a given to work with his performance was adequate but hardly exceptional or particularly worthy of an award. More to the point Clooney won his Oscar in the category of Best Supporting Actor  though as far I could work out his was the leading role with Matt Damon in the supporting role. All in all this was the worst Hollywood movies I have seen in the last couple of years.".

I'm a big movie fan and see most movies and for the most part enjoy all genres. Action Adventure Drama Kids movies even Chick Flicks at times and I rarely dislike films even bad ones are usually tolerable. But I have to stand up for all the movie goers out there like myself just looking to see a good flick something fun with the basic feature of being understandable  This is not it! This was the first movie ever that I honestly would have felt good about asking for a refund. It was that bad in my mind. There were only 20 or so people in the theater and I think I counted 4 or 5 that got up and left. One guy came back in stood in the doorway for 15 minutes and left again.I mean this movie being compared to Traffic is ridiculous! Sure it tries to have that similar style of having many small stories with many different characters that TYPICALLY all come together in the end but Syriana just left you hanging! I sat there waiting for something to happen but it just didn't! There was no resolve no story no nothing. Just a bunch of political jibber jabber that made no sense. I not only didn't understand what anyone was saying or doing throughout the entire show but after awhile I just didn't care. I just wanted the nightmare to end so I could go home and chew on Reynolds Wrap.If you want to see how this type of movie should be made go see Crash 21 Grams or even Magnolia which was fairly painful to sit through but was far far better than this pointless waste of money. Honestly I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental not even a dollar rental at your local grocery store heck if someone gave you this movie for free I would use it as a Frisbee for your dog before I would waste two hours of your life on it! Generally IMDb is a great source of reviews and I think a good way to get an idea about whether or not to see a show I use it all the time but Syriana receiving a 7.2 just blows my mind! It saddens me to think that most of you will believe the other 90 of comments that give this movie a high rating and will watch but I'm sure some of you will agree with me and wish you hadn't.Oh yea and can someone please tell me what the crap Syriana even means!!???".

Don't waste your time unless you agree with the political message and feel some need to support it. If you want an enjoyable movie with a good plot look elsewhere. They should have organized the movie differently if they wanted people to follow it better. The characters were not defined. If you want to watch Geo.

Quite a beautiful palate and always visually interesting. The plot itself was engrossing and featured many layers of subplots involving the panopoly of characters we meet and their relationships to each other growing up maturing dealing with life challenges and all sprinkled with the spice of magic and imagination thanks to the angelic innocence of the 9 year old quasi dieci Peppino. What a fun journey and transporting experience into a beautiful culture and scintillating story. I enjoyed each character and marveled at how richly each of their individual worlds were explored. While employing a bit of fantasy and imagination the film never lost touch with the sense of true reality we all face each day. Hope to see this at the Oscars next year.".

It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars who perform as The Twins. Don't let this put you off. These girls can act at least well enough for this type of film and add a lot of charm to the proceedings. Jackie Chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings.

I regret only that Universal cheats the Brazilian consumers with a huge picture and the name of Jackie Chan on the cover of the DVD released in Brazil.

	schema:reviewBody "If you go into the Twins Effect looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience you will be disappointed. This is not to say it is bad but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie running in a similar vein to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's resolutely silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious Hong Kong action look to a John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping movie. This movie's got a lot of flak for it's silliness and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what you're getting into as it's disappointed a lot of purists.For the nonpurists and those with more forgiving tastes though Twins Effect is a delightfully silly kungfu comedy. I liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act. I believe this is the first movie of it's type they've been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned pros.The patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite knowingly written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud. The comedy really is the most prominent thing here and it's a subtle gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la Stephen Chow. It has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too. The sequence with the discodancing vampires is a total classic.The action is a blend of two genres really. It falls between the 'period drama' wireandsword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of Jackie Chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters.All this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through. Despite this it does have a few sticking points. For instance Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernised than kungfu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the Blade series is definitely sound as an example though Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade ever managed especially for fighting action. Personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong the hissable villain from John Woo's classic Hard Boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about Hard Boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal gripe.If you watch this with an open mind you'll probably enjoy it greatly like I did but you must be firmly aware it is a COMEDY not a balls to the wall kungfu movie. Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.".

It can be compared to Blade in the sense of intense action against vampires early on. There wasn't the excessive gore factor which I believe ruins some films.For most of the film through the middle it slacks off quite a bit. It is written into too much as a love story and the jokes fall pretty flat.At one point in the film after the ambulance scene I became excessively frustrated with trying to take this seriously.The last twenty minutes or so really pick it up. The fighting is well choreographed and the CGI was used well not to an excess.The beginning and end really assist the film. A rewrite of the middle could create a very strong movie that could set its place near Blade.Still it's better than Vampire in Brooklyn.".

I thought I had to see it. I didn't know whether to love it or hate it. The character development is slow but quite interesting.  You really have to love the personality that each of the girls brings in.Gypsy AhJiao Really makes her mark as a possible action or drama hero. Her acting is very skillful and thankfully not overdone. Helen AhSa also brings charm to the screen but more in a quite concious overacting Which though sometimes annoying is also quite endearing.The Vampires are scary funny and different at the same time.  The film pulls elements from Buffy the Vampire slayer as well as kind of a eurocoolness for the Vamps.  It is a crazy mix and doesn't exactly pull me into the film but it pushes the plot through and though not convincing they are fun.Obviously some of the draw to the movie is the great ensemble cast which includes several Hong Kong stars and starlets.  Jackie Chan and Karen Mok bring some of the funniest and most endearing scenes in the movie. Karen as a boozeloving bride steals the scene in her short cameo.Action Romance Vampires and cool stunts really make this a good all around movie.  It can be a date movie or an action flick or just a fun mindless movie.  In the beginning I said that when I saw it I didn't know whether to love it or hate it.  Well now I've seen it about 12 times and I love it more with each viewing.  My recommendation is give it a chance you may like it.BY the way the opening song done by Jackie and Twins is really cool if you want to hear it with the vocals look it up The song's name is Bian Bian Bian  It really is a good piece of HK Pop.I give this movie an 8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " A pretty tight entertaining martial arts film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I think a strength of this film is that it never takes itself too seriously. The subject matter is fairly dark a love square revolving around a Vampire Hunter his new assistant his sister and a vampire prince who is being hunted by his fellows so that a vampire lord may ascend and become a daywalker.The love story between the Sister and the Prince is cute and touching at times. He falls for her instantly and pursues her with vigilance and charm not falling on the very clichd vampire seduction. How does a girl resist a guy who risks his life just to see her during the day?The movie does a good job foreshadowing the action. The hunters use an equalizer that quickly plays into the HunterAssistant relationship. The story shows us right away what the girls are capable of with a hilarious fight over a stuffed bear. Even Jackie Chan's bit part ends up being more than a cameo as his characters reappears to help the heroes out.The choreography was refreshing to me. I watched Hero recently and while the story was excellent the fights were laughable with people spinning around in the air like they just had a major stumble in zero gravity. In Vampire Effect the action ranges from car chases tug a war with a stuffed bear a tight roof top chase with capoeria involved an excellent all out brawl between the girls and the legions of vampires and extensive use of grappling techniques which I rarely see in movies.The use of caucasian actors for most of the vampires was clever it fit into the plot as these type of beasts were supposed to be from out of town. They also looked tall pale and alien against the mostly Asian cast.If you like good choreography a bit of angst and a nice dose of humor. I would recommend it. Don't expect Hero.".

The subject matter is fairly dark a love square revolving around a Vampire Hunter his new assistant his sister and a vampire prince who is being hunted by his fellows so that a vampire lord may ascend and become a daywalker.The love story between the Sister and the Prince is cute and touching at times. He falls for her instantly and pursues her with vigilance and charm not falling on the very clichd vampire seduction. How does a girl resist a guy who risks his life just to see her during the day?The movie does a good job foreshadowing the action. The hunters use an equalizer that quickly plays into the HunterAssistant relationship. The story shows us right away what the girls are capable of with a hilarious fight over a stuffed bear. Even Jackie Chan's bit part ends up being more than a cameo as his characters reappears to help the heroes out.The choreography was refreshing to me. I watched Hero recently and while the story was excellent the fights were laughable with people spinning around in the air like they just had a major stumble in zero gravity. In Vampire Effect the action ranges from car chases tug a war with a stuffed bear a tight roof top chase with capoeria involved an excellent all out brawl between the girls and the legions of vampires and extensive use of grappling techniques which I rarely see in movies.The use of caucasian actors for most of the vampires was clever it fit into the plot as these type of beasts were supposed to be from out of town. They also looked tall pale and alien against the mostly Asian cast.If you like good choreography a bit of angst and a nice dose of humor. I would recommend it. Don't expect Hero.";

	schema:reviewBody "spoilersJust like Storm Riders 1998 Twins Effect is a Hong Kong production released with an eye on the international market. The somewhat puzzling title of the movie in fact cannot be simpler. It capitalises on the phenomenal success of the pop group Twins the two young ladies who were catapulted to stardom within months of their debut winning the hearts of Hong Kong fans from three to eighty. Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung have since ventured into the realm of the silver screen making movies separately as well as together as in this one. This movie is made for the Twins.By comparison the two male leads Ekin Cheng Reeve the champion of the Vampire Slayers and Edison Chen Kazaf the vampire prince are reduced to what I might coin as supportinglead' roles. Those who have seen the Storm Riders would remember Cheng as the model hero in that excellent adaptation of Hong Kong's most popular comic series. The other male lead young pop idol Chen born and raised in Vancouver made his film debut in another internationally released Hong Kong movie GenX Cops 2 2000.Two other people to watch for particularly are Anthony Wong Academy of Performing Arts trained versatile veteran who should be well known to people familiar with Hong Kong movies and Josie Ho who made quite an impression in Purple Storm 1999. While reasonable screen time has been given to Wong who is always a joy to watch I'm disappointed that Ho's appearance is so brief that it is really just a cameo role albeit one in which she smashes and slashes the living daylight out of quite a few vampires. Talking about cameo roles there are quite a few including Jackie Chan who needs no introduction and Karen Mok one of the most talented entertainers Hong Kong has ever produced. The others would be known to the Hong Kong audience only.One tagline that had been used for Twins Effect was Buffy the Eastern Version' for obvious reasons teenage girl battling vampires. This however is about as far as the similarity goes. Buffy is a comedy period. Twins Effect is an action flick which tries also to be many other things in fact too many.Let me go back to Storm Rider which is hailed by many as THE best Hong Kong production in terms of overall quality. If my memory serves me this fantasy took about two years to make which is almost a fantasy in the context of Hong Kong movies many of which were shot within a week in the hay days.Coming back to Twins Effect in a recent radio interview Cheng intimated that its making encountered some of the difficulties inherent with the process of movie making in Hong Kong where the script is a LIVING THING that grows and sometime mutates as the film is being shot. This was not a problem with Storm Rider because based on an immensely popular comic in Hong Kong comparable to Superman in the States the characters and story line were not susceptible to manipulation. The script of Twins Effect however apparently went through 5 versions DURING not before the shooting of the movie. I truly sympathise with the chap who apparently was expected to play his character one way today and a different way tomorrow.Continuing with the comparison Storm Rider is a fantasy epic with an element of melodramatic tragedy. Twins Effect on the other hand starts out looking like a comedy. It then goes on to try out melodramatic romance horror and tragedy roughly in that order. In the end the only impression it really leaves is its action in which it has done not too badly. While Storm Rider boasts of the best special effects ever seen in a Hong Kong production the success or otherwise of Twins Effect hinges on its action sequences. And there is a reason for this.The two lead young ladies in real life are reported to be planning to split up next year a wise decision to allow them to each try something new before the pop fans get a chance to grow tired of the combination. Twins Effect gives them a chance to test the waters. Gillian Chung for one aspires to follow the footsteps of Michelle Yeoh. You bet she is dead serious under the guidance of master Donny Yan to show her stuff. Well you don't make a martial art expert even just for the screen overnight. However Chung's effort is commendable. After all Michelle Yeoh was beauty queen before she was fighting star.Overall the action sequences in Twins Effect are respectable. Whether you like it or not is very much a matter of personal taste. What Twins Effect offers is along the line of blood and sweat scream and groan as opposed to the stylish choreography in Matrix reloaded. Take your pick.In conclusion Twins Effect is one good action flick from Hong Kong since Storm Rider but not quite in the same league.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Twins Effect  Chinese ActionComedy  Charlene Choi Gillian ChungThis vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie. First of all the characters are memorable contributing a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first exposure to them and all I wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a REALLY BIG HUG. The remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including Jackie Chan Karen Mok The Duke Josie Ho Edison Chen Anthony Wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to Will Ferrell. Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this one. Good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences.And speaking of action this film has plenty of it. More importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography. One aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists  a sword with a retractable spearended rope. This weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices. In addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights  one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale. In fact the bladewielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and I truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in Ashes of Time Storm Riders or A Man Called Hero with the wellplanned precisely executed sequences seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close. I can't understand why this film gets so much criticism. I'm sure diehard apologists for the Hong Kong Golden Age will hate this because it doesn't fit into their narrowminded view of what Hong Kong action should be. We should learn from the downfall of John Woo  a one trick pony who never learned how to reinvent himself. We don't need another clone. We need something different. The Twins Effect is one good example.This film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other Chinese movies with the same actors and actresses. This especially applies to Ekin Cheng whose other films almost always suck  and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even The Twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role e.g. Beyond Our Ken Good Times Bed Times House of Fury or when one or both are in supporting roles e.g. Colour of the Truth New Police Story Just One Look. The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy. I am still yearning to see Charlene and Gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that The Twins Effect hits on all cylinders optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in Protg de la Rose Noire.All in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained. And may I remind the reader that it is precisely this  ENTERTAINMENT  that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about.In the end the Twins Effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed.Rating  55 stars P.S.  The Hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the U.S. by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes. However the final fight of the U.S. version does have a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore I purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 120 mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the U.S. version.".

	schema:reviewBody "...And I don't mean that they have released The Twins Effect uncut and uneditedno I mean just the opposite. It may be blasphemy to say in the kneejerk antiDimension fanboy world of HK film but the original Hong Kong version of this film was a sloppy unfocused barelywatchable highly derivative repetitive mess. Oftentimes in the original version it seems as though we're watching several different stories that have little connection even though by the end we finally realize that all these characters actually are interconnected. The US version retitled Vampire Effect has undergone some scene shifting altering the sequence of events and thus bringing us directly into the plot right away. For example instead of starting as the original does with a spectacular action sequence that unfortunately has much less to do with the overall plot the US version starts off with a more lowkey scene that establishes some of the conflict introduces key characters and also sets the toneclueing us in that the film we're about to see is going to be both Gothic and comic. THEN we jump into the action which by the way has been considerably tightened.

These scenes remind me of one of those uncomfortable conversations in which one of the participants feels compelled to keep talking to fill the dead air because the other one has nothing to say at all. Vampire on the other hand moves along giving us at least the illusion of a coherent story though a couple of completely extraneous but pretty damn entertaining cameo appearances by Jackie Chan are preserved mostly intact.Another interesting and somewhat ironic effect of Dimension's reediting is this even though many scenes featuring the very cute titular Twins Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi have been cut from the US version they are actually brought to the fore as THE main characters in the film. Of course this is due in no small part to the even more significant reduction in speaking scenes for Ekin Cheng and equally drenched in irony is the fact that his role is made all the more interesting as a silentbutdeadly type.This was a good move as the Twins are very cute and charismatic. Besides watching cute chicks fight vampires is much more fun that watching some dude fighting vampires right? I think Buffy the Vampire Slayer proves that and by negative example that crapfest Van Helsing.. There could still be MORE of the girls involved in actual Vampire fighting but Dimension didn't have the option to shoot more film but could only bring out the best elements of the movie by eliminating unnecessary footage.So as evil as people seem to think this kind of thing is these days I say that Dimension's traditional HK hack job was just what this particular film needed.".

	onyx:emotionText "...And I don't mean that they have released The Twins Effect uncut and uneditedno I mean just the opposite. It may be blasphemy to say in the kneejerk antiDimension fanboy world of HK film but the original Hong Kong version of this film was a sloppy unfocused barelywatchable highly derivative repetitive mess. Oftentimes in the original version it seems as though we're watching several different stories that have little connection even though by the end we finally realize that all these characters actually are interconnected. The US version retitled Vampire Effect has undergone some scene shifting altering the sequence of events and thus bringing us directly into the plot right away. For example instead of starting as the original does with a spectacular action sequence that unfortunately has much less to do with the overall plot the US version starts off with a more lowkey scene that establishes some of the conflict introduces key characters and also sets the toneclueing us in that the film we're about to see is going to be both Gothic and comic. THEN we jump into the action which by the way has been considerably tightened.

This movie was off the chain beautiful fight scenes and nice special effects. A very good step up for Ekin Cheng because Tokyo Raiders was terrible.Anyway the storyline was nice as well with the whole potion effect it he didn't take the potion to reverse the effect he would fully become a vampire. If Blade would have had this kind of action in it as far as fighting it would have busted the box office wide open. Not saying the Blade had bad action or anything like that. This movie was put together very nicely. So if you are a vampire movie buff and an even deeper martial arts movie fan then there in no way in hell that you should not check this movie out.I didn't want to spoil anything but by all means give this movie a try.

	schema:reviewBody "Although I've seen several of them now I still don't know if I actually LIKE Catherine Breillat films. Her films are a strange contradiction On one hand they contain a lot of pretty graphic sex and always feature some of the most attractive actresses in Europe and this one with Asia Argento and Roxanne Mesquia is certainly no exception. On the other though they are often very depressing and told with such a harsh feminist bent that they probably make most people well most men anywayfeel more like castrating themselves than getting turned on.  I actually haven't even seen her most notorious film Fat Girl but after the truly depressing experience that was the supposedly very similar 36 Fillete I've never wanted to.You would expect then given Breillat's typical misanthropic bent that when she made a French costume drama like this one the liaisons would be even more dangerous and the intentions even crueler. This is actually a surprisingly softhearted film though where all the main characters are pretty likable and sympathetic at least in some ways. The only typically harsh Breillat touch is a couple having frenzied sex next to the funeral pyre of their dead daughter. The basic story involves a handsome young rake who is about to marry a beautiful young heiress Mesquia with the blessing of her jadedbutwise grandmother who since this is set in 1835 is herself a battlescarred veteran of the original prerevolutionary dangerous liaison era. He is unable to give up his longtime mistress however a socialclimbing Spanish divorce Argento with whom he has had a passionate ten year lovehate relationship. All the acting is very good and the characters believable although you do have to wonder why a 19th Spanish noblewoman would have a tattoo on her butt. My only real complaint was that it was about a half an hour too long and the climax was pretty anticlimactic.If you like either French costume dramas or typical Catherine Breillat films you may or may not like this since it ends being very different than either. It's not too bad though.".

It is widely known that Ryno has kept a notorious mistress the SpanishItalian Vellini for the past ten years. A few days before his marriage Ryno pays a call on Vellini and tells her that he will stop coming to see her. She is clearly distressed and after copulating for one supposedly final time he leaves her with a bad feeling between them. Ryno must then explain himself to Hermangarde's elderly grandmother the Marquise de Flers who demands an explanation for the rumours and aspersions that the gossips have been whispering. Ryno swears that he loves Hermangarde and then tells the Marquise the story of his and Vellini's affair.There follows a long flashback in which the affair is relayed. We see their initial intense courting  she hates Ryno at first but after he is nearly killed in a duel by her decrepit husband she gives herself totally to him. They run off to Algeria have a daughter who tragically dies spend a lot of time screwing and then decide that they are no longer in love. Despite separating they can't keep away from each other and it is only Ryno's current love for Hermangarde which has finally in his mind ended the affair. The Marquise is satisfied with the marriage going ahead in pomp and ceremony with various misogynist readings from St. Paul peppering the service.But Vellini is not got away from so easy. She stalks her exlover and he soon drifts back into her bed. Hermangarde's heart is broken Ryno feels bad but there's nothing anyone can do. The gossips feel justified in their initial worries but we've seen the situation being far more complicated that they can ever grasp.The brilliance of The Last Mistress is that it fully convinces in it's portrayal of a love affair which operates beyond the socially acceptable structures of sexual relationships. Ryno and Vellini obviously work together but not all of the time and not fulfilling all of each other's needs. Ryno did genuinely love Hermangarde and wish to settle down with her  whether that was from himself or imposed on him by social convention is an unanswered question  but nevertheless is he drawn inexorably back to the woman with who he shares an intense though imperfect and illegitimate bond. The story is very carefully placed within the social structure and ideological values of its time  which is why the wedding scene with its long misogynist orations is so important. Vellini and Ryno as well are not made for these ideological bounds  and the tension between the avenues society gives them and the desires they have within causes them no end of pain.The characters are fully realised sexual beings. Although we don't see the copulating sexual organs as in Romance we do understand that these are people with sexual organs and that the use they put to those parts of their body is connected to the very core of their being. The actors especially the stunningly beautiful lead actor Fu'ad Ait Aattou all do superb jobs of showing the emotional havoc the story wreaks on them. There's a distance to the filming which allows us to see the story without getting too caught up with it although the costumes sets and cinematography all have a seductive beauty.There's also a stylisation going on whereby the actors don't age throughout the narrative as it they are beautiful beings frozen in the roles they are enacting  timeless and eternally suffering. A ravishing and quite wonderful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Breillat's films are mostly small budget contemporary provocations with a feminist bent. This one her twelfth she says cost as much as ten previous ones and is a costume drama based on a controversial novel by JulesAmde Barbey d'Aurevilly 18081889. This is a bit confusing the film begins by saying it's the century of Choderlos de Laclos author of Dangerous Liaisons. but his famous work was written in 1782 and the action of d'Aurevilly's novel is set in 1835. The point is the story is about the French aristocracy and in the early nineteenth century its members still believed in and lived by the libertinism of Laclos.In fact The Last Mistress Une vieille maitresse is a transitional story that links the two centuries and in a sense presents a romantic conception of the eighteenth century. Ryno de Marigny beautiful newcomer Fu'ad Ait Aattou is a high born young man who has squandered his wealth on his Spanish mistress the willful Vellini Asia Argento in her element with whom he's been involved for ten years. Allocine calls Ryno a kind of romantic Valmont. But that's just it there was nothing romantic about de Laclos' cruel and manipulative Valmont and Ryno is a new posteighteenthcentury conception of the eighteenthcentury libertine that is titillated by his freedom but adds the emotional dressing of romantic passion. Breillat obviously loves this combination is at home with it and has given it deliriously appropriate treatment in this minor but beautiful lush and thoroughly enjoyable film.The Breillat touch is perhaps most visible in the lovemaking scenes between Vellini and Ryno in which there is much nudity and specificity of physical detail. Fu'ad Ait Aattou has pale skin and bigger lips than Asia Argento. By intention both are androgynous this is Breillat's conception of Choderlos de Laclos's and d'Aurevilly's libertines. The two actors are perfectly matched for this. Vellini is the aggressor it is she who makes love with Ryno using him like a lovely male statue made of alabaster. He is passionate like a romantic lover however that is he's hung up on her forever no matter what he tries. Early on he fights a duel with her English husband and is wounded in the shoulder. The sex sequences are specific and fleshy as in no other costume drama but Breillat is not creating an anachronistic work. As she explained in the NYFF press QA she is passionate about the quality of her period detail and bought tons of lush materials and costumes. The dress the jewelry and the interiors are all completely authentic and there is a rich color scheme in which red and green and yellow predominate. Without seeming overglossy it's not eyecandy like Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette The Last Mistress is a pleasure to look at. It's also a pleasure to listen to with its choice use of ornate and witty language. Oldtimer Michael Lonsdale as the gossipy Le vicomte de Prony particularly relishes his wellturned phrases.As the story gets under way Ryno has now found a wife the beautiful young blonde noblewoman Hermangarde Breillat regular Roxane Mesquida and he's in love with her and tired of Villini. Hermangarde's grandmother the Marquise de Flers nonactress Claude Sarraute daughter of novelist Nathalie is responsible for vetting Ryno and in a lengthy sequence that's the heart of the film he confesses to her everything about his relationship with Vellini. After much has been told and shown on screen in an amusing moment we see the Marquise reclining low in her seat she is exhausted but entranced. She wants to hear every detail. The Marquise is of course of the older generationa real Choderlos de Laclos lady. For her the information that Ryno is a true libertine is proof that he is reliable not an unknown quantity.

Case in point Ryno de Marigny Fu'ad Ait Aattou an impoverished but elegantly handsome young man who is trapped between the aristocratic world to which he aspires and an obsessive bond with a defiantly independent mistress the boldly seductive Vellini Asia Argento an older but dazzling Spanish woman said to be born of an Italian noblewoman and a bullfighter. Adapted from a 19thcentury novel Une vieille matresse by JulesAmde Barbey d'Aurevilly Catherine Breillat's beautiful and elegant The Last Mistress challenges the patriarchal assumptions of the age by depicting a 36year old woman's right to fully express her sexual desires even if it is means flaunting society's conventions and Christian misogynist teachings.Set in Paris in 1835 complete with elaborate period costumes and sumptuously decorated drawing rooms the film opens with the gossip between two aging aristocrats the Vicomte de Prony Michael Lonsdale and his wife the Countess d'Artelles Yolande Moreau about the tenyear affair between de Marigny and Vellini and the young man's impending marriage to the wealthy Hermangarde Roxane Mesquida. Hermangarde's grandmother La marquise de Flers excellently played by the 80yearold French writer Claude Sarrate is an openminded and rational individual who claims to be a woman of the 18th century. Worried that Ryno will not be able to get over his passion for his fiery Spanish mistress de Flers listens attentively as Ryno relates to her the details of his long relationship an affair that he says has now come to an end telling her that You don't betray a new love with an old mistress.In flashback Ryno relates how he was overcome by Vellini's wild beauty after they were introduced at a party ten years before. Vellini then married to a wealthy but dull Englishman reacts negatively however when she overhears Ryno call her an ugly mutt and the young man is forced to vigorously pursue her despite her strong objections forcing her to kiss him while the two are out riding. Her horrified husband witnesses the act and challenges Ryno to a duel the next morning. After deliberately missing his first shot Ryno is shot in the chest a wound from which he will take months to recover. The incident however triggers Vellini's awareness of her love for Ryno exotically announced by her sucking the blood from the gaping hole in his chest.De Flers presses Ryno for the details of their life together during the past ten years but the dramatic story is better left for the viewer to discover. When the film returns to present time de Marigny and Hermangarde are married and ostensibly in love yet he struggles to keep his word to her grandmother by moving away from the temptations of Paris to a remote seacoast. The cigarsmoking temptress however also loves the fresh sea air and the stage is set for the film's final act. The Last Mistress is an outstanding work of art that is strengthened immeasurably by striking performances by Asia Argento and firsttime actor Fu'ad Ait Aattou. Argento fully captures Vellini's sexual assertiveness but tempers her incendiary disposition with naturalism and a tenderness that makes us care about her fate.Aattou discovered by Breillat in a crowded caf is almost feminine in appearance with overly thick lips and sensitive eyes yet he brings a masculine determination to the role that makes him completely convincing. Like the recent film by Jacques Rivette The Duchess of Langeais in The Last Mistress love becomes a contest of wills a power struggle between two people whose relationship consists of a tug of war not only between domination and submission but between 18th and 19th century social codes. That Breillat makes the ride so entrancing is a tribute to her enormous talent.".

Breillat's direction of the story which is mostly told in flashback as the grandmother of her soontobegrandsoninlaw tells all about his very turbulent bond with Vellini is sometimes a little dull and stodgy and it drags in spots that it really should pick up in high gear.But damn it all if it's not some absorbing times in the midst of a classic period setting among character we can relish in. Granted Breillat likely cast Aattou for constantly having a 'sexyman' look somewhat akin if you ask me of a young Mick Jagger with ridiculously striking eyes and big lips. Argento on the other hand is cast perfectly and for every bit that Aatou and Mesquida don't quite connect as husband and wife it's made up for by the total hot connection between the real two leads. Argento is right at home with this twisted damaged but alive and easily emotional creature who has that tendency in French melodramas for tragedy at any moment just to get a rise. But she's also tender in surprising moments and lets her soul bare completely in rough sex scenes the craziest set in the desert following a very sudden death of a character which par for Breillat are goforbroke.What the film may lack in really being a fully modern work it feels like a lot of it is so stuck in the period novel setting that it's locked away which maybe was the right choice it's made up for by the stars' appeal and the drive of the torrid love affair that just won't go away. It's appealing boring and highly charged in equal measure.".

	schema:reviewBody "For yearsI pretty much avoided the face of new Euro porn films of French director Catherine Breillart infamous for 'Romance'or 'Romance X'as it was known in Europe. When I heard she had taken on a film adaptation of the 19th century erotic masterpiece 'The Last Mistress' I though to myself grand...more boring Euro porn I walked out on 'Romance X' out of sheer boredomand not of shock. Well I was pleasantly surprised by 'Mistress'. Mind you Breillart still has some growing up as a writerdirector to do there are things that transpire that are never explainedand her characters are still for the most part unlikable. Apart from that she has made some improvements. The cast includes Asia Argentowho doesn't seem to have any issues with tossing off her duds and parading around nude in any film she appears inas well as several othersincluding veteran British actor Michael Lonsdale. The plot concerns a pennilessgood for nothing young lad who is engaged to be married to a French woman of wealth  name but has been an off againon again lover of a half Spanishhalf French woman of no certain valor. All I could think at times was 'Dangerous Liasions' meets 'Fatal Attraction'filtered thru a European perspective. This film obviously will not be everybody's cup of teabut is still worth a look.

	onyx:emotionText "For yearsI pretty much avoided the face of new Euro porn films of French director Catherine Breillart infamous for 'Romance'or 'Romance X'as it was known in Europe. When I heard she had taken on a film adaptation of the 19th century erotic masterpiece 'The Last Mistress' I though to myself grand...more boring Euro porn I walked out on 'Romance X' out of sheer boredomand not of shock. Well I was pleasantly surprised by 'Mistress'. Mind you Breillart still has some growing up as a writerdirector to do there are things that transpire that are never explainedand her characters are still for the most part unlikable. Apart from that she has made some improvements. The cast includes Asia Argentowho doesn't seem to have any issues with tossing off her duds and parading around nude in any film she appears inas well as several othersincluding veteran British actor Michael Lonsdale. The plot concerns a pennilessgood for nothing young lad who is engaged to be married to a French woman of wealth  name but has been an off againon again lover of a half Spanishhalf French woman of no certain valor. All I could think at times was 'Dangerous Liasions' meets 'Fatal Attraction'filtered thru a European perspective. This film obviously will not be everybody's cup of teabut is still worth a look. No rating herebut probably only pull down a hard Rdue to nudity  some fairly restrained sexuality.";

The man must explain the two's connection and he must then face the fact that he won't be able to see her again or if she will let this happen. Breillat has become one of my favorite directors since seeing FAT GIRL several years back and she continues her success with this love triangle that certainly has a lot more style than substance. In the end I'm really not sure if this movie tries to say anything other than that men are worthless pigs but if that's all there is to say then I'm alright with it because this is a beautiful film to look at and we're given some fine performances to watch. Argento is the one who really stood out for me and this is certainly the best I've seen from her. She's usually hit and miss especially in her dad's movies but she nails all the right notes here and delivers a full character. I really felt Argento hit all the dramatic notes just right and I think she did quite well in the more emotional scenes at well. There's a bizarre sequence in the desert where she really gets to show this off as well as mixing it in with her sexuality. Being a Breillat film you know there's going to be quite a bit of sex and nudity. There's plenty of both but it's certainly a lot tamer than we're use to seeing but Argento dives into it head first. There's not an inch of her body that Breillat doesn't put the camera on but this is never a bad thing as she's got a certain way to throw her sexuality around. Newcomer Ait Aattou is also very impressive as the libertine as he perfectly captures the spirit and tortured soul of this character. He and Argento work extremely well together and this is especially true during their more dramatic moments. The visual look of the film is a real treat as the cinematography is top notch as is the costumes art design and the marvelous sets. It seems Breillat spent a lot more time on the style here than the actual substance but I don't say this as a negative thing. I'm sure some might feel there should be more meat here but I think the film balances both ends quite well and in the end we're left with a very impressive film although no classic.".

Vellini's first encounter with Ryno de Marginy is tame downright chasteby Breillat's standards as Argento fully clothed moans and grunts while Fu'ad Ait Aatou fully clothed himself expresses himself in a physical capacity. Breillat never one to be conservative about representing female sexuality in her work stages this first love scene like something out of a traditional period piece costumer. The context of this encounter between Vellini and Ryno de Marginy is the nobleman's impending marriage to HermangardeRoxanne Mesquida the jewel of French aristocracy. This midafternoon f is meant to be a parting gift to his mistress.The first nudity belongs to a little girl the daughter that Vellini and her Frenchman reared in Algeria who dies tragically from a scorpion's bite. Breillat in her own words told journalist Chris Wiegan in his article A Quick Chat with Catherine Breillat that she takes sexuality as a subject not as an object. Prior to the Algerian tragedy as part of an oral history that Ryno de Marginy recounts to Hermangarde's grandmother about his relationship with the mistress he conjures up the day when La marquise de FlersClaude Sarraute told him that Vellini was a woman not an object. When the young girl is killed she's being punished for being naked not by Breillat who's not a feminist in the traditional sense but by the patriarchal church which equates nakedness with sin. The little girl has to die because the nude form is a temptation to man. Next to her funeral pyre Argento is on top straddling Aatou's body her ample bosoms prominently displayed unhindered by any scrap of clothing as she tries to f the pain away. Since the woman is in anguish mourning over a dead child big breasts notwithstanding the male gaze ignores the deeroticizing circumstances and finds pleasure in her pain. This is why Breillat's films aren't softcore porn. Adult films don't have a selfreflexive component. Vellini has a right to grieve however she likes it just so happens that sex helps being bucknaked while she's having sex helps. Breillat sees her as a woman. The scene isn't about sexuality it's about forgetting. When you lose somebody you do whatever is possible to get out of your body. Vellini doesn't feel the penetration she feels the loss of her child. But all the male viewer sees is a woman they'd like to have sex with an object.During Ryno de Marigny's narrative in the grandmother's drawing room the old woman changes from a seated position into a subtly provocative rearrangement of her body in which she's nearly falling out of her seat. She doesn't look particularly ladylike. Her laxness in the chair is the closest she'll get to sleeping with the young man. Very subtly this woman of advanced age recalls the way Tori Amos seats herself in a sexual manner before the Bosendorfer piano. Ryno de Marginy not only seduced Hermangarde but also this matured lady who should have known better than to arrange a marriage between her granddaughter and a libertine.Wherever Ryno de Marginy goes Vellini is sure to follow. She follows his man to the countryside where the recently married couple decided to live away from Paris away from her. Their reunion takes place on top of a fort in which Ryno de Marginy greets Vellini with a long phallic gun. The mistress grips the gun like she's pulling the male organ closer to her transforming the penis as a weapon into the penis as a benign component of the male anatomy since it's clear that Ryno de Marginy wants to shoot her with his very substance not riddle her with bullets. Une vieille maitresse is a love story about a man's loyalty not to his wife but to his mistress. The filmmaker just goes about it in the most incendiary way possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright let me preface this film review with my admission that this is my first exposure to Catherine Breillat's work. So you'll read no references to Romance and Fat Girl from me. What you will read is starling commentary wellconstructed and didactic film. Breillat's newest production Une Vieille Maitresse or The Last Mistress in North America is a Frenchlanguage set in the early 19th century. It is a film adaptation of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly's novel of the same name.The story is narrated by and follows Ryno de Marigny Fu'ad Ait Aattou a pompous womanizer through a tenyear period during which he has a sporadic relationship with a beautiful Spanish courtesan. Ryno is finally ready to settle down and is convinced of his unabated love for wealthy and virginal Hermangarde Roxane Mesquida. Her grandmother Claude Sarraute requests his life's story as symbol of his devotion to her granddaughter which Ryno struggles to reveal. Ryno was rebounding from boring liaisons with married women when he was introduced to Seora Vellini Asia Argento the wife of an English aristocrat. Though she initially dislikes him Vellini warms to Ryno's persistence in courting her. The process is bloody and lifethreatening for both of them. Eventually Vellini leaves her husband to live with Ryno. They move out of the country where they are beset by great tragedy and decide to separate. They agree to see others but return to each other's arms for many passionate scenes. The narration ends and Ryno is now married to his devoted wife who according to local gossip is already subjected to him. Hermangarde shows us her devotion and follows Ryno to coastal France despite her disdain for the ocean. Unbeknownst to both of them is Vellini's interest in the area too. Hermangarde sees her one day and follows her home to discover Ryno's horse outside. The film ends with observation that Vellini and Ryno will never separate. The Last Mistress is a film about liberation of sexuality for both men and women. Vellini and Ryno are dominant partners when with other people but in their inappropriate relationship they are harmonious. Neither finds content by acceptable sexual practices. Their lawless affair is what impassions them. Asia Argento is much more attractive than her counterpart Roxane Mesquida in her sexual scenes. Her lovemaking which is always presented on screen appears more vivacious than Hermangarde's. Both Vellini and Ryno are capable of such visual flair because they view each other with an odd sortof respect. Ryno literally takes a bullet for another chance at convincing Vellini to leave her browbeat husband and she in turn is shamed by society at large though Ryno remarks that she doesn't notice this. It is this duality which creates there tenyear bond which we see and their presumed future together. I noticed a palpable feminist slant to The Last Mistress which I discovered is frequent in Breillat's work. It's most obvious when someone remarks that Vellini and Ryno have been together three years longer than most Parisian marriages last During Ryno and Hermangarde's wedding ceremony the pastor discusses passages from Corinthians which state that man is the head of the house as Christ is head of the church. Yea that was typical in the 18th century but what wasn't was an illegitimate relationship between a penniless Frenchman and a Spanish courtesan. Breillat provides the most striking criticism of that archaic viewpoint with Vellini's selfdeclaration as a devil not a shedevil at a costume party.As a feminist I must admit a slight bias I felt when writing this review. It's much easier to evaluate films for which I've no attraction than those I do. This one is enjoyable but its pacing is slow and its story unfolds via an outdated method. Its character reveals hisher past to curious spectator approach is rarely used because of how obvious it is. Breillat provides a distraction for us in the skillful newcomer Fu'ad Ait Aattou. His facial expressions resonate with movement and convey a deep level of complexity. We are never sure if he's ecstatic or gloomy until we see his face. Given that most of the film is extreme closeup this is incredibly important. Asia Argento doesn't show Aattou's depth with her face but her appearance is important nevertheless. While Hermangarde is pallid and her physical features are withdrawn Vellini's skin is dark her breasts are larger and her body is fitter. See that feminist slant? This does reveal a possible anachronistic tattoo on Asia's upper spine. I would have preferred more information about Hermangarde. We know Asia loves her but why? How did she become the wife of the most disreputable playboy in Paris at the time? The absence of Hermangarde's past allows us to explore Vellini's history thoroughly but there is scant a sentence on the white virgin's history. As my first Breillat film I was quite impressed. I'll view more of her work and perhaps return to this piece once I can evaluate in greater context. It's a very slow film and I wouldn't recommend it to those seeking a typical romance. The nature of romance in The Last Mistress is similar the peculiar relationships in Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being. This film isn't as impressive as that one but it is a worthy comparison full of modern application.Note This film is unrated in the United States but the MPAA would probably have rated it NC17 for explicit sexuality violence blood and drug use Final Consensus  and  out of ".

A cheap plot device  the ultimate detailed confession  provides the full guts of the story both background and foreshadow.What made the film inaccessible for me were both lead actors especially Asia Argento as Vellini the last mistress. I just didn't find these people likable whether together or apart. On the other hand I did enjoy Michael Lonsdale as de Prony and his wonderful dialogue and delivery.Mostly an uneventful couple of hours with no surprise ending at all.";

Endless dialogues in very literary French with the characters sitting down filmed by a director who has no idea how to film dialogue especially literary dialogue. The costumes were nice and so were the sets but it reminded me of a very bad Masterpiece Theater episode.And it's a shame because there was the makings here for a good movie with another director. Most of the actors and actresses looked their parts with the annoying exception of the male lead who looked convincing at 20 but way too boyish  or girlish  for 30. The novel is interesting. Though the premise is obvious and doesn't sustain almost 500 pages. The novel would be better known if it were a lot shorter. A much better script could have been the basis for a good movie. The script was evidently by the director. And then there were the annoying small mistakes. Why in the middle of a movie that sticks close to its historical period c. 1835 do the characters do a rendition of a German popular song from the 1920s that sounds very 1920s? Why at the opening of the movie is the date 1835 given with the tag the period of Choderlos de Laclos? Laclos died in 1805 and his one remembered work Les Liaisons dangereuses dates from 1782. This story so very clearly dates from the Restoration and right after it the period Balzac Barbey's real contemporary described so well in Eugnie Grandet with its aristocracy moving ever further to a moral and sexual right wing  as we see in poor Ermangarde who is afraid to enjoy sex.As I said the acting here was fine the sets and costumes ditto. But the dialogue was leaden as was the direction and I found the male lead annoying.A major disappointment.".

Part of the experience of film unavoidably is how to handle celebrity. Sorting out who is easy keeping a reign on how is harder especially for me where women are concerned. I allow Asia into my field of vision together with a few similar excessive female lives. The simple narrative is merely that they live their lives deeply with some dangerous mix of abandon and control. Our vision only sees the cinematic skin of their lives in sex and relationships but we infer the internal passion and focus.Breillat makes powerful films formed as skits about damaging sex and recoil. The balance is a bit unfair because these things are easy to communicate but hard to convey in a manner that you can use in building a self. But she is honest and we see her. She apparently had some severe medical event and this is her first film after recovery. She merely adapts a book a story about a man reluctantly captured by a woman. That woman is played by Asia presumably using much of herself or what she uses in acting herself.Narratively the thing is well structured. We have an outer wrapping a couple telling each other the 'scandalous' story we are about to see. Then we have the story of the romance and an inner story where the man tells the story. These three versions do not coincide but the tension among the versions is not mined as we would hope.The society dunces have the romance as simply sexual gluttony too marvelous to abandon. The story told by the man is one of reluctant obsession a curse that is inescapable and that only incidentally involves the escape of sex. What we see is sparse allowing us to struggle with our own voyeuristic issues do we allow ourselves to be captured by the nudity and sex we see or do we allow the narrative to have its own passion without feeding it ours?This is where the attraction of celebrity engagement confuses because Asia exists outside the movie. We see the familiar tattoos. We see the commitments still rare among actresses. We see the risk. It works I think but only by accident and it may not for you if you have not followed her life from that of the tortured film child.The sexual roles incidentally are reversed. The guy is passive possibly a victim and softly feminine. He lies like a stereotypical woman. The mistress is bold open fearless aggressive. She is possibly the predator fate be denied.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Just like most of the French movies The Last Mistress doesn't hesitate from sex seduction and brutality of love. It's a story about a young rich French Ryno de Marigny who is ready to get married into a Nobel family. Just before getting married he confronts in front of his future rich wife's grandmother about his last old mistress of 10 years. The movie unfolds how Ryno falls head over heels for an older married woman who is not even pretty or graceful. It's the rawness which attracts Ryno towards her whom he first called an ugly nut. Fu'ad At Aattou a newcomer played Ryno with utmost honesty. He is divine and his falling for an Asia Argento's ambiguous character is questionable. But that's the whole point of love lust and seduction when two unlikely people meet and ruin everything around them along with each other. Asia Argento is amazing even though I saw her first in Marie Antoinette as French king's crazy mistress raised question of her action ability because she acted the same as she acted here. If I ignore that she was in tedious Marie Antoinette and Une vieille matresse release long before atrocious Marie Antoneitte. I actually loved her performance. There are many few actresses who can let them emotionally and physically open like that. You forget that it's the part of an act as it looks reality. Fu'ad At Aattou and Asia Argento's chemistry makes this a memorable venture. The long sex confrontation scenes are the proof how involved they are with the subject. Roxane Mesquida as Ryno's wife is stunning as always. Une vieille matresse is a controversial tale of lust love and seduction. Overall I enjoyed the movie even though I wanted the characters to be smart not so nave and stupid lost in sex lust and seduction.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like costume dramas and period pieces as much as the next person but this one just didn't sit that well with me at all. Despite the sumptuous detail exquisite costumes and a great score it failed to draw me in on an emotional level. For me none of the characters were in any way likable and the worst thing was that it felt so stuffy. Besides this I've only seen one other Catherine Breillat film ROMANCE which while having a depressing atmosphere that I often enjoy was too pretentious for me to really get into. This film combined with the other is almost enough for me to swear off Catherine Breillat films from here on out. The basics of the story is that a young nobleman is engaged to be married but his former mistress of 10 years Asia Argento doesn't want to let him go. I've never particularly liked Asia Argento but she seemed a little more natural in French here then in the few English roles I've seen her in elsewhere. The actor who played Ryno de Marigny the man to be married also didn't work for me. He was so uncharismatic and it baffled me how he could have been so entranced by Asia Argento's Vellini. The only two characters that I thought were the least bit interesting were two old ladies one of whom listens to Ryno's long story about his past with Vellini. At least they seemed like they were having fun with the material. Overall while it might have a few interesting things to say about fidelity or the lack thereof in relationships and excellent production design to me it was too emotionally vacuous and stodgy to really be effective. Maybe see this if you're a fan of Catherine Breillat but for everyone else there are better period pieces worth your time such as THE INVISIBLE WOMAN.".

Even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him.To bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky. John Huston did a magnificent job. He never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story. It is simple and true with outstanding acting. The only slight missstep is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy.Its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece but I think its fair to use this term for this movie.

It is a rare treasure this movie and I cannot write enough praise for it.It is cast incredibly well with quite a few Abbey Theatre faces and also the wonderful tenor voice of Frank Patterson. Lady Gregory's poem recited in the movie is one of the most moving ever written. Anjelica's scene walking down the stairs as she listens to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film. I cry every time I see it..for all the right reasons.We have all had love lost at an early age and weep for our young hopeful selves.Donal McCann acted in far too few movies for my liking he just loved stage work and stuck to it and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be reciprocated and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing this.If you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this there really is no beginning middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shadings of the personalities portrayed so beautifully.Bravo to all who were involved in this production. 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The entire movie an artful adaptation of one of Joyce's Dubliners stories takes place on the night of January 6 Epiphany 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters two sisters and their niece where a group of upperclass Dubliners gather for an evening of music recitations and dinner. While there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. The cast all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. The poignant final scene between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies The Dead is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th. After many viewings it never fails to move me and each time I glean something that I've missed before.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is truly a remarkable movie. The Dead shows us a turnofthecentury Irish dinner party attended by a host of lost souls. It is a snapshot of people who either loved and lost or never got to love at all. Everyone here longs for love  not just ordinary fondness but a condition where one almost sees God in the other person. Those who have not experienced this will deem it maudlin. For example in the story Anjelica Huston's character refers to one Michael Fury whose love for her had burned so intensely that he allowed himself to freeze to death in a river because he could not be hers. Such actions strike the idle passerby as pathetic savage Americans would label Michael Fury a loser. But years later when this kind of passion is deemed the only thing that matters people privately develop a more respectful take on such things.At dinner tenor Frank Patterson sings for the guests his lovely voice stealing through the walls like the scent of a garden into a tomb. Beauty like this makes us want to find someone open our jugular vein and urgently bleed into them. We feel that somewhere burns an unseen silent and impossibly distant Light.  If only we could share that Light with someone or at least share a quest for it. But how? Alas we can only stand at the bedroom window alone watching the snowfall like Anjelica Huston's husband Donal McCann does at the movie's end. Many characters in the movie spend their whole lives at that bedroom window. Others are like Michael Fury dying in a freezing river as he stares at the house where his Beloved conducts her affairs unresponsive to him. At one point after a guest recites a moving poem one of the female guests laments Imagine being loved like that. She means a devotion so intense as to rearrange our psyches. But her chance for love is gone crushed beneath layers of dashed hopes now piled high like the snows of Ireland in the movie. No rose sprouts in these drifts only longburied yearnings that waft like a vapor around headstones. This movie hints at secrets that are akin to something one experiences as a child who lying awake and alone one night spies a star outside the window and for an instant glimpses the Unspeakable. The child makes no mention of this to anyone  who would understand? That's nice dear. But the longing to share that glimpse with someone or to share someone else's glimpse burns until death.  At the end of The Dead Anjelica Huston's husband realizes that he has shared no such glimpse with his wife no such love. His wife has sobbed herself to sleep on the bed and remains silent as he looks out the bedroom window in the wee hours. Great stories have great dialogue but the greatest have characters whose silence points to the realm of boundless couldbe's. We hear the husband's lamenting thoughts as exterior night scenes melt into one another. Fields starlit graveyards wizened trees  all hushed as snow is gently falling all over Ireland and falling gently. No routine tale of collision between desire and proscription this no melodramatic costumestruggle between attraction and social propriety. The Dead speaks to each person's Star of Bethlehem glimpsed once and then repressed until something like this dinner party shakes it loose. On the morrow the guests will tell themselves that they simply had too much wine at the party and will thereby seal Heaven into their mental cellar once more. Their pain will continue as always.Sensitive and understated I give this one top marks across the board. Bravo to John Huston. A fitting last effort by a great director.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superlatives really are a dangerous thing. No sooner do we rashly assert something as being unsurpassable the object of our veneration immediately becomes just that. James Joyce's concluding story in his book 'Dubliners' entitled 'The Dead' was always going to be the exception to that rule. It's been described by a number of critics over the years as the greatest short story in the English language. After seeking the story out many years ago when I was a teenager I can do nothing but agree whole heartedly with the critics.The story captured a time a place and a romanticism that I've dreamt about all my life. The setting is a house at the turn of the century filled with guests from all over Ireland who gather for an evening of dancing poetry and piano recitals.Joyce's consummate story telling is not found in the almost mechanical way most authors put their stories together but it's revealed in the sheer power and strength of feeling projected by the characters involved Gabriel's concern about his after dinner speech and the ongoing changes in Ireland Gretta's secret passion for someone she'd once loved and lost and now even the mere acknowledgment of such a love threatens to destabilize her relationship with Gabriel Freddie's inability to rise beyond his drug dependency the arrogant tenor Mr D'Arcy at the table loudly trying to upgrade his status through his supposed musical superiority Lilly the housemaid all nervousness and efficiency the list goes on each playing their part with absolutely convincing character motivation.How could John Huston's film ever really of taken on such a literary masterpiece and still proved faithful? Well to his credit he comes pretty close.Of course when we're reading a story an author often leaves a degree of ambiguity specific areas in which we're allowed to interpret our own mental pictures from the words cited. Joyce was no different. Here lies the problem transfering a work of fiction to celluloid is like trying to join up the dots. Not everyone is going to recognize the picture and be happy with the adaptation.Personally I loved the film. However there were a couple of scenes that I knew were going to prove a problem and they did prove problematic. Firstly when Gretta defers her descent down the stairs after dinner because she's filled with thought's of Michael Furey and the love that she'd lost. The memories come flooding back. She can hear his voice superimposed over D'arcy's and it unsettles her. It's such a deep enduring moment. In the film Huston just looks away dreamily. There's very little to express the full range of thoughts rushing through her head. It's not Angelica Huston's fault. It simply highlights how difficult it is to accommodate the limitless expression of literature to the silver screen which is why like an earlier commentator on this film asserted I too strongly recommend that Joyce's story is read first. It really does add a great deal.The second scene that troubled me was the ending. It doesn't even begin to pack the tremendous power of Joyce's written word. How could it? This is a stream of subconscious thought extracted from the greatest short story in the English language reduced to a simple voiceover.Ah well! Still a good film. Overall Rating 8 out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last film of John Huston the great American director of the Irish descent is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection Dubliners of the greatest writer ever came from Ireland. The film is a family affair. The dying director made it based on the script adapted by his son Tony Huston from one of the most poignant beautiful and profound short story ever written in this language and considered by many THE BEST English language short story. John directed his daughter Anjelica in what could be her finest screen performance. The film is short only 83 minutes. It's got no action sequences no plot it is almost noneventful and it may seem slow. The guests friends and relatives come to the party that takes place in Dublin during the Epiphany week in January 1904 at the house of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance. What viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble conversation piece. The guests talk listen to the music discuss the latest opera premiere and make jokes sometimes awkward. Gradually the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away.This is the film you have to stay with let it pull you in listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate. Pay attention to the body languages to the looks at their faces when they drift away from the light laugh and music of the present to the long gone but never in fact left most precious memories where the Dead of the title are not dead but forever young and so alive. If you do you will be awarded with the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you. It will break your heart to pieces pull them together and put it back transfixed. The film as well as Joyce's story centers on Gabriel Conroy Donal McCann as James Joyce's alter ego gave a very moving understated performance as one of the party guests who arrives with his wife Gretta Anjelica Huston. Gabriel is still in love feels close connection to and fascinated with her. It is after the party he discovers that even after many years of closeness he does not know all about her past her pains her regrets and the unforgettable emotions and loss she had lived through as a young girl and he is no part of. For the first time he looks at her and thinks of her not as the indelible part of his existence but as another human being with her own inner world her own loneliness and sadness and for the first time a strange friendly pity for her entered his soul. It is he who narrates the final most powerful and profound lines of the story Snow is general all over Ireland. . . falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead. If you have not seen the film or read the Joyce's story please do. They are truly the works of Art that leave the everlasting impression and would change something in you to the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released posthumously THE DEAD bookends John Huston's illustrious career spanning 46 years which is kickstarted with a bang by THE MALTESE FALCON 1941. Adapted to the screen from James Royce's source story from his shorts collection DUBLINERS by John's son Tony and stars his daughter Anjelica plus a succinct length of merely 83 minutes and the fact that its story is mostly confined in a single location THE DEAD is a smallscale labour of love of Huston and his family too an octogenarian ruminates about his fulfilled life and ponders what is inevitably waiting for him. But don't be misled by its title the film doesn't dwells on that morbid subject instead its lifeforce engendered from the lively festivity of a January dinner in Dublin 1904.University professor Gabriel Conroy McCann and his wife Gretta Houston are invited to attend the annual dance and dinner to celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany hosted by the former's aunties the Morkan sisters Kate Carroll and her elder sibling Julia Delany as well as their niece Mary Jane Craigie. Other guests are also presented among which there is Mr. Grace McClory the Irish old stager in his final silver screen presence a character doesn't exist in Royce's original text entertains audience with his sublime recitation of a Middle Irish poem YOUNG DONAL  ..You have taken the east from me you have taken the west from me you have taken what is before me and what is behind me you have taken the moon you have taken the sun from me and my fear is great that you have taken God from me. it is a magic moment where the sheer power of words embraces its deserved cinematic glory.Another highlights include Freddy Malins Donnelly an unforeseen usurper in my BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR list a middleaged bachelor a raging alcoholic Gabriel's childhood friend noticeably under the influence his soused conduct sterlingly breathes an air of discomfiture and drollness on top of the cordiality presented by the rest of the ensemble whereas his mother Ms. Malins Kean a helicopter parent who perhaps isn't even aware of what damage she has done and risibly puzzles why her son keeps being such a disappointment and laughing stock.Irish hospitality as Gabriel addresses in his heartfelt tribute speech to the three hostesses whom he praises as three Graces is the glue brings everybody altogether regardless of their tastes in music political stances or even religious persuasions. Cathleen Delany as Aunt Julia upstages the rest of the Irish ensemble with her grand reaction shots and bolstered by her rendition of an Irish folk song purely because it is too rare a case that the script would give sizable screen time to a senior lady singing in her weatherbeaten timbre apart from Ms. Florence Foster Jenkins for obvious reason.Anjelica Houston shares her last journey of moviemaking with her esteemed father takes a back seat in the dinner party with her composed demeanor until Gretta's concealed memory is unexpectedly prompted by THE LASS OF AUGHRIM sung by the tenor Bartell D'Arcy Patterson when the party is winding down. In her quietly poignant confession of a deceased young man who she fell in love with the film reaches its wellearned catharsis through Donal McCann's reflective voiceover about certain existential epiphany enhanced by the picturesque montage from DP Fred Murphy and Alex North's conspicuously pensive accompanying score.John Houston takes his exit with an elegiac meditation in honoring his forefathers and passing on his wisdom to his devout audience it is brimming with loftiness sincerity and an utterly captivating sensibility and we wish the party would never be over because goodbye is the hardest word to say to a beloved master.".

But don't be misled by its title the film doesn't dwells on that morbid subject instead its lifeforce engendered from the lively festivity of a January dinner in Dublin 1904.University professor Gabriel Conroy McCann and his wife Gretta Houston are invited to attend the annual dance and dinner to celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany hosted by the former's aunties the Morkan sisters Kate Carroll and her elder sibling Julia Delany as well as their niece Mary Jane Craigie. Other guests are also presented among which there is Mr. Grace McClory the Irish old stager in his final silver screen presence a character doesn't exist in Royce's original text entertains audience with his sublime recitation of a Middle Irish poem YOUNG DONAL  ..You have taken the east from me you have taken the west from me you have taken what is before me and what is behind me you have taken the moon you have taken the sun from me and my fear is great that you have taken God from me. it is a magic moment where the sheer power of words embraces its deserved cinematic glory.Another highlights include Freddy Malins Donnelly an unforeseen usurper in my BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR list a middleaged bachelor a raging alcoholic Gabriel's childhood friend noticeably under the influence his soused conduct sterlingly breathes an air of discomfiture and drollness on top of the cordiality presented by the rest of the ensemble whereas his mother Ms. Malins Kean a helicopter parent who perhaps isn't even aware of what damage she has done and risibly puzzles why her son keeps being such a disappointment and laughing stock.Irish hospitality as Gabriel addresses in his heartfelt tribute speech to the three hostesses whom he praises as three Graces is the glue brings everybody altogether regardless of their tastes in music political stances or even religious persuasions. Cathleen Delany as Aunt Julia upstages the rest of the Irish ensemble with her grand reaction shots and bolstered by her rendition of an Irish folk song purely because it is too rare a case that the script would give sizable screen time to a senior lady singing in her weatherbeaten timbre apart from Ms. Florence Foster Jenkins for obvious reason.Anjelica Houston shares her last journey of moviemaking with her esteemed father takes a back seat in the dinner party with her composed demeanor until Gretta's concealed memory is unexpectedly prompted by THE LASS OF AUGHRIM sung by the tenor Bartell D'Arcy Patterson when the party is winding down. In her quietly poignant confession of a deceased young man who she fell in love with the film reaches its wellearned catharsis through Donal McCann's reflective voiceover about certain existential epiphany enhanced by the picturesque montage from DP Fred Murphy and Alex North's conspicuously pensive accompanying score.John Houston takes his exit with an elegiac meditation in honoring his forefathers and passing on his wisdom to his devout audience it is brimming with loftiness sincerity and an utterly captivating sensibility and we wish the party would never be over because goodbye is the hardest word to say to a beloved master.";

Joyce's tale is reputed to be one of the best short stories ever written and that is pretty accurate but maybe Huston has even improved upon it. I say this because an Irish friend who saw the movie said that a love and deep understanding of the Irish shines through in every frame. It is this warmth that makes it such a wonderful experience and yet it only makes the final few minutes of the film more poignant. The casting is inspired and Anjelica Huston has never been better. How fitting that this role should be in her father's last work. If you have never seen this sublime film I urge you to remedy that. It will be watched many times in the future and its status will surely grow.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes the newspapers were right snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain on the treeless hills falling softly on the Bog of Allen and father westward softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling too upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones on the spears of the little gate on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead. I think that few endings are as fine as transcendent as that penned by Joyce in 1914. It rivals the final paragraphs of Sir Thomas Browne's Hydriotaphia A Discourse on Urn Burial for pure sublimity. Tony Huston chose to quote it in full at the end of this remarkable adaptation of the novella contained within Joyce's brilliant dissection of Irish society. The Dead is easily one of the best films made in the last two or so decades of the twentieth century it is a pearl amidst swine.The entire cast work with and therefore in certain senses against each other in an impeccable manner. The direction is consistent and steady. The cinematography is respectful. The art direction is restrained and the period detail sure. The story is allowed to speak for itself and to carry itself at its own measured pace. Although it is little more than 80 minutes we feel as though we have lived through every part of an Epiphany party than might have lasted for several hours or so. In most readings of Joyce I have been conscious of the time contained within a story passing at a natural rate the effect is achieved with an horologists' care in Ulysses for example. The film is therefore a tribute to Joyce much as it is for the ailing John Huston one of Erin's own adopted sons.I gather than a sixty minute programme was made on the making of The Dead and it was shown as part of the John Huston season that has just ended at London's National Film Theatre. Alas I was unable to attend but I have read that Huston was very ill at the time it was made dependent on oxygen cylinders and often unable to leave his car. He was therefore reliant upon his assistant directors and upon his son Tony and daughter Angelica as Gretta Conroy one of her finest roles. This may have been a cathartic experience as I gather that relations between the very demanding father and daughter had been distant for some time  the experience of making this film led to a final reconciliation. Perhaps it was wrong for Huston with his lungs wrecked to leave the clear dry air of Mexico for the dank foetid vapours of London and Dublin although I'm not sure that he actually did any of the exterior scenes in Ireland. Whatever the medical merits the artistic result clearly vindicated his decision.Many of the stories in Dubliners are concerned with the sterility and stolidity of Irish society 'The Sisters' the reference to Fr. Flynn's 'paralysis' is apt 'A Painful Case' 'A Mother' etc. Gabriel Conroy a superlative Donal McCann surveys the prospect of the party arranged by two elderly maiden aunts and surmises that most of those assembled are one way or the other halfdead. Then stung by his wife's lament for the passing of her original only? love he understands he himself with his own want of feeling of passion of emotional engagement is afflicted by that same malaise. Is Ireland dead or is it merely sleeping? Will it  as Molly Ivors an electric Maria McDermottroe sincerely hopes  awake when the British yoke is cast off and it ceases to be 'John Bull's other island'? Gabriel is sceptical  like Joyce himself he would rather travel to France than Galway where Michael Furey lies buried by the shores of Loch Corrib at Oughterard. Molly enjoins Gabriel a London hack to learn Gaelic. Gabriel almost hunches his shoulders  the people of the Pale have given the same shrug to the outer reaches of Connacht and Munster for centuries only now that residential property prices in Kerry and Clare have scaled the heights of those in Surrey and Berkshire are attitudes starting to adjust. Joyce shrugs too  but the suggestion that Ireland is only blanketed in snow and not deadened by permafrost suggests that he still has hope for his nation.There are no false notes in this film no missteps. Even Tony Huston's interpolation of Lady Gregory's ode to love is woven seamlessly into the script and enhanced it brilliantly thanks to the excellent recital by Sean McClory as Mr Grace. The entire cast delivered an outstanding performance and I should make particular mention of Cathleen Delany as Aunt Julia Marie Kean as Mrs Malins and Donal Donnelly as her wayward son Freddy and lastly Frank Patterson as the bibulous Bartell D'Arcy a particularly interesting character  at once very Anglican and yet very Irish and therefore a typical Dublin type the city being in certain respects an island of unionism and protestantism in a Romish and increasingly republican sea. I mention these actors not because they are superior to the others but because they illuminate particular aspects of this besetting malaise that interest me. Of these the most significant is Aunt Julia. It is she whom Gabriel sees in her coffin and there is something in her indomitable rendition of 'Arrayed for the Bridal' the beautiful resolute yet curiously myopic eyes set in a failing face that typify the confused mixture hope and desolation that 'The Dead' represents. A stellar performance and a fitting epitaph to one of the last and greatest of old Hollywood.".

Attending are various relatives an Irish tenor and assorted friends. It's a lively gathering with food conversation singing and poetry. As the dinner breaks up the tenor Frank Patterson sings an Irish ballad The Lass of Aughrim. Gretta stops at the top of the stairs and in the most stunning moments of the film listens to his beautiful tenor singing. When she and her husband arrive home she cries over a lost love Michael Fury whose passion for her was great but it wasn't to be and he let himself freeze to death in remorse. Gretta falls asleep leaving Gabriel to stand at the bedroom window and watch the snow fall as he ponders life its meaning and all that matters...love. What might have been and what isn't.Such a staggering film where the silences are more powerful than any words about private pain about love and loss almost as if John Huston had come to some profound understanding before his death and shared it with the world.Powerful in its quietness The Dead will have a profound effect on you.

The focus is intimate centered almost entirely on a dinner party in 1904 Dublin and the evening's revelations are small and personal but quietly devastating.

	schema:reviewBody "James Joyce arguably could write some of the best sentences in the English language and his short story The Dead which ends his collection The Dubliners containsin its finaleperhaps the most perfect paragraph in the English language. It's fitting that John Huston who held back in attempting to film this story ended his career with it. As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Would Be King Huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. And with The Dead which was completed after Huston's death by his son Tony Huston we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema.Valuing all that cinema can do as one of the commentators points out this isn't The African Queen nor does it need to be this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience. All of us slogged through Portrait of an Artist in school and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us. As with silent films Huston seeks something pure here and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals Joyce's original.Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with selfimportance and mock selfdoubt that's reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany. What's in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of celebration song dance poetry where he's asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party. He's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earthshattering experience handed to him by his wife.

	onyx:emotionText "James Joyce arguably could write some of the best sentences in the English language and his short story The Dead which ends his collection The Dubliners containsin its finaleperhaps the most perfect paragraph in the English language. It's fitting that John Huston who held back in attempting to film this story ended his career with it. As with The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Would Be King Huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic. And with The Dead which was completed after Huston's death by his son Tony Huston we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema.Valuing all that cinema can do as one of the commentators points out this isn't The African Queen nor does it need to be this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience. All of us slogged through Portrait of an Artist in school and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us. As with silent films Huston seeks something pure here and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals Joyce's original.Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with selfimportance and mock selfdoubt that's reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany. What's in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of celebration song dance poetry where he's asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party. He's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earthshattering experience handed to him by his wife. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past it's also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are living.And rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story cinematic Huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling.

It is a beautiful look into a time that has past within which people are growing up and others are winding down.  Some are frustrated and others are serene.  And all around ever present throughout the evening are the people and the parts of people that have been laid to rest. The words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and set to the music of the Irish brogue are an auditory feast particularly to us flattoned Americans.

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many '10 Best' lists which could easily fit The Dead  Best Screen Drunk Best Literary Adaptation Best Use Of Music Not Specifically Written for the Film Best Use of Poetry Best Screen Speech Best Ensemble Cast and finally perhaps Best Film Ever Made. This was John Huston's last and greatest film adapted by his son Tony from James Joyce's short story and set on the evening of the Feast of the Epiphany in the Dublin of 1904. It is confined largely to one setting the home of the Morkan sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional 'dramatic' terms. They entertain their guests there is singing dancing recitations and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company.Finally of course it is 'about' much much more. It is about love loss and regret those stable mainstays of great drama. In the film's closing scenes the tenor Bartell D'Arcy Frank Patterson sings a song 'The Lass of Aughrim' which conjures up in the mind of Gretta Anjelica Huston wife of Gabriel Donal McCann the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly Gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all. Emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as Gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in Gabriel's head sums up his own feelings. This is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by Huston and McCann.But then all the performances are extraordinary. This is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable genial or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that Sean McClory the IRA man in The Quiet Man brings to his reading of Lady Gregory's translation of 'Donal Og' here? Added poignancy is to be had of course from the knowledge that Huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work. Death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a lifeenhancing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely love this movie.  It certainly was created for gay men but as a lesbian I feel a kinship with other gay people and I believe this is an excellent movie.  The depiction of female impersonators is genuine and doesn't give the false glamourpuss view that probably causes many outsiders to think all drag queens are just like RuPaul nothing against her she's a diva but not everyone has so much money!.  The portrayal of a relationship involving one gay person and one bisexual person is also beautifully realistic.  Ann Bancroft's performance as the Ma is stunning.  I believe this movie would also appeal to openminded heterosexuals who may not have too much involvement with our culture as it depicts a grittier side of life than the commonlyseen rich gay boy lifestyle.

The depiction of female impersonators is genuine and doesn't give the false glamourpuss view that probably causes many outsiders to think all drag queens are just like RuPaul nothing against her she's a diva but not everyone has so much money!.

My favourite scene is the last one the beautifully scripted showdown between Firstein's Arnold and Ann Bancroft's Ma. Bancroft is so well cast as Ma  the tiredness the lack of understanding  such a human picture. Thats what makes this picture so special  all characters are human. Even Allan far from being perfect is not quite perfect.My other favourite scene in this film is the lovely seduction of Arnold by Ed to the tunes of Rod Stewart. In fact every time I hear the song Maggie I think of this scene with Arnold's nervousness and bashful coyness. And I saw in the DVD edition that the street where Broderick's Alan is beaten to death was also one where the unprovoked murder of gay people is a reality  this makes the last part of the ambulance scene where Arnold is barely able to walk after seeing Alan's bloodied body almost real.I think this is the best gay file ever made. It is certainly dated with the corporate imposed restrictions on the showing of gayness but the story is so beautifully crafted. You realise how pathetic commercial fests aimed at straight people like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is after seeing this the message Harvey Firstein wrote in 1983 is still relevant today.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie exhibits the same careful story telling as the play which should come as no surprise considering that Harvey Fierstein wrote the screenplay. It is an uncompromisingly honest  and occasionally brutal  portrait of a New York drag queen. And it is told as only Harvey Fierstein can tell it.Our first introduction to Arnold Beckoff Benji Schulman in this scene is his mother finding him in her closet at age six wearing her clothes and makeup. This sets the tone for their relationship throughout the movie as Arnold Harvey Fierstein and his mother Anne Bancroft have a wonderfully portrayed lovehate relationship throughout the film. The movie follows a grownup Arnold through the major relationships in his life Ed Brian Kerwin a closeted school teacher who leaves Arnold to marry a woman Alan Matthew Broderick graduating from the role of David in the stage play a model who loves Arnold as much as Arnold loves him but who is murdered by batwielding thugs David Eddie Castrodad the son Arnold adopts following Alan's death and ultimately Arnold's mother with whom he attempts to have an honest relationship despite her openly disapproval of him. Things come to a head with his mother during a visit to the cemetery where she cruelly berates Arnold for praying over Alan's grave telling him that he has no right to compare his playing around with a little boy to her thirtyfive year marriage. Arnold's response to her ultimately becomes the catalyst through which they work out their differences.Fierstein's desire for integrity in his story is apparent throughout the movie. The script neither shies away from nor pretties up difficult issues. The characters are fully developed and each acts from an internal logic that is readily understandable to the viewer whether or not we agree with their choices. The humor doesn't take away from the seriousness of the themes covered but rather serves as a contrast to highlight them.The acting is exemplary. Fierstein is brilliant as Arnold but then he had plenty of practice. Anne Bancroft gives an edgy performance as a mother who wants to love her son but has trouble accepting him for what he is. In spite of her unforgivable cruelty to her son in the graveyard you do forgive her when she tells Arnold You shut me out of your life and then blamed me for not being there! She then goes on to share her own wisdom on loss with him healing the breach for once and all. Matthew Broderick gives a wonderful performance in a part with little screen time but huge impact. His portrayal of Alan's love for Arnold is real and as satisfying a romance as one could want to see on the big screen. Brian Kerwin plays Ed's confusion to perfection.This movie was among the first to offer up gay characters who are honest and unashamed about their sexuality. That alone would make it a must see but this movie is also highly entertaining sparkling with humor wit and unforgettable drag scenes. A movie that should be watched every so often to remind us that no matter what clothes you wear all of us are the same underneath.".

	schema:headline " No Regrets Or Apologies From Arnold Beckoff";
	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to see one of the 1222 performances of Torch Song Trilogy when it was on Broadway a show written and starring Harvey Fierstein who with this success becomes a Brooklyn Jewish version of Noel Coward. Sad to say Torch Song Trilogy was tragically dated when it got to the screen because the AIDS epidemic had not occurred when Fierstein wrote this bittersweet tale of a gay life and a man who refuses to conform to anyone else's ideas including his all powerful Jewish mother. And we know how formidable those folks can be.Fierstein is Arnold Beckoff who knew from early childhood he was a gay kid and took life as it came. In fact he became a drag entertainer of note and seems to be doing quite well at it making a living much to the consternation of his mother Anne Bancroft. I saw Estelle Getty do this on Broadway and I wouldn't want to split hairs on the differences between the two actresses. Like so many of her generation Bancroft just thinks being gay is a phase that her son will grow out of. Of course by his mid thirties you'd think she would have a clue. As on Broadway the scenes between Mrs. Beckoff and her son have the real meat of the play.As you might have guessed Torch Song Trilogy had its beginnings in the gay cabaret scene and through the persistence of Harvey Fierstein it got to Broadway. On stage the various scenes which are more segmented than in the film version are punctuated by a cabaret singers doing various torch song ballads to put a coda on what the audience had just seen. Here the torch songs are relegated to background music the best kind of background music to be sure. Harvey himself however does perform in his drag character.The one true love of his life is Brian Kerwin who can't quite accept himself as gay. He's comfortable being 'bisexual' but as Fierstein so accurately points out he'd like to meet just one bisexual who is open with his boyfriends but keeps his women a big old secret.Kerwin is always an interesting player to watch. He got his first notice as the hayseed deputy on the Sheriff Lobo series and he's spent the rest of his career making sure he was NEVER cast in that kind of part again. As the troubled love of Harvey's life Kerwin certainly proves he's more than a hayseed. Because Kerwin won't be true to himself Harvey looks for love elsewhere. Harvey's not capable of closeted behavior the closet would be death for him.Matthew Broderick plays Alan the young male model who Harvey falls for and he's as winning here as he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In fact he's a gay Ferris Bueller who probably did spend time trying to get into adult gay clubs and knew all the places where they'd wink and let him in. His tragic end at the hands of a gang of homophobic street thugs is something I saw all too much of in my working life at Crime Victims Board. Torch Song Trilogy transfers quite well from the stage to the screen and with Harvey Fierstein helping with the transfer we'd expect nothing less. He kept the film true to the vision of gay male life that he saw and lived. I still remember he and I were both witnesses at the gay rights hearings in New York City back when Torch Song Trilogy had just finished its Broadway run. His words there were among the most inspiring. So this review is dedicated to the author and star of Torch Song Trilogy who has never slackened in his dedication for GayLesbianBisexualTransgender Rights and gives of himself and his talents to his people. From your fellow Brooklynite Harvey with love.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was fortunate enough to see one of the 1222 performances of Torch Song Trilogy when it was on Broadway a show written and starring Harvey Fierstein who with this success becomes a Brooklyn Jewish version of Noel Coward. Sad to say Torch Song Trilogy was tragically dated when it got to the screen because the AIDS epidemic had not occurred when Fierstein wrote this bittersweet tale of a gay life and a man who refuses to conform to anyone else's ideas including his all powerful Jewish mother. And we know how formidable those folks can be.Fierstein is Arnold Beckoff who knew from early childhood he was a gay kid and took life as it came. In fact he became a drag entertainer of note and seems to be doing quite well at it making a living much to the consternation of his mother Anne Bancroft. I saw Estelle Getty do this on Broadway and I wouldn't want to split hairs on the differences between the two actresses. Like so many of her generation Bancroft just thinks being gay is a phase that her son will grow out of. Of course by his mid thirties you'd think she would have a clue. As on Broadway the scenes between Mrs. Beckoff and her son have the real meat of the play.As you might have guessed Torch Song Trilogy had its beginnings in the gay cabaret scene and through the persistence of Harvey Fierstein it got to Broadway. On stage the various scenes which are more segmented than in the film version are punctuated by a cabaret singers doing various torch song ballads to put a coda on what the audience had just seen. Here the torch songs are relegated to background music the best kind of background music to be sure. Harvey himself however does perform in his drag character.The one true love of his life is Brian Kerwin who can't quite accept himself as gay. He's comfortable being 'bisexual' but as Fierstein so accurately points out he'd like to meet just one bisexual who is open with his boyfriends but keeps his women a big old secret.Kerwin is always an interesting player to watch. He got his first notice as the hayseed deputy on the Sheriff Lobo series and he's spent the rest of his career making sure he was NEVER cast in that kind of part again. As the troubled love of Harvey's life Kerwin certainly proves he's more than a hayseed. Because Kerwin won't be true to himself Harvey looks for love elsewhere. Harvey's not capable of closeted behavior the closet would be death for him.Matthew Broderick plays Alan the young male model who Harvey falls for and he's as winning here as he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

	schema:reviewBody "A notable film on several levels. First it was way ahead of America in being a relatively mainstream film that treated gay men as people of depth value humor and worth making a film about. Although there is sad irony in the fact this huge hit play took so long to make it to the screen that AIDS had already totally altered the landscape by the time of its release. That's something the film only notes in the closing credits and gives it a bit of a 'rose colored glasses' hue. But beyond any politics or social significance this is also a very well acted funny and moving look at one man Arnold played by the unique and charismatic Harvey Firestein who wrote the play and screenplay as he looks for love  both romantic and familial in a sometimes very cold world. If Firestein's performance can occasionally feel theatrical it's also entirely appropriate for the startingtoage drag queen performer he plays. What's wonderful is how Firestein always keeps the humanity under Arnold's occasional flamboyance very alive as does Anne Bancroft as his 'difficult' mother. Later in her career Bancroft could tend towards theatricality on screen as well but she tones it down just enough to feel real here and anyway lets face it next to a drag queen who is more innately dramatic than a Jewish mother? I grew up with one trust me. Matthew Broderick and Brian Kerwin also do very good work in support Broderick as a sexy but understated young man totally at ease with his sexuality and Kerwin as a confused bi sexual trying to work out his. While never rising to the level of a great film the direction is very straightforward and bland there's almost a TV movie look to it it never completely surpasses it's theatrical origins it's certainly a good touching human and important one  although to a generation growing up with the reality of gay marriage and deeper integration of gay people into society some of the historical importance may be lost. But not the essential timeless embrace of kindness love respect and understanding".

	schema:reviewBody "I was born raised and lived in New York City until I was forty and I saw a lot of Broadway shows but it has always been one of my great regrets that I never saw Harvey Fierstein's monumental play TORCH SONG TRILOGY which he both wrote and starred in. So when I saw that a film version had been made and wonder of wonders it starred Fierstein I rushed out to see it. And I was not disappointed.In the interim I had read the play. On the stage TST was an experimental piece with minimal sets lots of overlapping dialogue something that works well on the stage but is hard to do on film and a running time of nearly four hours. So when I saw that the film's running time was just two hours I prepared myself for a hack job. But Fierstein himself adapted his own play to the screen I should have known better. The end result is you might say a compressed version of the play Fierstein made a good many judicious cuts in the dialogue leaving only the choicest bits and the finished product shines like a wellcut diamond.TST tells the story of ten years in the life of Arnold Beckoff Fierstein a female impersonator in New York City with a romantic nature surrounded by men looking for sex Arnold is looking for love and it can be cold out there in the big city.Yet he does find love and more than once. The first time in the person of a bisexual schoolteacher named Ed Reese winningly played by Brian Kerwin who ultimately can't make up his mind which bed he wants to sleep in. Ed isn't a bad guy but he is terrified of being gay and tries desperately to make a life with his girlfriend Laurel Karen Young in a brilliant funnysad performance in the end succeeding only in hurting both Laurel and Arnold who drops him.Arnold's next love interest literally falls into his lap. Onstage at the club Arnold is heckled by a bunch of young men who are very drunk and one of them upon being confronted responds by passing out. Arnold takes him home to sleep it off. The young man by name Alan Simon barely out of his teens is brilliantly played here by the indecently beautiful Matthew Broderick. Looking down at the sleeping boy Arnold says If you have an IQ of over 30 then there is no God. When Alan awakens Arnold serves him breakfast gives him directions to the subway and locks himself in the bathroom until the kid leaves. But what he does not know is that Alan has developed a huge crush on Arnold and he pursues him quite openly until Arnold's defenses crumble.Arnold's love life goes on with more than its share of triumphs and tragedies. Running on a parallel track is his relationship with his mother Anne Bancroft sensational as always on the surface your typical New York Jewish Mother who hovers over her kids and has a gift for laying on the guilt. But there is more to her than that. Arnold loves her and is frustrated by her in equal measure she has never accepted him for who he is and constantly makes references to the mythical wife he will someday have.Arnold's journey of love and loss and reconciliation climaxes with a final confrontation with his mother in which he finally lays down the law There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life!Condensing a four hour play into a two hour movie seems an impossible task but Fierstein and Company pull it off brilliantly and the end product is a warm and winning film often funny and sometimes tragic but always real. And the best part is that Hollywood did not insist on putting a name star in the lead. The part was written by Fierstein for Fierstein because on some level Arnold IS Harvey and it's perfect for his rubbery funny face which reflects every emotion he feels and while he starts out considering himself somewhat less than attractive by the end of the film he has gained considerable dignity and is almost handsome.A joy to watch from start to finish.".

Anne Bancroft a great actress is miscast once again as Harvey's mother she seldom found a role that suited her particularly after The Graduate.

I was fortunate to see the world premiere of 2 of them in San Francisco at Theatre Rhinoceros.  The combination into a single movie makes for a very powerful movie.I'm told that Matthew Broderick agreed to be Harvey Fierstein's lover in this movie he even kisses Harvey in the movie in gratitude for Harvey's giving him a break on the Broadway stage when Torch Song was first performed as a play.  In the original play Matthew Broderick plays the son.It was a very courageous thing for Matthew Broderick at the height of his career to play a gay character and especially to kiss another guy knowing that he would be dropped from all the teen heartthrob magazines and would lose a ton of movie roles.Between Harvey and Matthew this is a film well worth seeing.".

One of the most touching scenes comes at the end of the movie when Arnold finally has it out with his overbearing mother.  He gives it to her and good and in the end finds that he has all of the love that he needs and some pretty good memories as well.  It is a film that affirms life love and being proud of who you are no matter what others think of you.  Fierstien and Bancroft give powerful performances and Matthew Broderick is adorable as Alan.

	schema:reviewBody "Frank John Candy is a good policeman but he is framed for theft when he catches other officers pilfering electronics. He is kicked off the force in short order. Meanwhile Norman Eugene Levy is an inept lawyer who messes up big time when he assigned to defend a Charles Manson type offender. The judge in the case orders Norman to find alternative work. With few options Frank and Norman both enroll in a security guard officers training school where they become fast friends and partners. This is in part because so many of their classmates are complete idiots like the man who wonders if he should put his own name on the application line that says name! Frank and Norman's first assignment is to stand watch inside a factory but they soon realize that their company Guard Dog Security may have some criminals on the staff ones that are stealing from the companies they are supposed to be guarding. Can Frank and Norman with the help of the firmowner's daughter Maggie Meg Ryan expose the bad elements in the company without getting fired or killed? This is a very funny film with abundant laughs. Yes it may be considered a more lowbrow vehicle but it is still very mirthful and will cause any viewer to laugh themselves silly. Just watching the lessthanintelligent guards on the staff of the security firm makes for a fun fun evening. Candy Levy and Ryan are terrific but then so are the relative unknowns who round out the rest of the cast. Sets costumes and production values are great too. If you want to see a classic Candy film this is a great choice for it displays his marvelous and abundant talent no doubt. But anyone truly wishing to transport themselves to a world of laughter will find this one a very good choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie about a framed police officer and an inept lawyer  turned  security guards. Once licensed and assigned to their new jobs they uncover a labor union teamsterMafia plot to embezzle a load of money from the employees Pension and Welfare Fund. John Candy is almost serious in this role as he ferrets out the bad guys defends the honor of Meg Ryan's character Maggie Cavanaugh and helps to reverse her father's wayward ethics. Oddly enough Eugene Levy is the funny guy to Candy's straight man act. It is an odd formula but it was quite effective. This is one of Candy's better movies and the most serious role in which I've seen him thus far. LOVED Candy's small role as Augie Morosco in Once Upon A Crime 1992 On the firing range after a demonstration As you can see it's really quite simple. Just remember when you pull the trigger the bullets come out going very very fast. So make sure to keep the weapon pointed away from you. Now that's about it you are now ARMED guards God help us all. Maggie Cavanaugh.I am a true John Candy fan and own most of his movies. But while many of his fans have all but dogged this production I found it quite entertaining and a breath of fresh air. Also starring Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr. as Bruno President Lindberg in Fifth Element and many many more Robert Loggia as Michael Carlino a Jimmy Hoffaesque character and Kenneth McMillan as Captain Clarence O'Connell Maggie Cavanaugh's father. Meg Ryan's performance was sweet and honest. She has done better but this was in 1986 and her experience was not yet as worldly as it is now. Even without taking that into consideration hers was one of the brightest of the supporting roles. In the end Candy's character's reputation is redeemed and his life as a law enforcement officer is restored and plays out to a very satisfying 1980's ending.While there are better comedies out there and also while most of Candy's other movies are better this is one of my favorites of his line.It gets a 6.810 from...the Fiend .".

I like the part where John is riding in truck with the cowboy and John pulls out a huge handgun. The cowboy says I've never seen a gun like that before. John says It's a 50 caliber only legal in 2 states and this isn't one of them. Another part to mention is John on the motorcycle. John is in this old style biker outfit and riding an old police motorcycle. The outfit is reminiscent of something out of Rebel Without a Cause. The old motorcycle was probably a old Harley police bike. For you gun fans out there the gun John is using is probably the 50 caliber revolver made by Ruger. This pretty entertaining film. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Candy is not one of the all time great actors but he is memorable in his own way. His characters tend to be cute cuddly and sometimes simply clumsy. His characters were enjoyable and his movies entertaining. Unfortunately now that he is dead others try to imitate his style of acting and just don't seem to come close. Everybody is an original and that goes just as true for John Candy as it does for everybody else. Armed and Dangerous is about a police officer Dooley John Candy who catches a couple of crooked cops stealing television sets but is framed instead. Another character a hopeless lawyer is encouraged by a judge to quit law and find another career so they both become private security guards. As guards they are forced to join a union and discover that this union is conducting some very illicit business including staging robberies when the security guards are off duty. Dooley and the exlawyer are caught by this scam and decide to expose the crooks. This movie is an antiunion movie. In every part of the movie the union is portrayed in a very bad light. The union bosses are all crooks and the cast is made up of very thuggish looking characters. The boss is corrupt and the union is more concerned with making money for themselves than for looking after the workers. When confronted with a lawyer who asks too many questions they ban the lawyer from the meetings so that they might continue with their crooked schemes. The purpose of this movie seems to reinforce in our minds that unions are evil and that they should be disbanded. Americans have always hated unions because they are too left and infringe on the right of the individual to make money. The movie ignores that facet of the union that protects the worker though. Instead we are constantly forced to see the evil side of the union and not the good side. It is an entertaining movie with its share of comedy. Armed and Dangerous is a movie that John Candy fans will appreciate and though I do not consider myself a devout fan I do not mind him. In another way this movie seems to be like Police Academy except it does not focus on the training but rather the work.".

It's just such a STUPID movie and I guess thats the charm it holds for me. Candy is the mainliner here but I really liked Levy's hapless character getting in all sorts of crap because he's following Candy around as a rent a cop no less!. It's probably a 410 star movie for the objectionable viewer but I guess I grew up on this flick seeing it in the 80's and the scene of the two of them coming out of the porn store wearing the drag and sm getup is gut bustingly priceless stuff! I'll really miss Candy and it's a shame he didn't make better choices for movie script's because some are really really bad but although this one may fall in that group for some it's a funny flick in my book! See it with Dragnet as a double feature and an early Police Academy flick for a triple feature one with Bobcat in it!. 710 so bad it's funny.".

It's just such a STUPID movie and I guess thats the charm it holds for me. Candy is the mainliner here but I really liked Levy's hapless character getting in all sorts of crap because he's following Candy around as a rent a cop no less!. It's probably a 410 star movie for the objectionable viewer but I guess I grew up on this flick seeing it in the 80's and the scene of the two of them coming out of the porn store wearing the drag and sm getup is gut bustingly priceless stuff! I'll really miss Candy and it's a shame he didn't make better choices for movie script's because some are really really bad but although this one may fall in that group for some it's a funny flick in my book! See it with Dragnet as a double feature and an early Police Academy flick for a triple feature one with Bobcat in it!. 710 so bad it's funny.";

Where did our sense of style ever go? If I had lived in the 80s and been in my prime I would have lived as Gene Wilder's hair or Eugene Levy's hair.

This film also has a lot to offer like shark catching and is a teaching tool to cops who climb trees to rescue cats from them although how Candy got up there is a big visual fault upon the director while not showing him clinging onto any others on the start up.

Although running for only a week in Adelaide cinemas here's one comedy flick I really liked and still do up until this day. Judy 'Boobs' Landers as one of Candy's girls is another comedy asset.

Well they figure something is up and they start to unravel a conspiracy which still makes for an okay film but I almost wish they just continued to have misadventures as security guards.

	schema:headline " The film's main problem is its lack of intelligence humor and wit as well as containing some boring and typical dialogue expected from a film like 'Police Academy' not a film with John Candy and Eu";
	schema:reviewBody "Armed and DangerousWell here's another copbuddy comedy from the eighties with a weird sense of humor Armed and Dangerous.' It features old SCTV Canadian buddies John Candy and Eugene Levy in one of their most forgettable roles. John Candy plays Frank Dooley a policeman who one day finds some corrupt cops stealing some TVs. Unfortunately for Dooley the tables are turned when he confronts them and gets the blame causing him to lose his badge and suffer.Eugene Levy plays Norman Kane a bumbling inept lawyer who we feel got his job because he either had extremely rich parents or just made some fake certificates to prove he is a lawyer. One day while defending a client Norman realizes that he is about to lose the case. The man he represents is a psycho who will almost surely kill him after he gets out of jail. So Norman makes a deal with the court judge the judge hates Norman so he tells him that he will put the psycho behind bars forever if Norman quits his job because he is a Disgrace to lawyers.' And that's exactly what Norman does. He quits his job.So now both men decide to enter the Watchdog Security' program where they meet each other for the first time as well as the daughter of Watchdog president Maggie Cavanaugh Meg Ryan. Candy and Levy are later assigned night watch at an old factory and unfortunately for the two men they have no idea that something more than meets the eye is going on if they wish to keep their job they must discover the truth and reveal it.John Candy is great as Frank Dooley. I thought his character would be the bumbling one but in fact Dooley is smart and Levy's character Norman is the stupid one. Dooley's motivation behind it all is that he wants his respect as an officer back he took the blame once and he wants to get his badge back.Eugene Levy is endearingly dumb as Norman a guy we all find a place for in our hearts. He obviously has a crush on Ryan's character but is not as persistent or cocky as Dooley is he just can't muster up enough guts to ask her out. However he is not completely stupid. He isn't the kind of character that talks with a lisp and has crossed eyes. He is justEugene Levy.Despite the two comedians' great performances however the film is simply average. The gags become old after a while and the ending is quite ridiculous and not even fun. Candy and Levy try their best at delivering laughs but fail miserably mainly because the script is so awful and the direction wonders around aimlessly searching for the right direction.The beginningfirst half of the film is actually quite funny but eventually after the men join Watchdog Security the film suffers from lack of dialogue and lack of direction director Mark L.

	onyx:emotionText "Armed and DangerousWell here's another copbuddy comedy from the eighties with a weird sense of humor Armed and Dangerous.' It features old SCTV Canadian buddies John Candy and Eugene Levy in one of their most forgettable roles. John Candy plays Frank Dooley a policeman who one day finds some corrupt cops stealing some TVs. Unfortunately for Dooley the tables are turned when he confronts them and gets the blame causing him to lose his badge and suffer.Eugene Levy plays Norman Kane a bumbling inept lawyer who we feel got his job because he either had extremely rich parents or just made some fake certificates to prove he is a lawyer. One day while defending a client Norman realizes that he is about to lose the case. The man he represents is a psycho who will almost surely kill him after he gets out of jail. So Norman makes a deal with the court judge the judge hates Norman so he tells him that he will put the psycho behind bars forever if Norman quits his job because he is a Disgrace to lawyers.' And that's exactly what Norman does. He quits his job.So now both men decide to enter the Watchdog Security' program where they meet each other for the first time as well as the daughter of Watchdog president Maggie Cavanaugh Meg Ryan. Candy and Levy are later assigned night watch at an old factory and unfortunately for the two men they have no idea that something more than meets the eye is going on if they wish to keep their job they must discover the truth and reveal it.John Candy is great as Frank Dooley. I thought his character would be the bumbling one but in fact Dooley is smart and Levy's character Norman is the stupid one. Dooley's motivation behind it all is that he wants his respect as an officer back he took the blame once and he wants to get his badge back.Eugene Levy is endearingly dumb as Norman a guy we all find a place for in our hearts. He obviously has a crush on Ryan's character but is not as persistent or cocky as Dooley is he just can't muster up enough guts to ask her out. However he is not completely stupid. He isn't the kind of character that talks with a lisp and has crossed eyes. He is justEugene Levy.Despite the two comedians' great performances however the film is simply average. The gags become old after a while and the ending is quite ridiculous and not even fun. Candy and Levy try their best at delivering laughs but fail miserably mainly because the script is so awful and the direction wonders around aimlessly searching for the right direction.The beginningfirst half of the film is actually quite funny but eventually after the men join Watchdog Security the film suffers from lack of dialogue and lack of direction director Mark L.

This can't miss at the box office and it didn't. Of course if the film were made today it would also include Libby Holman's lesbian affairs. As the Code was now in place that was an aspect that MGM couldn't film in Reckless. Although Harlow is clearly in the lead Franchot Tone also got one of his best roles as the young millionaire from the horsey set who's not wrapped too tight although that's not apparent at first. For once his part from MGM did not include just wearing tails and being charming.Of the leads William Powell is clearly in third place he just has to be dapper and supportive as the family lawyer for Harlow and grandmother May Robson. He gets to do a great drunk act though. Speaking of Robson her part in Reckless probably led to her being cast as Janet Gaynor's grandmother in A Star Is Born.This was an early film for Rosalind Russell who plays the girl Tone jilts when he marries Harlow. She plays it nice and supportive. Russell did China Seas as well with Harlow and in her memoirs she says that Harlow was a kind generous and supportive to a new kid on the lot. Who could know she would be dead within two years.Reckless is one of Jean Harlow's best acted parts in her career. Fans of her and Franchot Tone should not miss this film by any means.".

A drama can have aspects that are humorous and a comedy can have its serious moments but when it comes right down to it most films have to be primarily one type...and this isn't.There's an overlylong production number early on in the film which though important to the plot should have been much shorter. The scenes in the funhouse were quite clever and interesting and reminded me of funhouses I experienced as a child back in the 1950s. William Powell plays a sort of thinmanesque character here with his best scene perhaps being when he professes his love for the Jean Harlow character not realizing she has fallen asleep in the hammock. Franchot Tone plays the heavydrinking likable playboy...a role that he was often typecast in.So things are going happily funnily and musically along and in my view boringlyuntil almost exactly halfway through the film when suddenly it transforms itself into a drama. Franchot Tone realizes he is still in love with his former fianc Jean Harlow realizes Tone is not really in love with her and suddenly Tone commits suicide. Not to mention that Harlow is secretly pregnant. Now don't get me wrong but up until it turned into a drama I wasn't enjoying the film. Once it became a drama it got quite interesting.Some of the supporting actors here are interesting. A preAndy Hardy Mickey Rooney is quite good. May Robson is superb as the grandmother. Rosiland Russel has a small but key role and you may not recognize her because of how young she is here. Henry Stephenson comes across as the bad father of Franchot Tone but redeems himself as the film comes to a conclusion and he is a welcome presence in any film. There are two mugs in the film  Nat Pendleton who is interesting and Ted Healy of Three Stooges fame who is not.So I gave this film 5 stars out of 10 because half of the film is interesting.".

Spotting the likes of Mickey Rooney Leon Ames Allan Jones Margaret Dumont and Paul Fix saved this movie for me. If it weren't for that little game I'd have regarded this film as a total waste  of both my time and a deep talented cast.The film slowly develops a plot that never seems to gel and the characters are all very onedimensional except Franchot Tone who delivers a reasonable performance. However his character's fate comes out of the blue and is the point at which the tone of the story veers sharply in a bizarre way.The early light comedy part of this movie is pretty aimless and it jumps around a lot. The second half of the movie is like a completely different film spliced onto the first half. It too meanders but unlike the first half it is maudlin and melodramatic.The final scene is preposterous. The supposedtobe climactic speech by Harlow would not come close to turning a hostile audience in her favor. She repeats a few generalized statements that no doubt everybody had read many times in the press coverage of the scandal. Talk about rehash!Oh yeah there are quite a few discontinuities too for those of you who can entertain yourselves by spotting them. There is a shot of Tone's yacht in broad daylight an intervening interior scene and then Harlow and Tone go out onto the deck in darkest night without the slightest suggestion of any time having passed.I was drawn to this film when I saw the incredible cast.

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently when this debuted it was a box office dud. And apparently Jean Harlow was offended because she thought the studio deliberately put parallels into the script that mirrored her tragic marriage to a man who died under suspicious circumstances even today no one seems exactly sure what happened to her husband Paul Bern. What is obvious is that Harlow should have been offended as the script clearly takes advantage of Bern's death. Now if the film had come out shortly after this tragedy perhaps the studio could have been excused as they might have been able to claim that they made such a film to help Harlow's image after all like the character in the film the public COULD have blamed Harlow for his death. But with a three year gap between them it's obvious they were just trying to exploit the tragedy for ticket salesand I am surprised that apparently William Powell was able to convince Harlow to play this part. Frankly based on the end results I think she should have faced suspension and refused! Now this isn't because all the film is badbut the ending is just godawful and makes the entire film come off as rather seedy and stupid.It's important to note that after the film was completed a total idiot at the studio thought they should add some song and dance numberseven though Harlow was incapable of doing eitherespecially sing. Since she couldn't sing they dubbed another's voice and the end result is without a doubt the WORST job of dubbing in the history of Hollywood. At first I really did think that they deliberately did it badly as a parodybut later at the end is a supposedly poignant moment and once again her lips aren't even close to being in sync and the voice is so obviously another's. Heck had they used Paul Robson's voice I don't it would have come off much worse!! As far as the story goes the first 90 of the film aside from the singing and dancing isn't bad even if it is taking full advantage of the Bern tragedy as well as the death Libby Holman's husbandwhich is even closer to the plot of this film than the HarlowBern death. Harlow plays an actress who is very much like herself. When she meets a rich society guy Franchot Tone they fall in love and soon marrymuch to the consternation of her agent William Powellwho really was in love with Harlow in real life. However things are not rosy as Tone's father and many society folk don't accept a common actress. But Harlow handles it very well and soon the society swells warm up to her. However Tone is a complete loser and spends all his time drinking and mopingand regretting marrying Harlow. Instead he thinks back to his old fiance Rosalind Russell and wishes he'd married her. Russell is classy and from an old established familyand Tone seems much more concerned about this than whether or not his wife loves or respects him. Eventually Tone becomes so depressed that he kills himself just like Holman and Harlow's husbands. And the rich society swells turn on Harlow even though she is practically angelic in how she handles this. All this leads to her returning to the stage and a completely horrible ending that simply made me cringe.The bottom line is that the actors try their best but the script is horrid in spots and the singing is cringeworthy. It's sad as without the terrible ending and singing I would have given this one a 7. As it is 4 is probably a bit charitable. Worth seeing because it's so awful and exploitative but not a good film by any standard.".

The dialog particularly in the first half of the movie is light and amusing and there are a couple of nice musical numbers. It gets a little fast paced and soap operatic towards the end but it's always entertaining. This is the film that got Powell and Harlow together personally for the last two years of her life and their chemistry shows. The early scene with them lounging together and him proposing in his own way as she drowses off is fantastic and Powell's scenes with the old granny are also priceless. It's also fun to see a young Mickey Rooney in a couple of scenes. Not perfect but watch this one for the cast and their performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "RECKLESS MetroGoldwynMayer 1935 directed by Victor Fleming is an odd little title for a movie classified as a musical for that there's no reckless driving involved nor reckless living to classify its story. It is however a title tune for a production number delivered by the studio's platinum blonde bombshell Jean Harlow 19111937. For Harlow starring in a backstage story where she gets to sing and dance one would expect a sort of gold digger theme involving three sassy Broadway show girls possibly Harlow Una Merkel and Patsy Kelly out to nab some rich husbands. Instead RECKLESS is very much Harlow's as the center of attention for a scripted story by Oliver Jeffries supposedly based loosely on the life and incidents of an actual entertainer named Lilly Holman.Set on Broadway in the Great White Way Ned Riley William Powell is introduced as a sports promoter staying at the 43rd Street Hotel with his assistants Blossom Nat Pendleton and Smiley Ted Healy. His sleep is interrupted by the arrival of Granny May Robson coming to Ned to have him raise bail for her granddaughter stage star Mona Leslie Jean Harlow who's being held on a reckless driving charge at the House of Detention for Women. Ned being Mona's agent and discoverer arranges her release in time for the upcoming charity benefit only to discover the stage show arranged by millionaire playboy Bob Morrison Jr. Franchot Tone who has bought every seat in the theater so he could be the only one to watch Mona perform. Later Mona becomes romantically involved with Bob. They eventually elope much to the chagrin of Bob's father Henry Stephenson having high hopes for his son marrying Josephine Mercer Rosalind Russell his childhood sweetheart. Though Josephine comes to like Mona the rest of Bob's family and friends prove otherwise making her feel like an outsider. After Josephine marries Ralph Watson Leon Ames billed as Leon Waycoff Bob realizes the error in his ways leading to tragedy involving Mona's custody battle over her baby and attempt of a theatrical comeback to a very unruly audience.In the listing of players credited in order of appearance rather than the standard billing there's Mickey Rooney as Eddie a little boy briefly seen in two scenes with William Powell Robert Light Paul Mercer Josephine's brother James Ellison Dale Eberly Charles Middleton Harold Huber and Charles C. Wilson. There's also famous wrestlers of the day Man Mountain Dean Hans Steinke and Ernie Hayes appearing as themselves. Look quickly for Allan Jones singer and Margaret Dumont woman in audience best known for their major supporting performances opposite the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA MGM 1935 each taking time away from that comedy classic in cameo appearances. Songs featured in this production include Reckless by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein Ensemble Jean Harlow Allan Jones Carl Randall and Nina Mae McKinney Everything's Been Done Before sung by Allan Jones Cyclone dance number Here's What My Heart is Saying and Reckless. Though Harlow sings her vocalization is obviously dubbed with choreography lavish scale but forgettable. Interestingly the Reckless number was selected in part of its musical segment profiled for the documentary on MGM musicals titled THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT 1974.The problem about RECKLESS clocked at 97 minutes and produced by David O. Selznick is that it could have been a really fine musical even better. Rather than presenting a full comedy with standard singing and dancing the plot generally looks more like a setback to those melodramatic overtones found in those early talkie MGM musicals 192930. RECKLESS does have its share of amusements and wisecracks commonly found in thirties movies however with William Powell doing his share with Harlow and the rest of the cast. Powell and Harlow had much better luck in the hilarious comedy LIBELED LADY 1936 but it's only during the latter portion of RECKLESS does the story weaken to conclusion that doesn't ring true. Harlow and Franchot Tone have worked amusingly well together in both BOMBSHELL 1933 and THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI 1934 but with RECKLESS having their serious moments together especially during Tone's drunken tantrums they are either satisfactory or a bit unpleasant. Rosalind Russell is a refreshing presence here while the rest of the cast tries hard to rise above this soso script.Considering mixed reactions then and now RECKLESS wouldn't be classified as Hollywood's greatest musicals. It's somewhat allstar cast and MGM gloss does save it from being lost and forgotten to classic film historians especially over the years with its presentations in revival movie houses in New York City as Museum of Modern Art 1980 to a full house or the Regency Theater in the seventies and eighties followed by availability on video cassette 1995 DVD and broadcasts on cable television's Turner Classic Movies since 1994.

Trouble is her singing is in a group shot at that end that's so far away you can't really see her on the television screen. I'm thinking this has to do with the fact that unless they played domestics black performers weren't allowed to be on the same screen as their white counterparts not unlike the line in Show Boat that I saw and heard this morning about the same thing concerning the play in there when Julie almost got arrested. While I was looking for Nina during the rest of the picture I got mostly bored with the plot of the triangle between Harlow William Powell and Franchot Tone. It was interesting when I recognized many of the supporting players Nat Pendleton Ted Healy after leaving The Three Stooges to Columbia May Robson Rosalind Russell a 14 yearold Mickey Rooney in a couple of scenes frequent Marx Brothers foil Margaret Dumont as one of the women at the end yelling at the Harlow character to get off the stage and as the jockey Gold Dust former Our Ganger Allen Farina Hoskins.

As wrong and unsympathetic as it may come across these little people look naturally eerie and their appearances made an impression on me that was even stronger than the mesmerizing story. Even Dwarfs Started Small is a revolutionary film pretty much covering all the daily wars every human being wages only the protagonists are all dwarfs. Since these people's position in society already are oppressed as it is this film looks extra powerful and compelling. All the actors and actresses deliver amazing performances even though none of them had any experience in cinema. Especially the 'main' character Hombre is a truly intriguing man. Other aspects that increase the depressing intensity of this film are the black and white cinematography the extended sequences showing farm animals and  most of all  the raw tribal music.

It's got a great idea behind it inmates at a mental institution on one of the Canary Islands pretourism create an anarchic uprising with practically no one else in sight and the headmaster locks himself in with a retarded patient while the others go wild and crazy albeit still staying in the confines of the grounds of the area. I also liked when Herzog went for an interesting route in the picture psychologically and in mood which was to show how chaos and disarray even if among little people can actually become rather aimless and uncanny. There is no plot it's just a series of interconnected segments that seem to be happening in real time where they do things like ogle at naked girls in magazines kill a pig randomly give constant torture to a couple of blind dwarfs circle around a constantly 360 degree spinning car and with Herzog sometimes just as interested in the animals chickens a camel the pig a monkey on the premises as he is with his whacked out little folk.But the problem arises then with the work that since it is plot less even if it ends with the headmaster talking to a branch outside as a metaphor for human control and what is and what isn't a free will or spirit perhaps there's the danger of becoming tedious with what goes on and that's exactly the trap that I think Herzog falls into here. It's not that he is out blatantly to mock them although like with Stroszek the tendency to laugh is hard to avoid at times especially with its documentarystyle anythinggoes approach but there isn't any grand metaphor I could really obtain from the material at least from a first viewing and Herzog seemed to be having too much fun getting the dwarfs to do both the mundane and whatever to get something consistently interesting. While he does have one character who ends up being quite memorable the freakylaughing hilarious Hombre all onenote of course but then again isn't everyone here there's nothing to tie the parts together that are worth watching for to make it good enough for the whole. There's surrealism of course the fate of the monkey and the car and an image or two that strikes greatly when the headmaster or whomever tries to get the attention of the onepasserby on the island but it just didn't compel me or surprise me in ways that Herzog at his best can do.Not that I'm telling you to not see the film as a fan I mean. The title alone should be a calling card to anyone who might have a bit of interest in the subject matter and I'm sure a work like this has inspired a few avantgarde director's out there I saw it as a possible forefather for Korine's Gummo. Yet it's own lackadaisical use of narrative and Herzog's insistence on ambiguity and derangement makes it a kind of schizophrenic work that makes it a fun yet flawed trip.".

Yes it has a lot of fabulous images and moments but for me the problem is that it doesn't work as a film very well. It's kinda poetic kinda surreal kinda nightmarish Herzog has said that the film is a prolonged nightmare in his view and kinda like a lengthy performance art piece but in my view the individual elements are not tied together as well as they should be. It does seem like he simply took a group of dwarfs out to the desert gave them some rough improvisational boundaries told them to go crazy filmed it and somewhat randomly edited it.In a very rough way the film does have a plot. It begins with a group of dwarfs in something like a prison. Someone offcamera seems to ask one about a crime and then most of the film is in flashback giving us the story of how the dwarfs ended up in their situation at the beginning of the film. The backstory has the dwarfs rebelling at some kind of institution. At first it seems like maybe it was a mental home but then an authority figure keeps referring to himself as an instructor and there is talk at various points of a principal being away so maybe it's supposed to be a school.The bulk of the film is just the dwarfs rebelling by doing things like breaking manufactured objects harassing a couple blind dwarfs torturing animals destroying plants and trees burning stuff and having a food fight.As fun in a dark twisted way of course as a lot of this stuff is in isolation and as entertaining as some of the dialogue and behavior of the dwarfs isthe laughing is particularly infectious there's not a lot of structure to anything including on a meta level to the film as an artwork. There are thematic and content resemblances to Tod Browning's film Freaks 1932 you can see how some of this stuff probably influenced David Lynch and Herzog made slight allusions to films like The Wild One 1953 but Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen is not as good as either the films that influenced it or the films that it influenced.There are themes explored and interpretations abound because the film is so intentionally ambiguous. You can see the film as a critique from many different angles on rebellion you can see it as a meditation on entropy you can see it as a commentary on people inheriting a world they didn't make . . . you can see it as many things. While all that stuff is interesting to think about having an intriguing theme isn't sufficient for having a good film either.Still Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen is worth a watch for fans of weirdness because of its arresting images and content on a trees level but I would hardly recommend it to anyone else and even for us freaks it's a pity that this couldn't have been a better movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's an honorable director going extremely bad with something painfully terrible and it's the first time that I ever see something truly worrying from an outstanding director. Person in question is Werner Herzog Aguirre the Wrath of God and Stroszek. He was very young when he made it one of his earliest experiences and it could be a good film if his head was in the game by that I mean if he managed to mix surrealism with a concrete text including his political criticisms and a bit of fantasy and allegory. Buuel could do it perfectly. But this isn't Buuel doing an allegedly political allegory on Nazism or Fascism disguised as an empty story involving revolted dwarfs. This is Herzog going completely nuts with something that leads to nothing. Even Dwarfs Started Small revolves a strange dwarf revolution that goes erratically bad when angry dwarfs take control of a little island controlled by one police officer also a midget who arrested one of the revolution leaders leaving him tied to a chair. The latter isn't worried always laughing and never speaking with his captor while his friends are vandalizing in the streets driving cars hurting animals and placing a strange hierarchy between themselves. The riot drags on and on as the movie without a single worthy dialog scenes played on randomly and with a theme song played like four or five times during the whole thing working as a violation of our patience and senses and no ways of being translated whatever that language was.It lacks in coherence time and time again. Where's the drive to make us going? Where's the ambition and the social commentary? If this was a comedy I didn't laugh once. An horror film? Well it was so horrific I couldn't believe in my eyes. Empty images that goes nowhere they're just there because it can scripted it can be directed it can be filmed but it can't cause anything other than boredom repulse strangeness. Being bizarre for its own sake is useless unless if you're creating a powerful imagery like Malle did like Black Moon and Herzog isn't a director of such ideals. At least that's what I thought. One of those movies you feel completely exhausted emptied and imagining the worst of yourself Why am I still watching this mess? Where are you going with this Werner? Those kind of thoughts Even Dwarfs... is simply not worthy of anyone's time. Wanna discover Werner go everywhere else but here. The symbolic rating is a formality related with traces of originality good scenes or parts when I thought this could be saved and be a fine movie. But that song will haunt me for life. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "The ultimate concern of Even Dwarfs Started Small 1970 is not the plot or the characters  or indeed the obvious gimmick of the casting and presentation  but in the creation of a certain sense or atmosphere pertaining to the broader representation of madness and insanity. As a result it can viewed as either a metaphor or a microcosm of society with a cynical and satirical comment on the then contemporary ideas of a civilization with no rules and limitations  a forced utopia if you will  and the inevitable escalation of violence corruption and contempt that could only ever thrive in such a characteristically free environment. Although these ideas and interpretations do lend a certain sense of context to the images and themes presented herein the eventual intent of Even Dwarfs Started Small is to present a story on the most simple and visual of levels creating an escalating sense of emotion that moves wildly from moments of humour to horror until finally reaching a feverpitch level wherein all the notions blur together into one.Herzog would probably reject any interpretation other than the literal one of dwarfs rebelling against authority but then again Herzog's word isn't intended to be taken as gospel. The natural contradictions of the setup here in which the fight of the characters to free themselves from what they see as a corrupt and abusive society ultimately giving way to something that is even more oppressive is an intelligent one something that you could interpret on a political level or in fact as a widerreaching comment about the position of the outsider within society. Likewise the casting of the dwarfs' works on a number of other more interesting levels most obviously in the creation of a world that we must carefully readjust to and learn to experience from a completely different perspective. The buildings cars furniture trees and animals remain the same as how we would experience them on a daytoday basis but thrown into this veritable mix we have characters that are literally dwarfed  overwhelmed even  by the world around them creating a further rift that propels these notions of revolution and defiance.In a world in which even climbing onto a bed or reaching up to pull the door handle becomes a accomplishment as epic in scope as that of Herzog's ultimate personification of singleminded determination and intensity Fitzcarraldo 1982 the plight of the dwarfs in this film takes on a greater meaning as the film begins with something of a moral victory that simply cannot be sustained given the heightened sense of reality that the film exists in. We're never entirely sure as to what triggers the revolt or why there is only one dwarf left in charge of the compound barricaded in his office with one of the other dwarfs tied to a chair as a hostage or indeed what purposes this compound fulfilled in its previously active form. This persistent abstraction of the background details of the story forces us to focus more closely on the relationship between the larger group unit and the slow spiral of dysfunction and destruction that escalates from one scene to the next. If you attempt to approach the film on any such level of story and character you might possibly be disappointed or even offended by Herzog's stark presentation. Instead the real point of the film is in the atmosphere that it creates and in the feelings that it forms as we watch these enigmatic and often provocative images unfold.If you're familiar with Herzog and his work you'll be able to appreciate this style from films such as Aguirre Wrath of God 1972 or Heart of Glass 1976 with the continual juxtaposition between moments of abstracted realism and bizarre feverdream hallucinations that seem to exist within the story free of context. This continual contrast adds to the dreamlike or indeed nightmarish aspect of the film which recalls elements of Todd Browning's difficult masterpiece Freaks 1932 and not simply on the more obvious superficial level but in the way in which the film gets darker and darker as it progresses towards a violent and memorable final. Though a brief description of some of the scenes and situations presented in the film might fail to shock an audience viewers should be advised that the incredibly heightened sense of tension and the abstract surrealism created by the use of cinematography editing location and music lends the film a suffocating air in which the destruction of personal property plant life and animals becomes hypnotic frightening and entirely overwhelming.For me it's one of Herzog's best and most fascinating works filled with bold visual imagination a potent message and element of satirical intent room for interpretation and some incredibly disturbing and enigmatic imagery. More to the point however the film remains an unrivalled visual experience one that goes beyond the conventions of story character and ideology and instead creates a cinema that is simply felt clearly an absurd and disturbing work of pure cinematic expression. In many respects I would consider it Herzog's most intense and perhaps even most disturbing film and one of the most powerful films ever made with the location setting theme character and visual presentation creating something that is entirely affecting and entirely unforgettable.".

If the evening news makes you laugh maybe you should give this a look. Don't think this is some dwarfspoitation flick  this story could have been filmed with standard actors and retained most of its meaning.  But creating this vision of dwarves in an oversized world makes the story timeless makes the characters closer to universal.  The inmates rebel against a world they never made but they don't want freedom They just want to hit something back. When I watch CNN that makes even more sense.  Bottom line Herzog made his casting choice so we'd all be feelin' it yo.

After that the film starts to become rough going. The film really has no beginning and no real end. Its all middle. After awhile watching midgets commit endless acts of vandalism becomes tedious and boring. Half way through the film the inmates begin to commit acts of cruelty on animals which makes the film rather unpleasant. The crucifixtion of a monkey on a cross is not my idea of good taste. This is one of those films that is unusual enough that I would recommend seeing it once but only once at that.".

It seems no less depraved than most of life. I'm just disappointed that things did not line up so that it could touch my soul.Herzog is not an accident he is an engineered vessel. He made himself makes himself. He works at this. In this case he successfully created a environment. He already has established the balance he would keep between highly stylized abstractions and discovered raw truth. But his means for abstracting are not yet mature. His choices in what raw things he finds are wrong wrong for him and us.I have to think of this as practice for Hearts of Glass which is something of a masterpiece along these lines.

Instead of fleeing the area the inmates stay outside of the building and rebel until their cohort is freed. Their rebellion goes from organized to filled with rage and insanity involving animal torture dangerous play with vehicles foodfights and teasing the blind.The movie is ostensibly a commentary on both imprisonment and rebellion but can it just as easily be taken as an exploitative Midgets Gone Wild? It's debatable. For some watching this will be like experiencing a nightmare. I think this is one of the earliest films I've seen where little people are used to produce a surreal effect something that has been done regularly in the works of David Lynch and critiqued in the amusing Living in Oblivion. It is easy to see how this movie has influenced the likes of Lynch Harmony Korine and even Nine Inch Nails there is a monkey crucifixion very similar to the one in the Closer video. The DVD commentary with Herzog isn't particularly informative but is still fascinating because it is really an interview by Crispin Glover whose recent What Is It? stars a cast of actors with Downs Syndrome.".

	schema:headline " True  False adapting Orson Welles";
	schema:reviewBody "Many viewers have raised the issue about how true or false this film is to the original screenplay Orson Welles developed in 1982 with Oja Kodar. Because I wrote the many final drafts of the screenplay directed by George Hickenlooper I can comment with authority. Fear not  I'll avoid spoilers.On the surface it is a very free adaptation. Underneath it is highly faithful... Welles's original script was set in Spain and the Congo. We set ours along the Mississipi and in Cuba. Nevertheless the characters have kept their original names and essential personalities through the many adaptations George and I devised whether separately or together between 1991 and '98.Welles's tale centered on a Presidential hopeful who escapes his wealthy wife's yacht and pursues a clandestine adventure with his aged political mentor a part Welles wrote for himself. This grand sage a fallen Lucifer of American politics was a candidate for President in his own prime  until he was outed as a homosexual. In Welles's original the two old friends engage in a psychological chess match involving a longvanished woman they both know. In ours they play an equally rough game over a longlost brother.Welles himself had a troubled brother Richard who shadowed him throughout his life. THAT felt like a deeper wound to explore in Welles's wake than the ghost of a missing mistress.In both versions the reunion between the hero and his old mentor sparks a dark merry go round of busy pursuits. An ambitious reporter modeled on Italy's Oriana Fallaci chases Blake and flirts with him and tries to penetrate the secret of his soul particularly his connection to the old man. The candidate's wife jealous of the mentor schemes and looses a murderous espionage agent on the old man's tail.Details vary sometimes wildly between what Welles conceived and what we executed. My wish in retrospect is that we had played certain cards face up in terms of story secrets. I won't say which ones here  no spoilers! More and more I'm convinced that Hitchcock was right to keep as few secrets as possible from HIS audience. Less confusing AND more suspenseful!Were we wrong to take liberties? No. A film must be a living thing. As Welles always advised young filmmakers Be Bold! He is after all the guy who conflated five Shakespeare plays into a single new one centered on the character Falstaff  CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT.I'm giving this movie only a 7 out of 10 out of respect to everyone who adds posts to this board yet is NOT one of the filmmakers. I'm too close to be objective My heart says Give it a ten. Flaws and all I'm very proud of it.I can offer one bit of impartial praise William Hurt Nigel Hawthorne Miranda Richardson Irene Jacob Jeff Mayes and Ewan Stewart all give superb multi layered performances. Welles could have asked for no better group to embody the characters he originated.".

	schema:headline " Good plot poorly presented";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a murky story of politics scandal sex and deception.  Sounds like it should have been a great film but it wasn't.  The basic plot was sound as we might expect from Orson Welles.  But the way it was presented was too disjointed and abstruse.  Without reading the original script it is hard to tell if the responsibility for this lies with Welles Oja Kodar who did the adaptation or George Hickenlooper the director.  I suspect it is the latter two.The biggest problem I had was character development. By the end of the film one should reasonably expect the pieces to fit together.  Good character development should give us insight into the characters' motivation.  I found this lacking.  The flashbacks didn't really help us to understand the motivations of the characters as much as they should have.  It seems that the brothers voluntarily switched identities since Billy was wearing a name tag that said Romero on his uniform when he left to go to war.  So Blake really didn't steal his brother's identity as it appeared.  This wasn't made very clear.There were lots of loose ends here.  What motivated the limo driver to do what he did?  Was it a need to be close to power or some personal vendetta? Who knows?From a directorial and cinematography point of view the film was far too dark that is underexposed.  I'm certain they were trying for that look but it made the photography look as if it were shot on 30 year old film of poor quality.  Also the audio was very bad.  It was very difficult understanding a lot of the dialogue.William Hurt was miscast in this role.  For certain films his puling self tortured style of delivery are appropriate to the character Big Chill Broadcast News Children of a Lesser God.  However in this film his character required a more dynamic and confident portrayal which he was unable to deliver.Nigel Hawthorne gave the best performance as Kim Mennaker the Senator who brought the boys up.  His ability to portray the old political warhorse seduced by the trappings of power was excellent.Irene Jacob gave a good performance as Cela the reporter with an obsession for the candidate and the truth behind him.Overall the whole was less than the sum of the parts.  The presentation was ponderous and uneven and the direction mediocre at best.  Worth a 510. If you are looking for political campaign stories there are better choices Primary Colors The Candidate with Robert Redford.".

	schema:headline " Mediocre or a flawed masterpiece?";
	schema:reviewBody "This may be a flawed masterpiece or perhaps a mediocre movie with a lot to recommend it. I enjoyed it and would like to see it again partly to make sure the plot worked and partly to catch some nuances that I missed. And also because as my esteemed colleague flickjunkie notes below the audio is atrocious and my ears are not as sharp as they once were. But life is short and the entire opus of film is long...but maybe I can edit with the fast forward!Okay let's look at the evidence. Script by Orson Welles somewhat amazing since he died in 1985. His last work. That alone may make this worth watching. William Hurt plays a southern pol Blake Pellarin running for governor of Missouri. Miranda Richardson plays his rich alcoholic wife and she is very good. Nigel Hawthorne is Kim Mennaker Blake's one time mentor a shadowy behind the scenes political figure a cynical character who is writing a 27000page memoir which no doubt includes much about his love for the Pellarin boys. Irne Jacob plays Cela Brandini a TV reporter fascinated with Blake. The onetime protg of FrenchPolish director Krzysztof Kieslowski is not shown to advantage here. I'm not sure why but there is little subtlety in the way she plays the part. To really appreciate what she can do see her in La Double vie de Vronique 1991 or Trois Couleurs Rouge 1994 both directed by Kieslowski. She is very beautiful and very winning.William Hurt contrary to some opinion was excellent. His characteristic laidback almost languid style works strangely well for a southern pol. He is certainly different but believable although I don't think his style would have worked had his character been running for president as in Welles's original script. Incidentally they really wanted Louisiana not Missouri for the locale. Hurt's performance reminds me in some ways of his work in the outstanding but now somewhat neglected Kiss of the Spider Woman 1985 for which he won an academy award.The Big Brass Ring never had a theatrical release and it is not hard to see why. The print is too dark and the story too murky and hard to follow. It appears that the brothers changed identities when young and never bothered to change back. Apparently Blake's brother and not Blake was the subject of the homosexual photo but I'm not sure. To make this movie work for a mass audience the true status of the boys then and during the time of the action must be made clear.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	onyx:emotionText "This may be a flawed masterpiece or perhaps a mediocre movie with a lot to recommend it. I enjoyed it and would like to see it again partly to make sure the plot worked and partly to catch some nuances that I missed. And also because as my esteemed colleague flickjunkie notes below the audio is atrocious and my ears are not as sharp as they once were. But life is short and the entire opus of film is long...but maybe I can edit with the fast forward!Okay let's look at the evidence. Script by Orson Welles somewhat amazing since he died in 1985. His last work. That alone may make this worth watching. William Hurt plays a southern pol Blake Pellarin running for governor of Missouri. Miranda Richardson plays his rich alcoholic wife and she is very good. Nigel Hawthorne is Kim Mennaker Blake's one time mentor a shadowy behind the scenes political figure a cynical character who is writing a 27000page memoir which no doubt includes much about his love for the Pellarin boys. Irne Jacob plays Cela Brandini a TV reporter fascinated with Blake. The onetime protg of FrenchPolish director Krzysztof Kieslowski is not shown to advantage here. I'm not sure why but there is little subtlety in the way she plays the part.

	schema:headline " Character Driven Train Ride from Hell";
	schema:reviewBody "Brad Anderson is probably the best unknown director working today. He's the independent Christopher Nolan often making characterdriven psychologically complex flicks that transcend the trappings of their respective genres. In the past he has successfully combined elements from timetravel thrillers and romantic comedies in 2000's Happy Accidents delivered a taut Shiningesque thriller in 2001's Session 9 and then provided a stirring Hitchcock homage with 2004's The Machinist which also featured a gonzo performance from Christian Bale. With Transsiberian Anderson attempts to breath life back into the often forgotten trainbased thriller. Like those three earlier films Transsiberian was made on the cheap yet still manages to feature great camerawork and well known faces headlining the cast. In terms of the logistics of the location shooting in Lithuania doubling as Siberia this arrives as Anderson's most accomplished film from a technical standpoint.The story starts off with an American couple a goofy Woody Harrelson and a criminally underrated Emily Mortimer returning from missionary work in China by route of the famous Transsiberian railroad. Once on board the train they befriend a young couple Kata Mara and Eduardo Noriega who claim to be studentteachers returning from Japan but might be hiding something sinister. The screenplay does a good job of building up to something and developing the characters especially Mortimer's Jessie delving into her past with expository dialog that makes you care about where these characters are headed and think deeply about their motives. Without giving away too much of the film entanglements ensue as a drug smuggling operation comes to light and in steps Ben Kingsley excellent as a Russian bruiser as a narcotics detective with a special interest in the case.There is a point however where pardon the pun the screenplay derails and despite some unexpected twists there never seems to be that big payoff. The film keeps the viewer on their toes with a bizarre turn of events at an abandoned church and a shockingly grim torture scene but the psychological ramifications of these events are never probed as deeply as they could've been. The seductively cute Mortimer gives a nervy complex and excellent performance as Jessie keeping the viewer invested in her character and what could happen to her even as the screenplay goes all over the map with her development. Woody Harrelson's performance is more of a conundrum as he seems to be playing a booksmart version of his moronic character from Cheers. He makes you laugh during some of the more ridiculous scenes as the plot holes get deeper and whether that was intentional or not to break the tension or gloss over the leaps of logic is never clear.Transsiberian should please those looking for something different from your runofthemill Hollywood thriller. Though the screenplay initially gives us characters that feel like real people the mechanics of the convoluted plot spoil the potential of that development. However the film still offers up an exotic locale solid direction and interesting performances which makes it easy to recommend.".

This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really welldone. And it definitely captures the current political and social climate of Russia today. Having dealt with the border guards in Siberia over a visa problem I witnessed first hand the 'wild west' mentality that currently exists in that country. It may be hard for Americans to believe that the events that occur in this movie are realistic. But they are. And Woody Harrelson is a revelation. Ben Kingsley is great as always. I was not familiar with Emily Mortimer prior to this film but I will be on the lookout for her next film. It's a shame not many people will see this movie. Hopefully they'll catch it on pay per view.

Roy a very younglooking Woody Harrelson and Jessie Emily Mortimer are a young Iowa couple returning from a church humanitarian mission in China via the Transsiberian Express where they encounter the much more adventurous Carlos Eduardo Noriega and Abby Kate Mara. Boarding midway is Ben Kingsley who we have learned from the opening scene is a Moscow police detective.Like a Hitchcock classic we are grabbed from the start with a feeling that things are not all as they seem and don't lose that uneasy feeling that something very bad is going to happen until bad things really start happening. The tension is eerie and relentless with telling glances and social conversation that suggest the relationships between these four are going to take a disturbing turn. Written by Director Brad Anderson The Machinist and inspired by a Transibberian trip he once took the script is inspired and very tight the characters infused with extraordinary depth and interest the Russian state a harrowing umbrella and the dialog consistently powerful and compelling. My favorite line from Ben Kingsley goes something like this We have a saying in Russia You can always go forward with a lie but you can never go back.As Anderson said in the QA the confined spaces of trains make for heightened drama. Shot in Lithuania the cinematography is haunting capturing the mysterious bleak and unsettled state of postSoviet Russia which makes for a marvelous backdrop to the action. This movie should do well in national release. Maybe very well. Sundance Moments Brad Anderson and all the principals of the cast were at the Sundance premiere. More so than usual they all praised Anderson as an extraordinary and meticulous director one of the greats. Ben Kingsley noted that what attracted him to the movie besides the Russian substory was that the characters were archetypes and not caricatures which is quite true. Anderson talked about how bitterly cold it was shooting in Lithuania.".

	schema:headline " Old fashioned train thriller with fresh intense atmosphere";
	schema:reviewBody "Trains are famously atmospheric especially on long runs across remote areas like China to Moscow through Siberia. Voil the Transsiberian railway. The quartet who meet in a compartment aren't really likable but you're thrown in with them like on a trainthe way Roy Woody Harrelson his wife Jessie Emily Mortimer Carlos Eduardo Noriega and Abby Kate Mara are thrown together in this tight exciting basically old fashioned thriller. This is the new Russia of big money and mafia corruption but the ingredients are tried and true. Strangers on train there's something Hitchcockian about the way innocent people get roped into incriminating situations and then appear perhaps not to be so innocent after all.They're on a very long ride and in the overheated intensity of the cars you can't seem to pry the windows open things are blown out of proportion. They're too naive too suspicious too sexy. Roy's too pious and decent and upbeat. Look at the donut and not at the hole is his motto. He's a very Christian hardware dealer and Jessie is his wife with a wild past that comes out when she meets another woman. They're returning from some sort of Christian outreach project in China. Roy's like a little boy he loves trains. The Express is like a huge toy all for him. He's very devoted to Jessie but the sex hasn't been going too well.The next day into the compartment comes a younger couple. Carlos and Abby say they were teaching in Japan. However Carlos a handsome devil who has his eye on Jessie seems to know a little too much about how to get past customs with a dodgy passport. He shows off theirs proudly to Jessie who's had a bit of trouble with the Russians. Her passport and Roy's are too pristine he says. It makes the officials suspicious. His and Abby's are packed with stamps. They look real. He's got some of those Russian dolls the little lacquered things like shoots only with babushka heads one inside the other. He says his are special and he's going to sell them for a lot of money.Well he is but that isn't why.The train makes long stops and Roy is so fascinated with the cars he gets involved in a conversation with Carlos and then the train takes off without him. Abby and Jessie have had a hearttoheart and Jessie has confessed she had a lot of drug and alcohol problems. Roy says they met by accident because they met in an accident when she was driving drunk and he stayed with her in the hospital. That's when he told her the donut and the hole story.Carlos is dangerous handsome and predatory. Jessie has that wild side gesturing wildly to be let out again. And he could be the one to tease it out.When Roy gets left behind Jessic has to get off at the next stop and wait for him. Carlos and Abby insist on getting off with her and keeping her company. And that's when the trouble really begins. Stuff happens. Surprising stuff. Or not. Depends on how good you are at predicting this kind of plot.But the thing is Brad Anderson and his writing collaborator Will Conroy have put together a story rich in atmosphere that really convinces you all this could only happen here on the train in the snow in the nonetootouristic rural Russian hotel and on a bus and out in the middle of nowhere. The outdoors is all snow. The train cars are rickety and yet tough. The woman attendants are all Nurse Ratcheds who speak nothing but loud angry disapproving Russian. The food sucks but the vodka flows. Jessie refuses it but when things get tough she downs a shot. This is a world bad enough to make all but the strongest lose their sobriety and she wears her heart on her sleeve. The Russian fellow travelers are a mixture of camaraderie and hostility.And then of course along comes Ben Kingsley as Grinko detective of Russian Narcotics Bureau no articles please. When Roy reappears he's made friends with Grinko. Well before that early on we happen to have seen Grinko examine a man at a table with a knife buried in the back of his head. Cherchez les drugs.I can't tell you any more. I can tell you that the trains are so lovely they make you understand Roy's enthusiasm. Whole cars give off a smoky ooze of white frozen air whenever you look at them. To heighten our sense of the visual in all this Jessie is a good amateur photographer armed with an expensive digital Canon with a big lens and the images on screen often jump with a handheld camera but also step back to take in long views of a skeletal ruined Russian church out in the waste or to snap a hawk in the sky or a bunch of huddled old ladies at a station near a rubbish bin where Jessie is trying to dump something incriminating. But wait. Mustn't tell.It all hinges on moral ambiguitypeople who used to be bad who still are bad or who turn bad and getting trapped in your lies. There are some questionable details especially at the end. Mortimer usually a supporting actor has depth and a central role here. Kingsley is as good as ever. Unfortunately the character of Roy is bland and conventional Abby silent Carlos more a smile and a sexy body than a personality. But the milieu itself is the richest character and the too little known Brad Anderson who made Happy Accidents and The Machinist again proves his originality with material that follows a timehonored template but with a very fresh feel that keeps you absorbed from beginning to end.".

	onyx:emotionText "Trains are famously atmospheric especially on long runs across remote areas like China to Moscow through Siberia. Voil the Transsiberian railway. The quartet who meet in a compartment aren't really likable but you're thrown in with them like on a trainthe way Roy Woody Harrelson his wife Jessie Emily Mortimer Carlos Eduardo Noriega and Abby Kate Mara are thrown together in this tight exciting basically old fashioned thriller. This is the new Russia of big money and mafia corruption but the ingredients are tried and true. Strangers on train there's something Hitchcockian about the way innocent people get roped into incriminating situations and then appear perhaps not to be so innocent after all.They're on a very long ride and in the overheated intensity of the cars you can't seem to pry the windows open things are blown out of proportion. They're too naive too suspicious too sexy. Roy's too pious and decent and upbeat. Look at the donut and not at the hole is his motto.

The blend of great actors and natural dialogue makes for an emotive and visceral experience.Brad Anderson has made a well paced thriller that explores the vast emptiness and deprived parts of Russia and at the same time in contrast capturing the beautiful scenic landscape as the characters delve deeper into the twisting roads of the narrative. Other than The Machinist 2004 I was unfamiliar with his work but will probably lookout for upcoming features as he has shown great competency in both the writing and direction of this film. Balancing the dramatic aspects of the narrative with the overall film.The most important thing to note is that it is an independently produced film which means it is free from the constraints of the mainstream but unfortunately this may mean that it falls through the net as independent films are often unable to compete with the marketing capacity of studio productions. As a result this film will probably not receive a nation wide release across UK cinemas which is a shame. This film is great watch with a solid narrative structure and with honest performances from all actors involved hopefully you'll find Transsiberian a worthwhile watch as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just screened this great film at Sundance 2008 and came away very pleased with the experience. It appears that Director Brad Anderson has successfully created a modern thriller worthy of attention. The backdrop of this film is the wondrous Transsiberian Express railway which in itself makes this completely watchable and makes for fantastic cinematography. The story takes us along the railway with Jesse Emily Mortimer and Roy Woody who are taking the trek as an adventure after a stint in China. The two Americans find themselves befriended by a young couple Carlos and Amby I think thats her namethe character was played by Kate Mara who themselves are traveling around Russia. After some time together an awkward friendship forms between Jesse and Carlos who has several different motives. As the train keeps pushing across the frozen tundra some situations occur that separate the newfound friends and places certain individuals in compromising positions that ultimately result in some stressful events. Russian narcotics officer Grinko Kingsley arrives just in time to really make things chaotic and turn the train ride into a thrill ride. Jesse finds herself pushing and pulling between dealing with the truth and what it will take to survive the train trip home.First of all whether one loves the plot or not its hard to deny the fantastic cinematography that takes place throughout the film. The train sequences inside are so authentic that one can truly feel the atmosphere breathing. Overall the whole film just feels authentic to the locations and the people who wander in and out of the film are completely genuine. Superb performances by all just really good stuff from actors you would expect it from. Plot runs a little weaker towards the end and inevitably its somewhat predictable as most thrillers are but with the train and the location its a enough of a twist to keep viewers interested. Flick definitely should appeal more to mainstream audiences then the typical indie sorts so buzz might be a bit weak on the indie circuit but this movie should have decent release interest and definitely get good views on video and cable when people give it a chance.".

We're not on Amtrak and the more perilous side of American's traveling in distant lands is beautifully rendered by the director Brad Anderson and sensational cinematography by Xavier Gimnez.However it's the cast that takes this from something routine to something very unsettling. Emily Mortimer gives a fine performance as a woman trapped by her past. She does more with this role than perhaps was written and finally cinches her place as an actress you can count on. Two supporting roles Eduardo Noriega being a great predatory villain who sees a mark in Emily Mortimer's character and plays her for all she's worth. At his side is an unsettling performance by Kate Mara who with less to say makes a very vivid impression as a girl who's both mysterious and sympathetic.Woody Harrelson stumbles but he's always interesting to watch. His character doesn't belong in this film which is almost the point of the movie but he plays naive closer to dumb or dumber. And we understand why Mortimer may be frustrated with her marriage but it's halfway through the film that lots of beans are spilled about her past and everything we've seen and will see is dead on and convincing.Less convincing is the plot which isn't up to the level of the other elements. I'm not sure in a real world these characters would have faired as well as they do or nearly so long.Ben Kingsley shows up and works fine as someone who may be the lifeline to our travelers but as the action heats up too many things require answers that the plot doesn't have time or the audience much interest in figuring out.Yet it's one of the better films this summer. And if you don't like what's going on with the plot you can always look at the exotic frozen Lithuanian scenery or the shadows of fear the Emily Mortimer sends across her face tingling up our own spines. Terrific performance.".

The railroad hostesses live in a constant state of pissedoffness toward the passengers. Amtrak it ain't.The first half of this movie is fairly slow as we get to know the characters. Then during a layover at a remote village an incident happens that puts the movie into total nailbiting overdrive. The second half is as gripping as any movie I've ever seen. As riveting as anything Hitchcock has ever done ... and this is from a major Hitchcock fan.Warning late in the movie there is a torture sequence of a woman that caused a few in the audience I saw it with walk out.I'm sorry they walked out.

Its pretty stretched at times but the acting is great the setting is interesting and the plot about a unsuspecting couple meeting the wrong people on a Transiberan travel from China to Russia starts interesting.

After her husband misses the train and is left behind in a hotel at first we think he got beat up but that red herring is soon dropped which is idiotic in itself she waits in a hotel with Latin lover Carlos whom the met on the train with his girlfriend Abby who obviously has a crush on her and even goes on a trip to an abandoned church in the middle of some forest. Sure her husband is in the middle of nowhere so why not get everybody lost. After Carlos is a little too eager to get in her pants she doesn't hit him once in self defense no she beats him to death with multiple hits to the head. But like this isn't stupid enough she meets her husband back on the train who made friends with a Russian detective played by Ben Kingsley. She finds out Carlos placed drugs in her luggage they give it to the cop but she doesn't tell her story even when the Russian mafia threatens to kill her husband Abby lies cut up and bruised on a table and everyone is looking for Carlos who also stole money from the mobsters. Like some gangsters looking for money that would care if she killed Carlos. And this behavior carries the movie to a to a ridiculous train crash and then a medium end. To me Transsiberian was a rather bad surprise.".

In the end their fate is pretty much left to destiny.Doing some very good work Emily Mortimer and Woody Harrelson play the unsuspecting couple who see their adventure turn sour as they run into a couple of young people who might be or not be who they say they are. Before the audience can start wandering what's going on things become uglier and more twisted that we expected.Mortimer's role is one of the best female roles in years a woman with a complex past that returns to haunt her as she confronts very dangerous choices during the ride through Siberia. It is amazing to see her transformation from a bored housewife to a woman who starts questioning the consequences of her actions and how easily she can sink into madness.In order to make the tension effective there is a cop who comes in to question our heroes and help them get out of their ordeal. With the persona created by Ben Kingsley one wonders exactly what makes this character tick there is an air of mystery of knowledge that can be effective and dangerous if obtained by the wrong people. The one word that comes to mind as interrogations begin is who can be trusted? The film moves with elegance rarely seen in contemporary cinema one can recalls the classic work of Hitchcock in much of this piece and there is definitely references to the fluid camerawork seen in Spanish films like The Others a movie that delivered by relying on the presentation of images and evoking moods that a simple dialogue couldn't.This is a fine film a movie that tells an old tale in a refreshing way a presentation that satisfies the viewer because it engages the audience with its dramatic power. One is likely to want to see it again to clarify a few points and also to enjoy it again and again.It is almost a perfect film.".

Why would he protect the two of them if he was crooked like they all are? There are worse foreign actors who play Russians and Kingsly did an almost acceptable job.

	schema:reviewBody "Roy and Jessie are a young American couple who have just finished doing some volunteer work for their church in China and have decided instead of flying to take the Transsiberian Express to Moscow before they return to the States. Roy played by Woody Harrelson is a happygolucky guy teamed with a neurotic wife whose chief vice is smoking cigarettes. When they meet a mysterious couple Carlos and Abby on the train it's obvious that our unsuspecting couple are soon to become victims of criminal machinations a la a typical Hitchcock thriller. The story plods along for about 45 minutes before something actually happensRoy fails to get back on the train and Jessie is forced to get off at the next stop and spend the night in a hotel with suspected drug mule Carlos and unsuspecting Abby in a room down the hall. Carlos has already put some moves on Jessie but she somehow agrees to go on a little sightseeing tour the next morning with Carlos who takes her through a forest until they arrive at a monastery in the middle of nowhere.Here's where things totally fall apart. Carlos gets more aggressive with neurotic Jessie and she assumes he's going to rape her. She finds a small log and smashes Carlos in the face. Somehow Carlos is unable to subdue the upset Jessie and moves on her again. Clunk! He gets smashed in the face again. Okay he gets up and tries to grab her again and she smashes him a few more times on the head until one final coup de grace killing him. Her white ski jacket now covered with blood she manages to get all the way back to town covering the blood spots with her hands as she walks. The whole scene is totally ludicrous with Carlos making no attempt to avoid the blows inflicted upon him by a crazed Jessie. The story grows more absurd as we move along. Roy suddenly calls Jessie with no explanation as to why he failed to get on the train and Jessie doesn't seem too interested as to why he was such a doofis. Roy finally meets her in the town they get back on the train and Jessie fails to tell him that she killed Carlos. Any normal wife who's involved in such an extraordinary incident would have told their husband right away what happened and they would have simply went to the police. But no neurotic Jessie remember she smokes cigarettes! has to hide the truth from Roy that she killed Carlos as well as information that Carlos planted heroin in her suitcase. Jessie can't tell Roy because of course that would kill the whole storyline especially when Ben Kingsley shows up pretending he's a detective but is actually part of a drug syndicate. When Kingsley grabs Roy and Jessie and takes them off the train to a secret hideout Kingsley's partner wants to kill Roy and then extract information from Jessie as to where Carlos is. Instead of simply killing Roy right away inexplicably Kingsley's detective tells his partner to merely shoot Roy in the leg nice way to keep a character alive so they can escape! Before Roy can get shot in the leg Roy and Jessie make an incredible escape from the secret hideout somehow the bad guys forgot about the door in the room they were taken to also they forgot to tie them up!.Finally Roy and Jessie get back on the train but the bad guys have uncoupled half the train and now there's no one on it except the engineer who meek and mild Roy manages to dispose of by clunking him on the head. Roy figures out how to start the train hmmm!!!! but not before Kingsley and his crime syndicate partner get back on the train and are about to kill them. Wouldn't you know it the train collides with another train coming in the other direction. All's well that end's well when Kingsley turns on his partner and disappears into the Russian wilderness. Roy and Jessie are saved and are met by Embassy officials who have them sign statements as to what has occurred no extensive discussion of Jessie killing Carlos is brought up. Finally the theme of the movie 'never judge a book by its cover' becomes evident when 'innocent' Abby is seen digging up the drug money and making out like a bandit. Without credibility 'thrillers' like Transsiberian Express tend to fall apart. Not intellectual enough to be an indie 'art' film and not thrilling enough to be a commercial blockbuster Transsiberian falls into the netherworld of forgettable filmmaking. Ben Kingsley manages a nice Russian accent and is probably the best thing about the film. Woody Harrelson is too onenote of a character and Emily Mortimer as Jessie is so down on herself and acts like someone afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome most of the time that we cannot believe in virtually any of her motivations. Even Carlos the newly enlisted drug mule fails to be much of a menacing character at all. Transsiberia doesn't have enough surprises to thrill us and whatever surprises do pop up they're not believable!".

	schema:reviewBody "After a period of volunteer work with needy children in China promoted by his church Roy Woody Harrelson and his wife Jessie Emily Mortimer decide to travel to Russia by train through the Trans Siberian Railway. Roy is a naive American with a great passion in locomotives and Jessie is an aspirant photographer haunted by her past of bad girl. During the travel they share their cabin with the Spanish Carlos Eduardo Noriega and his American girlfriend Abby Kate Mara and they befriend the young couple. In a layover Roy visits other trains in the yard and is left behind Jessie decides to wait for him on the next station and Carlos and Abby stay with her. While waiting for Roy Carlos invites Jessie to travel to the countryside with him and they see a ruined church in the middle of nowhere. Carlos tries to force Jessie to have sex with him and Jessie kills him with a plank. Jessie does not report the crime and meets with Roy in the next train. When Roy presents the narcotic division detective Grinko Ben Kingsley that is sharing the cabin with him Jessie finds that Carlos was trafficking drugs and scared she tells many lies to them. However the experienced Grinko does not buy her story and the couple gets in trouble.Transsiberian is a thriller with a promising beginning good first half but with a poor commercial conclusion. Roy performed by Woody Harrelson for example is the stereotype of an American tourist overseas silly and naive. Jessie is a complex credible and very well developed character performed by the wonderful Emily Mortimer. Ben Kingsley is outstanding as usual and Eduardo Noriega and the unknown Kate Mara complete the great lead cast. The cinematography is very beautiful supporting the tense and cold atmosphere the screenplay and the direction keep the tension along the plot. However there are some weird situations like for example Jessie and Roy disclosing their intimacy to new acquaintances or Jessie unable to get rid off the drugs in the train. The conclusion is unrealistic and disappointing but anyway this movie is entertaining. My vote is six.Title Brazil Expresso Transiberiano TransSiberian Express".

	schema:reviewBody "Evaluating the movie I take into account two major things  judging Transsiberian as a thriller and the way they show Russia in the movie because this is where the events take place. Besides almost everything in the screenplay is based upon the peculiarities of the country. Actually I live in Russia though Siberia is father from me than most of the European countries but such are the distances in Russia. In one of the first Russian talking pictures in Tsirk 1936 precisely the was a song Broad my native land is as I was watching Transsiberian I kept on thinking that the song might be really illustrative and that Transsiberian is probably the very film to show to everybody how boundless the country is. But before watching I checked whether the film was shot in the USA as Im tired of watching the images of Russia that is shown in the Hollywood pictures. You know of course if Russian then undoubtedly wearing USHANKA drinking VODKA singing songs walking handinhand with a bear and selling Russian dools. Such a grotesque character may be seen practically in all the films connected with Russia and this very character is probably either a mobster corrupted cop will do or a prostitute or maybe a drug dealer. This is all tedious. That is why having read that the film was done by a number of European countries namely Germany Spain etc I thought I might hope to see something adequate without Hollywood stereotypes. However there turned to be inalienable vodka and ushanka luckily enough no bears. And those who acted as Russians were wearing sweat suits. Not but a longdistance trains atmosphere I would not have watched the movie up to the end. In a train vodka and sweat pants are a little bit more acceptable than elsewhere. What puzzles me somehow is that the movie lays emphasis on drawbacks of the journey and the people surrounding the main heroes the couple but what is good  the sceneries the hospitability probably road romantics  is shown in passing. The citizens of Russia may be roughly divided into good  those who help the tourists  and bad  all the rest. And the bad ones seriously outnumber the good of course. The rights of the tourists are being violated at every step. But against all the unfairness of the world they have an incantation that is We are Americans mind you probably before torturing us. I am most convinced of the naivety of those who wrote the screenplay at least of what concerns Russian realities. I can assure you nobody will drink for oil in the train. If they had shouted Na zdorovye it would have been boring and dull but more or less looking like true. Next what a pleasure to watch a Russian police officer being able to speak English! Though a colleague of his does wear sweat paints but one cannot demand everything at the same time. Grinkos English proves that the creators of the film lay certain trust on our education level. For this only fact I would give the movie  7 because earlier the only sounds the Russians made in the movies were obscene fourletter words. To make every detail even more authentic the character performed by Thomas Kretschmann was given such a lovely name as Kolzak. It might be even better if somebody explained me whether it is supposed to be a surname or a Christian name because neither exists. There is no such a name believe me. This caricature of Kolzak is wearing not only sport trousers with stripes but a thick golden chain as well which is in fact too much. Does anyone really believe that this is a usual uniform of the police in Russia for it seemed to me they were introduced as policemen? And it is a pity to see Thomas Kretschmann looking appallingly and participating in such stuff. As a whole very nave. I lost my time watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "My expectations for this movie was that I would get kind of a Agatha Christie story. I don't know if it's the setting in the train or some other factors that contributed to that but that was what I hoped for after reading the synopsis. And to some extent the suspense has a classical cut which I enjoyed. The movie start out fairly slow and it takes a while before the tension builds up. And hands down they have done that quite well by leaving some things to your own imagination. You have the classical Hitchcock set with suspicious looking people and your heroine all alone in a hostile and unknown environment. Up to this point the movie is a clear 8 on my scale. Although I don't think they used the full potential of Woody he still does a great nerd with religious elements.Unfortunetely it goes downhill from there.Emily Mortimers character without giving away the plot starts to act hysterically. This is what you'd expect from the circumstances but it gets just too much over the top. I found myself actually being annoyed by how stupid they made her in the last quarter of the movie. And I don't know if it's an American thing but another scene actually made me angry and that's the fact that they the characters Roy and Jessie have the stomach to be upset over the fact that the conductor doesn't speak English. What did they expect? They are in the middle of the Far East in between China and Russia. If they wanted people to speak English they should have gone to Disneyland in Florida. Just a stupid and very ignorant part of the script. Speaking of ignorant the natives that surrounds the pair are also portrayed as rough stupid and unfriendly and I think that this is the US way to see the rest of the world. Things we don't understand are alien and if everybody doesn't adapt to the US perspective of things they are hostile and stupid.I've done my fair share of traveling in countries where I didn't know the language but to my experience people are actually friendly if you stay humble to the task. My point with this is if you go to a foreign country where the chances are that the culture is very different from your own don't get upset if you can't have things done in the ways you are used to. Bribes for instance are a way of doing business in a lot of places on this earth and you just have to accept it. It's not right or wrong just a different way of doing things that has a history going back thousands of years. And as I said if you can't handle that stay at home and watch cable instead. When in Rome..No I can't feel sorry about that characters just because they are portrayed as lost Americans in a foreign country. They should have done a better research before they set off on an adventure like this. I am getting rather tired of that stereotypical character set.So to sum up everything this movie had great potential and to some degree it lived up to it but since they choose the Hollywood mainstream path to the ending it crash landed before it could reach it's final destination. Unfortuntately just a 45 out of 8 possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brad Anderson is one of those directors who everyone thinks they like until they look him up. Since getting attention with his creepy but unsatisfying Session 9 in 2001 his only feature of note was 2004's The Machinist  a movie which will always remain more famous for the extraordinary physical transformation of its star Christian Bale than its effectiveness as a creepy thriller. This is partly because Bale's emaciated form was genuinely mesmerising but mostly because the movie just isn't very good. So after a few years directing TV episodes Anderson had something to prove with his latest  Transsiberian.I've never really thought of Emily Mortimer as a leading lady. She's always seemed either hopelessly insipid or appears to be battling some unrecognisable accent and a cold at the same time. It may come as a surprise then to learn that she is one of the best things about Transsiberian but unfortunately that statement comes with a number of disappointing caveats. In the film Mortimer and a miscast toupee sporting Woody Harrelson play a husband and wife heading home to the US after completing charity work in China. In a decision which screams 'bad choice' to the ever watchful audience they forgo a simple flight home in favour of the famous 8000 km rail journey through the snowlocked Russian wastes. Hence the title of the film.What results is billed as a twisty action thriller with multilayered secrets and lies and the familiar device of a claustrophobic location surrounded by scenic wilderness. This may not sound particularly original but done well it could amount to an enjoyable few hours of escapism. And in fairness to the film it starts well  meandering slowly through the mystery laden landscape of character development planting seeds of murky histories and maintaining a convincing sense of unease and displacement  2 American tourists in the time warp of undeveloped Russia. Events occur in a fashion that makes sense uncomfortable situations get steadily worse and around the time Ben Kingsley shows up as a Russian detective everything seems on a wonderfully dramatic collision course with the revelations of the final act.But then the 'twists' begin. Not twists in the normal thriller sense of the word but closer to the M Night Shyamalan meaning ie twists that spoil a perfectly watchable film. The final act of Transsiberian dispels any sense of tension and unease by blowing the films internal logic to smithereens. I'm not suggesting for a second that the follies here are on the level of the denouement of Signs or the entirety of Lady in the Water but they do manage to bring the films momentum to a halt. Both The Machinist and Session 9 had problems with their endings Anderson seems to believe that if everything doesn't reach an overedited fever pitch he isn't doing his job correctly. This is a shame as the deliberate but inexorable pacing of the plot was one of the films strong points.Ultimately Transsiberian is a missed opportunity. Some good performances and impressive cinematography are not enough to smooth over the eccentricities of the final act. It cannot maintain the tension well enough to be a thriller but is too mild to fall into the category of suspensehorror. If it is a drama about the fate of foreigners abroad then why does it descend into near Outer Limits territory towards the ending? Brad Anderson may well have potential as a talented filmmaker but so long as he continues to make films which are only halfway effective he will remain in that halfway obscure list of directorsyouhavetolookuponIMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that  along with Central Station  this is the finest movie ever to come out of Brazil. Walter Salles shows he can go beyond the cheap formula of violencemiserysex that populated most Brazilian films in the past. While showing the true face of poverty he doesn't nourish the expectation with such corny stereotypes. That's chasing scene will stay in my mind forever. I am glad to see that Brazilian cinema is experiencing its richer moment since the 1960's. The first time I've heard about Behind the Sun I thought it was a tale based on the true story of two families in the state of Paraiba. The ongoing vendetta was in the news all over the 1970's. I was surprised to hear that Abril Despedaado' was in fact based on a book from an Albanian writer. It's amazing how the Brazilian Northeastern backdrops fit the plot perfectly. The movie describes the economical changes  cattle ranchers taking over the decadent sugarcane farms  that happen in that region following the end of slavery in the late 19th century. The actors are superb  particularly the splendid veteran Jose Dumont who plays the father it is hard to believe that only nine of them are professionals! The photography is strikingly beautiful. It impress me the reactions regarding the casting of Rodrigo Santoro for the role of Tonho. Has anyone ever met an average 1910's sugarcane picker of Brazil's Northeast region???? I don't see the same reactions when a young and handsome Al Pacino is chosen to play Serpico or when Julia Roberts is cast to play Erin Brokovitch. How many roles Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt would get if casting directors took such nonsense seriously? Well for me Rodrigo Santoro was a pleasant surprise. Just as a note this film was not shot at the Pampas as someone said. The semiarid region in the Northeast of Brazil is known as Serto and that vegetation is called Caatinga. The vast grassy and treeless plains known as Pampas  great for cattle you will not find cactuses or sugar cane there  are located in the South of Brazil and go all the way to Central Argentina. Thousands of miles away from the arid Northeast. I loved this movie!".

	schema:headline " A triumph of good moviemaking";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie starts with a bloodstained shirt hanging under a strong wind. We will learn later on that it belongs to the eldest son of a small rural farmer the Breves in the droughtplagued sundrenched desperately poor Northeast region of Brazil. He was killed in an ambush by a member of another family the Ferreiras starting a feud which in the past  the year is 1910  was very common in this region and could last for decades. Vengeance is required by the rough peasant's honor system but a truce period is dictated by the slow yellowing of the blood stains under the sun.One of the things that are extraordinary in this gorgeous movie is the way we learn all this. The slow tempo of images their rough poetic beauty with an eerie musical background tells everything we must know without words but with skillful dramatic suspense. A lot of symbolism is also present for instance the sugarcane mill operated by the Breves family is powered by a pair of bulls walking endlessly around. The family patriarch is behind them all the time forcing with a whip and shouts their round about. The oxen are so used to it that when the yoke is removed at the end of the day they continue marching by their own around the mill! So this is an apt metaphor for the routine yoked forced existence of the family under the weight of the father's authority and of tradition an existence they see as a kind of inescapable karma.The remaining eldest son of the Breves played superbly by Rodrigo Santoro must now exact revenge on his dead brother. There is no way out so reluctantly he does just that and kills the eldest son of the Ferreira family in a dramatic sequence one of the best filmed I ever saw. He knows now that he will have a truce too until the bloodied shirt of his enemy yellows. His life is now divided into two as the blind patriarch of the Ferreira clan tells him the 20 years he has lived so far and a week or so he still has to live because death will surely come and he cannot dishonor his family by running away. The mutual killing cycle will so be like their bleak lives and the oxen's. It will be like two serpents eating each other tails until nothing remains just a pool of blood another touching metaphor described by one the characters. He has never known love and will never know. April the month when all this happened was torn up the meaning of the title in Portuguese which was disgracefully altered in the English title.The film's ambiance alternates between blinding sun and the dried up caatinga the semiarid plains typical of this region and the darkness of the night lighted only by primitive oil lamps and candles. Night always bring respite and rest to the oxen as well as to the humans but it also brings fear. The eldest son wants to escape from this life to interrupt the oppressing lifestyle to revolt against the symbol of all this his father and to stop the revenge cycle. He doesn't know how but the sudden appearance of a twoperson circus in the village changes everything. The metaphor is now apparent a beautiful girl shows him that love is possible that a new life elsewhere is possible that there are many other things beyond his narrow horizon of poor peasant. His young brother gets a book as a gift from the girl and this opens up marvelous fascinating storytelling and daydreaming of constructing a new reality where the boy is hero and is desired with a plot he can change at his will. Both brothers see a light at the end of the tunnel a dark passage to a brighter day.The movie paces up now to a climax that everybody is able to feel the characters as well as the audience. The assassin is coming for him the shirt stains have finally yellowed. Night falls and he meets for the first time his love. Heavy rain starts a new metaphor because it is so rare and so unexpected. Will this mean that there will be a way out for him a meeting of a new life and world a blossoming of life like the one is brought by rain in this parched land? How can he escape without dishonor to his family without having to kill again?The answer is at the same time simple and fully symbolic too. I will not spoil the surprise but I must say that is absolutely impressive and emotionladen. When you see the film you will understand the solution to this impasse painful for some liberating to others.This is another triumph for young director Salles and his team one of the best of the new breed of Brazilian cinema directors. His previous international success Central do Brasil was excellent too and very properly incensed by critics and public alike. Motorcycle Diaries is also another movie by him very well received. But Abril Despedaado belongs to the rare category of a true masterpiece.".

To put it simply this is the most beautifully shot film I think I have ever seen. Walter Salles seems to bring so much colour and life out of the screen and into the theatre it was just an awesome experience. That scene with Clara on the rope the scene with Tonio on the beach and the chase sequence at the beginning were just stunningly shot. It was strange that I was the only person in the cinema to see this movie and at the same time it's a pity that people would rather suffer the likes of Kate and Leopold or Collateral Damage ! than a masterpeice like this. No matter how clunky you think some of the symbolism is it was refreshing to see something as moving. I read a review of this by Anthony Minghella and he said It's as close to poetry as cinema gets and I couldn't agree more. Top marks 10 out of 10. And no mistake!".

This is the story of me my brother and a shirt in the wind he says at the outset. When the blood on the shirt turns yellow someone will die. Based on the Albanian novel Broken April by Ismail Kadar Behind the Sun by Walter Salles Central Station is a story of revenge and brotherly love set in tiny StreamofSouls in northeast Brazil around 1910. A blood feud between two families over a piece of land has continued for generations. After a member of one family is murdered a mourning period of one month is allowed then the killing of a member of the other family takes place. This is the way they've always lived. It's like two snakes I saw fighting says one observer. Each one was biting the tail of the other they ate each other until nothing was left. Since his brother Inacio was gunned down another brother Tonio Rodrigo Santaro must protect the family's honor and avenge the murder. The family is poor and the father forces his sons to work in the burning sun growing sugarcane. We are like oxen Pacu says. We go round and round and never go anywhere. When Tonio asks for peace his father labels this as a dishonor to the family. Only when Pacu and Tonio meet the beautiful Clara Flavia Marco Antonio an itinerant circus performer can the possibility of a different life be glimpsed. Realizing his longing to see new things Tonio takes Pacu to the circus in a nearby town meeting Clara who also longs to escape from the circus. Though aware of his destiny she visits him at home and they fall in love. In one of the loveliest moments in the film Tonio holds a rope as Clara twirls above him faster and faster in a moment of exhilarating freedom. Seeing the joy on Tonio's face Pacu knows that he alone must assume responsibility for ending the violence.Behind the Sun occasionally lapses into selfconsciousness yet it is redeemed by the surreal beauty of the Brazilian landscape the loving relationship of the two brothers and the elemental power and relevance of the story. In this film both families would rather be right than do what is nurturing. They accept the ritual of killing only because of some misguided notions about honor. Salustiano tells Clara They would rather kill than solve their problems those are the real fanatics.' Any resemblance to people living or dead is not purely coincidental.".

I don't know there's something mysteriously alluring about Portuguese it has this smooth almost rhythmic flavor about it. I was thoroughly entertained by the little boy they called kid aka Puca played by Ravi Ramos Lacerda he's basically a kid wanting to drown in the world of his fantasies but has to uphold these responsibilities of labor jus like the rest of his family. I found him to be sweet assertive and pure comedy. All the roles were praisingly convincing and held my attention the whole way through. I couldn't get over how young Rodrigo looked even though the movie was taped but only two years ago. hehe...young but oh so adorable o. He doesn't say much but...sometimes words just aren't necessary. Neways I think the film's great. Not one metaphor or streak of symbolism seemed out of place not one character seemed a bit too exaggerated or too thin in personality. I really liked this film. Honestly?

The memorable faces of largely unknown actors will haunt you after the film ends this is no film filled with special effects or easilyexplained motivations but a mythic tale with repercussive shocks after one viewing with subtitles one could turn them off and revel in the visuals the music and the strange tragic finale.".

	onyx:emotionText "Brazil 1910 and out of the stark barren land director Salles has brilliantly composed a visual poem in various shades of amber ochre and deep gold the beauty of location composition often at odds with the stark story of revenge between families a seemingly unending cycle of violent death unrelieved for peasant families.Moments of magic do happen now and then with visits from a traveling circus from vivid pictures in a child's story book from ascents into the skies from swings. The memorable faces of largely unknown actors will haunt you after the film ends this is no film filled with special effects or easilyexplained motivations but a mythic tale with repercussive shocks after one viewing with subtitles one could turn them off and revel in the visuals the music and the strange tragic finale.";

The glory of BEHIND THE SUN is in the presentation and transformation of a familiar precis into a visually stunning prolonged motion painting.Director Salles has assembled a cast of beautiful actors especially Rodrigo Santoro! minimized the Portuguese dialog so that the visuals may convey the text almost solo and has added appropriations from other art forms to make this a memorable film. The only characters outside the feuding families are a traveling troupe of 'clowns' or a circus consisting of an older man and his sensuously beautiful stepdaughter. This nod to the I PAGLIACCI opera invests intrigue and introduces the concept of the redeeming force of love into this otherwise blighted life story of a young man doomed to die for family honor. The photography is elegant the acting is superb the musical scoring is sensitively appropriate without drawing attention to itself. This is a very beautiful very fine film. Grady Harp".

The oppressive poverty the constant work and the hardened father all contribute to a life that the son and his little brother dream of escaping.  But can they without sacrificing the honor of their family?  Is it possible to break out of the cycle of violence?

It is one of those films that needs to be developed within your mind first chewed after rewatched then tackled. It is not a simple film yet Salles makes it so. Confused? I was too after watching this film not because of the storyline but because of my insecurity of emotion felt towards this title. Typically I can say  Nope or Yep loved it but with this one it took me two viewings to fully find myself saying This was nearly a masterpiece. This isn't your typical Hollywood film but neither was his original first Central Station this is a film with minimal players coupled with a simple plot yet emotion raining down from the sky like fire. It is about a family that is so caught up in tradition that living just isn't available. Year after year or in this iteration months after months two families struggling for control over land the bickering and death has gone on for so long that the land seems so unimportant in the grand scheme kill one another in hopes that this final blow will be the last. The crazy thing about tradition it keeps going  and this one is not different  until now. Two brothers workhorses who question this tradition after one is faced with the undutiful task of killing look outside their small box of a life to see what else is out there to life for. It is there they find something that has been missing  imagination love and most importantly  a life.My description above seems and feels to me like ultimate cheese spread on a film. Why would I like this? I think the first thing that pulled me towards this sleeper foreign film was the fact that I never quite new what was going to happen next. The story was solid when I say that I mean it was lacking the typical holes that clich Hollywood standards. This story was so simple yet not that Salles was able to focus on our characters enriching us with images of the land the culture and the possibilities. The fact that this is a foreign film takes us away from the hardships makes it almost fantastical yet keeps us grandly rooted in reality. I felt sympathy for all the characters because there was no defined evil I wanted them to explore go on adventures and see opportunities that this tradition was holding them back from. I loved the character of Pacu or The Kid as he read the book given to him from a circus performer. The fact that he couldn't read didn't stop him from using his imagination bringing stories to life and enjoying a small cusp of life that we typically take for granted. What could have been dull or trite transformed by Salles vision into pure gold. This was more than just a film but instead a cry to anyone that may feel the pressures of work getting them down and looking for any opportunity to escape. Abril Despedacado is a universal story rooted within an obscure culture. Why did this take me two viewings to see it? I must say everything fell perfectly into place with Abril Despedacado nothing was missing nothing was forgotten and nothing was misplaced. In a year of overplayed recycled films this was a breath of fresh air. Our characters were strong yet independent. I loved that Tonho wanted to leave find a new hope yet couldn't forget about his family especially his younger brother. I loved the sense of family and trust that happened within a small sect of people that really had nothing in common except the word family and the roof over their heads. While the ending was sad I saw it as the perfect wake up call for these two bickering families. The scenery was genuine. The music was somber. Salles in my eyes couldn't have perfected Abril Despedacado any better. I have seen some utter garbage this year and while my eye for film is constantly changing with age I think Abril Despedacado is one that families could enjoy as well as anyone who found the courage to put this in their DVD player. I am eager to see more of what Walter Salles has to offer really explore his style and suggest him thoroughly to friends and family.Overall I am very impressed with this film. It is one that could be watched again and again and more could be discovered. It is the perfect film to enjoy on a rainy day with a warm cup of coffee and enjoy the beauty that Salles creates with such a poignant family drama that obviously has a date on it but can be considered universal. Time has shown on this film AND proved that Abril Despedacado is one that can sustain the test of time. Bravo Walter Salles Bravo! Grade  out of ".

I am eager to see more of what Walter Salles has to offer really explore his style and suggest him thoroughly to friends and family.Overall I am very impressed with this film. It is one that could be watched again and again and more could be discovered. It is the perfect film to enjoy on a rainy day with a warm cup of coffee and enjoy the beauty that Salles creates with such a poignant family drama that obviously has a date on it but can be considered universal. Time has shown on this film AND proved that Abril Despedacado is one that can sustain the test of time. Bravo Walter Salles Bravo! Grade  out of ";

	schema:headline " Brilliant atmospheric Bmovie";
	schema:reviewBody "Heaven knows why I fall for this picture. But I do hook line and sinker. The deadpan delivery from Lundgren and Bellman makes this a truly post ironic classic. Gina Bellman is difficult to watch being from the UK I'm acquainted with her later emetic sitcom work and seeing her try to hold down a serious role is very funny. She's clearly very sensual though so she has to be let off.It's also pretty intriguing on an existential level to see the sniper Waxman Lundgren pondering what his duty is and whether he can ever be redeemed. But asides from all the post irony and existentialism it's downright atmospheric. Mulcahy found some pretty extraordinary landscapes to film. The title scene is of a man running through some sort of estuary set to a nice bluesy piece of jazz. What it has to do with the plot is anybody's guess but it was brilliant. Most of the film is set in the penthouse of a skyscraper the Algonquin at night time during heavy thunder and rain. It's a great looking piece of architecture and very atmospheric. The rest of the film is shown in flashbacks of Waxman and his spotter's exfiltration following an abortive assassination attempt. The Algonquin is described in this movie as 'a piece of technocrap' it's an unfurbished incomplete neoGothic skyscraper that noone seems to be bothered to finish. It's an uninhabited shell that makes a great eagles nest for sniping. It's all quite amusing quite why the powers that be want a VIP in an armoured limo travelling at high speed to be assassinated so publicly so flagrantly and so spectacularly by a sniper using armourpiercing explosive rounds from an incredibly difficult onemile away shooting position is anybody's guess. Just for your interest my friends I have looked into why Mulcahy has named the skyscraper 'The Algonquin'. It seems the literal translation of the root of this word whose definition is an Indian tribe comes from the Micmac meaning at the place of spearing fish and eels. How pretentious is that? Good though.In true Bmovie tradition we have a freak Christopher Heyerdahl as the nightshift security guard in the Algonquin. His body is tattooed with his 'buddies' a load of spiders who seem to urge him to commit wanton acts of sexual violence especially after he's snorted a bit of white. He's really very creepy indeed.The few action scenes in the movie are quite effective but action fans may find the longueurs in between to be unpalatable. This one is more for the Bmovie mavens.Plotwhores don't really like this movie because it is a bit discontinuous for example why on earth is Waxman given a second chance after his first failure to complete his assignment? But Silent Trigger is perhaps the most entertaining movie I have ever watched and I could see it again and again. For the true connoisseurs of tripe from this period it is an interesting debate whether or not to prefer Van Damme or Lundgren in my opinion this film marks Lundgren out as the top banana. Can you imagine how excited I was at the tender age of 12 to find out that they were appearing in the same movie Universal Soldier. Food for thought my friends.".

The whole movie relies entirely on Mulcahys direction that is still hip and vital.The script is average with lots of flaws in the middle of the movie but the writing overall does the trick.Plotting is trashy but the ending is twistoriented and it really freshens up the whole concept.The script isnt witty enough but those gaps couldve been filled by bigger budget since the movie has only two capital Aaction setpieces.I wonder how Mulcahy got expelled from the Hollywood action mainstream since lots of hackers like Hyams or Dwight H.Little get to do mainstream movies even though they havent had a hit for years. This movie is the right way for Dolph to go because such action vehicles are hard to find in Hollywood these days.Lundgrens martial art scenes are great since he is tall and bulky so his kicks really pack a punch.His face isnt as pretty as Van Dammes but he hits harder.Of course Silent Trigger aint no Citizen Kane but it sure does go way beyond anyones expectations from a movie that lays in the dust of the videostore backshelf. Mulcahys visual work is great and he still has the zeal for the job. No Kevin Hooks or Peter Hyams can overthrow this wet of hip visual directing.Let me remind you that Mulcahy brought video clip aesthetics to the Hollywood mainstream at the time when David FincherSimon West and Domenic Sena used to dress in diapers.Sadlyhe never had an idea of his own like Fincher but he still made groundbreaking videos for Queen and movies like Highlander or Ricochet.Lets hope he finds his way back to the maistream.".

Although Gina doesn't have an ounce of toughness to her she still does all right as the female assassin. The action scenes were good some extreme but not too outrageous like a lot of other flicks. And maybe I could include that the Canadians seem to have a higher percentage of good action movies than Hollywood.";

As time goes on he find more and more conflict between his sense of morals and his job. If you like Dolph he looks really good in this film and his acting isn't bad. He does deliver one boring monologue that you should just skip and the girl in the film Gina Bellman has an annoying voice. However the action scenes are good and the film looks really slick.

I concur this film has a strange quality even exotic. Everything about Silent Trigger is excellent including the acting. I really liked the set design. You might like this movie less if you need a visible plot and an even pace it's not here!. Silent Trigger would be good in a trio including say The Anderson Tapes Sean Connery and Dyan Cannon and The Peacemaker George Clooney and Nicole Kidman because of the contrast and similarities in all three films. At any rate it would seem to be a film that could use a balance because it does have a slice factor. So my advice is to pair it with a few other films and round out your viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dolph Lundgren's 1996 vehicle here is a pretty unique production. A 90s actionthriller with heavy existentialist aspirations the feature manages to attain most of its ambitions via the surprisingly careful touch of director Russell Mulcahy. It's got some problems that threaten my rating and may limit it to a niche audience but for the most part this is a successful experiment the likes of which Lundgren has yet to reproduce.The story A mysterious sniper Lundgren and his spotter Gina Bellman face a series of internal and external threats as they prepare to eliminate a target from an unfinished highrise building.From a thematic standpoint this is an extremely ambitious effort for an action movie starring a performer best known for punching people. The first time I saw it I thought of how easily this could have been turned into a play. There are only four prominent cast members all generally inhabiting a single location and there is an emphasis on character scenes with few action highlights. Sergio Altieri's screenplay mixes a typical action premise with heavy doses of noir and a touch of absurdity creating a microworld wherein alien codes of conduct are natural and the namelessness of characters is taken for granted. Though Russell Mulcahy can be a heavyhanded director he's very in tune with Altieri's story and manages to create a tense intimate atmosphere that's oftentimes more chilling than his attempts at horror have been. There are some lapses and excesses to this moody atmosphere but for the most part the filmmakers are very successful at striking the tone they want.The one major qualm I personally have with the picture is its treatment of Gina Bellman's character which makes painfully clear that this is a movie written by men and for men. Bellman's talent shines through even in the most indignant of situations but aside from the usual tropes of turning a highlytrained female operative into a damsel and a random sex scene it's a challenge to find any statements or actions the character makes that aren't in some way critiqued by her male counterparts.The action content is measured. It's pretty sparse but what's there tends to adrenalize. The worst of these scenes is the single brawl that Lundgren had with sadistic cokefiend Christopher Heyerdahl but the best scenes involve the use of Lundgren's unique sniper rifle. Two major shootouts compose the highlights of the action and Lundgren's weapon of choice  with its immensely powerful bullets but agonizingly slow rate of fire  gives these scenes a unique pace that you don't get when both sides of a firefight are blazing away with automatic weapons. The uneven nature of these gunfights combined with their infrequency may understandably leave some action fans unfulfilled particularly if the story is not to their liking either. Essentially this is an action movie that asks you to take a chance on something other than the strength of its action and if you'd rather spend your time on less of a gamble Lundgren has an entire library of other flicks to check out.Personally I had a good time with this one. The fact that the star has not attempted to make another film along these lines is a little disappointing since Lundgren does well with the minimalist touch. Nevertheless this helps make SILENT TRIGGER something of a hidden gem and if nothing else the strength of its production places it on the list of highend offerings among Lundgren's nontheatrical features.".

Now holed up in an unfinished skyscraper with his female assistant Clegg also known as Spotter  Waxman is also known by Shooter in some sources Bellman  Waxman and Clegg must execute their new assignment as well as survive the night in a creepy building with bad guys after them. Will they make it? Well the movie certainly lives up to its name as Dolph doesn't really say that much here. Apart from that this was the beginning of a phase of more seriousminded films from Dolph leading up to Hidden Assassin 1995. In Silent Trigger however there's a lot of setup in the plot perhaps too much but what's good about this movie is that it is at least trying to be different. What helps that are the stylistic flourishes by Russell Mulcahy that provide atmosphere and interesting shots camerawork and set design.On the flipside of that however the fact that the movie takes place in one location except for Dolph's flashbacksmemories impedes the movie even though the set is impressive. Additionally many scenes needed more light and were too dark to see. And there needed to be more goons for Waxman and Clegg to dispatch. So in summation we liked what was there so we wanted to see more of it more locations lights and baddies. That would have helped this movie a lot.On the bad news front there is some really stupid and unnecessary well it's always unnecessary CGI at times. And it's 1996 CGI at that. The inanity of these few moments shouldn't put you off seeing this movie we just like to point out when this happens as a warning to potential viewers and take the opportunity to say how much we hate CGI. There's also the classic one really really annoying character clich we see often. But the violent bits that are in the movie are great and that keeps the viewers' interest.Also it should be pointed out that Dolph has an extremely large complicated gun. When he's assembling it it reminded us of the scene in Spaceballs 1987 where the ship keeps going and going and going. This thing is a monstrosity but it does some serious damage.Shot in Montreal it has a very Canadian feel Silent Trigger is worth seeing but it's not the best Dolph vehicle out there.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

You always have multiple knives and use them frequently in close quarter combat. If it takes more than two seconds to kill an obstacle the operator is seriously lacking skills. Bare handed fighting just doesn't happen. The guys dropping from helicopters were grossly unskilled. When dropping into a kill zone you always have your weapon online and ready with your strong hand while working your rappel with your weak hand. Additionally every one on the drop line has a target zone they cover and they are coordinated to cover targets tactically in the air and move in coordinated teams on the ground covering all target areas. Highly trained crews pick targets fire on them and provide cover fire on the way to ground and you haul ass getting there. You drop like a rock but land on your feet. Your gun is always online. Always always always online. If your long gun or side arm is not online your knife is always ready for a quick kill of an unexpected surprise. Fist fights just don't happen with military grade operators. I found it impossible to slip into a willful suspension of disbelief and enjoy the movie. Everyone in this movie has zero tactical knowledge and their antics would get everyone on their team killed or captured in no time at all. In short IMHO the screenplay is awful as is the action special effects direction and acting.".

It would have been so much more difficult for example if the writers were there actually writers??? had had to explain that roadside massacre or name who was being assassinated and why. It's an interesting concept that allows the filmmaker to produce 90 minutes of tasteless crap and bad acting without having to invent reasons for it or waste time to explain things time better used to cram in even more blood bullets and bodies.

This movie does stray from the classic hit movie formula as the initial hit is not completed which is somewhat disappointing because its always cool to see a perfectly executed hit.

	schema:reviewBody "A cat and mouse game between a heroic sniper and sinister assassins all set in a super highrise building miles above the ground directed by Russell Mulcahy the man who gave us that '80s cult classic HIGHLANDER. It's a premise that can't go wrong right? Wrong unfortunately as Mulcahy yet again proves himself to be a one hit wonder with this watchable but disappointing story that suffers from a slow pacing a lack of decent action and a budget that really hurts. You know the film is in trouble when there are only four cast members and the story is set in one location but despite this there are flashes of style and inspiration to keep you watching and wanting more. For a start the camerawork isn't bad at all and manages to make the setting pretty interesting if bleak a deserted and rundown building soaked by the constantly pouring rain and covered in grime littered in dirt.Into this setting comes allround action man Dolph Lundgren one of the more dependable actors in the straighttovideo crowd whose work I'm quite fond of his highs may not be as high as the high points in Van Damme's and Seagal's respective careers but at least he usually hits the mark more often than those two with his movies and rarely lets his audience down. Here we see Lundgren putting in a solid performance as the conscienceridden sniper with a background although his character is kept mysterious throughout Lundgren's subtle let nobody call it wooden portrayal keeps his Waxman character interesting whilst still proving himself a force to be reckoned with in the various action bouts.Unfortunately the rest of the cast attempt to match Lundgren at his game but their bids do not pay off. Partly at fault is Gina Bellman as the contact Clegg her character is perhaps even more mysterious than Lundgren's but she fails to connect with the audience even when emoting her character always seems cold and distant and never really explored as well as it could be. Then there's George Jenesky as Klein a security guard with a surprising secret that only comes out in the latter stages his acting is barely existent with only the odd emotion flickering across his face about every twenty minutes or so. The opposite can be said of Christopher Heyerdahl who at least puts in an enjoyable if overacted performance as drugaddicted guard O'Hara a vile wouldbe rapist who hallucinates that killer spiders are out to get him.Most of the action sequences take place in flashback and prove to be brief but wellstaged. They're also exceptionally violent with deaths occurring in slow motion and loving zooms on blood erupting from human bodies and necks being slashed open with knives. In fact in this respect it's actually gorier than many a horror film I've seen and certainly a surprise to see such violence on terrestrial television. After an incredibly slow first hour which introduces and explores the characters to a minimal level whilst they walk and sit around a lot there is one major setpiece towards the finale which provides something of what I was expecting from this movie but it really isn't enough and the end result is that I'm left feeling a little cheated. A waste of Lundgren and a bare minimum of an entertainment value SILENT TRIGGER is recommended for dedicated drama fans only as its cold atmosphere makes it seem more like an arthouse movie than the action flick which it masquerades as.".

Slight comedy slight High School angst and every bit entertaining with its classic 1950's Rock n' Roll soundtrack such as Walk Like a Man Big Girls Don't Cry by The Four Seasons and My Boyfriend's Back by The Angels. Focusing around a football game where the different gangs play with and against each other then at its grand finale come together in a mass of union to defend their honour and their turf. Nostalgic stuff and above all a Rock n' Roll retrospective on a grand musical era. Timeless.";

	schema:headline " An homage to the end of an era";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a novel by Richard Price Philip Kaufman's 1979 film The Wanderers is a surreal comedy about teenage gangs in the Bronx during the sixties that is both a coming of age film and an homage to the end of an era. The film was considered too strange for American audiences but gained popularity in Europe and eventually landed a theatrical rerelease in the U.S. in 1996. Set in 1963 just prior to the Kennedy assassination The Wanderers deals with a group of high school friends who must ward off challenges from rival gangs while coming to grips with the problems of growing up during rapidly changing times. The film has great music an authentic sixty'ish look colorful characters and nostalgia for the days when alcohol was the favorite drug and the football field was the only battleground. In the film ethnic gangs populate the Bronx but there are no guns and no knives. We meet the Wanderers Italian the Del Bombers Black the Wongs Asian Kung Fu and the Fordham Baldies oversized bald guys. All except the sadistic Ducky Boys who seem to suddenly materialize at the opportune moment are more like social clubs and do little besides partying and hanging out.Led by slick goodlooking Richie Ken Wahl a pizza parlor employee discovered by Kaufman and his friend Joey John Friedrich The Wanderers have their hands full fighting the Baldies and their 6' 7'' 400 lb. leader named Terror Erland van Lidth de Jeude. One of their members Turkey Alan Rosenberg even crosses over and enlists in the Baldies to keep his gang connections going after graduation but the Baldies comically end up enlisting in the Marines. When newcomer Perry Tony Ganios comes to the Wanderers' rescue during a street brawl they recruit him for their gang and become confident enough to challenge the Del Bombers to a fight. After an abortive attempt to discuss racism in class ends in a brawl the stage is set for a rumble but local mobsters channel this energy into a football game. When the Ducky Boys show up however the game turns into a free for all. Although there is lots of violence it is of the comic book variety and never seems quite real.The energy never flags throughout The Wanderers and the film is assisted by a great soundtrack that includes many sixties favorites Runaround Sue'' performed by Dion and other classic oldies such as The Contours' Do You Love Me'' the Shirelles'  Soldier Boy'' and the Surfaris' Wipe Out''. Karen Allen plays Nina Richie's new crush who competes for his attention with his long time girl friend Despie Toni Galem the daughter of a local mobster. One of the best scenes is a hilarious game of strip poker with Nina and Despie that is fixed by Richie and Joey to achieve an inevitable outcome. When Nina the symbol of the new generation goes to Folk City to hear Bob Dylan sing The Times They Are aChangin'' and the boys watch television accounts of the Kennedy assassination it is clear something has shifted and their lives will never be the same. For those who lived during this time The Wanderers will bring back many memories. For others it is an entertaining but often sad journey back to a time of innocence that now seems so very long ago.".

I don't recall rock'n'roll songs ever being put to better or more appropriate use in a sound track. I don't recall a movie ever shifting more seamlessly effortlessly from gritty naturalism to bizarro impressionism and back. The cast is great! Whatever happened to some of these actors? There really was a Fordham Baldies and I grew up not far from the old Alexander's in the Bronx so I can't pretend to objectivity. For me this is rather like a New York version of American Graffiti it creates a world that I feel at home in even if I never was a gang member and we left the Bronx when I was eight. By the way the adaptation from Richard Price's book is I think remarkable. The book is a series of thematically linked stories that become a single organic story in the film. And I can't blame Ken Wahlor his characterfrom being besotted by Karen Allen. Personally I'd have gone right into Gerdes and flung myself at her feet. Oh yeah the late Dolph Sweet is superb here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Interestingly enough most of the gangs portrayed in the film were neither symbolic nor imaginary but were based on various real gangs who existed at different periods throughout the fifties and early sixties.Many of these gangs were not real gangs in the common theatrical sense but were specific ethnic groups of teens  from different Bronx and Manhattan neighborhoods.  Of course each group developed its own mythical idea of what the other groups were like and in his novel Richard Price used much of this teenage myth and lore.Of all the wellembellished epics common to the teens in the Wanderers' neighborhood  those dealing with the Duckies were the most detailed and commonly accepted.  The Duckies whether or not they were truly an organized group with such a name were the guys across the tracks insofar as The Wanderers were concerned the tracks being the NY Central's Harlem Line. They lived in the predominantly Irish neighborhood directly across Bronx Park.  I believe their frightening near demonic quality in the movie was based on a single actual event when two of the Wanderers were actually attacked in the park.  Since The Wanderers had never really engaged in any real gang wars or any significant fighting for that matter  that particular episode was the source of most of their perceptions of the Duckie Boys' penchant for unbridled violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Philip Kaufman's The Wanderers opens with a couple kissing on a couch. He wants to have sex but she doesn't. You're a guy she says worried about getting pregnant. Guy's don't have to worry about their reputations!Kaufman undermines her proclamation by immediately cutting to a shot of skinhead gang members gathering on a street corner Walk Like A Man playing on the soundtrack. As the film progresses Kaufman will use this scene a horde of gangsters standing outside a military recruiting station trying to recruit new members of their own as a jumping off point to delve into such issues as loyalty sex racial tension adolescent swagger and the pros and cons of machismo. In other words the film is about guy's worrying about their status and reputations within their own little communities.More importantly though Kaufman takes this theme male identity under threat and then builds a sequel to his earlier picture Invasion of The Body Snatchers creating a film which is more about migration movements and group formation.The film's two main protagonists are Richie leader of a gang called the Wanderers and Joey a kid with artistic aspirations. As the film unfolds we watch as the various boys and men of the picture form cliques join gangs and jump from one group to the next always seeking the solace and protection that these ready made supportgroups offer. All these gangs assemble at the end of the film where they face off on a giant football field. The blacks the Italians the Chinese the mafia the sons the fathers all gather on the field all in their own little testosterone filled groups waiting for any excuse to release their rage. When that violent moment comes however they target not one another but a ghostly group of men called The Duckies a seemingly phantasmic gang which Kaufman bathes in smoke and treats as a kind of supernatural force even oppositional groups join forces to curb anxieties.After this multigang orgy in which every creed and race teams up to defeat the spectral Duckies Kaufman undercuts the testosterone and exposes the normalcy of gang life. Scoring sex leads to dull marriages acting tough leads to dead end jobs in the military violence and machismo masks weakness and anxieties gang peer pressure leads to death etc etc. By the film's end everyone  despite their macho rebellion  is trapped in a future that's a conformist carbon copy of the past. All except Joey the artist who  like the artist character at the end of George Lucas' similar film American Graffiti  jumps in a car and skips town. Don Siegel's 1956 film The Invasion of The Body Snatchers dealt with a hostile group of aliens who sought to take over a small Californian town. The film used a cultural invasion from outer space to symbolise the annihilation of free personality in contemporary society.Kaufman's 1978 remake however saw cultural invasion as a blend of what sociologist Robert Park calls migrations and passive movements. Migration as a mass movement usually entails a certain amount of cultural conquest economic or political and assimilation whereas passive movements represent a more individualised negotiation of cultural boundaries within a society in Kaufman's invasion film the humans have to act like aliens who are themselves acting like humans in order to survive. IE conformity is itself a kind of parody of a fake humanity. In Don Siegel's film actor Kevin McCarthy stumbles out onto a rural street and yells They're here! warning townsfolk of the alien invasion. In Kauffman's remake the same Kevin McCarthy finds himself bumbling down a busy urban street again yelling They're here!The relocation of the alien invasion from rural town to urban megacity marks an important shift. By placing the alien invasion within a metropolitan centre the sharp distinctions between ethnic groups blacks Irish Italian Japanese American Commie etc are down played while the question of the individual as Other within the large alienating convolutions of the modern landscape takes precedence. In the modern world individuality as a means of defining oneself against any number of groups becomes lost within the ubiquitous streamlining of social ethnic and religious differences everyone essentially becoming the same in their differences.In Kaufman's next film The Wanderers he again has a character yelling They're here! this time when the viruslike Duckies appear. Set against the changing nature of ethnic communities within the Bronx the racial tensions of the film are resolved not by all the different races battling against one another in order to survive but in the races coming together against an external seemingly ghostly contaminant. Here it is conformity  the very alien behaviour that the humans rallied against in Body Snatchers  that allows the various gangs to band together and fight off the foreign invaders.Kauffman stresses that it is the basic values that the different gangs share codes morals symbols colours lack of weapons etc that allow them to identify with one another and band against the invading Duckies. The Duckies themselves are perhaps a stand in for America's Vietnamese or foreign enemies which Kaufman sees as a ghostly sham a boogie man used to whip up homegrown fear.Why are the gangs so easily whipped up into fear? Because they all agree on boundaries to define themselves in relationship to other ethnicracial groups. The Duckies however refuse to acknowledge these basic values. They like the aliens from Body Snatchers are an external social force that does not distinguish between race ethnicity and religion and are therefore threatening to the supposedly distinct and anti establishment ie hypocritical gangs solely because of their non conformity.8.510  Kaufman's use of surfing music predates Pulp Fiction. Worth two viewings.".

Set in the early sixties in a Hollywood vision of the Bronx we are introduced to such fearsome gangs as the wongs the notorious baldies and off course the title making wanderers. For once what we get is what we wanta bit of bantera bit of fun with the ladies and most importantly a fair amount of brawling. All this set to a most glorious soundtrackthank you frankie!

	schema:reviewBody "I was delightfully surprised with this film. I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I watched it after it was mentioned by The Warriors director Walter Hill because he had some worries that his film and The Wanderers would be coming into theaters around the same time and he described them as two streetgang movies competing for box office sales. As much as the seniors in this movie had a gang the two movies were far different from each other I feel.The Wanderers is a strange movie. At moments intensely serious fighting and interpersonal problems exist amongst these teens in the community and then in other scenes the moments couldn't have been lighter ie. Playing strip poker with a couple of the girls at a party. It reminded me more of Porky's and the relationships between characters in that film. The cast was an excellent ensemble and even though most of them went on to other acting work I'm surprised I haven't seen them in more roles.Watching the movie now is a little difficult due to political correctness and the way the movie tried to cut the racial tension with a knife. The movie has real guts by laying it out there for the audience to get uncomfortable by. The truly surreal moments involve a whole different gang that shows up a few different times during the movie they don't seem to resemble a different neighborhood and its residents but more like zombies and it was very difficult to take them seriously without understanding their true intentions and characters. In contrast I really enjoyed The Baldies the neighborhood skinhead gang that didn't seem to take life too seriously which differentiates itself between the skinhead stereotype of white supremacists which most skinheads get labeled as.Overall I really want to buy this movie after watching it. It reminds me of a movie that tried to get remade in the same style Dueces Wild. The characters were playful yet had real problems. The music is classic 60's tunes from the era with a handful of originally scored pieces for the surreal fighting scenes. I feel that its good enough for a few more watches but there are some odd choices for included scenes that I didn't feel fit the movie too well. Definitely check it out if you like gang movies like The Outsiders or The Warriors.".

In the Wanderers it's nice to see how the gangs were in that time in New York. It's absolutely not comparable with the gangs from now.

Just before the audience is introduced to some of the most original colorful characters in cinematic history whose personal perceptions of the world are limited to the prism of their ethnocentric gang affiliations that rule their urban jungle environment. In contrast to George Lucas' semiautobiographical movie 'American Graffiti' that recreated his young life filled with hot rods cruising the main street and drag racing in a small California town in 62'. Philip Kaufman adaptation of Richard Price's semiautobiographical novel 'The Wanderers' recreates the atmosphere of the gritty street gang life of Bronx NY in 1963. While George Lucas' American Graffiti enjoyed far more recognition and success than Philip Kaufman's 'The Wanderers' ever did. These two great independent films could serve as bookmarks to one another with American Graffiti in 1973 being the main inspirational source that launched the whole 50's  60's nostalgic retro entertainment for the rest of the 70's. While 79's 'The Wanderers' marks the end of the 50's nostalgia era. With one film about the lives of high school kids in 62' on the west coast and the other about the daily lives of high school kids in 63' on the East coast. Both movies are similar in nostalgic form and independent style but very different in tone and content. Because these two movies are so interconnected to one another it shouldn't be any surprise that Philip Kaufman and George Lucas teamedup to create the story for a little movie called Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1980. Ever heard of it?While it's more than likely you've already seen 'American Graffiti'. However if you haven't ever seen Philip Kaufman's The Wanderers? Then you definitely want to find it and watch. I assure that you won't be disappointed. It's truly an independent Philip Kaufman masterpiece which includes Kaufman's trademark use of captivating cinematography while the great music of 1963 serves the movie by magnifying the films humor tragedy gritty realism with an occasional touch of the truly bizarre as we observe the daily lives of the young tough high school gang members of the Bronx in 63'. And Alan Rosenberg's portrayal of 'Turkey' is one of the most original and uniquely funny tragic and troubling characters that's ever been performed for the big screen.A must see film. A".

	schema:headline " An Underrated Classic Of Gang FilmsTeen FilmsComing of Age films and Cinema.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wanderers Is one of the most underratedoverlooked movies of all time and a classic of gang filmsteen films and comingofage films and one of my all time favorite movies.Based on Richard Price's novel and set In 1963 BronxNew York The Wanderers tells the story of an Italian gang called The Wanderers focusing on three members of the gang RichieKen Wahlthe leader of the gangJoeyJohn Friedrichthe hyperactive little guy In the gang who lives with an abusive Father and PerryTony Ganinosthe gentile giant who's new In town and joins The Wanderers and Is a neighbor of Joey's. The three characters along with The Wanderers deal with love growing up changing of the times and rival gangs such as the allblack gang The DelBombers the bald headed gang The Fordham Baldies an Asian gang called The Wongs and probably the scariest gang of them all The Ducky Boys a group of small guys who are silentbut come in large numbers.The Wanderers Is a great film from beginning to end and will stay with you after you watch it because it's funnytragicnostalgichaunting and unforgettable. The film is funny because of the way it depicts teenage life for The Wanderers in the early 60swhether it's picking up girlsgoing to partiesor getting in fights with other gangs. The music fashionsstyle and the way the characters act seems true to what was going on at the time and they're definitely is a realism to it. The film is like a great mixture of George Lucas' American GraffitiWalter Hill's The Warriors and Barry Levinson's Diner all in one. The film also paints a world where every teenager in the Bronx is in a gang and all of the gangs are different by race like the all Italian gang The Wanderersa Asian gangThe Wongs Black gangThe DelBombersBald gangThe Baldiesa silent gangThe Ducky Boys. The way the gangs are shown in the movie is exaggeratedfunnysurreal and at times scary but also unique. The film has an episodic nature where some scenes aren't connected to one another and sometimes character tend to disappearbut there isn't a wasted scene in the film and the movie has a great energy and flow. Some of the scenes will have meaning and will stick with you after you finish. Like the best Teen films or Coming Of Age films The Wanderers is a film about dealing with the last grasps of being a teenager and facing the tough challenges of being an adultwhere the characters face the fact that they're not going to be teenagers or in a gang foreveror it's dealing with life teenage and other relationshipsparents or an uncertain future. This is one of the reasons why The Wanderers sets itself apart from other gang films. Like American GraffitiThe Wanderers is about the end of the 50s and the beginning of the 60s where the innocence and fun of the late 50s was being replaced by the dark times of the 60s. The characters especially RichieJoey and Perry know that the times are changing faster than they and they're is a bunch of powerful moments in the film that give way to the changing of the era's and will stick with you after the film is over. The film moves at a solid pace and at times feels like a 90 minute film than a 117 minute film with great energy and break neck speed. Although The Wanderers is not an Action film they're a couple of fight scenes in the film that are well done and brutal and add to the greatness of the film. I know people have been comparing The Wanderers and The Warriors and trying to say which film is betterstop comparing them. As someone who owns and loves both films they both shouldn't be comparedThe Wanderers is coming of age ComedyDramaThe Warriors is an Action filmthe only thing they have in common is that they're both gang films. Both are classic films and shouldn't be compared. The ending of the film is beautifulsadtragic and at the same time optimistic and will make the viewers make up their minds about what happened to the characters. A great ending.The whole cast does a great job. Ken Wahl does a great job as Richiethe leader of The Wanderers. John Friedrich is wonderful as the hyperactive Joey. Tony Ganios is wonderful as Perrythe gentle giant who's new in the neighborhood and becomes a member of The Wanderers. Karen Allen does a great job in her small role as Ninaa girl Richie and Joey meet. Toni Kalem does a fine job as DespieRichie's girlfriend. Alan Rosenberg is funny as Wanderers' weasel Turkey. Jim Youngs does a great job as Buddya ladies man. Erland Van Lidth is excellent as Terror leader of The Baldies. Linda Manz is outstanding as PeeWee Terror's girlfriend. Dolph Sweet gives a memorable performance as ChubbyDespie's father and a local gangster who helps The Wanderers out when needed. William Andrews frightening and intense as EmilioJoey's abusive Father.Director Philip Kaufman does a masterful job Directing the film moving the camera when ever he can never slowing down. Kaufman's direction gives the film a since of edge and realism and at times creepiness. A year before in 1978 Kaufman directed the great remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers a creepy and terrifying film and Kaufman brings the same terrifying tone in this film with The Ducky Boys scenes. The soundtrack is amazing with great songs like Walk like a manSoldier BoyBaby It's youThe WandererStand By Me and many more. The soundtrack greatly fits with the tone of the late 50s and early 60s. In final wordif you love Gang filmsteen filmsComing of age films and love films like The WarriorsThe OutsidersRumble Fish and American Graffiti or cinema in generalI highly suggest you see this underrated classic. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Wanderers Is one of the most underratedoverlooked movies of all time and a classic of gang filmsteen films and comingofage films and one of my all time favorite movies.Based on Richard Price's novel and set In 1963 BronxNew York The Wanderers tells the story of an Italian gang called The Wanderers focusing on three members of the gang RichieKen Wahlthe leader of the gangJoeyJohn Friedrichthe hyperactive little guy In the gang who lives with an abusive Father and PerryTony Ganinosthe gentile giant who's new In town and joins The Wanderers and Is a neighbor of Joey's. The three characters along with The Wanderers deal with love growing up changing of the times and rival gangs such as the allblack gang The DelBombers the bald headed gang The Fordham Baldies an Asian gang called The Wongs and probably the scariest gang of them all The Ducky Boys a group of small guys who are silentbut come in large numbers.The Wanderers Is a great film from beginning to end and will stay with you after you watch it because it's funnytragicnostalgichaunting and unforgettable. The film is funny because of the way it depicts teenage life for The Wanderers in the early 60swhether it's picking up girlsgoing to partiesor getting in fights with other gangs. The music fashionsstyle and the way the characters act seems true to what was going on at the time and they're definitely is a realism to it. The film is like a great mixture of George Lucas' American GraffitiWalter Hill's The Warriors and Barry Levinson's Diner all in one. The film also paints a world where every teenager in the Bronx is in a gang and all of the gangs are different by race like the all Italian gang The Wanderersa Asian gangThe Wongs Black gangThe DelBombersBald gangThe Baldiesa silent gangThe Ducky Boys. The way the gangs are shown in the movie is exaggeratedfunnysurreal and at times scary but also unique. The film has an episodic nature where some scenes aren't connected to one another and sometimes character tend to disappearbut there isn't a wasted scene in the film and the movie has a great energy and flow. Some of the scenes will have meaning and will stick with you after you finish. Like the best Teen films or Coming Of Age films The Wanderers is a film about dealing with the last grasps of being a teenager and facing the tough challenges of being an adultwhere the characters face the fact that they're not going to be teenagers or in a gang foreveror it's dealing with life teenage and other relationshipsparents or an uncertain future. This is one of the reasons why The Wanderers sets itself apart from other gang films. Like American GraffitiThe Wanderers is about the end of the 50s and the beginning of the 60s where the innocence and fun of the late 50s was being replaced by the dark times of the 60s. The characters especially RichieJoey and Perry know that the times are changing faster than they and they're is a bunch of powerful moments in the film that give way to the changing of the era's and will stick with you after the film is over. The film moves at a solid pace and at times feels like a 90 minute film than a 117 minute film with great energy and break neck speed. Although The Wanderers is not an Action film they're a couple of fight scenes in the film that are well done and brutal and add to the greatness of the film. I know people have been comparing The Wanderers and The Warriors and trying to say which film is betterstop comparing them. As someone who owns and loves both films they both shouldn't be comparedThe Wanderers is coming of age ComedyDramaThe Warriors is an Action filmthe only thing they have in common is that they're both gang films. Both are classic films and shouldn't be compared. The ending of the film is beautifulsadtragic and at the same time optimistic and will make the viewers make up their minds about what happened to the characters. A great ending.The whole cast does a great job. Ken Wahl does a great job as Richiethe leader of The Wanderers. John Friedrich is wonderful as the hyperactive Joey.

First of all technically it's quite rare  the camera work is really very good with fantastic cinematography and the sound design is also not bad at all. The songs are also quite nice and while it's hard to relate to the concept the film does manage to hold interest and is quite engaging as a thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Gupt was one of the biggest hits of 1997. It was a lavishly mounted film and directed by Rajiv Rai. Gupt starred Bobby Deol Manisha Koirala and Kajol in the main roles.I have watched this movie many times and its varied theme made me interested in it. The movie is not a typical Bollywood crap.A plot with lots of twist and turns. The movie is about Bobby Deol who is convicted to life imprisonment for murdering his step father.Deol has all the evidence against him in the murder case to kill his father.His love interest is played by old flame Kajol as well as Manisha Koraila who his step father wanted him to get married to.Deol escapes from jail with the help of Manisha and vows to get to the bottom of the matter as to who killed his step father and why He also has the uneviable task of running from the law as a convict who has run from jail.Other coactors like ompuri raza murad prem chopra and others have also performed to their best.i will not tell more as it will reveal suspense for those who have not watched it yet.Direction by Rajiv Rai is excellent. As the writer he has done extremely well to keep audience guessing till the end.He also keeps the pace of the film tight and fluid as the editor.

	onyx:emotionText "Gupt was one of the biggest hits of 1997. It was a lavishly mounted film and directed by Rajiv Rai. Gupt starred Bobby Deol Manisha Koirala and Kajol in the main roles.I have watched this movie many times and its varied theme made me interested in it. The movie is not a typical Bollywood crap.A plot with lots of twist and turns. The movie is about Bobby Deol who is convicted to life imprisonment for murdering his step father.Deol has all the evidence against him in the murder case to kill his father.His love interest is played by old flame Kajol as well as Manisha Koraila who his step father wanted him to get married to.Deol escapes from jail with the help of Manisha and vows to get to the bottom of the matter as to who killed his step father and why He also has the uneviable task of running from the law as a convict who has run from jail.Other coactors like ompuri raza murad prem chopra and others have also performed to their best.i will not tell more as it will reveal suspense for those who have not watched it yet.Direction by Rajiv Rai is excellent. As the writer he has done extremely well to keep audience guessing till the end.He also keeps the pace of the film tight and fluid as the editor. The cinematography is eyecatching and Gupt features some of the best locales ever filmed.The music was a very important factor in making the movie a hit.

She carries the whole movie on her shoulders. She was thoroughly into her character.The climax will give you goosebumps. After a lot of red herrings you can't really guess who the real killer might be. And that's where the victory of the script and the director lies.There are lots of characters in this movie though. But these characters are added to heighten the suspense.Bobby Deol is strictly okay. He should cut his hair and develop a strong screen presence like his brother Sunny Deol. Manisha Koirala looks good but looks heavy and wears clothes that accentuate her heaviness. The rest of the cast are okay but Om Puri stands out among the rest. I liked the way he mouths his dialogue.Overall Gupt is a must watch for Kajol fans! Go watch it with an open heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rajiv Rai's Gupt is an ordinary yet enjoyable thriller but there is something unique about it. It had a certain ingenuousness and charm whether it's the way it was made directed or acted the music the cast or the dialogues. This style has somehow disappeared from today's Bollywood. As a thriller it does work and manages to keep the viewer interested and curious but it is mostly a love triangle. Bobby Deol plays the leading man who is accused of killing his stepfather. Deol is too angry at times and is not the best choice for the role but he generally does an okay job. It's an interesting paradox watching a serious actress like Manisha Koirala in an allout commercial flick. She is amazingly beautiful sexy attractive and convincing in a role that is very different from what she was generally used to doing. It may have been her choice to get a slight relief after all the intense dramatic characters she played before. Gupt clearly belongs to Kajol though not because she made it that way but because the script allowed her to go to such extents. She was compelling and despite the scary and dark shades of her character she ends up being sympathised by the audience. The contradiction between her restrained act before the true identity of her character is discovered and her wild animal afterwards only deepens the significance of her role and the impression of her performance. Surprisingly the movie does not go overthetop even though it would have been easier to with such a simple yet complicated storyline. At times it does look completely messy with all these idiotic and corrupted politicians but overall it's interesting throughout and towards the end after the secret is disclosed it's even more interesting. This one's an entertainer well done.".

Gupt is a murder mystery but what sets it apart from other movies of its kind is the fact that the identity of the killer actually shocked me. The plot is lifted of The Fugitive1993 but the writers have added their own touches. Usually when I watch Bollywood murder mysteries I normally work out who the killer is before the end and therefore when the killer is finally revealed I am not shocked and that is a major flaw. This is where Gupt succeeds I suspected everyone from Raza Murad to Kulbulshan Karbanda to Paresh Rawal but I never suspected the actual killer. Rajiv Rai movies are heavily reliant on chart topping songs to make his movies a success in Tridev there was Oye Oye in Vishwatama there was Saat Samundar and in Mohra there was To cheez badi hai mast mast but while Gupt does have excellent songs it does not rely heavily on them to sell the movie the story does that on it's own. Rajiv Rai has always repeated his actors He used Sunny Deol in Tridev and Vishwatamahe used Naseer Uddin Shah in TridevVishwatamaMohra and Asambhav and character actors like Raza Murad and Tej Sapru have appeared in almost all of his movies. I first watched Gupt in 97 when it had just released and therefore the twist wasn't widely known. Unfortunately the twist is now widely known and therefore the shock value doesn't exist for the people who watch it for the first time now and the twist is a vital element of Gupt. Watch Gupt not just for it's twist at the end watch it also for the great story and wonderful songs. Highly recommended for people who love Bollywood suspense stories.".

This movie has more than enough action but the comedy was surprisingly actually funny! The poetry by the lawyer was the peak of all the humor. Everyone has already praised the other aspects of this film so I wont elaborate on all of them. The music which is universally acclaimed deserves all of its accolades. Duniya Haseeno Ka Mela Mere Khwabon Mein Tu and my personal favorite Yeh Pyaar Kya Hai are extremely well known but the other songs are also great thus placing the late great Anand Bakshi's soundtrack amongst the best of the generation. Oh and did I say Manisha looked sexier in this than in any otther movie? Because that is true. Ultimately a great film that stands the test of time. 1010.".

	schema:headline " Spellbinding murder mystery wrapped in laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "When the script of a suspense movie is written in such a way that you keep on laughing generously alongside enjoying the spellbinding mystery embedded in the story then the laughs available are nothing but the cherry on the cake. They are to be considered by the audience as the bonus received with a handsome salary by some employee. Gupt 1997 is one such movie only.Gupt secret is the story of Saahil Sinha Bobby Deol who is the stepson of Jaisingh Sinha Raj Babbar the governor of the state. Saahil's mother Priya Tendulkar had married Jaisingh Sinha after the death of her first husband Saahil's father and she begot a son Master Harsh through her second marriage also. Saahil is a college student and he does not like his stepfather at all. In the college his friend is Sheetal Chaudhary Manisha Koirala the daughter of a businessman Meghnaath Chaudhary Dalip Tahil. However when he happens to meet his childhood mate Isha Kajol in the college it does not take much time for love to blossom between them. Isha is the daughter of the secretary to the governor Paresh Rawal. Since Sheetal is also in love with Saahil the lovetriangle is complete here. But the theme of the movie is not a lovetriangle but a murdermystery. So here comes the twist in the tale.Jaisingh announces Saahil's matrimonial alliance with Sheetal in Saahil's birthday party inadvertently fuelling Saahil's anger towards him. The same night Jaisingh gets murdered. Saahil is arrested for his murder and he is awarded long imprisonment by the court. However he breaks jail and escapes through searoute alongwith two fellow jailbirds in his bid to search for the real murderer and prove his innocence. Sheetal helps him. He meets Isha also. A shrewd and nononsense cop inspector Udham Singh Om Puri is assigned the duty to rearrest him. Locating the murderer of his stepfather is by no means easy for Saahil because the suspects are many. The fathers of both his lovergirls a high profile minister of the state Prem Chopra a corrupt labour union leader Sharat Saxena a corrupt advocate who had prepared the governor's will Raza Muraad etc. had motives to kill the governor. Hence the confusion is great. Further the personal physician of the governor Kulbhushan Kharbanda is also murdered when he was going to tell Saahil something significant regarding the governor's murder. Now Saahil is facing the charge of that second murder also. However Saahil is able to unmask the real murderer and prove his innocence in the end.Gupt is a gripping murder mystery no doubt. As said earlier the high laughterquotient can be considered as its another USP. There are several characters in the movie who do not leave any stone unturned to make the audience laugh. The first and the foremost among them is Prem Chopra who has played the role of a minister. His reacting upon anything by exclaiming 'Beautiful !' in a peculiar manner tickles the funny bone of the viewer every time. And the last but not the least among them is Om Puri who though plays the role of a nononsense and highly efficient cop has amused the audience with his mannerisms. The other ones contributing to the audience' laughs are Raza Muraad who utters funny SHERs Urdu couplets Harish Patel who always laughs at the minister Sadashiv Amrapurkar and Ashok Saraf who play the sidekicks of the investigating officer i.e. Om Puri Dinesh Hingu who plays the servant of the advocate i.e. Raza Muraad etc. Thus the mystery becomes spicy.Gupt has its share of flaws too. There are many weaknesses in the script. The governor has been portrayed as if he were the President of the United States of America. Nowhere in India does a governor enjoy that much powers and profile. Instead of showing any chief minister or council of ministers just one minister has been shown throughout the movie interacting with the governor and others. The governor must be governing some state but he talks as if he is governing the whole nation. Besides there is no security at his official residence which is completely indigestible. The hero keeps a locket of the murderer found in the fist of the victim with him till the climax of the movie without making any serious attempt to open it and know something about the murderer whom it must be belonging to. The director has kept too many songs in the movie making it unnecessarily lengthy. At least three songs could have been easily removed and the movie could have been trimmed by 1520 minutes. The songs block the flow of the story and irritate the viewer who is interested to be lost in the mystery.Viju Shah has kept the melody intact in his music compositions. However keeping less no. of songs would have been better for the movie.The story roams around Bobby Deol and he has done well. However the director has not given him a proper hairdo. Anyway it's his second movie only the debut movie being Barsaat  1995 and he has done everything viz. romance emotion action song and dance etc. satisfactorily. Both the heroines also have done well. Manisha Koirala used to look very pretty those days. The complete supporting cast is well in place. Om Puri and Prem Chopra deserve special admiration for their performances. The dialogs written for Om Puri are also brilliant highlighting the fearless and stylish personality of his character.Summing up Gupt is a wellmade murder mystery which should not be missed by any mystery fan.".

This movie has one of the biggest twist endings ever filmed in Indian cinema. At the time the movie came out much of the audience was divided as to the identity and motives of the real killer.  I thought the surprise ending was innovative and satisfying almost as shocking as endings in Hollywood films such as Seven and The Sixth Sense.Unfortunately Bollywood no longer produces big budget action thrillers like Gupt anymore and if they do the films are usaully lousy rip offs of Hollywood box office duds.I would say that Gupt is one of the top ten bollywood action thrillers of all time along with Sholay Baazigar and Darr Khalnayak.Again if you dont know the ending of this movie or have never heard of it go and buy the DVD as the film has some great songs and a great background score which is usaully lacking in Indian films.And then you can see what the Gupt or hidden truth really is.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been said that Rajiv Rai's 'Gupt' is one of the best whodunnit thrillers of Hindi cinema. I couldn't disagree more. It's below average. Actually scratch that it's pretty bad. A lot of money has been spilled but the film is executed in a very amateur style. Should I start with the horrendous dialogue although the ones between Manisha Koirala and Om Puri are quite amusing the screechy background score the childish writing and the monotonous cinematography. The dishumdishum fight scenes are headache inducing. The movie hasn't dated well.Now regarding the who's the killer factor I thought that was quite obvious right when the first murder happens. It's a little puzzling that no one realized it. Just look at the killer's feet and notice the gait in the first scene. I was hoping there would be an extended catfight between Kajol and Manisha but alas. Anyway the final chase sequence is fun to watch. Speaking of the two women both perform well considering the material they were given halfbaked characters. But more than that Manisha Koirala's ultraglamorous image and Kajol's sizzling girlnextdoor look ooze sex appeal. Om Puri delivers a sincere performance. Bobby Deol is terrible as is the rest of the cast.Some heavy editing and rewriting is required. 'Gupt' could have easily done without an hour. Perhaps that would have made for even better viewing. I only watched this for the two beautiful leading women.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's been said that Rajiv Rai's 'Gupt' is one of the best whodunnit thrillers of Hindi cinema. I couldn't disagree more. It's below average. Actually scratch that it's pretty bad. A lot of money has been spilled but the film is executed in a very amateur style. Should I start with the horrendous dialogue although the ones between Manisha Koirala and Om Puri are quite amusing the screechy background score the childish writing and the monotonous cinematography. The dishumdishum fight scenes are headache inducing. The movie hasn't dated well.Now regarding the who's the killer factor I thought that was quite obvious right when the first murder happens. It's a little puzzling that no one realized it. Just look at the killer's feet and notice the gait in the first scene. I was hoping there would be an extended catfight between Kajol and Manisha but alas. Anyway the final chase sequence is fun to watch. Speaking of the two women both perform well considering the material they were given halfbaked characters. But more than that Manisha Koirala's ultraglamorous image and Kajol's sizzling girlnextdoor look ooze sex appeal. Om Puri delivers a sincere performance. Bobby Deol is terrible as is the rest of the cast.Some heavy editing and rewriting is required. 'Gupt' could have easily done without an hour. Perhaps that would have made for even better viewing. I only watched this for the two beautiful leading women.";

This strange and unending boredom never leaves you but this is a real feat to make a boredom look like a masterwork. I do recommend this movie for all who think that actors may be even a bit sincere. No they cannot. This film proves it.";

Now that I am a mature woman living in the USA and knowing two very different cultures of two different countries I enjoy this movie. It is so different than all the other movies.

	schema:reviewBody "I totally agree with Denis888. I just want to add for those who don't quite understand it that actors and other movie makers here play themselves look at credits. Do they play or is this who they really are? That is the question. I think they were too serious about the Stanislavsky's method. All of them were celebrities at that time so many details of their life were a common knowledge in Poland and as such were not explained in the movie. Also the person of the absent main character Zbigniew Cybulski one of the biggest stars of Polish cinema. His exploits were known very well to general public and were subject of widely spread gossip. He died crushed when trying to jump into moving train exactly in the way shown in the initial scene of the movie. This scene still gives me goose bumps 'cause I still remember hearing the tragic news from the radio. Showing this scene so soon after his death took a lot of courage and was very controversial at that time. Unfortunately just like majority of Polish movies it is so much set in specific local Polish reality and not very transparent to viewers who don't know much about Polish history and current events particularly those behind the scene. I watched this film recently with my 27 y.o. son who currently studies film in college. He was impressed by general idea camera work and other technical matters but could not really grasp all the flavor and spice of the movie without extensive explanation of the background events and details about lives of main movie characters. So to really grasp it you need to learn about Polish cinema milieu in 60's. If the behavior of few characters in this movie seems to be somewhat strange remember that most of these people were survivors of the war were 20 of Polish population was killed and after the war they were subjected to Stalinist terror. They did not have psychologist to treat their posttraumatic stress disorder. A lot of Wajda work is about people dealing with their demons and different forms adjustment to the new reality. This is one about filmmakers and actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrzej Wajda directs Lotna. Set during the second world war the film revolves around Lotna The Swift One a Polish war horse who is passed down from soldier to soldier like the winchester in Anthony Mann's Winchester '73 as his owners are systematically killed in combat by invading German forces. It soon becomes clear that the horse in Wajda's hands becomes a shifting symbol initially that of patriotism and defiance but then finally death betrayal and defeat. By the film's end the horse has been blamed due to her conspicuous markings for the Germans discovering a band of hiding Polish troops.The film is episodic the horse introducing us to various subcharacters and subplots as it ambles across wartorn Europe. Moments of horror and violence at times give way to more lighthearted sequences  a budding romance a village priest taming the horse etc  but the film's overall arc like most of Wajda's works is that of tragedy. The film's aesthetic itself seems to move progressively away from colour to muted browns and greens to murky blacks and whites life sucked out of Europe until the landscape seems to match the horse's own complexion.Though set in the Second World War Lotna at times feels more like a fable caught out of time Wajda's tone frequently mystical hallucinatory surreal and even satirical. The film is often viewed as a piece of Polish propaganda thanks largely to dreamy sequences in which Wajda's epic tracking shots glide with Polish horses as they gloriously charge German tanks but Wajda is doing something completely different. Indeed what the horse does is crystallise Poland's own backwardness and vulnerabilities slowly shifting away from a figure which leads and inspires to one which charges uselessly with an outdated calvary towards fleets of German tanks. Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion seems to be the chief influence the horse and her original owners representative of a dying aristocracy whose entrenched Old Order fizzles out. Lotna broken leg coincides with Poland's end. So a sense of defeat and despair suffuses the film a mood which Wajda contrasts with shots and compositions designed to conjure up glorious images of Polish soldiers men and animals. Frequently Wajda has his characters loom proud preternaturally or heroically over his camera before pulling back to reveal dark wet or smoke filled skies. Like Jancso's The Red and the White its a parodic marriage of patriotism with a more dispassionate distanced view of conflict. The film's famous tracking shot in which Polish horses charge German tanks is less a moment of national pride than the wedlock of stupidity nationalism and slaughter. Like Kanal another warthemed Wajda film accused of being patriotic it's not Lotna is devoid of antiGerman sentiment. Wajda's aim is always closer to home.Wajda's films tend to be heavy with visual echoes and symbolism. It's the same case with Lotna shots of white veils contrasted the spasms of a horse mirrored to that of twitching fish etc. In each case the effect is that of a movement toward oblivion. The film's acting has been criticised during this period Wajda favoured somewhat stylised grotesque performances.7.910  Not as good as Wajda's war trilogy Ashes and Diamonds Pokolenie Kanal. Lotna as well as Winchester '73 and Lassie Come Home would form the basis of Spielberg's War Horse. Worth two viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Damn after really good french movies like A L'interieur and High Tension I was really eager to see Frontieres from reading all the positive reviews. The movie starts out kind of different with political riots and some kids who seem to have stolen money in the hassle. After some dramatic departure of one gang member they flee and split up to meet at the border to go to the Netherlands. The first two take a break in a hostel Yeah Hostel everyone! where they soon meet some strange backwoods girls and a butcher guy... after some uninspired sex with the girls the action breaks loose just waiting for the other 2 to arrive You can pretty much guess what happens... like in a million other movies they were killing tourists for years clicheed pictures of boxes full of cellphones and passports and abandoned cards hint to that like in Wrong Turn etc.. Its exactly the old TCM Theme with a real messed up family which in this case happen to be the followers of some clich Neonazi who talks a real fake mix of french and German. You get some violence and torture and like the french love it the only girl turns out to be the toughest of the gang. The cinematography is nice the acting is OK the gore is kind of average considering that we live in the age of tortureporn SawHostel movies and the violence is not as over the top as I expected. What bothered me about Frontieres is the strange pacing... the movie is way to long and beginning and end are strangely torn by some cheesy dramatic elements the female main actor real overacts the last sequences... it seemed way off to me how they were all permanently crying in this movie or telling each other how the love them. The main part of the movie is stretched and seems kind of random in how the family story is implemented. Its just puzzled together with a decrepit slobbering grandma then some deformed children in the basement Nazi Daddy and the obligatory good character in form of a seemingly sick girl who lends a helping hand in the backwoods mess. Most of this stuff is just thrown in dropped off and doesn't work as creepy as e.g. the family story in TCM2 but rather seems like a patchwork of loose ideas. Frontieres is not a bad movie but it suffers from a kind of stylistic inconsistency that throws it from drama to hostelhorror to weird actionstyle shootouts and back to drama. I am a friend of movies that try to break the genre boundaries but this one didn't quite work. I think A L'interieur did that way better. If you just rent this for he violence you can fastforward this but you won't see anything you haven't seen in other movies before... OK maybe I never saw a messed up girl in such a bloody bloody white dress but the whole idea was there ... in other french movies of the recent past. Overall a rather average movie that obviously stole too many ideas from here and there.".

Frontiers sounded like it could easily fit in with this ethos but it was a total blow out.Frontiers is slickly shot quite gory and has some bits that should be scary but it has this horribly immature atmosphere to it like it was made by a bunch of 15 year old kids let loose with a decent budget and short term memory loss. The editing is ridiculous rendering the film unwatchable and incoherent in the action scenes Frontiers makes 'Van Helsing' look like a Bela Tarr movie. The acting is really bad too with the main characters performances reminding me of some kind of inner London 'Yoof' centre AmDram play. The director has obviously watched 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and realised that if everyone screams their head off and goes into unconvincing spasms then they will create a scary atmosphere. All it does is pull you out of the film.Finally the plot is completely stupid even by horror standards introducing a Nazi sub plot There is definitely a 'La Haine' type plot element with Paris rioters coming into contact with neoNazis hmm and making no attempt at all to explain anything.If you want to watch a film where by the end you feel like you have been shouted at and smacked around the face with a packet of Bernard Mathews gammon for 10 hours then watch this film.

There is a lot of action in this boring time but none of it is extremely well done so you'll most likely be bored in the first hour.The plot itself is nothing special. It IS not arguably The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a Nazi instead of a wannabe cop gone over the edge. Leatherface is replaced by a guy with his exact same build but no chainsaw or skin disease. The family table scenes are copypasted into this movie in nearly the same exact form. Rip off or inspiration? You decide but you can't deny the liberties the director took to use the same exact story as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The way it's shot is a copypaste of the Saw franchise minus the clocktick camera scenes. The way it's cut combined edited and shot originally are all heavily influenced if not directly rippedoff of Saw. Once again decide for yourself which it is.Unlike the poster tries to suggest this is no epic. It's more or less a went to a hotel with the family from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre they put me in a Saw IIlike maze and I got out like every typical horror movie ever. Nothing more nothing less.It is NOT insanely violent. If you've seen Saw III this is tame. Nor does it have the brutality of Saw II. The gore is very generic almost boring and certainly predicable in every way. It remained me of an edited cut of The Hills Have Eyes minus the mutants and minus the more extreme moments. Do not expect a gorefest. If you do you'll be disappointed. Some gore scenes are even cutoff scenes.My opinion This film was way too typical. You've seen the formula done a hundred times. The reason I enjoyed it was because it was very well done and it was pretty intelligent. I was disappointed with the lack of gore but it wasn't too bad. If I hadn't seen the movies it took everything from I would have really loved it. But I have and it was just too typical. The action scenes with the guns were very cool and probably the most memorable parts of the movie. Some of the acting was deadonamazing while othersthe little girl the fat guywere just lame. The only thing that sold me was the twisted moral about wishing your child was dead before it was born into a world like this.Worth a buy? Not really. Worth a rental? Hardcore yes! Just don't go into it with the expectations that a perfect review suggests you have. Maybe it does earn a perfect review for the moral or maybe it deserves a low one for the clichs. I don't know.

	schema:headline " Effective flick especially if you know about recent riots in France";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not often you need an overview of recent European history to fully enjoy a horror movie. But Frontiers is a special case. All the negative commentary I've read seems to come from the hype surrounding this film. Is Frontiers bloodsoaked and violent? Sure is! Is it the bloodiest most repulsively gory film ever? No. I also agree that the basic plot doesn't really venture too far off the path of Hostel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Motel Hell for that matter. But what some people seem to be missing is sociopolitical climate of France in the last few years. Well here's where a short French history lesson may come in handy. In October and November of 2005 there were a series of largescale riots in France that stemmed from the death of two teenagers who lived in a lowincome suburb of Paris. They were suspected of a breakin at a construction site and being chased by police. When they tried to hide in a power substation they were electrocuted. The civil unrest that broke out was fueled by unemployment religious tensions racial inequality and a growing fear of police harassment. A little over two years later more riots broke out when two more teenagers died after a police car collided with their stolen motorbike. These recent events give Frontiers a healthy dose of subtext as well as a realistic backdrop for its extreme violence. Fear and intolerance are now right beside baguettes and berets as France's main cultural identity. The France seen in Frontiers isn't the glossed up version most of us have dreamily romanticized. There are no midnight walks on the Seine. No sipping of espresso at a sidewalk caf with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. No scenic tours of the Louvre or the Arch de Triomphe. Writerdirector Xavier Gens shows a modern day France that's dark violent and in anarchy. This is the France that in 2004 banned the wearing of khimars headscarves by Muslim girls at school and in 2007 elected Nicolas Sarkozy  a rightwing conservative  as president. So it should be no surprise that Gens' choice of a Nazi family as the bad guys works as a not so subtle metaphor for the French Government. So for what it's worth anyone too myopic to know something about France's current environment probably just won't get what Gens is saying in this film.".

So for what it's worth anyone too myopic to know something about France's current environment probably just won't get what Gens is saying in this film.";

The more or less simultaneously released  l'intrieur a.k.a. Inside thus far remains the absolute highlight of shocking controversy but this Frontires surely ain't no Saturday afternoon picnic neither. The rudimentary concept is a variation on the infamous mid70's sub genre of 'Rednecksploitation'. These films revolved on maniacal hillbillies terrorizing and butchering big city folks in rural areas far away from the civilized world and usually strictly for their own sheer entertainment. Considering the high population density all across the European continent it would be pretty ridiculous to introduce unworldly rednecks and so Xavier Gens' script cleverly replaces them with extremist cartels. There are several of those around here including fanatic minions of Hitler's Nazi principles. The city of Paris is in complete chaos following the announcement of the election results and a bunch of young thugs grabs this opportunity to commit a bank robbery and flee towards the FrenchLuxembourgian border. They arrive in a place far worse than the Parisian suburbs when checking into a hotel run by a deeply deranged family of Nazis. The family led by an elderly patriarch who easily could have been one of Hitler's closest drinking buddies need the girl for breeding reasons and subject the men to various games of sickening torture. Admittedly Frontires sounds like a compilation of gratuitous gore and perverted characters but writerdirector Xavier Gens definitely had some more admirable ambitions. Extreme rightwing political parties unstoppably march forward in pretty much each European country in fact their victory triggered the whole chain of events here and Gens actually attempts to illustrate  albeit quite vigorously  what the consequences would be if they regain power one day. Anyway you obviously shouldn't watch this movie for its valuable morality lesson but rather because it vividly depicts hardcore violence and uncompromising cruelty. Unless you have nerves of steel and a properly insulated stomach you might want to consider turning your head away from the screen most of the time. There's a truly nauseating massacre involving a mechanical band saw various close range shotgun killings slit throats stabbed chest and one excruciatingly uncomfortable moment featuring pliers and someone's Achilles tendon. Yikes! Vile revolting and totally unnecessary? Perhaps  but definitely fascinating to behold. Frontires suffers a bit from messy cinematography and limited imagery but at the same time you could claim this also increases the primitive and savage atmosphere Gens intended to reflect. The film is definitely a bit too long for its own good 110 minutes of running time for a sickie film? and some of the redundant sub plots and character drawings during the first half hour could easily have been cut. The makeup effects are simply great and Xavier Gens' surefooted directing skills already bought him a oneway ticket to a promising career in Hollywood.".

Now after watching the flick when trying to compare this grotesque piece of film making that without the shadow of a doubt I could probably replicate using my cell phone and shooting all the scenes in the bathroom and closet to the mentioned above almost cult bits and as a matter of fact to any movie from here back to 1952 Frontiers is nothing but a tragic display of letting foreign people take hold of a camera every once in a while. Then I started thinking how can the movie be so unpleasant to watch so I broke the whole thing down and got the following gaps in the picture. Well no so much gaps as huge unlit holes in the middle of a freeway the kind of holes you would avoid as you show nothing but hate against towing your car some 40 kilometers back to get it fixed.First of all the director Xavier Gens better known for directing Hitman which although a painful movie to watch was at least well directed disappoints like whole grain bread. Don't get me wrong the directing bit is somewhat flawless but in lack of a better word shallow. As shallow as French actors actually trying to perform in front of a camera. It's the same with Mountain Dew the drink tastes good but after a while you start thinking what's point is? The issue here is not so much the directing but the writing which Mr. Gens is also credit for. The movie is so mind numbingly stupid it makes fatal head injuries seem like playing World of Warcraft. Some young passionate probably mentally incompetent thieves from Paris flee and end up in a hostel where get this the movie shifts to a slaughterhouse condo trailer park or whatever literally littered with Nazis that besides killing innocent people and cooking them into delicious mouthwatering treats try to find a bride for the man of the family as no sane chick with hook up with a French neo Nazi that just happens to trick teenagers out of their vital organs. Now that's a perfectly ordinary English statement.The gore is not visual nor feels gore by the end of the movie. It's more of a feeling the movie projects anguish and such but there are no more than three maybe four violent scenes the rest being endless reels of garbage with bad French which reminds me not only is French bad in general but here its spoken with such a rebellious ignorant and utterly dumb accent that you pretty much have to drink toilet scrub to get it out of your system.Then it's the retarded and clichd bit where the heroine kills everybody and it's done in such a bad taste it makes you shiver with contempt when the movie comes to a halt. And the even more idiotic and this time just annoying scene where the girl happens to have a very steady aim when killing her brother or whatever he was but will not budge for the wood of the true cross to help the main protagonist in defeating the final villain. This along with the melee weapons that just happen to be left ALL throughout the building and the unrealistic fighting all of this of course being painful to watch leave the competitors sighing with relief. I'm sure a lot of people liked the movie but then again a lot of people think Chronicles of Narnia was good and you don't see them being put to sleep now do you? There was a great scene however the one where the blonde obnoxious kid gets stuck in the tunnel that was really well done but of course they screwed that up in the end as the kid was just lazy and self conscious not stuck. A more vivid experience of horror would be looking at my thumb for one hour or possibly eating cereal with a fork while I try to pick spilled human entrails from the floor.Watch this only if you find trees interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Homage is a tricky thingthere is an extremely fine line in paying tribute to the cinematic works of others and merely ripping them off hello Doomsday!. And integrating a whiff of political commentary to give an aura of sophistication to what is at heart an unabashed splatterfest is even trickier and much harder to pull of convincinglysee George Romero's Living Dead series. Despite how wobbly Xavier Hitman Gens' bloodsoaked Frontiers is in both of these departments it comes out ahead due to its own maniacal implacable energy while prone to including too many monotonous chases that slow up rather than quicken the overall pace there are scenes of such visceral savagery on display that it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. While some of the performances and characterizations veer dangerously close to camp Gens comes close to establishing the same sort of feverdream madness that made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre so endearing when an extreme rightwing candidate is elected to the French presidency the citizens take to the streets in protest the film's opening images are culled from actual news footage using this as a cover 5 smalltime crooks knock off a bank and meet up at a countryside hostel that just happens to be run by several generations of an inbred neoNazi family including a patriarch that looks like Bmovie king Roger Corman and a sister who resembles Gen from The Genitortures what ensues is a survivaloftheluckiest chase through bowelsofhell settings that have been wellestablished in the Saw and Hostel flicks.

And integrating a whiff of political commentary to give an aura of sophistication to what is at heart an unabashed splatterfest is even trickier and much harder to pull of convincinglysee George Romero's Living Dead series. Despite how wobbly Xavier Hitman Gens' bloodsoaked Frontiers is in both of these departments it comes out ahead due to its own maniacal implacable energy while prone to including too many monotonous chases that slow up rather than quicken the overall pace there are scenes of such visceral savagery on display that it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. While some of the performances and characterizations veer dangerously close to camp Gens comes close to establishing the same sort of feverdream madness that made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre so endearing when an extreme rightwing candidate is elected to the French presidency the citizens take to the streets in protest the film's opening images are culled from actual news footage using this as a cover 5 smalltime crooks knock off a bank and meet up at a countryside hostel that just happens to be run by several generations of an inbred neoNazi family including a patriarch that looks like Bmovie king Roger Corman and a sister who resembles Gen from The Genitortures what ensues is a survivaloftheluckiest chase through bowelsofhell settings that have been wellestablished in the Saw and Hostel flicks.

Even a fan of extremely violent horror flicks cannot find an appreciation for this trash. Every scene is full of clichs that are executed poorly the acting is unbearable and the actual horror element of the film is not even entertaining to say the least. All the movie has to show is blood a lot of it. Yet there is no depth past that point and after about thirty minutes into the movie you can already tell exactly where it is going. At least most of the audience did as they began to leave the theatre. You almost wish that the movie picks up at one point and gets better but it only goes downhill until the very end. The last 30 or so minutes were some of the stupidest scenes I've watched in any movie you can tell it just had absolutely no direction and almost felt like the director thought of an ending on the spot while they were filming this garbage. I can go on forever about what is wrong with this movie but I'll spare you the details and just strongly recommend you do not watch Frontires.".

I think the tone and look of Frontiers is so similar to Hostel that it turned me off to the movie early on. And the story doesn't deviate too much from the classic TCM plot. I also really didn't like the acting from the lead during the last act. Sure she had experienced a lot of brutality but the zombielike shaking and convulsing was a little over the top for me.Meh....it's not a horrible film and if you liked Hostel you should give it a shot.

	schema:reviewBody "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is credited with revolutionizing the horror genre. Many subsequent films emulated its brutally psychologically violent approach. And a few subsequent films have just ripped it off.Accordingly I've generated a checklist to evaluate whether and how well modern horror films rip off the TCM. I'm kidding BTW. I'm making this checklist up on the spot.Qualification checklist Crazy family of murderers? Check. Butchery of the dead? Check. Emphasis on realism and brutality? Check. A scene where someone thinks they've escaped the family and gotten help only to discover that the person they're getting help from is also part of the family? Check.So yes. Frontiers definitely qualifies as a TCM rip off. But how good is it? Pretty darn good. Good enough to offend you. Good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat even though you've seen it a million times before. Good enough perhaps to make you cringe. Highly recommended if that's your sort of thing. Not really as gory as some films but it certainly has enough brutality to stand among the best of them.Of course it takes a lot more to shock us today than it did in the 70s. Accordingly my quality evaluation checklist bears little resemblance to the shocks from the original TCM.Quality EvaluationPregnant women gets punched in the face? Check.Severed tendons? Check.Someone gets ruined with a buzzsaw? Check.Exploding head? Check.Boobs? Sort of. I recall seeing a boob for about half a second in the latter half of the film and earlier in the movie there's a nonsensical fastpaced sex scene with music video style editing. I can't remember if any breasts are bared in this early scene.So all in all it's pretty good.On a parting note. Others have compared it to Hostel and to High Tension I think these are inappropriate comparisons. The film's structure is much more similar to TCM. Hostel is divided distinctly into two sections with the first half being a fantasy wonderland and the second half being its seedy underside. High Tension is pretty much one situation happening for an hour and half. Frontiers like TCM is a downward spiral for the first 45 minutes or so and then an extended climax that maintains its intensity right up until perhaps 30 seconds before the credits roll.".

And a few subsequent films have just ripped it off.Accordingly I've generated a checklist to evaluate whether and how well modern horror films rip off the TCM. I'm kidding BTW. I'm making this checklist up on the spot.Qualification checklist Crazy family of murderers? Check. Butchery of the dead? Check. Emphasis on realism and brutality? Check. A scene where someone thinks they've escaped the family and gotten help only to discover that the person they're getting help from is also part of the family? Check.So yes.

I don't like Eli Roth and I REALLY don't like Eli Rothwannabes but some of the torture flicks have been better than others. 'Frontires' fits in the 'better than the others' category I guess but I have some problems with it. One thing that can often ruin a film for me is a lack of likable characters. Even worse is when a film tries to make me like the unlikable. In this film the world is evenly split between thieves and Nazis. Well hell that's not going to work for me! I don't like thieves for obvious reasons. But Gans tries to make me like them. . . Why should I? Because one's female  pregnant? Because another is sweet and quiet and doesn't want to mess around with the women? They're still criminals! If I had to choose sure I'd rather root for a couple of robbers than a family of disgusting genocidal cannibals. But 'lesser of two evils' doesn't make you any less bad. Speaking of disgusting at what point in the Nazi control of Europe did Hitler start surrounding himself with disgusting cannibal hicks in the backwoods of France or anywhere? Anyway there are quite a few positives behind the annoying negatives. For one violence and gore is abundant hence the NC17 rating. Is it NC17worthy? I don't think so. I've seen much of the violence in other Rrated films and there was no sex except a brief dryhumping scene and only a brief topless shot of the 'heroine.' It honestly feels more like the 'unrated cut' of an Rrated film which would include some 'neverbeforeseen shocking new footage!' In addition to the violence there are some genuinely frightening scenes like the claustrophobictothemax 'tunnel scene' which I believe will stand out as a shining moment in recent horror and the first look at the freezer. Technically speaking the direction and cinematography were quite good often reminding me of a '28 Days Later...'esquire film. The writing well. . . hard to tell how good or bad it was as the subtitles in my copy seemed like they were written by someone with only the slightest knowledge of the English language and I had to constantly translate from 'Broken English' into something more logical.To wrap up I have a feeling this film could've been the 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' of the new generation because it took the 'torture' trend and added a more interesting plot behind it other than 'hot teens on vacation run into trouble.' However due to some poor execution it will probably only be remembered by those who are big into the genre. Although I say again the 'tunnel scene' does have a strong chance of making it into the next edition of 'Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.' Overall a 710.AP3".

There's not much I feel I want to add to the excellent and insightful comments from previous reviewers except I think this film can be read as that  a metaphor for African countries troubled and turbulent relations within between themselves and the West.

	schema:reviewBody "The premise of this fable is as simple as it is powerful in an African country torn by civil war a sixteenyearold orphan is asked by his blind grandfather to execute the man who killed his father. Of course Atim the young one having been brought up along An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth lines does not object in the least and armed with the gun of his own father hits the road to accomplish his mission. It does not take him long to trace Nassara the war criminal in question. However the man is in no way the monster Atim expected to meet. On the contrary Nassara has become a respectable married baker whose young wife is pregnant. The exkiller even goes to the mosque and gives alms to the poor children of his village. But Atim knows all too well that this good man once made HIM an orphan so the best thing to do is to offer his services to the baker who accepts to hire him as his apprentice. This way Atim will be able to gun him down easily when the appropriate time comes. But things do not go according to plan. Do they ever?For little by little and very paradoxically indeed a sonfather relationship is born and it becomes more and more impossible for Atim to kill Nassara .On the other hand the young man does not want to betray his grandfather. You could think this is a no way out situation but Mahamat Saleh Haroun has imagined an amazing finale in which he enables his hero to square the circle by pretending to execute Nassara in front of his grandfather who remember  is blind. Satisfied with the two bangs he hears the grandfather feels revenged while Atim has spared the life of the man he has learned to know.The moral of the fable is clear forgive your enemies try to live together in peace this is the only way to unify your country to make it become a democracy. Of course all this sounds a bit saintly not to say goodygoody but Haroun is neither wet nor softheaded. If Nassara can be forgiven it is because he has become another man and pardon constitutes a long and difficult process. Moreover it is not always possible for instance for the vile arrogant gun crazy soldier Atim meets in the taxi brousse. When after being threatened and humiliated by him the orphan meets him again he beats him up and maybe kills him without being explicitly condemned by the writerdirector.Mahamat Saleh Haroun is a courageous artist. Indeed it takes tremendous energy to manage to make a film in a poor country  ravaged by civil war for four decades like Chad. Moreover he doesn't shy away from burning issues for he doesn't rub everybody up the right way.As a filmmaker he proves able particularly good when it comes to directing the actors. I suppose the persons who act in this film are amateurs but you would never say so convincing as they are.Haroun has indeed managed to make Ali Bacha Barka really impressive as the troubled guntoting teenager although he lets him be too invariably sulky to be perfect. Youssouf Djaoro for his part captures to perfection all the strengths and weaknesses of his character and deserves a best actor award although I am pretty certain he will never get any.The only real flaw but a serious one I am afraid is the film's lazy rhythm. Too bad because except during the last ten minutes this viewer was more interested than captivated more respectful than overcome by emotion. All the same Daratt is well worth seeing and is a good insight into a country most of the time ignored by the media. So feel free to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a handful of films from Africa that can leap out like a big cat from the celluloid jungle and make the viewer think. A recent example is Daratt Dry Season a movie from Chad a Central African country that was initially economically weakened by the French colonial rule and later after gaining independence slumped into a 40yearold civil war. The neighboring Darfur crisis and the spillover of refugees have not ameliorated the political and economic situation of this landlocked country. Imagine living in a country that is dusty and hot with the Sahara desert to its north. Imagine living in a country where two generations of its population have not encountered peace or progress but live under the constant shadow of fear and corruption. If you can empathize with the unusually inhospitable situation you will realize the title of the film is not merely a reflection of the hot dusty climate but a metaphor to describe life in Chad today.This film is a powerful mix of metaphors and fables. The atmosphere captured in the film is real. People still get their news on the radionot on TV or by reading newspapers. People still eat freshly baked sticks of French bread. People still carry guns that often can compare with the best anywhere in the world quite in contrast to what else is available. The younger generation includes streetsmart crooks and quiet hardworking young men yearning for normal family bonds and affection that the civil war did not allow to grow. When the young man is asked by a baker what he wants he answers laconicallyNot charity. Today what Chad requires is not charity as well but honest hard work that will build the nation. What is unreal in the film? Corruption that eats into the soul of Chad is never glimpsed save for petty thieves selling fluorescent lights stolen from semidark streets in the night. What the viewer sees is a baker baking fresh bread and distributing it free to young hungry boys the entire film suggests that young girls are an endangered species!. Now why would a person do this? Is the baker so rich that charity has become his vocation? It is possible that any scene of money changing hands for the baker's bread got lopped off on the editing floor because another baker is later shown providing aggressive competition. Terror is never shown on screen save for slippers left behind by crowds that apparently fled in terror.What are the metaphors in the film? A blind grandfather seeks revenge after a radio broadcast proclaims amnesty for the perpetrators of the horrors. The blind man hands a gun to his grandson now an orphan called Atim metaphorically meaning an orphan to avenge the death of his parents by killing a certain individual in a far away city. This perpetrator of crimes now a symbol of reconciliation hard work and progress has lost his voice and can only speak with artificial aids. Yet he is the one with a kind heart wanting to adopt a hardworking son and keeps his armory of weapons well hidden.The good men who seek revenge are blind. The bad men who seek reconciliation normalcy and family life can't speak metaphorically. And both men are devout Muslims. That's Chad today! The final outcome of the film is easily played out for the viewer because of these physical constraints of the two men. The outcome is easily played out as social mores are not tampered withthe grandfather's command is seemingly obeyed. The father's love for the son is acknowledged. It would be too simplistic to draw parallels between Daratt and ArgentineChilean Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the maiden later adapted for the screen by American novelist Rafael Yglesias for Polish director Roman Polanski. Yglesais' and Polanski's ambiguous final scene in their film of the same name where principal players exchange loaded glances is a delight. In total contrast Daratt's final scene is not of individuals but of the dry environment as the camera zooms out. The viewer is nudged by the director to see the larger picture of the film not the bare story line. What Polanski and Yglesias did in an AmericanEuropean film MahametSaleh Haroun has equaled with ambiguity and force rarely seen in Africa cinema. Will the dry season accept a world of reconciliation that will lead to rain a metaphoric wet season and prosperity for future generations indoctrinated in love and traditional values? Perhaps yes. Perhaps not. . Moolade UCarmen e Khayelitsha and In Casablanca angels don't fly are three examples of mature works of recent African cinema with its distinct African aesthetics that transect the length and breadth of the vast continent and capture the tragedy and aspirations of its people. I am pleased to add Dry Season to my list of formidable African cinema.".

It would be too simplistic to draw parallels between Daratt and ArgentineChilean Ariel Dorfman's play Death and the maiden later adapted for the screen by American novelist Rafael Yglesias for Polish director Roman Polanski. Yglesais' and Polanski's ambiguous final scene in their film of the same name where principal players exchange loaded glances is a delight. In total contrast Daratt's final scene is not of individuals but of the dry environment as the camera zooms out. The viewer is nudged by the director to see the larger picture of the film not the bare story line. What Polanski and Yglesias did in an AmericanEuropean film MahametSaleh Haroun has equaled with ambiguity and force rarely seen in Africa cinema. Will the dry season accept a world of reconciliation that will lead to rain a metaphoric wet season and prosperity for future generations indoctrinated in love and traditional values? Perhaps yes. Perhaps not. . Moolade UCarmen e Khayelitsha and In Casablanca angels don't fly are three examples of mature works of recent African cinema with its distinct African aesthetics that transect the length and breadth of the vast continent and capture the tragedy and aspirations of its people. I am pleased to add Dry Season to my list of formidable African cinema.";

	schema:headline " A cold dish in a hot climate";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Koreeda's 'Hana' Haroun's 'Daratt' is another new filmed tale about delayed revenge but a very different one. Atim Ali Barkkai whose father was murdered in the aftermath of Chad's civil war goes out to avenge his father's killer after a general amnesty is declared. His plans change when in order to carry out his task he goes to work at the killer's bakery. While Koreeda's Soza is timid and doubtful and lives with a lot of other people Atim is virtually alone and perpetually angry and seems ready to kill at any moment.'Revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold' means it's not a crime of passion but of premeditation. Into that premeditation play not only a personal sense of wrong but often hereditary cultural rules governing loyalty to tribe clan family or parent. It seems unlikely anyone would feel obligated to carry out an act of revenge as both Soza and Atim do without cultural input requiring it and since traditional values are in a state of flux or devolution the motivation may wane. This must explain the arcs of both 'Hana' and 'Daratt'. Soza of 'Hana' feels an obligation to his clan which however his own nature rejects he's a gentle soul who would rather teach calligraphy than practice his dubious swordsmanship skills  which don't seem to translate well from the dojo to the street. Atim is directed by his ancient blind grandfather to avenge his father's death. It seems almost a religious duty and in some folk interpretations of Islam such obligations are given a religions sanction. In fact though when Atim arrives at the unidentified town where his victim lives and begins working for his father's killer he refuses to go to the mosque with him perhaps sensing that subjugation to the will of God might dampen his sense of purpose or because he realizes his bloody mindedness ill fits a religion whose greeting is peace be upon you. 'Daratt's' fablelike quality arises from its forceful simplicity. Each character has some iconic function. Atim's grandfather Gumar Abatcha Khayar Oumar Defallah acts as a relentless force of judgment. The soldier who is nasty to Atim on his trip Abderamane Abakar is a minor wrongdoer who disrespects Atim which also must be avenged. Upon arrival Atim's befriended by an amiable petty thief Moussa Djibril Ibrahim who helps him get established in town but whom he summarily abandons once he narrows in on his task. When we first see Nassara Youssouf Djaoro the man who killed Atim's father it's obvious he is more important. He looks like a priest. He is a tall thin man in a robe with a scarf around his neck and a distant ascetic air  offputting but not easy to despise on sight  and he appears at a gate with a bag full of bread scraps that he distributes to poor boys who come to him with tin plates. This happens several times and then Atim goes up to Nassara. Everything about Atim from first to last suggests inarticulate rage. One would say his performance was onenote were it not so strong and convincing. He takes the proffered hunk of bread bites out of it then spits it out. The man says if he wants work to come back tomorrow. Nobody talks much in the film. In fact Nassara has had his throat slit during the war and has to hold a gadget up to his neck to be able to say anything.The strength of the film comes from its tension and suspense from the accumulating power of things left unexplained. It is never obvious right up to the last scene what Atim is going to do. When he stays with Nassara and is befriended uneasily by his young wife Aicha Aziza Hiseine and begins to work for him it's not clear why. Is he biding his time to achieve maximum surprise? Or is he simply hesitating? Moreover while evidently Nassara is becoming fond of the young man it's hard to say whether Atim is liking him more or feeding his hate. Certainly the situation is complicated by the fact that in some strange way Nassara has become a surrogate father figure for Atim an outcome recalling events in the Dardennes brothers' 'The Son' but also because when Nassara's back is killing him and he lets Atim do all the baking it delights Atim to accomplish this task with success. Nassara like Atim is silent and seems full of anger further linking the two men young and old in an uneasy embrace. One of the most vivid ever portraits on film of prolonged inarticulate rage 'Daratt' is also a more emotionally intense and convincing depiction than Koreeda's 'Hana' of how someone bent on revenge might waver painfully over the task.'Daratt' is a fascinating powerful tale. Its intensity its vividness its simplicity even the dry heat of the setting all conspire to make for a riveting film.Shown as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival 2007.".

	schema:headline " The film is an emotional minefield of conflicted beliefs and morals forever unfolding in a very angry dry and apprehensive filmic space.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dry Season is an interesting little potboiler of human emotion. It begins with a fair degree of hatred before moulding into a film in which its lead must attain a certain respect. It then moulds further still into a tale of specific fondness two people have for one another before concluding with a moral set piece complete with questions raising issues to do with honour both to those you've known your whole life and to those you've come to know and respect in the short term. The development of the agents involved in Dry Season is fascinating and the power play going on between them carries a distinct sense of menace as we await the explosion of raw human emotion as the act of revenge is carried out.But Dry Season is all about getting to that obligatory scene the scene that completes the lead's goal it's all about what happens prior to that event and the chance to engage in that event. As it happens the film has its own clever little spin on that notion with a finale that is quite magnificent. The film begins in a small town in Chad in which Atim Barkai and his grandfather overhear an announcement on the radio declaring the lack of action that will be taken against Civil Wartime war criminals. From here the film creates an interesting juxtaposition between backdrop and emotional drive for its lead a state of war that caused the whole country to clash has already ended but a state of war or distinct act of aggression within the nation between two persons or families is about to begin again.During the Civil War Atim's father was killed by a man named Nassara Djaoro an individual living close by in a larger town than the one Atim currently inhabits. Armed rather ritualistically with his father's old gun Atim travels to this place to kill Nassarsa. Initially Dry Season is a genre piece. It's use and slight spin on the revenge arc as a drive for it's narrative is interesting as this young and lonely lead travels to a new and busier place to commit amoral acts on someone we have to presume is equally amoral. It represents a pushing of the film into a realm that makes it a lot more accessible than one might initially think. But the film realises this and rather than become a hardboiled and cause and effect driven piece that sees the lead rampage his way through the new town in search for his ultimate goal it places him with the antagonistic force of the piece early on seeing them spend time together for the rest of the film's duration.When Atim first meets Nassara one knows whom the other is but the other does not fit into the same scenario. It turns out Nassara is a holy man and a frequenter of a mosque. He is a man who runs a bakery and hands out bread to the children each morning in manya notion of goodwill. He will as will his pregnant wife soon be a parent and whilst Atim is there purely to offer death by way of pistol Nassara can only offer life in return by way of pieces of bread. For Atim Nassara develops into a fatherly figure a figure Atim never had because of said man. For Nassara Atim becomes somewhat of a sonlike figure someone he can pass on his learnings to employ in the bakery and generally keep in contact with by way of close proximity.As the two spend more and more time with each other we begin to question Atim's drive. He is this close to his goal but he holds back. Then we realise his father was killed before he was born and that maybe the fact that specific personal connection between father and son was never there in the first place it will blind Atim somewhat when it comes to carrying out an act of revenge on behalf of someone Atim essentially never even met. We begin to wonder if Atim subscribes to the belief retribution should be carried out on general principal and we doubt if he is still willing to follow through in his mission rendering the film far more unpredictable than we first thought after twenty or so minutes when familiar narrative arcs and genre seemed to be the order of the day. Atim's varying emotions act as one of the more interesting elements to the film. I was genuinely unconvinced if Atim would sway either way in terms of actually killing Nassara and additionally spent some of the time wondering what payoff indeed what new order would unravel if Nassara was to remain alive.As the film enters its final third there is a distinct shift in temperaments as these two characters shift away from their respective fatherly and sonlike figures. The two seem to suddenly share a fair amount of homoerotic scenes together as they engage in long pauses with one another while at other points Nassara gazes back at Atim's sweaty body as he does his work. There is one instance in which Atim tries to apply something to the back of Nassara's head and they roll about a bit with one another on the ground before sharing a moment. The content aids in pushing the characters away from the relationship they already shared and in one final act of mightbe homoeroticism Atim invites Nassara back to where he initially lived so that he can be introduced to the rest of his family. But queer theory aside Dry Season is a genuinely intriguing study of raw human emotion as opposing sides bond.".

It was written and directed by MahamatSaleh Haroun.This powerful movie begins with what clearly is a bitter blow for people who have suffered during Chad's long civil war. All war criminals are amnestied. There is no justice for people who have suffered horribly. The young protagonist Atim Ali Barkai is given a pistol and is told by his grandfather that now revenge is up to him. He must find and kill the man who killed Atim's father. Atim travels to the capital N'Djamena. He finds the killer Nassara Youssouf Djaoro and actually begins to work for him as a baker. Atim has ample opportunity to kill Nassara. However just as Hamlet hesitates Atim hesitates. Nassara has reformed. He begins each day by giving bread to poor children. He has married a beautiful young wife who is pregnant. The wife Aicha is portrayed by Aziza Hisseine. Naturally Atim falls in love with her. Atim hesitates and we all wait to see what will happen next.As I wrote in my review of another film from Chad Abouna This movie is worth seeing on its own merits. That fact that it's from Chad makes it even more important to view it. If I counted correctly less than a dozen films have been made in Chad. The superb Dryden Theatre at The George Eastman Museum in Rochester is showing five of these movies as part of a Haroun retrospective. My compliments to the Dryden for giving us the opportunity to see these films on the large screen.Some of Haroun's films are available for the small screen but some are not. Also even with the resources of the Eastman Museum a print of Bye Bye Africa couldn't be located. If you know someone who has a print of that movie please notify the Dryden Theatre.Daratt is a very powerful film and I highly recommend it. It's unlikely that you'll be able to view it on the large screen but it's available on DVD. Find it and see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the other posters make good points but the one they miss is that this is first last and simply pure Milius. If you don't know who John Milius is you probably do not read movie credits. John Milius is a screen writer and director. Kind of a cult figure. His stock in trade is manly virtue. His detractors would use the term macho but that is too derogatory. Movies you may have see by him are Wind and the Lion Red Dawn Conan the Barbarian Jeremiah Johnson Clear and Present Danger The Rough Riders Apocalypse Now Magnum Force Dirty Harry Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean. See a pattern here? Every one of the above movies deals with male relationships honor loyalty fall and redemption. Romance relationships take a back seat to the relationships between the male characters be they protagonists or antagonists. Jeramiah Johnson is a great example of this and shares many theme similarities with Farewell to the King.Milius the director's sense of honor transcends the norm and underscores his reputation as a Hollywood rebel and outcast. Leroyd is betrayed by his erstwhile allies symbolized by Gen. MacArthur who gives his word and violates that promise. Leroyd ultimately accepts his former hated Japanese enemy simply because he too possesses a personal code of honor similar to Leroyd. A similar scene plays out at the end of Red Dawn where the Cuban Commander lets the dying Jed escape carrying his dead brother Charlie Sheen through a shared warriors sense of honor. Jed then goes to a playground to sit in a swing presumably regaining their lost childhood in joined death. This is a familiar theme in Milius' work. Another familiar theme is that of the Rebel or loose cannon. Dirty Harry the Marine Captain in Wind and the Lion are just a few examples. Milius is the quintessential loose cannon in Hollywood. So he probably feels a kinship to the characters of which he writes. There are many other themes that are familiar to all his movies. The female as a catalyst and semitragic figure is another. His women move his protagonists to greater heights. The female at risk or her unfortunate demise drives the central character to either his doom or his redemption or both. I have to say that I am a Milius fan. This movie is one of my favorites by him. Yes I cringe at some of the acting like Sgt. Tenga's horrible fake British accent Kenyan by way of Chicago perhaps? The English speaking Apaches also make me roll my eyes. But scenes like Advance the Colors or Leroyd's redemption at the end of the movie more than make up for the other lapses. This movie is good stuff. Get a six pack or a bottle of scotch a few cigars some munchies and enter the world of John Milius. A world where men live by their honor disputes are resolved man to man and if enemies survive the ordeal the sit down and drink to one another as survivors.".

He pick ups where Peter O'Toole left. Playing dandy intellectuals with ease and graciousness. I liked the adaptation skill given to natives. Unlike other portraits of Indians or other native cannibal age tribes folks here are keen of accepting useful western habits so the gap of values isn't unbridgeable.

Released in an era when Rambo was king it seems many people just didn't get the film's messages of loyalty redemption and personal integrity. In other words it is a true adventure and not just a bangbang action flick. The kind of movie we need to see more of. Nick Nolte has never been one of my favorite actors but he shines as the gruff King Learoyd. Learoyd is a man of action on the surface but he has been running from conflict his whole life. When he sees that the justice of our real world is perverted beyond hope he retreats to the more honorable world of primitive uncorrupted Borneo.Eventually the real world intrudes in the form of World War 2. As The Botanist tells him you can no longer avoid history. Learoyd replies The world's so full of crap that you're bound to step in it someday. Is that what you call history? Finally Learoyd can no longer hide and the war hits him with its full fury. He is shattered by loss yet not unbeaten.He retains his integrity and transcends to nonviolence. In one of the film's most emotional scenes he accepts the surrender of the Japanese Colonel who has tormented him with grace and understanding leading to the Colonel's own redemption. This is a gorgeous film. full of breathtaking scenery and wellconceived action. The performances are all topnotch especially Nigel Havers as The Botanist. Why is Havers seen so little?He seems to be an actor of depth and talent. I also enjoyed the character of Tenga who brought some welcome humor to the movie. Farewell to the King can be accused of being too sentimental and I can't disagree. There are worse things to have in a movie than sentiment though. I hope this film achieves some of the recognition it is due. It is certainly John Milius' best.".

It is I think a mistake to label it an action movie it is a drama and played with a theatricality to which the viewer must adjust.Nevertheless once it gets into its stride this film has considerable charm.The core cast bond closely and Frank Mcrae who plays Sgt Tenga and Marius Weyers Sgt. Conklin manage to give warmth to the invaders who threaten the survival of The People of the Hills. The central relationship between Nolte and Havers is a fragile one which teeters on the brink of formulaic in Nolte's rescue of the sick Englishman and their mutual debts of gratitude and obligation. However as they plunge into the conflict against the remnants of the defeated Japanese army they each shock one another with what they are prepared to do. I think the climax of the horror which I do not wish to spoil is brilliantly done. I felt the protagonists' turmoil and understood their brutal reactions while still being shocked by it. This film is open to charges of hokiness theatricality and slowness but given a chance it explores themes similar to those in The Thin Red Line the imperialistic side effects of the Pacific war and the dehumanising effect of soldiering against the fully human power of love and community.".

	schema:reviewBody "Farewell to the King is one of the greatest war movies and simply one of the greatest movies ever. I've seen and own dozens of WWII movies and this is one of the best. The story unfolds in a grand sweeping fashion reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia even Lost Horizon. At the same time it manages to capture a reality of life and loss that rarely sees the light of day on film or anywhere else for that matter.It's great to see so many people here at IMDb and elsewhere have so much good to say about this film. Nick Nolte is fantastic as the soldier turned king and turns in one of his strongest performances ever. The film is breathtaking the acting story and music is top notch. It's a gripping film very necessary and old schoolHollywood in a time filled with dime a dozen action hero types.Perhaps where some of the few critics get thrown is by the near fantasy nature of the story. If they would follow through with the stories presentation intent and the directors molding done wonderfully by John Milius they could find in fact that it works great on every level. It starts with a romanticized viewpoint of war and the Flare of our youth that many soldiers could look back on to descend into the depths of hell and the realities of war that all should remember and none should forget. All of this of course is presented in a grand old tale container. The container has of that nature and large enough to hold some of the narrative information and striking barbaric realities that the film so accurately presents along side the beauty and normalities of what people could have in life. It's not easy to portray a vision of hell and a vision of Shangrila of sorts in the same picture. This film is saying a great deal on many levels. One thing is that real freedom and a real Shangrila is worth fighting for. Yet it's also one of the few films to even dare begin to unfold the true nature of how barbaric the Pacific War was. After years of studying the Pacific War I can tell you that as well done as this movie is it only skims the surface. But what a picture it gives.".

This is a film that could have been Milius's great masterpiece although Big Wednesday is a pretty great film. It has something important and striking to say about war and about the nature of the bond between Western adventurers and savage tribal people applicable to the American misadventure in Vietnam and to earlier periods such as Lawrence of Arabia during World War One. It doesn't quite succeed. Still this 1989 war film unfairly dismissed at the time as a blond version of Rambo has some of Milius' best work as a filmmaker.

It also resembles Dances with Wolves too. This film is a bit violent but any war movie would be.The days of signing on a tramp steamer and seeing the south seas are as long gone as the Phonograph and 78 rpm record. The jet age travel agencies and space age communication have destroyed whatever romance traveling there might have had.Films with plots like this now happen in outer space not the south seas. It is a little too violent so I give it a 9. This is a genre that I think can no longer sustain an audience.Farewell to the King!".

Firstly the film in my opinion is based on the exploits of an actual British botanist Major Tom Harrison who did exactly what Nigel Haver's character did in 1945 helping the tribes. He never met a king but from what I read there were striking similarities. Also I like Nigel Havers I think he is a great actor and here he proves that he is just that. He gives the film emotion and has a wonderful presence with his voice especially his last line of the film wonderful!    I also like the fact that film shows the British and Aussies did a lot of work fighting the Japanese and it wasn't just the Americans. Nick Nolte's character is just about what I'd expect from him gritty and King like although it is hard not see the similarities between him and Rambo. James Fox is good too and I'm glad he was in it. The film does have its flaws and the story seems to make it incoherent at times which is its major weakness. Having said that I still think it is one of my favorite World War Two movies.".

In between I saw all the black and white WWII movies that came to the old Westmore Theater within walking distance of my home now long gone with all the other old neighborhood picture palaces replaced by the sterility of the mall clusters. Many of those films are still among my favorites. Over the years many more films dealing with various aspects of WWII have come along mostly in color. Some capture the era and some don't but some fine ones have been made. One of those is Farewell to the King.Now I know that such things are highly subjective but the opening sequence after the credits evokes such a feeling of nostalgia in me. You see I remember these men in the flare of their youth. I saw the Greatest Generation leave and return and they were ten feet tall to me. I had a box of ribbons patches area bombing photographs and other items they gave me when they came home.But I digress. Farewll To The King is a testament to the futility of trying to escape history as Nigel keeps telling Leroyd. Here is a man who felt abandoned by his leader and escapes from the war himself and inadvertently finds a paradise only to have history catch up with it and destroy it. This is the great tragedy of the film. It is a tragedy for all concerned as war always is. It is not only a tragedy for Leroyd but for the soldiers who are sent to help fulfill the mission of engaging the natives of Borneo in the fight against the Japanese and who become enamored themselves with what Leroyd has found. It is a tragedy for Nigel's commanding officer who is himself smitten by it but knows what the result will be. It is a tragedy for the Japanese. And the magnificent score by Basil Poledouris just heightens the sense of it. And as another reviewer has noted the ending is great.I highly recommend this film.".

They landed on the island but he was the only one who escaped the Japanese executions. His blue eyes saved his life in the tribe. The women saw the sea in them and the sea means salt and salt means life. He was able to win against the evil ruler bring peace to the tribes and unite 22 longhouses. A Japanese plane strafes the settlement after triangulating on Tenga's radio. Learoyd agrees to fight the Japanese for the freedom of the tribes.There is a poetry to this jungle epic. It's an old fashion action adventure that feels very literary. Nick Nolte's acting can be divisive. His grandiose performance fits a man gone mad and reborn as a king. In addition Nolte is perfect to play it. There is a possible way to see a white man leading locals as racist. I don't think that's valid since more white men came and ultimately destroyed paradise. There are memorable scenes and turns in this. It is grand cinema and minor box office failure.".

This film is one of several Nolte performances before the real troubles began and along with films such as Cape Fear The Prince Of Tides and Jefferson In Paris showed that Nolte had a wide acting range that was sometimes downright surprising.Before watching this film it is important to understand that it is antiBritish colonialism which is fine by me and it has a romantic notion of life in Borneo. Having been in Southeast Asia a fair amount  although not in Borneo  the picture of life depicted here is not as wonderful as it appears. But it is always interesting. Part of the film was shot in Malaysia substituting for Borneo.Another thing you know before going in is that the ending is not going to be a happy one although the very conclusion is a tad upbeat but not until a great deal of sorrow had occurred.The 3 primary actors are Nick Nolte who is superb as an American who has washed ashore in Borneo and become a king of a local tribe...a life he sees as paradise. Nigel Havers is excellent as the British officer to interrupts paradise with good intentions of course but who brings about an end to paradise. James Fox an excellent British actor has a rule that is perhaps the most thankless in his career..This film was a disaster at the box office and I'm not sure why. It's well done. All I can think is that time timing was wrong.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was numerous parts of this movie that reminded me of Conan the Barbarian. Not the plot but rather the directing style. John Milius has a style that can be pleasing to the eye at times though the director of Photography was Dean Semlar a hero to South Australians as he won an academy award for his camera work on Dances with Wolves.Farewell to the King is a story set in the closing days of world war II. The Japanese and the Germans are losing the war and the plan is to unite the tribes of Borneo so that when the Australians land and push the Japanese back from the coast they will meet a strong opposition within. The island of Borneo at this time is still relatively untouched with many tribes living deep within the jungles. The Japanese occupy the island but only on the rim the natives control the tribes within.When a botanist is sent into the heart of Borneo he is captured by a tribe and brought to their king who happens to be an American. The Botanist gains the king's confidence though he plans on overthrowing him in favour of the allied forces. He learns that the King deserted the American Army when Macarther pulled out of the Phillipines. He escaped with other friends to Borneo when they crashed and clambered ashore. His mates wanted to get help from the Japanese but he did not trust them so he struck off on his own. Later he discovered that the Japanese caught and executed his friends. He then dying of malnutrition and malaria was found by a tribe and they were going to sell his head to the Japanese but a dragon tattoo on his chest and his blue eyes saved him. He them managed to unite the tribes defeat a despotic leader and became their king.The movie deals with him as the King and how the war and American imperialism destroys his kingdom. He is a king and his subjects see him as such but the Americans refuse to acknowledge his nation and even though they sign a treaty with him they consider it worthless and wish to bring him in for court marshal. The botanist though begins to build a strong friendship with the king and learns that he really is a king for he rules wisely. We watch as the botanist goes from his view of civilised British to an acceptance of the legitimacy of the native culture.This movie attacks the idea of white supremacy and civilisation. The AngloSaxon's in this movie consider them to be far superior to the natives of Borneo and believe that they need to bring their civilisation to them. At the beginning the Botanist corrects himself when he first says that they were going to recapture Borneo and then says liberate. What is interesting though is the longer he spends with the natives the more he comes to accept their lifestyle. The other soldiers that come to train the natives in the art of warfare also become to love the life and reject the western life. We also watch as the tribe changes as the war comes to them. They begin with swords and shields and finish with mortars and heavy machineguns. When the King finally gives himself up his retinue consists of a number of nationalities and they are all equipped as mercenaries.In farewell to the King we watch the end of the native culture and the beginning of Western Imperialism. The last outpost of the native is worn away as the Western Imperialists drive the Japanese out only to remain there themselves. The King tried to remain out of the war but the war was sent to them. Even though the Japanese were defeated the Western Imperialists did not pull out but worked to subjugate the natives of Borneo. They removed one evil only to replace another.".

What happened next was the basis of an amazing story and a wonderful movie.The man was crazy and yet was brought back to life by the tribe the women of the tribe seeing his eagle tattoo and believing he was sent by the gods. Eventually he became king of the village and the tribe and life was settled and happy until the British army parachuted into this seeming island paradise and drew the king and his tribe into the war against the Japanese.While the setting of the story is war this is a psychological drama concerning loyalty and honor and courage. The movie is attractive to the eye and comparisons to a Joseph Conrad story are appropriate. John Milius who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay presents this movie in almost a tantalizing epic manner. The scenery the musical score are wonderful! And if at times the plot is a little rough it is easily forgotten because of themes like friendship and life and death. And of course what would a tragedy be like without betrayal? If you can leave your cynicism at the door and even a few of your sensitivities against violence at the back of the room then you can enjoy this movie. Ultimately as good and sad as this movie is there are also themes of redemption especially at a personal level. Nick Nolte is excellent as Learoyd. Nigel Havers is solid as Captain Fairbourne. In fact I could not spot any poor acting in this movie.In this movie the lines between friends and enemies are blurred but positive human qualities transcend the faces of war and that is why I suppose I enjoyed this movie so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American deserter I had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the Philippines as their desperate escape by raft to Borneo is not your classic desertion. But no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the Japanese. Nolte's character a sergeant has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed. And incredibly no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the Japanese right to him. But anyway Nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. So he's out of the war. Then the British commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the Japanese.Unfortunately Nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war now with a tribe of warriors under his command Nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language rarely using contractions. He makes sweeping gestures when he talks and acts like he is one with nature as if he was raised in the jungle.There is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never believable. It always looks like he's overacting. He needed to be a little more of an American soldier and a lot less of a tribesman. As it is he comes across not as a regal king but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. But that is not the intent of the film as the script has him being admired and trusted by the British commandos. There is never any suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange. He is simply viewed by the British as the defacto leader of the tribe. Thus it always seems that Nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film.Another actor might have done a great job with the role delivered his lines believably and made it an outstanding movie. But Nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.What a waste.".

It is not. I watched it and after about five hours  or was it just 2? time distorts with boredom...  it ended and I also watched the making of. Which explained a lot. The concept The director wanted to shoot a movie. In Venice. With lots of famous actors that receive equally small salaries. Using only digital cameras and his own handheld camera rig inventions. Without a script entirely improvised. Without. A. Script.That should explain it all. Let's just describe one scene somewhere in the movie A hotel maid pours white liquid into two cocktail glasses that are placed in front of a business man on a cell phone. She undresses dipping her breasts into both glasses in front of the  now just mildly distracted  business man who continues to bark orders into his cell phone. She dips them in again. She stands up and gets dressed. The guy drinks the white liquid from the glasses. The sequence lasts a few minutes is completely without reference or context and just sits there eager to provoke an audience reaction but failing in my case.Or the 10minute flamenco dance shot simultaneously with 4 cameras. Impressive but useless. There are many such scenes  out of context without purpose done purely for the joy of doing them.Now don't get me wrong  the movie if it can be called a movie has its moments. Yes with a lot of effort you can almost make out a story a film crew shooting a cheap movie in Venice sticking to a weird dogma of guerillamoviemaking. There is a murder  or at least an attempted murder. And the most memorable scene of the movie has to be the 15 minutes or so that we see the shot director lying on the ground only able to move his eyes while his cast come to him and talk to him too selfabsorbed to notice he's dying. The three other sex scenes playing in the other split screen windows at the same time look pale in comparison. Note to director 4 split screens is just too much! Or the scene where a woman undresses whispering comments to the audience Now why should this be particularly interesting to you? she asks while removing the first item of clothing before engaging in sex with the comatose director.But do 2 memorable scenes make up for all the rest? After all the DVD jacket sleeve promised thrills chills and cleverness. There was nothing thrilling about the entire movie at all. And while it may think it's clever it just isn't. The actors left to improvise a story out of nowhere fail to achieve much. In the beginning Rhys Ifans playing the director grabs the screen eager to be the centre of attention and shouting so much that no one else gets noticed at all. No wonder they improvised his assassination  they must have been sick of not being noticed. Then the rest of the cast fail to do anything creative and most of the pleasure is in watching their movieinamovie which has more dialogue and more of a storyline and more displays of acting skills than the rest of the story. Then Salma Hayek tries to steal the show by being incredibly annoying and is improvised away just as she becomes unbearable. Is there a pattern here?The moral is a movie without a script cannot be entertaining. Film students and artists may appreciate it but the rest of the population won't. And with 20odd egos it's impossible to make a good movie.Quite frankly only watch this if you are looking for material to write a bad review or a bad arts essay about. Or if you need something to satirize  the entire movie feels like an extended version of the short film that the arts teacher presents to her class in Ghost World  a bad joke at art's expense....".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is severely lacking in the artistry that it claims to be all about. I feel it is as artistic as a the socalled art created by people who fling paint randomly onto a canvas or getting on a stage and doing various things to hurt themselves or shock the audience. I can't believe that the people involved with this are the people involved with this. I was deluded just as other people who wrote comments about this movie by the cover of the DVD don't judge a DVD by its cover I know but still what else do you have to go on usually? Besides its intentionally deceptive in my opinionwhich makes it sound like a sleek little independent mysteryhorror or something like that.

I feel it is as artistic as a the socalled art created by people who fling paint randomly onto a canvas or getting on a stage and doing various things to hurt themselves or shock the audience. I can't believe that the people involved with this are the people involved with this. I was deluded just as other people who wrote comments about this movie by the cover of the DVD don't judge a DVD by its cover I know but still what else do you have to go on usually? Besides its intentionally deceptive in my opinionwhich makes it sound like a sleek little independent mysteryhorror or something like that.

	schema:reviewBody "Just finished trying to make sense of the DVD and then watching the making of documentary in the special features and at the moment what stands out most in my mind is that they show a cast meeting where Burt Reynolds fairly pointedly says to Mike Figgis Well I got here yesterday and I've spent quite a bit of time looking at what's been shot so far and I can't tell who the characters are what their names are and what the relationships between them are so I want to know do you expect us actors to work that out between us? I'm just saying this because I've already got the job or I don't whatever. this is not exactly what he said btw just paraphrasing the gist of it from memory.Mike Figgis reply to him is basically don't worry about it that will all come out in the editing.Honestly I'm not a Burt Reynolds fan  something about his manner comes off as arrogant to me  but after trying to watch this confusing movie I sure wish Mike Figgis had paid more attention to what Burt was trying to tell him!! The only scene that worked well for me in the whole movie was the scene of the Flamenco dancer. Which I think is telling because it's the closest thing to a music video in the movie  i.e. the 4 screen technique I don't think works well for trying to tell a story. But for something like the flamenco dancer it's interesting visually to have closeups of her feet and her pretty face etc. all juxtaposed on the screen at the same time. To overwhelm the viewer with the flash and fury of all this motion and music at the same time. But when trying to tell a story it's just frustrating really as a viewer you don't know where to look and if you're missing something important.I love Leaving Las Vegas obviously Mike Figis has incredible gifts as a film maker. But for me this movie was pretty much an experiment that failed.".

I thought it was very brave of Mr. Figgis to do a movie where he let the actors improve freely and for that he should be commended. The actors did an excellent job and some scenes in the movie are actually humorous. My favorite scene was when Lucy Lui and Selma Heyek went at it! It was hilarious! Almost worth the confusement and oddness of this twisted tale. There are some pretty disturbing occurrences such as cannibals kidnapping and eating people so I don't recommend it for people who aren't in to stuff like that.

This one takes the cake for the worst I've ever seen. The only fair thing to do is put a big warning on the box or anywhere it's sold online.";

After reading a few of the very negative reviews all of which I found very pertinent and just no script insult to the actors pretentious and so on I decided not to bother with the second half. I really feel for all the people who felt themselves cheated by watching all of it.I can also justify the 110 vote rather than zero because I was prompted to read the IMDb reviews which I found much more entertaining that the movie. Out of curiosity and amazement I even read some of the reviews that gave the film a high score. I was not at all convinced by the people appreciating this film as art many of whom admitted to not understanding it. They should realise that this fact doesn't necessarily make them stupid and the director a genius it might just be that there is nothing to understand...".

Figgis seems to realise at several times in the film that his paying audience may be falling asleep and inserts gratuitous and seemingly unconnected perverted sex scenes. A moment of temporary relief comes early on when Rhys Ifans' character is shot why? and he enters a coma from which he seems able to selectively awake. Up until then the sound level is loud enough to keep even the most soporific viewer awake but mercifully the coma seems to coincide with a general quietening down.Ironically I'm almost tempted to watch Figgis's Timecode to see how it compares.
