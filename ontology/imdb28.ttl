	schema:reviewBody "I suspect that for most Western Europeans and Americans the name 'Bosnia' is now no longer simply the name of a country but also carries a subliminal implication of atrocity and ethnic viciousness.  I doubt then that many people would approach this film with any false expectations of what it will contain.That said viewers should not come to this film for a political explanation of why and how the war happened  for that it's probably best to read a few books.  This film does attempt to give a human explanation of how and why wars like this one happen and continue to happen though.Inevitably some have accused Savior of bias though an American film the director is a Serb and it was filmed on location in Montenegro with such emotive subject matter partiality would hardly be surprising.  Indeed the film does not flinch from discussing atrocities committed by Bosnian Muslims.  Those who accuse this film of being proSerb however should consider that one of the most hateful caracters in the whole film whom we witness carrying out pointlessly vicious acts of cruelty and mysogyny and who happily admits to being a serial rapist is himself a Serb.Viewers should instead look to the human heart of this film.  Dennis Quaid gives us a superb performance rendering a character of some complexity look at his expression when one character tells him 'You are a good man'. He is ably matched by Natasja Nincovic's complicated battered portrayal of a Serb woman  and not merely a 'rape victim' stereotype that we know from other films.There is a religious subtext for those who like looking for such things  plenty of Christ imagery chiming nicely with the title.  There is a special irony in the cross Joshua carries apparently a Catholic he has come to Bosnia specifically to kill Muslims in revenge for the loss of his family in a terrorist bombing  yet by joining the Serbs he is also aligned against the Catholic Croats.  Perhaps this says something about the selfdestructive nature of his revenge and about his own internal conflict.  This is a film about a man divided against himself in a country divided against itself.It is particularly effective that the main character in this film is an American.  We are tempted to comfortably see him as 'one of us' a decent man in the midst of a barbaric war  but we are not allowed such passive comforts.  Eaten by revenge and pain little seperates Joshua from his barbaric 'sidekick' Goran whose mindless cruelty he meets with contempt but also inaction.  His own conduct is difficult to stomach but nonetheless presented as the actions of a human not a monster.What Antonijevic's film does then is look at the line between those who have and those who have not become indifferent to the suffering of others  it is in this way that the perpetuation of war is explored.  There are no politics no discussion of religion or of 'age old ethnic hatreds'.  The focus of this strong film is the simple human cost both in lives extinguished and lives mutilated by war.  Indeed for those not very familiar with the details of the war in Bosnia the practical anonymity of the different soldiers throughout the film will heighten the sense of War as something soldiers do to Civilians.People who respect and appreciate this film should steer clear of the recent Behind Enemy Lines however  it reuses fragments of the Lake scene in Savior to simplistically antiSerb effect completely bastardising the intent of the people who originally created those images.Nonetheless despite what has been done to it Savior remains beautifully acted tragic mature filmmaking.".

Very tough to watch at times but in the end extremely rewarding and cathartic.Its so appreciated that some artists in the world have something to say and do a timely thoughtful movie to tell the world what they are missing or ignoring.  You can either see what they have to say or see the next assembly line CGI garbage. I suggest that any mature moviegoer give this a look.  There is some unexpected humor a lot of horror and carnage and heartache and I do suggest you keep the tissues close by for a some incredibly emotional scenes. There is not a whole lot of dialogue which is also much appreciated. Most of the time actors are better when they have nothing to say but alot to express.  The actors in this movie are all very natural and real.  Not the least of which was the baby!  One of the best performances by a new born I've ever seen..this child is beautiful. Thanks to Dennis Quaid who probably made the equivalent of cab fare for this one..you did a great job in an invaluable movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "1993 Bosnia.  Having seen his wife and son murdered by Muslim terrorists Guy has become bitter and hard and is fighting as a mercenary for the Serbs. When a prisoner exchange sees his partner take a girl he knows and try to kill her and her unborn mixed child Guy is forced to kill him to protect them.  However he then finds himself in a bitter war with a woman and child that no one wants.I have seen this movie twice now and can find little to dislike about it but also realise that it is not for a fun evening in with friends.  The film is unrelentingly bleak and depressing as it is a look at the bitter and cruel war fought in Bosnia.  The subject matter is framed around Guy as a man who has been turned hard by the horror he has seen and it works well for this reason.  We see it through the eyes of a man who has seen it all and has no more hurt left to feel.  The film doesn't simply act out atrocities for us to watch but frames them within this story  however we know that nothing is made up or exaggerated in terms of the bigger picture.The film lacks any sort of traditional American copout it's no spoiler to say that Guys wife and child don't turn out to be alive after all! only the opening this is why he's like this' 10 minutes are a little too neat and could have been dispensed with  I didn't need it to explain why he was dead inside only that he had become it due to war  which was partly true. However this doesn't really take away from the film only slightly weaken the character.The cast are pretty good but the film is 99 Quaid's.  He gives a great performance which is subtle and very downbeat.  His eyes are where most of the acting occurs and he does it very well  his character is very unsympathetic and has only a marginal redemption to look forward to but yet Quaid mixes it very well.  Kinski is out of the film before her name has even appeared on screen while Ninkovic does a good job again despite a unsympathetic character.  The rest of the cast are OK but hard to judge as much of the dialogue is in SerboCroatian and their performances are hard to judge.  Faces such as Skarsgrd add interest but I did wonder why he had bothered for such a short time on screen.Overall this is not a fun film to rent on Friday night but a bleak antiwar film that will leave you in no doubt that the conflict in Bosnia and perhaps everywhere else is of no value when compared to the enormous cost in terms of human life and suffering.".

This movie takes a serious look at war and it's effects on a soldier who has joined the foreign legion a woman he meets and an infant who enters their life. The setting is Bosnia and war is brutal. The hero finds himself surrounded by death and destruction. He chose his life as a soldier in the Foreign legion as an act of revenge to purge his anger from losing his family. Soon war and anger overcomes and all that is left is the Savior. Who is the savior? I'll leave that up to you the viewer to discover for yourself. Excellent film overall.

It also seems strange that the Croat defence council  HVO  decided to drive their Serb and Muslim victims right beside Joshuas hiding place to be massacared .Despite this criticism SAVIOR is a good film . I remember disliking it first time I saw it because Id written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that theres no good guys in the Bosnian conflict . Jealousy aside  I had my heart on SOLITUDE winning the best original screenplay Oscar  I do admire SAVIOR for being an intelligent  sad and haunting film . Despite having Oliver Stone as producer and an American star this is a totally European film in both feel and execution  I had a son . Hes dead . He had a son . Hes dead too . Both died fighting  For what ?  a Croat tells Joshua . What indeedI wouldnt say this is the best Bosnian conflict movie  That accolade goes to PRETTY VILLAGE PRETTY FLAME  but its probably the most accesible to a western audience .

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most painful depictions of war I've ever seen this shows the effect of a civil war on ordinary people in a very powerful way. Stonyfaced Dennis Quaid is excellent as ever as the emotionallyshutoff mercenary tiring of the pointless and unresolvable fighting in Bosnia slowly allowing himself to feel again some years after the horrific death of his family when a woman and child inveigle themselves into his life. Some of the scenes in here are beyond horrific particularly near the end where a massacre of civilians is made to seem quite dull and everyday to the killers.

Stonyfaced Dennis Quaid is excellent as ever as the emotionallyshutoff mercenary tiring of the pointless and unresolvable fighting in Bosnia slowly allowing himself to feel again some years after the horrific death of his family when a woman and child inveigle themselves into his life. Some of the scenes in here are beyond horrific particularly near the end where a massacre of civilians is made to seem quite dull and everyday to the killers.

I agree without hesitation but it's important to remember that particularly in its conclusion SAVIOR is also both heartwarming and gratifying. I have seen very few films that juxtapose these various qualities so well.This is one of Quaid's finest performances as Joshua Guy Rose a former U.S. Army officer who joins the Bosnian Serb Army for the simple reason that they are fighting against Moslems a religion that for reasons the film reveals he's come to hate. He soon finds himself the unwitting savior of Vera a Serbian woman played with utter conviction by Natasa Ninkovic and her child conceived through rape by former Bosnian captors. The symbolism of the halfSerb halfBosnian child shines through very well. Settings are also worthy of note The Bosnian sequences were filmed right next door in Montenegro and the whole senseofplace adds as much immediate realism to this film as the superb acting.There are some rather heated debates on IMDb's Discussion Board regarding what SAVIOR supposedly says about the war in Bosnia and how it portrays Serbs Croats and Moslems. Obviously way too much has been read into the fact that the director is Serbianborn. Certain events and portrayals will inevitably upset citizens of the former Yugoslav republics who were victimized during the wars in the 1990s. However the basic focus of this film is as nonpartisan as it can possibly be. If anything SAVIOR overdoes the point that Bosnian Serbs Croats and Moslems all committed acts of both horrific cruelty and extreme compassion. In the words of one character I am Croat my wife Serb. Before the war no difference. Now stupid!".

They rush toward it enduring one conflict after another along the way losing friends and sometimes the hero himself. In commercial pap Rambo races towards the goal is captured and tortured escapes and wreaks revenge. And Errol Flynn no matter the tribulations will wipe out the Japanese radio station and take the airfield.This movie about the tribal warfare in the former Yugoslavia between the Serbs the Croats and the Muslims doesn't adhere to the usual conventions. Dennis Quaid older and lumpier escapes American justice and finds himself a mercenary for the Serbs while in the French Foreign Legion. The ethnic cleansing that goes on is so general that at times it's hard to keep track of who's expelling or executing whom.One of his assignments is to pick up a Serbian woman who has been held captive by the Muslims and was deliberately made pregnant by them. Her pregnancy is intended as an insult to the Serbs and especially to the woman's family. Quaid's Serbian companion receives the insult exactly as intended. They stop the car in a tunnel and the companion kicks the woman brutally in the stomach bringing on labor and is about to shoot and kill both her and her baby before being shot by Quaid.Quaid drives her to her family's humble farm. The father finding her with a Muslim baby throws her out. The goal has been achieved. As in a typical action movie Quaid has escorted his ward and her baby from Point A  the prisoner exchange bridge  to Point B  her home. But the movie isn't nearly over. It's barely begun.Quaid drives her and the baby away not quite knowing what to do with them and they're both a big problem for him. The mother  an entirely ordinarylooking woman  hates the baby and refuses to breast feed it. She doesn't speak at all. And the baby girl herself isn't the cute kind that is likely to milk sympathy from Quaid even if not from the mother. It's a nuisance. She cries constantly because she's not fed until Quaid improvises an instrument out of a milk bottle and a condom. She soils her wrap and Quaid curses while he washes the garment in an icy river.I don't think I'll go on with the plot. There's very little gore but an abundance of savagery and murder. And it all takes place on gravel roads wet streets and skies the color of dirty wool whipped by an frigid midwinter wind. It was mostly shot in Montenegro near the Albanian border.I was in Albania once  for about thirty seconds  but it was summer the skies were blue and the sun was warm. Nothing looked as dreary and unpromising as this. I was in Yugoslavia too when it was one nation and Tito was in power. There wasn't this sort of insanity going on because Tito would never have permitted it. All the rules seemed to be observed. When a wedding party and its band marched through the streets of Skopje nobody stepped off the sidewalk because a police officer would dash over and bang the miscreant's shins with his baton. Yugoslavia was a socialist dictatorship. Yet watching this one wonders which political arrangement is better. Maybe Thomas Hobbes was right. In some countries anyway a strong leader is required to keep the public from each others' throats. Maybe a certain level of political evolution is necessary before ethnic or regional allegiances can be subjugated to those of the nation itself. There is of course no guarantee. America had its own Civil War.At any rate I've never seen such a powerful antiwar statement before or any movie within the genre that's quite so original in so many ways. There SHOULD be a developing romance between Quaid and the woman he's trying to save  and there isn't. The woman herself should at least be saved  but that doesn't happen either.It's a film made for adults and you're likely to forget in a hurry or at least try to. Antiwar movies are supposed to end with the good guys winning. The audience should never have to leave the theater confused as they do here and rarely in movies like The Bridge on the River Kwai.".

	schema:text "    The film 2040 creates a dystopian future where the threat of deadly sexually transmitted infections leads people to rely on masturbation to pornography as their chief sexual outlet. The pornography they use features sex between humans and humanlike sex robots called anabots. The narrative focuses on a male porn star who falls in love with an advanced model anabot that develops selfawareness and human emotions. The article considers whether 2040 is correct in predicting a future filled with more sophisticated sex robots or whether advances in virtual reality will make sex robots obsolete. Scenes that dramatize sex between anabots and humans allow the film to comment on the role that technology in the forms of both pharmaceuticals and robotics plays in the satisfaction and creation of sexual desire as well as the nature of objectification.";

	schema:headline " Highquality scifi production values no longer feasible for new videos";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite some obvious flaws I greatly enjoyed Brad Armstrong's 2040 an ambitious scifi project that literally looks like a million bucks. Today's dwindling market for quality porn means we won't be seeing videos on this scale again.My biggest criticism stems from an overabundance of injokes out of place in an otherwise seriousmood film. In the first scene Barrett Blade oddly left out of the opening credits as a secondgeneration porn director name drops David Lords as his dad an allusion I found irritating cronyism when a mention of a late giant like Damiano or Spinelli would have sufficed. Similarly hero Randy Spears takes as an alias in the final reels the name of the reallife head of film's distributor Wicked Pictures. That stuff belongs in a backyard horror video shot in New Jersey.Selfreflexive premise is a future where a pandemic killed off much of Earth's population and sex is now relegated to beating off. Hence Armstrong's unconscious wish that Adult Entertainment would graduate to a lofty place in society needed as a stimulant for a world of wankkers purposely misspelled IMDb made that word illegal.Again under the heading of wish fulfillment Spears is one of a dying breed of veteran porn actors in the future who are seemingly the only humpers left in the world. As if to prove this point he has two impressive sex scenes in succession to kick off the movie resulting in two quality cum shots.Both are with androids something of a Wicked product placement for its line of sex dolls but also the subject of the show. Though finished film runs nearly 3 hours its storyline would do for a simple Twilight Zone episode summed up in the battle of our villain Caldwell played by Brad himself in the tradition of Erich von Stroheim's Man you love to hate casting vs. Morris should have been spelled Maurice but perhaps that's too erudite out of MerchantIvory land for me to expect from even talented pornographers the inventor of a new breed of android lady wellplayed by that talented Brit in Chatsworth land Marcus London.New model robot is played by star Alektra Blue who makes the entire movie work. She is fabulous in her sex scenes starts off rather than build up to anal sex has the best body in the business and manages to pull off a very tricky feat of convincing you she's a machine yet making you root for her as a sympathetic being. Brad's script has a hip allusion to Battlestar Galactica and Blue is more convincing than the players of Cylons in that classic series.Armstrong's biggest boner no pun this time is to adhere to company policy at the time demanding that fiction films and videos promote safe sex with condoms when in fact that crusade should have been relegated to PSAs. So we have the ridiculous spectacle of porn actors like Spears' character Ryan Spears humping androids with a condom on and routine robots played by the likes of Tommy Gunn and Mick Blue humping Alektra or a human like star Jessica Drake also with condoms on. Since Brad's script makes a big deal stated at least twice that the new improved androids have self cleaning technology built in that keeps them shipshape without even needing to towel off this nonsense of using condoms spoils the otherwise carefully built up credibility of the show's scifi content and trappings.Those trappings include excellent convincing lab sets for the fabrication and display of the androids some nice scale exterior scenes including a helicopter landing on a skyscraper heliport quality costuming and especially a lengthy allstar cast which alone must have cost big above the line bucks. Unlike a mammoth production like Pirates there is not the overkill of CGI and endless visual EFX but they aren't needed for this more practical story.Quality sex is delivered by Blue Drake Kaylani Lei Kirsten PriceMikayla Janet Mason and others. One quibble is leaving out some of the best sex scenes in particular a brief 4minute masturbation display by Alektra in a mirrored palace of a bathroom that is the best sex in the entire production DVD has 37 minutes of missing footage devoted to this plus some orgy material of little interest unless one has an orgy fetish.Beyond the impressive physical content I found Brad's resolution of his story both moving and quality storytelling again due to Alektra's collaboration.".

With additional work by writer William Bast The Valley Of Gwangi was approved by Kenneth Hyman of Seven Arts Inc which had financed Harryhausen's film with Raquel Welsh One Million Years B.C. and who had purchased into the Warner Brothers studio.Filming took place in Spain and lasted two years mostly due to the time needed by Harryhausen to animate the dinosaurs.  Given that the film employed over 300 animation shots the most of any Harryhausen film it was expected that release would not come until two years after principal photography had been completed.The extra time paid off in Harryhausen's best animation.  Adding enormously were the superior sound FX employed by Warner Brothers giving dinosaur voices far more menacing and believeable than those used by Columbia or Hammer attention to peripheral sound FX is also striking notably in the finale within the enormous cathedral where the echo of Gwangi's breathing and footsteps adds greatly to the drama.The human cast also works well notably star James Franciscus.  The story involves the efforts of a struggling wild west show in circa1900 Mexico. To boost attendance owner T.J. Breckenridge Gila Golan cast in the film as a favor to Ken Hyman has found a tiny horse  which turns out to be a prehistoric Eohippus and which comes from a Forbidden Valley filled with dinosaurs.  One is known as Gwangi a belligerent allosaur that after an extremely long chase that sidetracks to a bloody battle with a styracosaur is captured and put on display in T.J.'s show only to be set free and rampage through the nearby town.Harryhausen's animation is the film's highlight but the performances Erwin Hillier's cinematography and Jerome Moross' superb score all add up to an immensely enjoyable film.  It suffered though as Kenneth Hyman was let go during filming and new Warners management released the film without publicity and as part of a doublebill with a biker film thus missing the youthful audience that was the film's target.  The film was largely forgotten until cult attention in the 1980s and '90s elevated general interest and has made it a favorite of fantasy film buffs.".

	schema:headline " The Western fantasy film boosted by some Harryhausen genius.";
	schema:reviewBody "Shot in Technicolor by Erwin Hillier and in Dynamation The Valley Of Gwangi sees Tuck Kirby James Franciscus and a team of cowboys get more than they bargained for when they enter a hidden valley in Mexico. For here prehistoric creatures reside and the cowboys come up with the idea of capturing a Tyrannosaurus Rex to become the chief attraction in the circus they work at.The makers of Gwangi never hid their motivations or homages from the off they wanted to nod towards King Kong whilst pairing the Western and Fantasy genres in the process. The result of which is an enjoyable if unfulfilled movie that again sees Ray Harryhausen's stopmotion creations save the day. Directed by Jim O'Connolly with a screenplay by William Bast The Valley Of Gwangi suffers not because of its bonkers plot this is after all why we watch this type of genre offering but more because of the slow first half that threatens to put the viewer into torpor. Thankfully the film is saved by the afore mentioned Harryhausen who unleashes prehistoric joys on the B movie cast tho Laurence Naismith is considerably better than the material given him. While the ending raises the adrenaline sufficiently enough to have made the wait worth while. Jerome Moross lifts from his brilliant score for The Big Country with mixed results it just feels out of place here even if it's stirring and pleasing to the ears. And the Almera Andaluca location work in Spain is at one with the material to hand. Saturday afternoon monster fun to be enjoyed with either popcorn or something stronger from the drinks cupboard. 610".

The result of which is an enjoyable if unfulfilled movie that again sees Ray Harryhausen's stopmotion creations save the day. Directed by Jim O'Connolly with a screenplay by William Bast The Valley Of Gwangi suffers not because of its bonkers plot this is after all why we watch this type of genre offering but more because of the slow first half that threatens to put the viewer into torpor. Thankfully the film is saved by the afore mentioned Harryhausen who unleashes prehistoric joys on the B movie cast tho Laurence Naismith is considerably better than the material given him. While the ending raises the adrenaline sufficiently enough to have made the wait worth while. Jerome Moross lifts from his brilliant score for The Big Country with mixed results it just feels out of place here even if it's stirring and pleasing to the ears. And the Almera Andaluca location work in Spain is at one with the material to hand. Saturday afternoon monster fun to be enjoyed with either popcorn or something stronger from the drinks cupboard. 610";

To me as a kid it was the very best dinosaur film ever made. Effects may have improved since then but for my money there is still nothing to compare to the loving handwrought artistry of Ray Harryhausen. Most video guides and many of the imdb's commentators note that this was originally based upon a Willis O'Brien story. What few seem to notice is that O'Brien himself made a similar film called The Beast of Hollow Mountain' in 1956. The film is inferior in terms of story and surprisingly effects but it does hold the title of the first cowboy western.'As far as Gwangi is concerned however it follows the familiar psychotronicera theme of a monster as catalyst for resolving a romance on the rocks. Tuck Kirby requires the help of the big lizard to prove himself to TJ Breckinridge and rekindle their love. This is a fairly familiar dramatic tension the problem to be overcome is that of the hero's impotence and he does so by invoking the dread demons of femininity. The location of the forbidden valley' accessible only via a tight cave which must be blasted with dynamite to enter only takes the Freudian theme to extreme excesses. What is interesting in this context is the centrality of Lope' the Mexican orphan child. For Lope the tension appears to be whom to accept in the fatherrole the heroic but impotent Tuck the knowledgeable if foolish and at times seemingly pedophilic Professor or as all us young boys truly craved  Gwangi himself. The resolution of JamesGila's romance appears to imply a resolution to Lope's situation as well he is to be adopted into a newly formed familyunit returned to normalcy and rescued from the streets. The fact that the movie closes with the image of Lope crying at the monster's death tells what a tragedy this happy ending' really is.".

In practically every dinosaur movie I've ever seen there's always a point where a Tyrannosauruslike dino in this case an allosaurus matches up against a Triceratopslike animal. In this picture it was a Styracosaurus. It's probably because they were the largest of their kind and seemed like natural enemies although I don't even know if they lived during the same paleontological age. Is that even a word? Well this flick is entertaining enough on a number of levels. For one I don't think I've seen dinosaurs as colorful as this before. Usually they're a dark grayish color but someone maybe Harryhausen himself felt they should be various shades of purple and blue. Or was that a function of the Technicolor format? If you noticed Professor Bromley Laurence Naismith running around out in the desert his face and hands were red as a lobster I've never seen a sunburn that bright.While watching I was reminded of the 1949 movie Mighty Joe Young when the Mexican cowboys brought out their lassos and tried to hogtie the allosaurus. I'm sitting there thinking what would possess someone to believe they could actually do that with a real live dinosaur? Sure it looks cool but what self respecting dinosaur wouldn't just bite through the ropes and knock the pesky cowboys off of him just like Gwangi did here.Say here's another thought. I've probably seen and reviewed close to a thousand Westerns by now and you might loosely call this a Western but I've never seen a horse dive into an oversized pool before. So there's another reason to catch this flick. Seeing Gina Golan all wet is a bonus.So all in all this is a fun movie if you're up for it. James Franciscus and Ms. Golan make for an attractive on screen couple and the dynamation styled monsters looked and moved fairly realistically given the limitations of the technology back then.

They say intelligent things like nothing happened the first 50 minutes or the special effects don't compare to today or it looks corny. I have just one thing to say to these folks Please take a film class. Let me back up a bit for them...in the old days directors recognized the value of CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. That's why they introduced characters early in the film so you could emotionally connect to them. Those same directors also understood the value of SUSPENSE. They knew that sometimes it's more tense or scary to NOT see that thing that is after you especially at the beginning of the movie. Also since there was no CGI then they had to get creative when it came to how they finally DID show the monster. They would use lighting shadows fog and other props to slowly reveal the beast. It was truly amazing that they were able do so much with the technology they had. Let me say this about CGI It is OVERUSED in movies today. I don't want to know it is there. I want more character development. I want more suspense. I don't want unbelievability to the point of ludicrous. The best CGI is unnoticed by the viewer.2. Dinosaurs in the Wild West. Are you kidding me? What an original concept! It is so unlikely. How could primitive cowboys stand a chance? Well a Cowboys are tough and crafty and b real dinosaurs aren't like Godzilla. They were simply animals. Though formidable they could be roped and trapped. Again part of the genius of the movie. It is strangely believable.3. To this day I am impressed with how Harryhausen used both Stop Motion Animation and lifesize models together. The scene where Lupe is taken by the pterodactyl illustrates this point. When the beast is in the air it is stop motion how the heck did they used stop motion suspended in the air?. When it is on the ground it's a lifesize moving puppet. BTW Spielburg wanted pterodactyl's in JP but could't figure how to pull it off that is until the very good JP III. 4. In my book there are only two great humans vs. dinosaurs movies The Valley of Gwangi and Jurassic Park. They stand alone at the top.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Franciscus plays Tuck an amiable hustler who comes back into the life of T.J. lovely Gila Golan. T.J. is one of the participants in a Wild West show that is not doing so well at the moment. However one of their people Carlos Gustavo Rojo has ventured into a Mexican location known as the Forbidden Valley and come back with a prize an adorable Eohippus or miniature prehistoric horse. Circumstances lead Tuck and others to head into the valley where they encounter other ancient animals such as a Styracosaurus and a very aggressive Allosaurus.In the well loved tradition of King Kong T.J. and her friends including Champ Richard Carlson get the bright idea to introduce the Allosaurus  who gets christened Gwangi  to their show. Havoc predictably ensues.There may be viewers who will grow impatient with the pacing at first. The Valley of Gwangi runs longer than previous Ray Harryhausen  Charles H. Schneer productions at 96 minutes and it's not until the movies' second half that we get to see any dinosaurs. But the little Eohippus is sure to charm people not just children and the story is very engaging.It helps that the actors are so sincere. The handsome Franciscus is good in the starring role with fine support from Ms. Golan and Mr. Carlson. Young Curtis Arden is appealing in the role of Lope the child who had to fend for himself from an early age and who is clearly eager to make a buck. Freda Jackson is amusing in the somewhat annoying clichd role of the wise old doomsayer who rants about the consequences of individuals going into the valley and bringing back evil specimens.As expected Harryhausen's special effects are excellent. They're especially impressive in the movies' major set piece when Tuck Champ and others work overtime to try to lasso Gwangi. And once the action kicks into gear in this thing a real fever pitch is reached and then maintained until the absolute end with an exciting rampage.Mostly lighthearted entertainment but G ratings weren't always what they are now a few people do fall victim to the jaws and teeth of Gwangi.Very well directed by Jim O'Connolly Crooks and Coronets Tower of Evil.Seven out of 10.".

T.J. is one of the participants in a Wild West show that is not doing so well at the moment. However one of their people Carlos Gustavo Rojo has ventured into a Mexican location known as the Forbidden Valley and come back with a prize an adorable Eohippus or miniature prehistoric horse. Circumstances lead Tuck and others to head into the valley where they encounter other ancient animals such as a Styracosaurus and a very aggressive Allosaurus.In the well loved tradition of King Kong T.J. and her friends including Champ Richard Carlson get the bright idea to introduce the Allosaurus  who gets christened Gwangi  to their show. Havoc predictably ensues.There may be viewers who will grow impatient with the pacing at first. The Valley of Gwangi runs longer than previous Ray Harryhausen  Charles H. Schneer productions at 96 minutes and it's not until the movies' second half that we get to see any dinosaurs. But the little Eohippus is sure to charm people not just children and the story is very engaging.It helps that the actors are so sincere. The handsome Franciscus is good in the starring role with fine support from Ms. Golan and Mr. Carlson. Young Curtis Arden is appealing in the role of Lope the child who had to fend for himself from an early age and who is clearly eager to make a buck.

It is a shame that this film is not given much respect for being creative at the time of it release The Valley of Gwangi is one of the few films that truly original in terms of story mixing dinosaurs with Cowboys.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm racking my brain but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You gotta wonder why John Ford andor John Wayne never tried it! The plot  While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus TJ Breckenridge Gila Golan Tuck Kirby James Franciscus and the rest of the castcharacters enter a strange lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse but some other more fearsome creatures as well. Dinosaurs rule this place. Now wouldn't that be an attraction at TJ's circus  a caged TRex? It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie I just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie. There are some parts that I actually find almost unwatchable. For the first half of the movie there just doesn't seem to be much going on. I wasn't necessarily bored but I did want something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. To top it off the movie features a very contrived love story. It feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together. But The Valley of the Gwangi isn't a total waste. There are moments I really enjoyed. Who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a TRex. You just don't see stuff like that every day. Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive. There are some really cool shots of Harryhausen's miniatures interacting with people and horses. It might not represent the best of his work but the effects are very nice. Still at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate to do it I've got to rate The Valley of the Gwangi a 410.".

Lured into a cathedral  some fragment of metaphor fighting to make itself apparent and failing  the Allosaur stalks the principals and Franciscus no stranger to BMovie convention starts the inevitable fire for the finale.Out on the street the principals and crowd watch the subject of their wonder incinerate while we are left to discern the innumerable messages that might be purveyed by the subtext. Was it that humans must destroy what they cannot control? Was it that greed can only lead to destruction? Or dinner burn cathedral at 4000 degrees for half a day remove crispy dinosaur and baste with guilt  serves 1300 Mexicans. Or was it simply pioneering the metrosexual look with James Franciscus?...By now the ice cream is sloshy in the base of my bowl and I make slurping noises as I put it to my faceMovie Maniacs visit www.poffysmoviemania.com";

Gila Golan puts some fire into her role but James Franciscus is bland throughout.  The actress who portrays the fearsome gypsy Tia Zorina is probably the best of the cast actually.  By far the best aspect of this movie unsurprisingly is the stunning special effects work of Ray Harryhausen particularly the Eohippus the pterosaur and the GwangiElephant battle which is however not quite as good as the similar YmirElephant fight in Twenty Million Miles to Earth.  Harryhausen's best stopmotion creations have a fierce realism which the slick computerdriven effects of today can't quite match and this movie contains some of his finest work in my opinion.".

I guess he wasn't on much a run but DeadBang surprised me just how much fun this durable if offbeat pulp was. Predictable but bold and ultrafun law enforcement thriller. This was mainly due to Johnson's hardnosed performance. Looking bemused and rather scruffy with a very witty script to work with as there were some hilarious lines of banter. The highlight would have to be Johnson's vomit sequence on a suspect after an exhausting chase and the unorthodox methods in getting the job done. Jerry Beck is one burnt out L.A detective whose personal life is on the skids so he lives for his job. Looking on a case involving the murder of a convenient store owner and cop leads to something much bigger when he finds himself tailing a gang of murderous white supremacists to Colorado. In all it's dumb crude snappy and loud while containing white supremacists using automatic weapons but like a good Frankenheimer feature the violently hardhitting action was wellstaged wellframed with its camera angles and it moved at a fast clip. The story is taken from Beck's truelife exploits of his novel where we are taken for one hell of a ride as Frankenheimer really pushes it to the brink. When it came to showing off the film's firepower it's an outrageous assault and ballsy in its execution. William Forsythe can be just as amusing playing uptight than say crazy watch Out for Justice for that as the FBI agent who gets on the wrong side of Beck. Penelope Ann Miller also seems to walk onto set sweet talks Johnson and beds him to suddenly disappear. Was I missing something there? Quite an unnecessary subplot involving her character. Also making appearances are Bob Balaban Tate Donovan Mickey Jones Brad Sullivan the exchanges between him and Johnson were a treat You don't need a gun chief. Just tell them who you are.

Taking his Stubbs character to new heights or lows for that matter he plays the consummate 'burnout cop'. He has been given a solid script to work from professional direction by oldhand Frankenheimer and a good supporting cast including John Forsythe as his FBI partner.Supposedly based on the real life experiences of LA Det. Jerry Beck this is Johnson's only film where he proved to be more than an exercise in futility.QUOTE I got a splitting' headache I'm seeing double and. . .s!t! I think I'm gonna throw up again.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a specific brand of cop in film and on TV that apparently appeals to audiences. Typically he's alienated from his family because he's too dedicated to his job and consumes too much of his time doing it and not enough with them. Or debasing brutality has taken too big a chunk out of his consciousness for him to frequent the society of women and children. Generally he eats three meals of pizza or Chinese and drinks like a fish. The company he keeps does nothing for his lexicon. And the first thing everybody tells him is that he looks terrible. In Dead Bang Don Johnson plays this classic brand of cop to a tee.Has anyone ever made a movie about a good cop who is neurotically orderly? The one perhaps determining stroke contributed by Dead Bang is a scene in which the inebriated investigator heaves onto a suspect. His name is Beck and on Christmas Eve he's designated to probe the murder of another LA cop. He produces the name of a freshly paroled offender apparently affiliated with a disheveled band of white supremacists.There are a few rows and gunfights and a Fed overplayed by William Forsythe imposes himself. Also due to his wreckless ways which appear somewhat restrained relative to that of most movie cops Beck is ordered by the chief to obtain permission from a police shrink or be removed from the case. However since Michael Jeter's counselor resembles Woody Allen Beck breaks up and the doctor grows annoyed and the opportunity of remaining on the case seems remote that is till Beck has a very unclinical clearcut and inhospitable talk with the slightly built fellow.Near the beginning there's an unwanted detour in which Beck beds Penelope Ann Miller who unbeknownst to him was the wife of the murdered cop. But when he faces her with the information that's all and she never appears again. From then on out it's all boys and there is some inexplicably evocative dialogue in which Beck and his contemporaries talk about going through doors together. Beck says there's only one thing that counts Is there anyone who'd be afraid to go through a door with him? And later his police chief replies I want you to know that I'd go through a door with you anytime. Johnson's eyes look aloof but he's got some presence here doing the work and really deriving something appealing out of the formula. As the burdensome Gman Forsythe is the essence of trivialmindedness. At one point he looks at a shivering Beck with gravitas and says You didn't bring a coldweather coat? What's wrong with you? Also Bob Balaban as a whipped parole officer and Tim Reid as a local police chief give their roles some punch.However what the audience sees actually are a couple of whitesupremacist psychopaths with a fixation on racial purity and homemade apple tarts. Their main advocates are a handful of dimwitted Hell's Angels sorts who when they need funds raid the Mexican bar right next door kill everyone in it and then are astonished when the authorities appear. John Frankenheimer's control is tight enough but quite mechanical He sustains the action but doesn't furnish much character. Then again Robert Foster's script is speckled with crumbs of peculiarity practically all of them minor. Frankenheimer the director of three of the most sharply honed and deeply affecting conspiracy movies ever made is also responsible for some of the more negligible.".

This is a man carrying the world on his shoulders his private life has gone down the toilet and his job specification doesn't look any better.As the movie begins a black shopkeeper is gunned down money from the cash register is taken and the killer movies on the crime is reported the criminal is approached by a passing patrol car suspicions arise the policeman is also gunned down.Enter Detective Jerry Beck into a terrain waiting to explode into a world of hurt and anger a world covered in darkness run by a gang of white supremacists.An absolute classic from start to finish littered with some seriously good dialogue and acting. The two best scenes from the whole movie consist of the infamous chase sequence between Beck and and a possible suspect when Beck catches up with the runaway and then proceeds to throw up on him.....what absolute joy.The other scene in question has to be the one where Beck's hierarchy decide to question his mental capabilities so they decide to send him to see the local Psychiatrist when Beck starts to laugh and lets it be known that he thinks the man looks like Woody Allen what happens thereafter in the scene just has to be witnessed.Action Packed to the max 'Dead Bang is Dead On! without hesitation this movie gets 10 out of 10".

Without the foul words it could have been an episode of Miami Vice. Don Johnson plays an alcoholic down on his luck loose cannon on the deck cop chasing white supremists through the Southwest. Johnson is an intense hero even if he isn't likeable in some ways. Theres a wonderful scene where he throws a fit after talking to his exwife. Theres a good foot chase involving several car accidents as well. My favorite part though is the one where he threatens the police shrink he compares to Woody Allen.

Don Johnson stars as Jerry Beck apparently based on a real LAPD cop who begins to investigate the murder of a fellow officer. The investigation ends up taking him all over the US on the trail of white supremacists. The film is pretty gritty and realistic but suffers from a terrible Hollywood We blinded you with convenience ending. That aside there is much to like here from Johnson's antiCrockett cop to great supporting turns by William Forsythe and Bob Balaban to the witty script. And of course the aforementioned puke scene.

He also has some wicked shouting matches with his exwife who from the sounds of it is a mega word that rhymes with witch. Still it moves at a good pace just a movie though that really kind of ticks you off. I mean the wife ticked me off though I never saw her and that one agent did as well. Still it was a good cop movie seeing him track down the person or persons responsible. Don Johnson does a fairly good job in this one he is not the smooth cop he was in Miami Vice which I rather like. He is more human here and seems like a guy going through a very rough patch in his life. Despite all of his character flaws his main goal throughout the movie is getting his man.

Filmed with a mixture of varied cast this was a very good reflection of a real life story where Hollywood was not trying to create a sterile environment and the characters were normal every day people with real issues that were bouncing off of each other. Some of the story line was predictable with Don Johnson sticking to his Miami Vice sense of humour but with an ongoing turbulent divorce and a career dependent on a successful case the other actors did not make it easy for Jerry Beck when his alcoholism started effecting his professionalism. Throughout the film the villains are always one step ahead with White supremacy and antisocial behavioural traits quite accurate to life situations and personal beliefsincluding religious denominations of cult Christianity creating a network of deceit. Set in a big city leading across small towns across USA brings out the sinister nature of true organised crime and involves the police FBI and local sheriff's departments working with Don Johnson's Homocide department in an inhibitory way until a crack unit enforces his efforts. Conflicts throughout were personal and not exaggerated and understandably psychological and contextualised accurately.".

The coolest thing about this movie was how it foreshadowed actual crime events that would happen later at places like Ruby Ridge and Mt. Carmel. And of course it was hilarious to see Johnson get to reprise his tough guy problem child Sonny Crocket type role. My favorite scene was when he enlists the straightlaced probation officer to serve in lieu of a warrant. Hilarious trick  made me wonder if that really works in real life. And the puking ruled. The one downer in this movie is that the gun fighting scenes were not produced well enough to convey the true sense of fear and danger and the tactics employed made them look more like actors than gunfighters. This is usually the sign of a limited budget which this movie probably had.".

Yesyou read right her name is really Evans Evans and she was married to JF for 39 years as well as being a terrific character actress mainly through the 1960s and 1970s. There are many other cast surprises in what is a surprisingly grippingly tense and efficient thriller. This is a great Frankenheimer film right up there with his best. I cannot speak too highly about Don Johnson and the Nazi villain of the piece. They give this film both tension and comic relief in what are beautifully measured performances. This is an 80s classic by one of cinema's great directors.".

Yet there is no big mobilization of the LA police force to catch the killer just Beck going after him alone. In every other movie I've ever seen and pretty much in real life if a cop is killed in cold blood like this character was every cop is going to be after the killer.Then when the rural OK sheriff's cars are shot up with automatic weapons and the downtown is blown up in a huge shootout with the bad guys again noone really seems to interested. Not the LA police force not the FBI that much. Usually these kind of egregious acts of violence get pretty big play in the media and with law enforcement types. So that whole premise was rather hard to swallow although it says it's based on a true story.Interesting cameo by the porno star Ron Jeremy as one of the bikers.

	schema:reviewBody "While most critics and fans alike consider Harryhausen's Jason and the Argonauts released two years later to be the apex of the special effects master's career Mysterious Island stands as one of his best also. Loosely based on the Jules Verne 19th century novel the film boasts some memorable special effects wizardry an awesome escape from a Confederate prison via balloon the giant crab the prehistoric chicken the bees and a cool Nautilus  closely resembling Disney's version from 20000 Leagues Under the Sea. The cast is good beginning with Michael Craig as the leader of the band of island dwellers. Gary Merrill who at once was the husband of legend Bette Davis as well as her costar in All About Eve is effective as the war correspondent that serves as the voice of reason among the band along with being the group's cook. Herbert Lom does a great Nemo significantly different from James Mason's interpretation in the Disney classic. English actress Joan Greenwood is appropriately aristocratic as Lady Fairchild. But it is Harryhausen's effects along with Bernard Herrmann's brilliant score that elevate this to one of the best fantasies of the 60's.Filmed at a brisk pace the story never lets up keeping the viewer captivated until the thrilling conclusion.".

I don't know if Island topped Sinbad but I loved both of those films in equal amounts. How about the musical score of Bernard Hermann....right from the start that pounding intense musical score you knew this film would be so good. Loved the scenes of the escape from the confederate prison camp and the photography of the 4 men who fought with all they had to stay tucked inside the hot air balloon as it blew out of control over uncharted territories. Landing on an uncharted island they became a Robinson Crusoe foursome and set up a camp and foraged for food. How lucky they were to stumble onto a giant and I mean giant rock lobster to feed the men for weeks and a giant bird who supplied a tasty bird dinner. Also two saucy women shipwrecked to add spice to the film as they provided companionship and love for one of the men. Throw in pirates a floating trunk of weapons monsters to fight a cave hidden in a mountain giant bees the discovery of Captain Nemo and his hidden nautilus submarine anchored in the cave while he plotted a new scheme to provide food for mankind with experiments that produced the giant creatures you were thoroughly entertained for two hours. Then check out the underwater scenes with the fight from a giant squid reminiscent of the Disney classic Twenty Thousand leagues under the Sea and home made sea shell aqua lungs to breathe under water.....wow! I just loved this film as a kid and now at age 60 I still love this film and watch it a few times a year on DVD. Believe it or not the first time I saw this film as a kid was in 1963 at a Saturday afternoon matine along with Seventh Voyage of Sinbad...my brother and I were mesermized by two such great films. The great English actor Percy Herbert with an accent as a captured confederate prisoner was a gem. Gary Merrill as a union war correspo dent plays the role of the so called cook in the film with his goofy shenanigans....Herbert Lom another underrated English actor with a stellar performance as Captain Nemo. Michael Craig as the captain of the so called crew with a tough disposition to follow as the leader of the group. Great entertainment for all ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harryhausen crossed Jules Verne with King Kong in his version of Mysterious Island giving the author's Civil War castaways something really mysterious to look at for a change. The result is a Skull Islandstyle adventure with a nifty 19th century setup and one of the stopmotion maestro's most satisfying films. Harryhausen movies are at their best when Harryhausen is unabashedly the staras he is here in Mysterious Island. From this highwater mark in the early Sixties Harryhausen's films slowly began to shipwreck on two constantly reiterated moviemaking clichs. First writers began to tell Harryhausen that his effects ought to be better integrated into the overall plot that they ought not to be isolated set pieces sprinkled through the picture like plums in a fruitcake. Secondly critics continued to repeat the old film music legend that movie scoring is best when it fades unnoticed into the background. Both of these old saws were in fact horrible lies. And Mysterious Island is great because Harryhausen and his composer were still refusing to take any notice of them. The effects sequences in Mysterious Island aren't plums in a fruitcake they're solos in a symphony they're like the soliloquies in Shakespeare. And Bernard Herrmann's scoring for these episodes is in your faceas it should be. It jumps up and screams THIS IS A SETPIECEAND A GREAT ONE. KICK BACK AND ENJOY IT! And this once again is as it should be. The truth is that stopmotion isn't an effects technique. It's an art form. If you can't enjoy it for it's own sake then you can't enjoy it. Every attempt Harryhausen later made to integrate his stuff just encouraged people to take it seriouslyas a serious attempt that is to duplicate reality. Which it isn't. We go to a Harryhausen film for Harryhausen just as we go to a Chaplin film for Chaplin. If you came in for some other reason then you picked the wrong movie. That said Mysterious Island really does work I think as a 60s Jules Verne picture. The period atmosphere is some of the best in any of those movies and the interesting Nautilus variation we see here is fun to look at in its own right. The acting is quite good also and Cy Endfield is one of the better Harryhausen directors. But the Verne elements are really just the frame around the picture. Like I said go for Ray's monstersthen go out and tell the world.".

Harryhausen's stopmotion creatures are breathtaking and movie is overall beautiful to see very imaginative managing to walk a fine line between the fantastic and the realistic with just enough artifice in some of the exterior shots to make it seem larger than life but not so much as to come off as contrived.

We are introduced to the dress like this our heroes escaped POWs are stranded on a desert island filled with gigantic animals. At some point two women aunt and niece if I recall wash onto shore after surving a ship accident. The aunt decides to make her niece a new dress because her old one is all torn up. So she constructs a dress out of leather and HOLY ! what a dress! I don't fully understand why she would make a dress like that being from the conservative 1860's Midwest and all but it is the most erotic dress I have ever seen. It's so tiny and skintight it looks like she can't bend over or it would explode into a million pieces. I spent the entire movie leaning forward in rapt attention because it honestly looks like it is going to tear apart at any moment. Wow!The rest of the movie is pretty good too. The special effects are wonderfully fun. The only really annoying thing is the stupidity of the characters. Case in point after encountering a giant crab and a giant chicken a guy and the girl still looking great in that dress! wander into a cave and see giant honeycomb. Hmm interesting they say. Then they hear this buzzing sound and wonder what it is. What's that buzzing noise?? It's getting closer... I don't believe it is humanly possible to be that stupid. It's GIANT BEES you idiots! Get out of there! Oops too late. Now a colossal bee is cornering you. Didn't see that one coming huh?Worth watching for the FX and the dress.810 stars.".

I spent the entire movie leaning forward in rapt attention because it honestly looks like it is going to tear apart at any moment. Wow!The rest of the movie is pretty good too. The special effects are wonderfully fun. The only really annoying thing is the stupidity of the characters. Case in point after encountering a giant crab and a giant chicken a guy and the girl still looking great in that dress! wander into a cave and see giant honeycomb. Hmm interesting they say. Then they hear this buzzing sound and wonder what it is. What's that buzzing noise?? It's getting closer... I don't believe it is humanly possible to be that stupid. It's GIANT BEES you idiots! Get out of there! Oops too late. Now a colossal bee is cornering you. Didn't see that one coming huh?Worth watching for the FX and the dress.810 stars.";

While Journey to the Center of the Earth was absolutely magical Mysterious Island is explosive and dynamic.  The magic is on hand with wondrous shots and music to go along with the island's flora and fauna.  The movie is also extremely charismatic.  Michael Craig is too good to be true as the lead Captain Cyrus Harding but he has a hard edge that gets respect.  The supporting players especially Gary Merrill and Percy Herbert more then pull their weight.  Merrill's role reminds me a little of Dr. Smith from Lost in Space and Percy Herbert is a gas as Pentcroft.  Neb's character is treated like one of the gang although I believe that Union regiments in the Civil War were either all white or all black so it is somewhat unrealistic.  Indeed how the character's mix together for the good of all is a hallmark of the movie.  The strengthening of Michael Callan's character seems to be a major plot point but it gets lost along the way and is moot when Nemo shows up. Beth Rogan is sexy as Elena and the Lady Mary Faichild character  I can't remember the actresses' name shoots the movie full of musky female intensity.  The special effects are brilliant and I hate to keep harping on it blow away the movie within a movie digital nonsense of today.  The bees are worth the price of admission alone and the movements of the crab are top notch.  When Nemo arrives the movie gets so political that I feel that I'm back in college.  Herbert Lom is a little too snitty for me as Nemo but he's a cool guy and is great in other things so I accept him.  The music is absolutely awesome and is one of my favorite musical scores of all time. A grossly underrated movie overall that is clearly meant to manipulate at the end.  Along with Journey to the Center of the Earth this movie would look incredible back on the big screen.".

There is a skeleton in the film but alas Harryhausen does not make it come to life. You will have to see Schneer's Seventh Voyage Of Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts for more on that.The cast including Michael Craig Joan Greenwood and a very acrobatic Michael Callan does a wonderful job of keeping their characters interesting and keeping the story flowing. Then in the last quarter of the film we get Captain Nemo played to perfection by Herbert Lom. Lom's cold and concise delivery is amazing. You can feel his inner tension as he explains the present situation to the other castaways. The volcano on the island is erupting and they must race against nature to get off the island in time.If you have a young son from ten to teens this is a great flick to show them along with the other two that I mentioned.

The uncontrollable wind takes the balloon to a mysterious island in the South Pacific in the area of New Zealand. Captain Harding selfproclaims the leader of the group and they look for food sooner they discover that they are stranded in an island. Further they are attacked by a giant crab that becomes their first meal. Along the days they build a shelter and finds that the island is inhabited by giant animals. A couple of days later they find two castaways on the beach the aristocratic Lady Mary Fairchild Joan Greenwood and her sexy niece Elena Beth Rogan. Later they find a trunk with weapons and instruments like sextant and shelter with a journal of a man left alone in the island by pirates. When the pirate vessel arrives in the island they are helped by Captain Nemo Herbert Lom of the Nautilus a submarine that had supposedly sunk in the coast of Mexico eight years ago. Nemo is famous as the man that tried to end strike among man. When the volcano begins activity they need to leave the island to save their lives.Mysterious Island is a fantastic and enjoyable adventure from the 60's that recall many films that I used to see in my childhood. The naive story has great special effects for a movie of almost fifty years ago excellent music score and still is a wonderful family entertainment. While watching this movie the costume of the sexy Ms. Beth Rogan called my attention and I glanced in a review an humorous comment from an IMDb User about the dress of this actress. Unfortunately in the modern world of satellites and communication there are no more space for movies about lost worlds maybe the exceptions are the TV series Lost and M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. Mysterious Island is a highly recommended voyage to not only a lost world but also to a time that has gone by. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Ilha Misteriosa The Mysterious Island".

	schema:headline " A beautiful and exciting trip.";
	schema:reviewBody "A Jules Verne novel only serves as the starting point for this cinematic adaptation which throws in women and some oversized creatures. Following the eyestraining opening credits Craig plays a Union Captain during the Civil War who along with a few others manages to escape a Confederate prison during a battle and a hellacious storm. The five men ride in a hot air balloon for days and days until they make a memorably eventful landing on an unknown island. Before they can even properly set up camp they discover that this is no ordinary hunk of land as a gigantic crab tries to make lunch out of them. Not long after their arrival a ship is sunk off the coast of the island and two British women are washed ashore. The seven castaways then work towards making life bearable on the remarkable island while building a boat to get them back to civilization which is close to twothousand miles away! They continuously find themselves being aided by some sort of mysterious benefactor as they struggle to survive against giant birds and bees. Craig is a heroic if somewhat bland leading man. Merrill having already survived ten years of marriage to Bette Davis adds a bit of weight to the film with his wry portrayal. Callan as the youth of the group is charming but often idiotic and clumsy. Unable to shake off his Gidget Goes Hawaiian pompadour he is clearly on hand to satisfy the teen set. Eventually he winds up in some amusingly abbreviated shorts! Greenwood as a haughty Englishwoman gives the most deliriously hysterical though sincere line readings imaginable! Her impossibly low and austere voice gives her uppity dialogue an inimitable life of it's own. Fans of this noted stage and screen actress probably never thought they'd see the day that she tried to kill an oversized chicken with the butt of a rifle. Rogan plays her pretty niece and in the most flagrantly anachronistic detail of all Greenwood fashions a skimpy goatskin minidress for her to trot around in. Rogan and Callan almost become an ersatz Adam and Eve in this new Wonderland. Lom appears late in the game as an authoritative and inventive Captain Nemo. If one can ignore the many illogical and absurd story points this is a delightful and eyefilling adventure. The settings both the real ones and the matte paintings are attractive and the stopmotion special effects are top of the line. Even though by now the audience is in on the tricks of the process there is still a great deal of tension and suspense as these hapless folks go up against a monstrouslylarge clicking crab or a massive honey bee. The entire film is aided as well by the sweeping and multifaceted score by Bernard Herrman. Certain events in the film take their time to occur so some viewers with short attention spans may be itching to move on. However this is a great example of the wonderful nonthink adventure film which strives only to present the eyes with some unusual and memorable imagery. It's influence can be seen even in such recent projects as the television series Lost.".

Directed by Cy Endfield with Ray Harryhausen working his stop motion genius for the creatures it stars Michael Craig Joan Greenwood Michael Callan Gary Merrill Herbert Lom Beth Rogan Percy Herbert  Dan Jackson. Bernard Herrmann provides the score. The plot sees three Union soldiers escaping in a gas balloon from a Confederate prison camp during the American Civil War. Also caught up in the escape is a Confederate rebel and a newspaperman. As they battle the elements they are forced to crash land on some island they think is in the Pacific. Here they encounter giant animals that threaten their survival. Soon two ladies are shipwrecked onto the island too but the strange animals are not the only thing to worry about the island volcano is close to eruption and they appear to not be the only humans on the island?Tho something of a lesser light in the pantheon of fantasy adventure films Mysterious Island in spite of its flaws is rather good fun. Dramatically it's OK with the creatures particularly memorable but those in search of a science story befitting Jules Verne are in for a let down tho some small science interest does come in the last quarter. This is an out and out desert island survival movie with some Harryhausen kickers. There's a nice group dynamic as soldiers from opposing sides are forced to come together to survive. While the arrival of posh stock ladies throws up a class distinction issue that is nice if not fully exploited. There's the usual clichs of course and as much as I enjoyed it as a red blooded man did they really need to make Beth Rogan's newly made island dress the shortest in the land? And true enough some of the matte paintings and effects have aged better in our childhood memories than actually on the print of the film. It's nicely photographed by Wilkie Cooper in Eastman Color using the SuperDynamation process but the film also suffers in parts for the restoration. For the prints that exist on DVD now are beset by spotting fading and scratches. While of course the resolution now shows the flaws of the source material that were once never evident.Still this is a must have film for fantasy adventure enthusiasts.Yes as with many Harryhausen based movies the action sequences involving his creations light up an episodic picture. But with giant animals intent on eating our survivors a Vernian turn of events in the last quarter Herrmann's brilliant bombastic score and Rogan's dress! Who cares about routine narrative eh? 710".

	schema:reviewBody "There are a handful of fantasyscifi films from the late 1950s and 1960s that stand out from all the rest. Mysterious Island is one of them. I place this film in the same box with movies like Jason and the Argonauts The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad and in some respects Journey to the Center of the Earth. They are all stories of adventure with exotic locations and seemingly impossible odds against the characters in their fight for survival. Each has their share of villans and heroes but the common mission of each story it to get out alive.There is one very important element shared by all these movies. The film scores were composed by Bernard Herrmann and all done in his usual excellent manner. Whether it is his using creepy bass woodwinds for the monster sequences or beautiful harp arpeggios to support scenes of mystery Herrmann was one of the greatest film composers and his style was definitely unique. Those who are interested in his music may be surprised that he wrote a complete cantata Moby Dick a complete opera Wuthering Heights and a complete Symphony along with shorter orchestral pieces. If you love his work I suggest that you research these pieces.Anyway back to the island. Her we have 2 British women one AfricanAmerican soldier a war correspondent 3 union soldiers and one confederate soldier  not exactly your perfect desert island party.In these days of reality TV where people are voted off the island in survivortype shows It is refreshing to see a film where people work together to plan their escape. Enemies in battle become friends upperclass British women forget their differences with the lower class Americans and sidebyside fight for their survival.The movie is fun full of action and there is never a dull moment in its 100 minute running time. It is a perfect family film.Now it's Soap Box Time. This relates to film technology in general and perhaps this film in particular. Each decade film technology improves. The movies of this decade are more advanced technologically then the movies of the 1980s the 1970s and so on to the beginning of the motion picture industry the late 1800s.  In each decade that we go back in time the movies are considered techinically inferior in quality to current films. Each movie is state of the art for the time that it was filmed. Well believe it or not someone will likely review a film like The Matrix in the year 2020 and say something like the special effects were really fake and cheesy. That's the way that things go.I think it's time for movie viewers who love old movies to stop apologizing for them by saying things like It had great special effects for its time or I guess it doesn't stack up to todays special effects but I still like it.Do you ever hear people say Citizen Kane should have been filmed in color or The music in Casablanca was too schmaltzy or Gone with the Wind was too long?I guess I've made my point. I watched this movie tonight with all the wonder of when I first saw it at age 5 or 6. Of course I noted things technically that I would never have seen as a child. You know what? I didn't care. The movie was fun.Quality will endure and a story that is well told with great imagination will always capture my attention.So at the risk of sounding redundant I LOVE THAT GIANT CHICKEN!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Longtime collaborators of scifi adventure films of the 50's and 60's producer Charles H. Schneer and special effects artist Ray Harryhausen are together again here for Mysterious Island. Harryhausen renowned for his Dynamation process of stopmotion special effects turns to giant birds and crustaceans in this film but no dinosaurs although the original script did call for some. Several changes were made right up until filming with one having the island as a link to the lost continent of Atlantis. Another change involved the character Tom Ayerton. In the novel The Mysterious Island by Jules Vern the character Thomas Ayrton is found living on the island where he had been abandoned after appearing in another Jules Verne novel called The Children of Captain Grant where as the former quartermaster of the ship Britana he hatched a treacherous plot to seize control of the Duncan. the character of Thomas Ayrton was to have been included here as Tom Ayerton with some other changes. He was a man abandoned on the island and who turned green from eating strange poisonous mushrooms. The green man was to have been played appropriately so by actor Nigel Green who was cast in the role but the character was eliminated from the final script before scenes were shot. Nigel Green's name remained in the credits although no footage was actually filmed. The only reference to the character in the film is some bones the castaways find in a cave. This adaptation of the Verne story is by screenwriters John Prible who would go on to write the story Zulu Daniel B. Ullman who was a screenwriter of Bwesterns and would go on to television screenplays and Crane Wilber who was both a writer and director. Cy Endfield who would direct the acclaimed film epic Zulu is this film's director. Noted cinematographer Willie Cooper who worked on The 7 Voyages of Sinbad Jason and the Argonauts First Men on the Moon and One Million Years B.c. is the film's photographer. A balloon carrying three escaped Union prisoners from the Civil War a Confederate guard and a yellow journalist is carried adrift in a storm and eventually lands far out in the Pacific on a remote island. They are soon joined by two women from a ship that has sank and so with seven castaways we have the original Gilligan's Island. The younger of the two women abandons her Victorian era modesty and cavorts the island in a sexy homemade leather minidress that would predate Raquel Welch's wardrobe in One Million Years B.C. Also showing up on the island is Captain Nemo and his submarine from Verne's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea. He's been busy experimenting with animal growth to help feed the growing world's population. He's a nice guy Nemo this time around and comes in handy for the illfated castaways. Americans Gary Merrill Michael Callan and Dan Jackson are among the British cast including Michael Craig Percy Herbert Beth Rogan and Joan Greenwood and Czechborn actor Herbert Lom. This is an entertaining movie and I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.".

In what is described as the greatest storm in American history this balloon is blown WAAAAAAAAAAAAY off course and they land on an island they later learn is 1000 miles from New Zealand. And what a place with all kinds of giant creatures crabs bees and even a giant chicken all brought to life by Ray Harryhausen with some of his best work.The man responsible for all this is Captain Nemo late of the Nautilus which it turns out was not sunk as written by Verne in 20000 Leagues Under The Sea but rather limped into its home base by Herbert Lom in a measured and calculated performance. Nemo has reassessed his life and now thinks that instead of blowing up the ships of war from every nation he should work toward providing abundance for man. Hence he pioneers organic food and that giant wildlife is part of the experiment.Two women also are shipwrecked as well Beth Rogan and her aunt Joan Greenwood. Michael Craig and Michael Callan are Union soldiers Percy Herbert who usually plays cockney characters didn't quite get the southern accent down for the Rebel hitchhiker and Gary Merrill is the war correspondent whose got the best lines and the best story in history and no way to report it out.All the human players however pale in comparison to Ray Harryhausen's animation monsters. Mysterious Island which while not a faithful telling of Verne's story is still good entertainment as good as I remember it at 14 seeing it in the theater.".

Michael Craig and Michael Callan are Union soldiers Percy Herbert who usually plays cockney characters didn't quite get the southern accent down for the Rebel hitchhiker and Gary Merrill is the war correspondent whose got the best lines and the best story in history and no way to report it out.All the human players however pale in comparison to Ray Harryhausen's animation monsters. Mysterious Island which while not a faithful telling of Verne's story is still good entertainment as good as I remember it at 14 seeing it in the theater.";

It becomes cataloged in my brain as 'awesome' 'pretty good' 'worst.movie.ever.' or a host of other standard issue classifications.Not so with 'I Am Legend.' I can't recall the last time I was this frustrated by a movie.It had so much potential to be so great and then just fell apart in the last third of the movie with every summer blockbusterzombie movie clich known to man run one after the other.The movie creates a fantastic atmosphere of postapocalyptic New York and requires your patience as Will Smith's character begins to unravel as the monsters around him begin to become more aggressive and intelligent. Before heading out to see the movie I did some research on the book the movie is based on and the reason it is such a well known classic story is because of the twists perspectives and grim ending. What you find out towards the book is that Neville really is the last man on Earth and the rest of society are now these zombievampires and Neville's ability to walk around in the daylight and kill them has basically made him the monster. He is the one feared by them he is the villain and they will stop at nothing to eradicate this day walker who preys on them.Keeping that in mind I was super impressed by how the movie seemed to be heading in that direction with that head Zombie guy's heated animosity towards Neville as if it were personal and perhaps the zombie Neville captured were his significant other thus lending the zombies an actual 'society and not merely 'meee hungry for flesh.' The movie basically went right down the tubes when Will Smith decided after he had to kill his dog that he was going to go on a suicide mission at the docks playing Destruction Derby with his Explorer. All of the haunting edgeofyourseat suspense and fear created brilliantly with the scene in the abandoned bank and with the zombie dogs clamoring for the last sliver of daylight to cede and creepy subtle atmospheric effects throughout went right out the darn window and we suddenly found ourselves in '28 Days Later.' With some random chick coming out of nowhere to somehow scare off 100 angry zombies who had just blown his UV truck to hell mind you but apparently she had outfitted a better one than an incredibly resourceful Military SoldierScientist carry Will Smith who weighs twice as much as her into her car and somehow drive them to safety.So we find ourselves in an incredibly uncomfortable scenario with the Brazilian chick and her creepy Columbine son and some Bob Marley metaphors laid on top of terrible dialog. Then instead of a suspenseridden inthedark atmospheric climax with heavy breathing flashes of gore heart pounding scene we're left with cheesy CG explosions zombies body slamming people no one keeping a gun on them when there's about 50 scattered across the house and other usual stupid horroraction movie misssteps.We finally find ourselves with Neville back against the wall Zombie leader separated from Smith's neck by a rapidly deteriorating inch of glass and I'm hoping the movie will be somehow salvaged with a great twist a grim conclusion or at worst a convoluted piece of foreshadowing from the first twenty minutes of the movie being pulled out of the scriptwriters pie hole to be played out here. I personally thought he could have awakened the zombie girl he was curing and seen if the reaction of the intelligent zombie would have caused a reaction or if some communication could have been made between Neville and his antagonist who at this point we've come to realize is moderately intelligent. I'm an idiot for expecting anything but 'yo hide in the chimney while i blow myself up.' Don't even get me started on the Utopian Vermont safehaven seriously. You're going to tell me 1 million zombies couldn't overrun some 20 foot walls spanning what would approximate 2 miles of land? Christ. I could have written a better ending in 20 minutes on the back of a cocktail napkin.".

This time the seemingly sole survivor of the worldwide pandemic Robert Neville is played by Will Smith who is an actor with real charisma and charm and considerable box office appeal who has beefed himself up for the role.The main strength of this version is the location shots in a deserted New York City a move from the Los Angeles of the book and earlier films and although the filming of these scenes apparently caused traffic chaos and much anger for local residents they chillingly set the tone for this dystopian thriller. To see the silent streets around Times Square or South Street Seaport or the lone scientist fishing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or playing golf on the USS Intrepid is to view this heaving metropolis as we have never experienced it before. The German shepherd dog who is Neville's sole companion deserves an honourable mention for showing greater thespian skills than most of the extras and stunt men.The principal weakness of the movie however is the realisation of the surviving victims of the virus. The CGI characters are almost as silly as they are scary but above all they are presented as more animalistic than human. The Omega Man handled these characters much better presenting them as sad as well as scary. The other serious fault is the lack of clarity in the narrative  at times it is simply unclear what is happening and why and a longer director's cut would be welcome. Finally the references to Ground Zero and God may play well with American audiences but will not be so resonant to audiences elsewhere in the world.".

Here the megastar who can do no wrong plays the last man on earth SPOILER HE'S NOT! after a nasty virus wipes out the world population and leaves behind some infected sourpusses in the vein of 28 Days Later. This movie has all the key ingredients for a Will Smith box office behemoth which no doubt it will be but fails to engage on any higher level. Here's the recipe1. Will Smith playing Will Smith No other movie star can be such an egotistical showoff and get away with it as well as Will Smith does. No matter how many times we see him do his funny little bits show off his buff bod or watch him stretch his acting muscle with an unnecessary emotional breakdown scene the audience still loves him. He carries I Am Legend and makes it watchable even when he starts doing a Shrek impersonation don't ask or carries on conversations with mannequins think Tom Hanks and Wilson the volleyball from Cast Away.2. A futuristic setting The set designers do a fantastic job here with a postapocalyptic New York tableau that is expansive and eerie and will leave you wondering How in blue blazes did they film that? Sadly the special effects team and creature designers didn't do a complimentary job. The zombievampirewhateverthehecktheyare monsters look like something from a second rate video game circa 1999. Given the PG13 rating they are only allowed a moderate amount of fun. Gore hounds and horror buffs will be greatly disappointed. Scifi fans will also be angered that after a decent setup the film devolves into a preachy messianic familyfriendly deathfetish film.3. A kickass dog Remember how everyone rooted for that dog from Independence Day? Well this German Sheperd named Sam puts that dog to shame. However you know there's a problem when the dog becomes the most dynamic and sympathetic character in a film. I won't carelessly give away what happens to Sam in any explicit detail but suffice it to say when two noncharacters named Anna and Ethan show up in the film's final moments you'll be wishing Sam was there to keep it real.I Am Legend offers nothing new but is diverting enough as a matine. In its depiction of a man and a dog in a postapocalyptic city it scores as populist entertainment. As a monster movie it's a joke. As some sort of endoftheworld message film it's abhorrent. But with Will Smith headlining expect it to be the biggest hit of the holiday season.".

	schema:headline " Legendarily Lame Science Fiction Remake!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel I Am Legend successfully for the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version the Italianlensed The Last Man on Earth 1964 ranked as an austere but depressing widescreen black  white epic with vampirezombies as our hero's antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist Robert Morgan with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Fullframe copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Notsurprisingly Price perished in the end.Charlton Heston retooled the role for the 1971 remake The Omega Man released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny barechested romantic action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch The Omega Man and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from The 10 Commandments and BenHur to the role. Along the way Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial bigscreen romances with AfricanAmerican actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed nonvampiric mutants led by Matthias Anthony Zerbe triumphed over him and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least welldone version I Am Legend which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action herovirologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a bigscreen television.

He watches old television shows that he has recorded before the apocalypse while he eats. The mutants themselves are not very interesting. In Last Man on Earth the mutants were vampirezombies that besieged the hero's house at night. In The Omega Man the villains were the equivalent of albino Klansmen that terrorized the streets after dark and clashed constantly with Neville.Like the previous versions I Am Legend delivers a dour downbeat ending that will bum you out beyond belief. The special effects are shoddy and superficial the villains emerge as a mob of onedimensional headbanging morons and the hero degenerates into an ignoble unsympathetic atheistic lout. There is nothing exciting or suspenseful about our hero's latenight encounter with the mutants on the docks where he uses his SUV as a weapon to smash them. Even more implausible is the way that he gets out of this cliffhanger confrontation. Constantine director Francis Lawrence provides several startling gotchabythegullet scare scenes that will frighten the squeamish but seasoned gorehounds won't find anything different or dazzling about this drivel.Will Smith's track record with science fiction is faltering badly these days. I Am Legend is nowhere near as memorable or entertaining as either Independence Day or his Men in Black movies. Instead I Am Legend is legendarily lame!".

	onyx:emotionText "Hollywood has never had much luck adapting science fiction author Richard Matheson's cult 1954 novel I Am Legend successfully for the screen. Iconic horror movie star Vincent Price headlined the first version the Italianlensed The Last Man on Earth 1964 ranked as an austere but depressing widescreen black  white epic with vampirezombies as our hero's antagonists. Call them zompires! Price impersonated a valiant scientist Robert Morgan with an acquired immunity to a deadly virus that had devastated mankind. Morgan struggled desperately not only to survive acute loneliness but also to cure the survivors. Fullframe copies of this opus are available everywhere in DVD bargain box sets. Notsurprisingly Price perished in the end.Charlton Heston retooled the role for the 1971 remake The Omega Man released by Warner Brothers. Heston turned immunologist Robert Neville into a brawny barechested romantic action stud hero who cavorted in a blue flight suit with a dress uniform cap complete with scrambled eggs on the visor. Watch The Omega Man and see if Neville doesn't resemble a Marvel Comics character. Naturally Heston brought the messianic allure that he had gained from The 10 Commandments and BenHur to the role. Along the way Heston's Neville indulged in one of the first interracial bigscreen romances with AfricanAmerican actress Rosalind Cash. An army of heavily robed nonvampiric mutants led by Matthias Anthony Zerbe triumphed over him and he died tragically as a misunderstood Christ figure.Will Smith fares even worse in the third and least welldone version I Am Legend which finally uses the original title of Matheson's novel. Essentially Smith imitates the Heston hero as a weapons reliant action herovirologist. They differ in how they contend with loneliness. Heston played chess with a bust of Julius Caesar and fed images of himself via a surveillance camera onto a bigscreen television. Smith's Neville dresses up mannequins at a local video rental store and converses with them when he selects a movie. Unlike both Price and Heston Smith doesn't enjoy a postapocalyptic romance. Instead of female companionship Smith has to settle for a German shepherd canine lovers are warned ahead of time to expect the worst.

So I saw I Am Legend tonite with my boyfriend now after the movie we just looked at each other and had that disappointed look and then the audience just looked around and just walked out grunting and I heard nothing but that was a waste of money. That's definitely not a good thing. I think the problem was definitely the script the story was not explained well as well as the character development needed improvement. The way that I Am Legend was shot very well it had a very isolated and cold feeling. Will Smith does a fine job of acting his best though? Not so much. The story also took a strange turn from SciFi to religion towards the end. Not to mention was this a zombie film? I don't know because it was never explained.Robert Neville is a scientist who is the last man alive in New York City. A cure of cancer has gone horribly wrong and killed off almost 90 of the human population. The cure has turned people rabid and has made them feed on humans. Robert has lost his family in trying to get them out of New York during the evacuation but he is dedicated to finding a cure for this virus. Along with his only companion his dog Samantha he has to survive this scary and isolated world and try to find the last survivors before he goes insane or gets attacked by these creatures.I Am Legend had good ideas like I said the script just needed major work. Like with Robert's flash backs it seemed like they just stopped the story at that point and didn't explain how the rest of the population died out and how he was really the ONE and ONLY person who survived New York's virus. I know he said he was immune but no one else was? Major spoiler they killed his dog off almost in the beginning of the film which didn't seem right to me. I Am Legend is one of the year's biggest disappointments with me I guess not everything Will Smith touches is gold. If you want to see I Am Legend please just expect a lot of confusion and not much of a story I am very disappointed.410".

The first half of the movie was great and started to build something interesting despite the glaring lack of any background regarding the story. Yes I realize that you get a few flashbacks but the writers decided not to include any flashbacks of how the disease started no clips of people progressing through the stages of illness in essence everything that led to the point Will Smith ultimately arrived at. SPOILER ALERT While this certainly was a drawback it is nothing compared to the nonevents that surrounded the relationship between Smith's character and what seemed to be the head of the vampirezombiedarkstalkers. Just as the plot was beginning to develop between them the film took an epic dive right around the time Smith's dog died. There was absolutely no further development and even though the darkstalkers seem to show some intelligence and evolution the movie is concluded with their leader banging his head against the glass and screaming like an idiot. It all leads to an ending that seems like a copout and left me feeling wholly unsatisfied. End SpoilersThere were definitely some great parts the cinematography was fantastic and the computer generated scenes of a dilapidated and uninhabited New York were amazing. It most certainly was scary and there were times that made me jump though the animation on the darkstalkers was not particularly impressive in fact it reminded me a lot of the movie The Mummy with Brendan Frasier. Smith once again proved himself a very capable and believable actor. The first half is great though the second will definitely leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.

	schema:headline " the bad grammar in the title should be a giveaway";
	schema:reviewBody "I have three major gripes about this film all of which have numerous subgripes. The first and most obvious is the extremely terrible quality and extremely high quantity of Computer Generated effects. When I say the effects are bad I refer to the zombie like infected zombie dogs the deer that roam the streets the lions that escaped from the zoo right down to the butterfly that Will Smith's dog looks at. These have to be the worst special effects of the 21st century. Not a single thing is convincing for one second. What's even more puzzling than the inexplicably poor effects is the sheer amount of them. Will Smith captures a zombie and brings it to his lab. Even the body on the table is computer generated. Could they REALLY not get a person to lay on table and do nothing for a few minutes? I'm not the type of person who goes to the movies to see special effects but when they are so bad as to ruin any suspense or drama by taking you out of the movie then they are an unquestionably bad part of the film.All this talk about the infected brings me to my second major gripe the screenplay. Basically it makes no sense. Never mind that zombies are boring movie villains anyway but the script attributes a certain set of characteristics to them and they act completely differently from those. Will Smith's character after an unscary run in with a pack of them describes how social devolution is complete and that all traces of human behavior are gone. This would suggest to the viewer that these zombies would have no community communication or group mentality right? WRONG! These zombies are actually kind of the opposite of how the movie describes them. They live and work in groups have a pretty well defined leader can coordinate organize and execute a pretty elaborate plan to trap Will Smith and they have apparently managed to domesticate murderous zombiedogs. Okay so you'd think these sort of smart zombies aren't that lame after all right? WRONG AGAIN!! Despite all this they still fall victim to the trappings of a Hollywood movie that caters to the lowest possible denominator. These infected humans have apparently forgotten how to speak so instead they run really fast and yell loudly entering rooms only to tear out the insulation from the wall or breaking through glass by banging their heads on it I suppose all in a grand attempt to scare the audience.The script is terrible for reasons other than the infected too. Towards the end two random human survivors show up and rescue Will Smith. In the minutes immediately preceding this the action flashes back to the evacuation of Manhattan during which all the bridges connecting the island to anywhere else are demolished. The very first shot of the film shows the flooded entrance to the Holland Tunnel. These mysterious survivors brought a car of their own and came from Maryland so this begs the question HOW THE HELL DID THEY GET HERE? Needless to say this question is never answered and doesn't really need to be because these two survivors are so annoying that you'll be praying for them to leave. The kid is the generic creepy type who doesn't say a damn thing and his mom is the generic God is killing us all but God can save us person who exists in all apocalypserelated movies. It also just so happens that these two morons accidentally lead the blood thirsty CG zombies to Will Smith's house. They crash his party leading to a dumb clichd ending that is clearly trying to emulate better films like 28 Days Later or Children of Men.I guess my third gripe is that the film creates no drama or atmosphere at all. The director resorts to really lame horror movie tricks to keep the audience on edge although all he managed to do was keep me from falling asleep. For example and this is used an awful lot when Will Smith is closing his windows at night they make an unnecessarily loud noise. Creepy... He also creates a lot of false tension when Will Smith is evacuating his family in a flashback people are being tested for the killer virus. His wife is marked as infected but 30 seconds later after Will screams for a little bit she is scanned again and this time she's fine. Oh Francis Lawrence you sure are a clever one... But perhaps the lamest and most mood killing flaw like this is how the movie tries to and fails at being symbolic or meaningful. Will Smith comparing himself to a Bob Marley song is especially cringeworthy but not so much as the false imagery of a butterfly explaining it would require a lot of effort that I frankly don't want to devote to reviewing a movie as awful as this so just take my word for it please.. The only scene that does hold any meaningful drama is when Will Smith has to kill his dog. Even still I can't escape the feeling that the plot device of a dead dog is almost like a free pass that the film uses to involve the audience. Nevertheless when that is the best scene from your movie you've failed on an epic level.The saddest part about all this is that the basic premise is actually pretty intriguing even worse is how Will Smith who I really like in other movies is betrayed by the material as he tries to work up the courage to say hello to a mannequin woman. This movie is just a complete failure an example of the Law of Diminishing Returns the phenomenon of getting less output out of more and more input. This movie cost 150 million to make and is just a shadow of the classic films it wants so desperately to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Really bad movie that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. The plot is so full of hole it's ridiculous  3 years into the apocalyptic future and Neville is driving about in justwaxed cars? How? Fuel oxidises in a few months and certainly after 3 years would be fairly useless. Guess that doesn't matter? Guess product placement is more important than realism?  Neville has useless 'pastimes' with no explanation. Just juvenile fulfilment? Again driving shiny fast cars through overgrown NYC. Hitting golf balls of an aircraft wing on top of an aircraft carrier? Hunting deer through the streets? All with no reason or explanation just playboy fantasy.Everyone else has been eaten by the darkseekers or killed by the virus but Neville somehow has a very flash 'pad' in the middle of the city that hasn't been breached by the night stalkers or looted by others?  The darkseekers purportedly cannot survive cold temperatures yet have lived in NYC for 3 years where the temperature is minus during the winter. No explanation. Houses and stores are neat and dust free... after 3 years? Who is doing the cleaning?  Darkseekers have somehow superhuman skills and can bound about like small monkeys hang from the ceiling and see in pitch dark. Totally out with the bounds of sense for what a virus could do to a human. The noncharacters Anna and Ethan appear out of nowhere. Did they use a boat? A boat that presumably can carry a SUV as they arrive in Vermont in the same vehicle. Anna pulls Neville out of his car wreck and into her car even though he is twice her weight. Neville's home lab is well fitted out with even a glass fronted 'cage' for restraining the darkseekers how was this possible in the time leading up to the crisis? Or does everyone who is in the military medical division have their own fully kitted out private lab in the basement of their posh Manhattan home?  Neville is hung upside down by his leg for presumably several hours yet is able to recover cut himself loose and regain the use of his foot. His foot would have been severely probably permanently damaged by the constriction. Somehow Nevilles house has remained a safe haven from the darkseekers for 3 years yet they are able to breach it by chewing through the ceiling?  Why does Neville sprinkle a liquid on the steps of his home? No explanation. Nevilles blood is given to Anna but not the formula for the cure? Doh!  Anna has heard of Damian Marley but not Bob Marley? Why?  There is more goofs at httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0480249goofs I am sure there are many more blunders but these are the ones I remember from a day ago.This film really sucks the big one. As everyone says the CGI graphic animals and darkseekers are cartoonlike and badly done. The geewhizz overgrown NYC scenes are OK but unless you live there it doesn't really matter. The plot is thin for the first 23 then deteriorates rapidly with Anna the 'angel' spreading her gospel. The antiscientific and proChristian undertones are obvious and preachy and don't help the story at all. The flashbacks are annoying and serve no purpose other than to tell a boring story of how Neville's wife and daughter were killed and the film fails to make us feel any sympathy at all for them and shows us no reaction from Neville to the incident. The ending and meaning to the 'legend' is trite and cheesy. The dog dying is cheap emotion. We feel very little sympathy for Neville. There really is so much to dislike about this film. Utter nonsense not worth watching unless it is shown on TV and you don't mind spending 1 12 hours of your life getting annoyed!".

	onyx:emotionText "Really bad movie that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. The plot is so full of hole it's ridiculous  3 years into the apocalyptic future and Neville is driving about in justwaxed cars? How? Fuel oxidises in a few months and certainly after 3 years would be fairly useless. Guess that doesn't matter? Guess product placement is more important than realism?  Neville has useless 'pastimes' with no explanation. Just juvenile fulfilment? Again driving shiny fast cars through overgrown NYC. Hitting golf balls of an aircraft wing on top of an aircraft carrier? Hunting deer through the streets? All with no reason or explanation just playboy fantasy.Everyone else has been eaten by the darkseekers or killed by the virus but Neville somehow has a very flash 'pad' in the middle of the city that hasn't been breached by the night stalkers or looted by others?  The darkseekers purportedly cannot survive cold temperatures yet have lived in NYC for 3 years where the temperature is minus during the winter. No explanation. Houses and stores are neat and dust free... after 3 years? Who is doing the cleaning?  Darkseekers have somehow superhuman skills and can bound about like small monkeys hang from the ceiling and see in pitch dark. Totally out with the bounds of sense for what a virus could do to a human. The noncharacters Anna and Ethan appear out of nowhere. Did they use a boat? A boat that presumably can carry a SUV as they arrive in Vermont in the same vehicle. Anna pulls Neville out of his car wreck and into her car even though he is twice her weight. Neville's home lab is well fitted out with even a glass fronted 'cage' for restraining the darkseekers how was this possible in the time leading up to the crisis? Or does everyone who is in the military medical division have their own fully kitted out private lab in the basement of their posh Manhattan home?  Neville is hung upside down by his leg for presumably several hours yet is able to recover cut himself loose and regain the use of his foot. His foot would have been severely probably permanently damaged by the constriction. Somehow Nevilles house has remained a safe haven from the darkseekers for 3 years yet they are able to breach it by chewing through the ceiling?  Why does Neville sprinkle a liquid on the steps of his home? No explanation. Nevilles blood is given to Anna but not the formula for the cure? Doh!  Anna has heard of Damian Marley but not Bob Marley? Why?  There is more goofs at httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0480249goofs I am sure there are many more blunders but these are the ones I remember from a day ago.This film really sucks the big one. As everyone says the CGI graphic animals and darkseekers are cartoonlike and badly done. The geewhizz overgrown NYC scenes are OK but unless you live there it doesn't really matter. The plot is thin for the first 23 then deteriorates rapidly with Anna the 'angel' spreading her gospel. The antiscientific and proChristian undertones are obvious and preachy and don't help the story at all. The flashbacks are annoying and serve no purpose other than to tell a boring story of how Neville's wife and daughter were killed and the film fails to make us feel any sympathy at all for them and shows us no reaction from Neville to the incident.

I take off points only because it seems like a film that's been done before and it has I know but I don't mean literally. What sets it apart from the rest of the postapocalyptic man made human killing virus that zombifies people films is the depth of Will Smith's character. With crosscuts to dreams and the portrayal of Robert Neville's loneliness the audience connects with him on both a deep mental level and a more surface level driven by pathos. You both laugh and cry with him you jump out of your seat when he gets scared and you cheer for him throughout. I walked in expecting a zombie shootemup and settled into something much more thought provoking and intense. It wasn't perfect but it certainly deserves a look even if you're not into the whole undead thing.".

As such I probably had high expectations.I was especially interested in seeing it since it was A one of the few books where the main character dies in the end and B one of the few times where the entire human race is destroyed at the end of the story. In the book version humanity is completely wiped out and a new race of mutant vampires takes humanity's place in the world.Not much of that is present in the movie. Oh sure there are zombie mutants. Yes they come out at night. However it is only alluded to that they could be becoming more resistant to light  that aspect of the movie is not explored as it is in the book.One of the main plot points they left out of the movie was the fact that one of Neville's coworkers had become infected returned from the dead or what have you  in other words he was a vampire. Every night he would come out of hiding and scream Neville's name trying to get him to come out. It was obvious that his coworker remembered some things about Neville and their life together. This whole aspect was ignored in the film.Another main point of the book was where the vampires used drugs to make one of their woman look more like a regular human and sent her in to spy on Neville. This was one of the scariest parts of the book to me when he realized she wasn't human but he had trusted her and let her into his life.Finally the worst part of the film was how they twisted the meaning of the book. In the book the vampires finally capture Neville and sentence him to death. He doesn't give them the satisfaction opting to take some poison pills and commit suicide instead. However before he dies he learns that he will always be the stuff of legend to the new race of mutant vampires  he will always be remembered as the awful last man in stories told to children  about how he came in the day while people slept and killed entire families of vampires.The twisted ending of the movie where he manages to find a cure and save humanity almost seems like they changed the ending after shooting one more like the book. It's probably a change forced by the studio heads in order to make the ending more acceptable to the everyday person. Instead a bunch of people stood up and laughed at the ending in the theater where I was watching it. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone who has read the original book. In fact I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends or relatives either. The movie doesn't really get what the book was trying to relate.".

	schema:headline " Excellent until it starts moving the narrative beyond a concept and stumbles and falls badly";
	schema:reviewBody "Cancer has been cured by genetically modifying the measles virus to benefit mankind  the results are impressive. However the downside is that the virus mutates killing 90 of humanity turning 9 into lightphobic monsters and leaving only 1 untouched due to natural immunity. Robert Neville is one of that 1 and also the military biochemist charged with stopping the virus but he has failed and now is the only person alive in what remains of NYC. Working on a cure in his basement and broadcasting fruitlessly into the sky Neville spends his days surviving and his nights hiding.Despite my fear of most zombie style films I came to I Am Legend drawn mostly by the interest in the effects. Having been impressed by an empty London in 28 Days Later I was curious to see what more money could do. In terms of impact the answer is the same but in terms of scale it is much more. New York looks amazing and even those who only know it from films will feel the emptiness of the place. The irony is that due to the sheer scale of it visually it looks unreal whereas the smaller scale 28 Days Later was just plain eerie as it involved nothing generated by computer. This will sound like a criticism but it is not because I do think that this sense of emptiness is the thing that makes I Am Legend excellent for part of the running time.The effects are only part of it but roundly the delivery makes this aspect work. The plot sits back and lets us just be with Neville in his isolation and semimadness talking to manikins treating his dog as a child and so on. This is greatly helped by a performance from Will Smith that is close to towering he is utterly convincing in his character and the film brings us an understand of his situation gradually. As we get used to his eccentric lifestyle the reality is brought home in a moment where he goes from sun to a sweat soaked scene in a dark room a brilliant moment where we the audience experience the fear he is living with first hand.So why is the film itself not brilliant? Well this comes down to the second half or so where the writers start to take steps to bring out a narrative that will go somewhere in the traditional sense rather than exploring the character of Neville as its sole reason for being. In doing this the script made many jumps that were convenient illogical or just plain lazy and it is disappointing. Bear in mind that this is a film that had managed to convince me that the majority of humanity was dead due to Emma Thompson the man responsible for finding the cure was one of the few left alive and that New York was completely empty  I never questioned any of this so how much of a dropped ball is it to suddenly introduce a narrative that has the audience looking at each other saying yeah right? It is not as bad as I make it sound though because at this point the action steps up and provides sufficient noise and explosions that perhaps many viewers will find themselves distracted away from the problems with the story telling. However these are too obvious and too big and contrast badly with the patience and emptiness of the first half and with the rush to a conclusion the film does really feel like the majority of the work was done on the concept and this plot was an afterthought. The writers don't help themselves with some of the dialogue anyway. Having got it so perfect with so little early on a massive shoehorn is used to get Bob Marley in there  one of several things that conspire to undermine all the good character development that had been done in the first half.Overall though the film is worth seeing. The first half is very impressive thanks to patience special effects and a very strong turn from Smith. Sadly the second half lets it all down as the plot devices used to provide a tradition flow and ending are clumsy and unconvincing and the noisy action sequences that are produced didn't manage to distract me from them.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cancer has been cured by genetically modifying the measles virus to benefit mankind  the results are impressive. However the downside is that the virus mutates killing 90 of humanity turning 9 into lightphobic monsters and leaving only 1 untouched due to natural immunity. Robert Neville is one of that 1 and also the military biochemist charged with stopping the virus but he has failed and now is the only person alive in what remains of NYC. Working on a cure in his basement and broadcasting fruitlessly into the sky Neville spends his days surviving and his nights hiding.Despite my fear of most zombie style films I came to I Am Legend drawn mostly by the interest in the effects. Having been impressed by an empty London in 28 Days Later I was curious to see what more money could do. In terms of impact the answer is the same but in terms of scale it is much more. New York looks amazing and even those who only know it from films will feel the emptiness of the place. The irony is that due to the sheer scale of it visually it looks unreal whereas the smaller scale 28 Days Later was just plain eerie as it involved nothing generated by computer. This will sound like a criticism but it is not because I do think that this sense of emptiness is the thing that makes I Am Legend excellent for part of the running time.The effects are only part of it but roundly the delivery makes this aspect work. The plot sits back and lets us just be with Neville in his isolation and semimadness talking to manikins treating his dog as a child and so on. This is greatly helped by a performance from Will Smith that is close to towering he is utterly convincing in his character and the film brings us an understand of his situation gradually. As we get used to his eccentric lifestyle the reality is brought home in a moment where he goes from sun to a sweat soaked scene in a dark room a brilliant moment where we the audience experience the fear he is living with first hand.So why is the film itself not brilliant?

Anyways after years of being let down by so called scary zombievirus movie genres and other blockbuster thriller debacles I Am Legend really separates itself from the group.Without giving too much way Will Smith plays a sole survivor of a world dominating virus created by man that was originally created to cure cancer. Three years into the new world Smith who was a former doctor dedicates his life to survival finding a cure....and talking to mannequins. In order to find a cure he seeks out the infected who only come out at night and hoping to correct man's mistake.Legend was the first truly scary movie I've seen in some time. Realism is the main factor in scary movies in my opinion. If it can happen than that's pretty scary. Also Smith's portrayal of despair and borderline insanity of three years of seclusion added to the effect. With the exception of his dog Smith had no live contact with constant failure attempts of his cure only leading to his insanity. It had a Cast Away feel to it with his dog as to Hank's volleyball and his house reminding you of that stranded island.The actionsuspense scenes coupled with superb sound direction were also heart pounding and unexpected which added to the scare factor. Whenever Smith engaged with the zombielike survivors there was that claustrophobic feeling that I haven't felt since Alien. My only real complaint was the overuse of CGI over real actors for these characters but with their speed and strength that these things showed if may have not been possible.Legend overall is one of the better movies of 2007 and a must see. Not Oscarworthy by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly entertaining realistically tense and maybe even thought provoking.".

The resulting virus which mostly resembles rabies kills most of the population worldwide except for some 500 million that turn into... of course a sort of werewolves that feed on the remaining million that are immune. This in itself is a very worn out and unrealistic theme by now and the werewolf angle only makes it more silly.Our 'hero' is living in the remains of a big city NY and luckily for us he is a biological engineer working for the military. In his house he has a laboratory  to find a cure which he has time for when he is not out shooting deer weredogs and wolves or is engaged in another boring 'activity'. The dramatic height of the movie is when his dog dies which had about the same impact on me as when i see i stepped on an ant boring. There is hardly any character development and well it's Will Smith which usually plays Will Smith. The acting is mediocre at best.The camerawork is less than mediocre. There are too many scenes that play in the dark so you can just guess whats going on which is not so hard because its all terribly predictable. They spent way too much money on the making of this movie for it to look so bad. It may be nice if you live in NY to see what your city would become but to me that means nothing. and why is there a Lockheed SR71 blackbird on an aircraft carrier? The thing can't land there and they've been out of use for quite a while now edit i found it is Intrepid SeaAirSpace Museum in NY. Nice if you live in NY and know these things otherwise useless end edit. I watch a movie to see nice images not 15 minutes of utter darkness...The end comes pretty hastily with a few narrated lines that should give the whole thing meaning. Should but doesn't. Along the way there are a few lines that attempt to give it some depth as in philosophical truths or meaning of which the best is 'I didn't do it we did' i want to reply 'no really you did!'I think they tried to copy the i robot feelstyle with the music of Bob Marley Was stevie wonder in I Robot and they added an anecdote of Bob to give it some 'depth'. Bob was great at making music but that doesn't imply he was a great philosopher. In the Netherlands we have Johan Cruyff maybe you heard of him an ex great football soccer player which tends to say things in the media. So now he is quoted for his 'wise' saying Every disadvantage has it's advantage pronounced with Amsterdam accent for dramatic effect. Goes to show that someone great in one field isn't necessarily great in another.As for humor there isn't any. I think they tried a few times... I wanted to save the bacon.... but... no.Very very disappointing movie. I even wanted to stop watching a number of times but didn't because i kept hoping a movie with Will Smith in it would get better at some point. It only got worse.My advise You can miss this one. There are a lot of better movies already made about virus outbreaks and apocalypses. Watch one of those again saves money and its less boring. Unless of course you want to be apocalypticly bored.".

This movie could have been great but it was edited all weird and could have used some music to heighten his alone time to pull us into his miserable world. If you want to see the concept done correctly in my opinion check out The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price. Same thing done well. Or even Omega Man with Charlton Heston.

Then the lions came and we get close to the animals.. And what is this I see? CRAPPY CGI?? It's deer! It's lions! No need for CGI! It looks worse than what you on The Discovery Channel in their Dinosaur programs. Quickly you see more bad CGI coming at you ugly zombiethe mummyvamps.

A vampire mask from Toys'r'us is more frightening.We see a lot of half decent acting from Smith then more crappy CGI. Some nasty shots of Smith working out.

Smith sees a butterfly on some broken glass and a butterfly tattoo the Christian nuts neck... I thought tattoos where a symbol of Satan?He then decides to become a martyr? Yes. He goes Jihad on those evil CGI zombies that don't understand him and don't want a cure those evil zombies made by a evil British scientist... Amazingly it seems Smith kills ALL the zombies with that grenade because the Christian woman seems safe and snug in that little hiding place of hers all night... Actually how will she get out? Does that place he locked her inside really have a doorknob on the inside? Wouldn't that be like making a handle and lock INSIDE a oven or fireplace? Just in chance that you hide in them? In the end she... Drives away from Manhattan??? In that same truck she started of with? How the heck is that even possible? Does she have a private boat or is that God teleporting her around all this time? Who knows?? But in the happy happy ending we get our share of a lovely white Church stars and stripes and even this whole Amish like village God told the Christian nut about in the first place....

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen some promising trailers I today decided to go and see I Am Legend. The film kicks off with a newscaster interviewing a scientist about what is thought to be a cure for cancer. The scientist's amateurish method of helping the layman understand how the cure actually works  using the simile of a car and its driver  made me wonder whether the film would persist with this kind of dumbing down.We are then taken instantly to the postapocalyptic New York in which Robert Neville Will Smith lives. Just about everyone has either died or contracted some sort of zombieism because of KV a virus originating from the geneticallymodified measles virus which was used to try and cure cancer. This part having been brought in so soon you are hoping that the director will be able to quickly establish the sense of complete human absence and at first the broken skyscrapers and the overgrown grass make you think that yes this is will make a nice backdrop for Will Smith to do his thing. But then come the zoo animals the first of many CGI cock ups that this film will probably become famous for one day. We have deers lions and well a distracting generic looking computergenerated animal that looks like a cross between a bear and a liger.Will Smith's interaction with his dog companion Sam is probably the best thing about the film and it all happens within the first half hour or so. Will Smith does a very good job of conveying Neville's dependence on Sam for interaction and companionship especially in an amusing scene involving Neville giving Sam a dog bath while listening to Bob Marley's 'Three Little Birds' every little thing's gonna be alright.During the first half of the film we are every now and then treated to a few emotionally charged flash backs that detail the evacuation of Manhattan and the separation of Neville from his family. A particularly touching scene involves a woman and her child frantically trying to beat the checkpoint despite the fact that she is infected.The first interaction with a zombie occurs when Sam takes a detour through a dark area of town and into some building. Neville enters the building himself to rescue his friend and soon comes face to face with a horde of horrifically tame looking CGI zombies. An unflattering closeup of one the zombie's faces reveals every last computergenerated flaw from their ridiculously fast animation frame rate to their laboured and drawn out facial expressions. Every time a zombie appears in this film you can't help but think you're playing a firstgeneration Xbox 360 game.The final decent scene of the film has Neville hanging upside from a trap and he and Sam have to escape from a tactical ambush that the zombies had planned out. Sam gets bitten by one of the zombie dogs while protecting his master and contracts KV thus marking the end of a decent first half of the film.Neville takes a mortally wounded Sam back to his home and holds him in his arms. A few moments of silence occurs and I thought to myself right there and then I bet any second now Will Smith will start singing Three Little Birds and just as if by magic Will Smith read my mind and decided to give a broken 'emotional' performance of that very song. If you had to state an exact point in the film at which the quality suddenly took a turn for the worse this was it. A whole scene exhibiting a cringeworthy caricature of the relationship that carried the first portion of the film. Neville then strangles his zombieinfected dog to death but instead of seeing this scene we are treated to a two minutes minifilm of Will Smith's gurning face.More fights with zombies in the dark ensue and then out of nowhere Neville is saved by a woman called Anna who had responded to a radio message that Will had sent out. Her plan is to reach Vermont to live in a survivor's refuge community. Anna takes Neville back to his place and makes him a Sunday morning fry up. The film's director suddenly decides to remove all of the social skills and optimism that Neville had evidentially maintained in his interactions with his dog and have him turn into an unsympathetic and hopeless loser.The film's biggest 'sin' is the utterly blunt proChristian subtext that is introduced after Sam's death. When Neville is saved we see his rescuer's cross necklace dangle before his eyes. Later we see some of Neville's wounds punctures on his wrists. Then a chat between Anna and Neville reveals that Anna believes that God sent her there and that God will save them. In the second to last scene Neville hands Anna a gourde containing the antidote to KV that he created in his laboratory sends her out into the world and then becomes a martyr by hurling himself into a mob of computergenerated zombies a scene that draws allegorical parallels with Jesus in the bible sacrificing himself to save mankind. Anna's journey from Brazil through the east coast of the America's locating survivors represents the Christian preaching work and her eventual arrival at Vermont represents the ascendancy to heaven the first building we see behind the huge gates is a Christian church.Now I'm not saying that Christianity is a bad thing or even that proChristian subtext in a film is a bad thing. What's bad is the fact that the subtext is so unsubtle that even Christians would take offence. The soliloquy that closes the film might as well say Christianity is the only answer to all of life's problems.Too long didn't read? First half is good second half is an embarrassing glurge fest and both halves are virtually ruined by laughable CGI.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie today the day it opened here. And was deeply deeply moved.I've got to start with the scenes of a deserted New York City postapocalypse. These were so very very moving and very very convincing. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good but you really have to see the full panoply of closeup shots distance shots etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. There's something of On the Beach and Resident Evil and of any number of disaster movies and zombie movies here. But none of them do justice to the New York depicted here. This is a New York City we see largescale and microscale in order to show us the environment in which the main character is acting.And Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of what it would be like ... to be the last man on earth living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his typical days in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us what it would be like with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing which I found all the more effective.Cinematography was excellent throughout the storyline and script are brilliant the use of a dog Samantha as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely isolated survivor.I won't give away the ending but think it was satisfying as far as it goes but not nearly as appealing from my angle as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint the title. By the end of the movie we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.But that's a minor plaint. If you haven't seen this movie and would enjoy seeing a really powerful story about a survivor in postapocalypse New York City hey go check out this flick. It's really worth it.".

With a movie that could quite easily be an epic you'd expect more. The movie watching audience is used to hour and a half movies. Let's save that time span for comedies can we? What's with the CG creatures throughout this movie? The animals I can understand. But when you're looking at all the villians in this movie they look lousy. I only say this because they could easily have been portrayed by humans but instead they're computer generated. Why? I have no clue. Emotions can be shown so much stronger through humans. With CG I don't feel any connection to the characters because I know that I'm watching a nonreal figure and hence I start not caring as much as I would. How hard would it have been to make the close ups on the creatures be humans in makeup? Not at all and it would have been fantastic!I was somewhat bored with this movie and I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would have. The movie industry seems to be relying too much on CG to fill in holes and when it's a hole as big as what is the main focus of I Am Legend it's embarrassing to see monsters that are almost cartoonlike.Sorry guys I'm just not impressed with CG anymore.

In just his late 20s he stood at the throne ruling over one of the largest nations on Earth with the most people on Earth. He controls and commands the lives of nearly FiveHundred Million people. Throughout his abdication his decline and dissolute lifestyle his exploitation by the invading Japanese and finally to his obscure existence as just another peasant worker in the People's Republic.While the film isn't perfect it is certainly beautiful and a visual treat for anyone. Bernardo Bertolucci's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an emotional beautiful and astonishing film... And it's a massive production which won 9 Oscars It deserved every single one of them. The film will always be remembered for its size and its beauty. This Asian Masterpiece tells us a story of not only an Emperor but of a country which was and still is the largest nation in the world.

	schema:reviewBody "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is a monumental perfect film and stands as one of the great artistic achievements in any artistic medium. Told in a complicated flashback flashforward style it's the story of Pu Yi born 1906 who was the last absolute monarch of China. During his lifetime he falls from the Lord of Ten Thousand Years the emperorGod of billions of Chinese to an anonymous peasant worker in communist China. Pu Yi was the child emperor from 1908 until the Chinese revolution in 1911 when he had to abdicate. He was allowed to remain in the Forbidden City but was stripped of his power by the communists. He was expelled from the city in 1924 by a warlord. In 1932 Puyi was installed by the Japanese as the ruler of Manchukuo a puppet state of Imperial Japan. At the end of World War II Pu yi was captured by the Soviet Red Army and turned over to the Chinese communists. Considered a traitor he spent ten years in a reeducation camp until he was declared reformed. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens.This film vividly portrays the change from the imperial and religious traditions of ancient China to the godless totalitarianism of modern communist China so the film is on one level the story of China's revolutionary transition from imperialism to communism. Visually the film is stunning especially the scenes in the Forbidden City. It was the first film to receive permission to film in the Forbidden City.The film can be enjoyed on the first viewing but really demands more than one viewing and some knowledge of history. In this respect it resembles Akira Kurasawa's masterpiece The Seven Samurai. The cast includes John Lone as emperor Pu Yi Joan Chen and Peter O'Toole. The film won 9 Oscars including best director and best film. A must see on DVD widescreen or in the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Emperor is a near perfect film.  It was nominated for nine Oscars in 1987 and it won nine including the Best Picture Oscar.  The movie is about the life of Pu Yi John Lone China's last emperor.  In spite of becoming emperor at the age of three Yi's reign was more of a burden than anything else.  Yi would ultimately end up living an unsavory life of imprisonment which is heartrending to the viewer.  The Last Emperor is visually stunning.  The minute details are amazing.  However the story stands up high as well.  Historically accurate for the most part The Last Emperor is easily one of the top 10 films of the 1980s and overall an exceptional achievement in every cinematic department known to man.  5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:headline " The Last Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Emperor like Once Upon a Time in America is an epic saga that delves among various aspects into the realm of Time and the ensuing effects it has on a human being and his culture as it passes through his lifetime.  The Last Emperor of the Qing dynasty PuYi was coronated in 1909 at the age of three and due to his youth ended up being a puppet to his adminstration. Bertolucci successfully shows us a young man who while understandably spoilt by many luxuries of monarchy is in actuality a tender hearted independent thinker not doer who is passionate about his homeland Manchuria and has a ravenous desire for experiencing life in the outside world.  His caged lifestyle in the Forbidden City Beijing is definitely a major contributor to this mindset.  From his infancy the director takes us through a chain of historical events that ultimately lead to PuYi being an ordinary man we know this from the beginning however flashbacks explain his situation at the start.  However it is not the desired lifestyle that he sought as an Emperor in his youth.The Last Emperor is breathtaking in its cinematography and Bertolucci's direction is impeccable.  A lot of criticism was directed at his film '1900' 1976 due to its sheer length.  The Last Emperor clocks in at 215 minutes director's cut and barring 10 minutes of a marriage related scene it never lets up.  Bertolucci seamlessly interweaves the flashbacks with PuYi's situation in postWWII China by providing us with a real life tragedy that epitomizes human weaknesses vices love and loyalty.  Here is a film that is a true story but goes beyond mere narration or simple depiction  it is a three and a half hour nonstop attention grasping journey through the spectrum of humanity that defines our lifetime through the eyes of an unfortunate soul who was a victim of circumstances like many are.  Any questions that the viewer will have concerning an event in the plot will be immediately answered through the rich tapestry that Bertolucci shows when depicting PuYi's imperial life.On a technical note the acting in this film is brilliant.  John Lone deserved atleast an Oscar nomination for best actor due to his seamless portrayal of PuYi.  He makes his portrayal of a 21  60 year old PuYi seem like an effortless act. Through his performance the audience feels an even greater compassion for the last emperor as we come across a man who despite all the hardships he endured was very compassionate and soft centered. The sheer down to earth nature of his character as a 5560 year old who walks with a tired smile forever accompanied by his loving brother is a testament to Lone's ability to portray any age and move the audience.Once again it takes a Hailey's comet like event for the Academy to nominate someone from the eastern world or nonBritish nonAmerican when it comes to best actor.  The rest of the cast is also brilliant barring Ryuichi Sakamoto who portrays the onearmed Masahiko Amakasu who for the most part presents us with a classic display of Japanese overacting.  Although I wouldn't call it overacting in a KurasawaesqueJapanese film environment it becomes quite hilarious in a production such as this.This apart the film is brilliant.  It is the last great epic yes Gladiator is very good but is far from an epic in my mind and somehow I hope it is rediscovered and reappreciated as it once was back in the late eighties.While the Oscars have always contrived to ignore the true best picture for most of the last two decades here is an example of a best picture winner which beat the competition by miles.".

AisinGioro Pu Yi also known as Henry Pu Yi was the last emperor of China who spent most of his early life as a puppet of others. He was then reeducated into an ordinary citizen He worked as a gardener in the People's Republic of China. The exciting thing from our point of view is that Henry Pu Yi wrote an autobiography From Emperor to Citizen and it is largely on this book that the film is based.The colourful pageantry in this film is superb  utterly unforgettable. Unfortunately the characterisation is not so well thought out. Only as the cheerful gardener does Pu Yi become anything approaching real  which may be the truth anyway. Otherwise the film becomes a series of historical events which could well bamboozle anyone who does not know their history since it is often not quite clear what is actually going on. Having said this the tragedy of Pu Yi's life  and it was mostly tragedy  comes through well. As well as the end that although stripped of title riches wife etc Pu Yi the gardener the citizen of Red China is now a free man comes through well too.One can find faults with this film  or to be more exact what one would think are faults  but to list these would prove nothing. This film treads new ground. It is difficult to make with three actors playing the same person. You have to watch this film because it will improve the way you view other people and you will see the tragedy of monarchy that the monarch himself becomes little more than a specimen in a zoo  rather like the cricket kept in the jar underneath the throne. It will also whet your appetite to read From Emperor to Citizen which contains much information that the film could not show.".

He didn't know anything. The movie tells his story from that moment in flashbacks. We also get to see Pu Yi when the Chinese Communists have the power and he is imprisoned. Because people have taken care of him the rest of his life from three years old to the moments inside the prison it still feels he knows nothing.To tell you about the life of Pu Yi would be a mistake. You have to see this movie to learn more about it. The strange thing is that Pu Yi can not do and decide much for himself. He is a hero of a movie where he is controlled by rules and other people. That is one of the reasons not many real things happen. We see the emperor grow up we see him take an empress and a concubine and then he has to leave the Forbidden City because the enemy is at the gate.The impressive thing here are the locations and the costumes. Everything looks fabulous and it is not a surprise to find out that the movie was shot on location. With all the extras in those beautiful costumes there are a lot of very impressive scenes. May be the movie is a bit too long for some it didn't really bother me. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has made a terrific movie.".

It has plentiful moments including his romantic affairs with concubines and how he learns the way of the world as a child. His chronicle of a young emperor boy paints a colorful picture for the first half only leading to more conflicting matters later which is the most exciting part. Don't expect to see heads getting chopped off like I thought would happen unless you have the longer DVD version but the intensity of the talk surrounding it sounds horrifying and true. Nevertheless the dialogue is clearly mystical. Every minute is a feelgood breeze through crafty cinematic art but it ends too fast and the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term could use a lot more detailing. Maybe I'll stick around longer and wait to see the Director's Cut which has more. Definitely a winning treat not to be missed for foreign movie lovers and collectors of premium filmfare.".

	schema:headline " Excellent if not emotionally confusing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to comment on the The Last Emperor from a somewhat oblique angle compared to the usual reviews a film gets.For starters it is my opinion that this was a really good film to watch. It also spurred me into researching a little more Chinese as well as Japanese history.  I think I should note here there are some great books to research on the life of Pu Yi.  There is in fact a book Twilight In The Forbidden City by Reginald F. Johnston as well as From Emperor to Citizen an autobiography by Pu Yi himself.  I'll list some titles and where to find them at the end of my comment.This oblique angle that I'd like to take is on the emotional impact of the film.While I found the film informative and well made I also found it conveyed an emotional emptiness and maybe even sadness.  I was distraught at the end of the film.  In short It made me feel that here is a man who was somebody and at the end of his life he has nothing.  He lost everything he ever had and died alone.While everyone may get something different from the film they undoubtedly will find similarities with other viewers as well.  I almost wish some creative license were taken to end the film on a happier note.Although I found it sad solemn and many times it made me feel just empty like I wasn't sure what to feel but I wanted anything to fill the emptiness I also found it compelling.  Not many other films have so made me want to learn more about the history and people in a film.That's my review.

	onyx:emotionText "I'd like to comment on the The Last Emperor from a somewhat oblique angle compared to the usual reviews a film gets.For starters it is my opinion that this was a really good film to watch. It also spurred me into researching a little more Chinese as well as Japanese history.  I think I should note here there are some great books to research on the life of Pu Yi.  There is in fact a book Twilight In The Forbidden City by Reginald F. Johnston as well as From Emperor to Citizen an autobiography by Pu Yi himself.  I'll list some titles and where to find them at the end of my comment.This oblique angle that I'd like to take is on the emotional impact of the film.While I found the film informative and well made I also found it conveyed an emotional emptiness and maybe even sadness.  I was distraught at the end of the film.  In short It made me feel that here is a man who was somebody and at the end of his life he has nothing.  He lost everything he ever had and died alone.While everyone may get something different from the film they undoubtedly will find similarities with other viewers as well.  I almost wish some creative license were taken to end the film on a happier note.Although I found it sad solemn and many times it made me feel just empty like I wasn't sure what to feel but I wanted anything to fill the emptiness I also found it compelling.  Not many other films have so made me want to learn more about the history and people in a film.That's my review.  And as a final note while my review may have had a somewhat down tone to it and may have even left some people feeling like the review is a bit empty or unfinished I also hope it compelled people to think a little differently about The Last Emperor and maybe even spur some of you to do a little of your own research on the people and places in the film.BooksTwilight In The Forbidden City by Reginald F.

He wielded absolute power within his real realm  a gilded cage of a palace  but could never shape events except for tragedy to himself or to others. We see his life as one unlikely person the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated in a gigantic tragedy  that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao with coups warlord rule World War II and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi once the Emperor of the great but decrepit Chinese Empire becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions this one in 1925 in China. We see him doing a few things right like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston who gave him the confidence to be a political figure  even a good one  in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner  himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days only the intriguers are worse  far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand. At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business  and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed as one might expect he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings  war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state  who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Exfascists make the most fervent communists. All in all he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge. Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good  if the going was ever good  and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire in population size that is on Earth  in a premature old age a cipher. Then again what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become  ciphers old before their time wrecks of no fault of their own just to survive.".

	schema:headline " The Life Of China's Last Emperor";
	schema:reviewBody "This is somewhat long and generally lacking in excitement but it's beautifully filmed and it serves as a fascinating look at the life of Pu Yi  the last Emperor of China who came to the throne in 1908 when he was three years old and finally died in 1967 as a gardener in Communist China after serving 10 years in a PRC prison being ideologically re educated. Much of the story is told in flashbacks taken from his interrogation by Communist officials in the PRC prison. Much attention is paid to Reginald Johnston's book Twilight in the Forbidden City. Johnston played in the movie by Peter O'Toole was Pu Yi's Scottish tutor.John Lone's performance as Pu Yi was very good. Not surprising perhaps for someone who became an emperor at such a young age Pu Yi is depicted as one who is used to comfort and used to having his way  a characteristic he seems to have retained for most of his life although he doesn't really come across as bad or arrogant just as someone who never learned how to care for himself or treat others as equals. I suppose it would be hard to expect a child who was treated almost like a god from the age of 3 to grow up psychologically well adjusted. He was actually overthrown not much more than a decade after coming to the throne but I appreciated learning that although he abdicated when the Nationalist revolution took place he retained his title and it seems as though the Forbidden City remained his Empire. He continued to rule this little enclave within Beijing much as the Pope rules a little enclave within Rome. That was very interesting.There was a lot of attention to Pu Yi's accession as Emperor of Manchukuo in 1934. He became a puppet of the Japanese who placed him on the throne to give Manchukuo a semblance of credibility but no freedom was captured by the Soviets at the end of the war and finally handed over to PRC officials in 1950 his transfer to Chinese authority being where the movie begins.Near the end of the movie there's a truly fascinating scene depicting a small portion of the work of Mao's Red Guards during the socalled Cultural Revolution that was quite sobering. I was disappointed though with the way this ended. It chose to conclude on a sort of fantasy scene where Pu Yi returns to the Forbidden City. I suppose it was meant as a way of saying that at his death he returned home but I found it a weak ending rather than a heartwarming one perhaps because while his life was interesting I can't say that I developed any warm feelings or sympathy for Pu Yi by watching this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the biography of AisinGioro Pu Yi commonly known as Puyi the titular last Chinese Emperor. It is a rare Hollywood picture about the Orient. It takes very few liberties with historical facts and covers his entire life an impressive feat given the many events that had taken place in and during his lifetime. He was coronated at the age of three and sent to live in the Forbidden city. It was the time when China was transitioning from Monarchy to a Republic. The new government allowed him to retain the title and he was not to leave Forbidden City. Thus began his life as a puppet placed on a seemingly high pedestal by different regimes for their own benefit.Puyi grew up in an extremely unhealthy environment. Separated from his mother when he was a toddler he had no friends apart from his wet nurse to give him love and no parental figures to teach him disciple or responsibility. The eunuchs residing at the City had no authority over him and he was at liberty to abuse them with impunity. He grows up to be a product of his circumstances. His has wellmeaning plans for Forbidden City and later the people of his native Manchu but he has no idea how to implement them. Instead he becomes even more powerless. To top it all he is misogynistic and vain with a misplaced sense of entitlement. He gets no sympathy from us the viewers even thought we have seen how we became the person that he is. We hold him responsible for his decisions and nonaction.The movie opens with the beginning of Puyi's life postimperialness when he was held prisoner. After his release he becomes a commoner. His time as the Emperor are shown in flashbacks. Ostensibly he had a better life before. But is it really true? He now has the freedom he never had before. This movie is as much of a character study as a historical account. What makes this aspect of it work is its strong cast. Richard Vuu as the toddler Puyi he gets the movie poster all for himself! is a delight to the eye and has remarkable acting chops for someone so young. John Lone brings the many internal conflicts flaws weaknesses aspirations and virtues of both young and old Puyi to life. Joan Chen is perfect as the Empress who understands the situation better than her husband but is helpless because she is a woman. Vivian Wu as Puyi's second consort makes the best of the limited screen time she gets. Peter O'Toole as teenage Puyi's mentor is good as ever. Maggie Han deserves a special mention for making the character of Eastern Jewel a real life Japanese spy whose life story merits a movie of its own stand out given that she has very few lines. The only weak link in the acting department is Tao Wu 15 year Puyi.This movie does not make the mistake of treating the Orient as something exotic something which Hollywood is often guilty of doing. The mores traditions and beliefs of the people place and time portrayed in the movie have been well researched and it was shot on location in the Forbidden City scenes. Together they add up to give an authentic feel to the movie. It is a movie that richly deserves its Academy Award for Best Picture.".

Not to say this movie is bad but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age how he abdicated this throne and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole one of the few Western actors here does an excellent job as always.Overall The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain but to teach. It's a good fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of only three total Best Picture winners that won every one of the awards for which it was nominated but strangely enough it received no nominations for acting. I found this odd since I thought that one of the film's finer points were its performances.In this film PuYi grows to a man who was deposed as the last emperor of China while still a child and thus he wanders from country to country as a young man who is wealthy but without purpose. Thus never really coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer king he jumps at the chance to sell himself out as a puppet to the Japanese when they offer him the opportunity to rule at least part of China again. As Emperor of Manchukuo PuYi is blind to the barbarous acts and experiments that the Japanese perform upon his subjects blind to the fact that his wife has an affair with a servant to produce a royal heir and most of all blind to his role as puppet in the Japanese scheme for world domination. Not until the end of World War II does he seem to even have an inkling of what has been going on.Now for the part of the movie to which I really object. Although it is compelling to see PuYi slowly owe up to his responsibility for what happened in China during the Japanese occupation and come to terms with the fact that he is after all just a man like any other man I strongly object to the Maoists as the goodguys in this quest for redemption. The Communist Chinese did the same type of reindoctrination on many other people  among them Christian missionaries Buddhist monks and believers in democracy and a free press  anyone who simply got in their way and needed their world view readjusted. On top of that how the Communists reindoctrinate people in this film is Grated compared to what really went on in such camps. For details consult the novel 1984. These points are completely whitewashed. Without the flaw of the portrayal of the Communist Chinese as the patient and kindly savers of lost souls this would have pretty much been a perfect film.".

The Communist Chinese did the same type of reindoctrination on many other people  among them Christian missionaries Buddhist monks and believers in democracy and a free press  anyone who simply got in their way and needed their world view readjusted. On top of that how the Communists reindoctrinate people in this film is Grated compared to what really went on in such camps. For details consult the novel 1984. These points are completely whitewashed. Without the flaw of the portrayal of the Communist Chinese as the patient and kindly savers of lost souls this would have pretty much been a perfect film.";

When O'Toole is on stage. our eyes rest a bit and our souls get engaged. But he is already emaciated and a walking tragedy of waste his own tragedy more hypnotizing in his brief moments than all the other character movements combined.Quite possibly the story is weaker here than in most Bertolucci films because of Chinese sensitivities. Why was the ten years in the prison camp not shown as the grueling hard labor it was? Why was the treachery of Mao not mentioned.There's some slight selfreference when the invasion' occurs the invaders bring still and movie cameras.There's one scene that has stuck in my mind for 15 years when Lone is in bed with his two very lovely wives covered with an opulent cloth sensually undulating. One of the loveliest and most memorable moments in film. You get mesmerized by the shifting polychromatic tones and shadows. Then it turns a passionate red which in fact is the treasure of a 4000 year old culture evaporating. Ted's evaluation 3 of 4  Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Heaven's Mandate";
	schema:reviewBody "Back when I was a university student studying a course in the Far East  we learned the term 'Heaven's Mandate'. It was said that when one  dynasty overthrew another the mandate from powers above to rule China  had been lost and a new mandate was given to the winners. It was a self  fulfilling idea because if the Mings went out and the Manchus went in  it was because the Manchus now had the Mandate.  The Last Emperor is the story of Young emperor Pu Yi who was the last  Manchu Emperor crowned at the age of 3 in 1908 and removed in 1911  during the revolution. Pu Yi spent half the rest of his life trying to  gain that back and the other half trying to roll with the punches for  making some very bad choices in trying for the former. By that time if  you want to extend the idea the mandate now fell to Mao Tsetung and  the Chinese Communists.  Still very few people had as colorful as tumultuous and as epic a  life as Pu Yi as portrayed by Chinese actor John Lone. Whatever else Pu  Yi was he was a survivor and maybe if he hasn't got Heaven's mandate  any more he's at least got a heavenly place.  From 1911 until he was kicked out the young Emperor was still  permitted to run a kind of fairyland kingdom in the Forbidden City area  of Peking which was the exclusive domain of the Chinese Emperors for  centuries. During that time he had an English tutor in Peter O'Toole  the one major occidental player in The Last Emperor. The relationship  here is similar to the one shown in Seven Years In Tibet between Brad  Pitt as Heinrich Harrer and the young Dalai Lama. Here though the  emphasis is on the pupil not the tutor.  The Last Emperor is an epic international achievement not possible  during the years of Mao Tsetung's rule. As a film it received great  international respect winning nine Oscars including Best Picture and  Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. That's quite a mandate in and of  itself.  Though the film is more than two and half hours long I guarantee your  interest will not flag. And it really is worth it to see at the very  end the elderly Emperor's meeting with the new Red Guards of Mao's  Cultural Revolution and that bit of symbolism with the cricket.  Absolutely priceless just as the film is.".

It was a bomb at the box office and has been discontinued on DVD as well at last reports.Anyway I came into it with a feeling of optimism but wound up disappointed too with my look at in on VHS. However I didn't give up buying the DVD with an extra 54 minutes on it. I really really wanted to like this film....but once again I found myself just plain bored with it all. That's the major fault with the film it's doesn't grab you get you involved in the story and the characters. After an hour and a half it's who cares?Too bad because the story is filmed in a fascinating place China's Forbidden City and features a cast of thousands and some spectacular costuming. The Asian colors of orange yellows purples reds etc. makes it a color feast. The acting led by John Lone Joan Chen Peter O'Toole and others is fine and the language is very tame. The problem is everything is too tame and it shouldn't be with all it has going for it.".

We see him unknowingly abdicate his throne as a boy held virtual prisoner among the greatest opulence as a teenager then seduced by the warlike Japanese as a young man who return him to the throne as a puppet over Manchuria which they've conquered. This narrative is intercut with his imprisonment and reeducation as a war criminal during the time of MaoTse Tung.

Not so with The Ring. Never have I seen a film that has affected me so.  The images seem to tug at your subconscious at the dark things we keep inside.  I haven't been able to close my eyes without replaying bits of the film behind my eyelids. I have slept with the light on since I've seen it and we can't stop talking about it.  Hands down it was the best the scariest the creepiest and the most intense horror film ever.  The audience in the theater all gripped their armrests breathed heavily and felt everything the characters were experiencing.  It was excellent!  But beware.... don't expect to leave The Ring in the movie theater it will certainly be with you for a long time.".

But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman playing the role of Aidan. My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase playing Samara. After seeing this movie do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison! And do try and watch Ringu as well. A very respectable movie indeed.A good story nice scares decent acting and smooth direction! Enjoy the movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "A one line review of this film would simple be The Ring does what most scary films promise but never deliver'. That should be enough for any scare enthusiast to justify the price of the ticket and for the most part no one will be disappointed. I say for the most part' because it is tough to define what is scary for everyone and I don't deny that this film may not scare many people as easily as others. It must be said however that this film is probably one of the more successful scare flicks in the spirit of movies like The Exorcist'. Well crafted extremely well developed and perfectly executed this remake of the 1998 Japanese Horror film Ringu' is one movie to fit into your top 10 scare flicks. Disturbing from start to end the film quite effectively leaves you writhing in your seat grasping a loved one until its gripping conclusion without a single piece of gore at all. An art often lost on modern films and obviously inspired by the original I have not seen the original the subtle approach to making these kinds of films is delivered to the screen close to an eerie perfection. The Ring is about a tape a tape that features some rather disturbing yet very student film' like snapshots of what can only be described as someone's nightmare. The problem is when the tape concludes the phone rings and a voice tells you that you will die in exactly seven days. When four teenagers die simultaneously at 10pm exactly seven days after secretly staying at a secluded cabin a reporter named Rachel who was the mother of a boy named Aidan who was a cousin to one of the girls decides to investigate. Partially motivated by the will of the dead girls parents to find an answer as to how their daughter's heart simply stopped Rachel successfully finds the tape the group watched. Unfortunately for her she watches it and to her horror she receives a phone call she now has seven days to solve the puzzle or end up like the others. What follows is an exposition mystery about the chilling origins of the tape and the power behind the sudden death of each viewer.Notably there is nothing terribly exceptional about the acting in this film it is by no means truly award worthy. It is however extremely well suited to the film and very well executed. Naomi Watts as Rachel holds up very well as the centrepiece of the film and remains a constant link to the audience making the drama more real. Martin Hendersen as the XHusband Noah was quite well played and David Dorfman as Aidan was not only well cast but will most likely go on to be apart of many more films that involve a child like this very much like the Sixth Sense. The most notable part of this film is its visual and auditory construction which is responsible for creating most of the tension and scares in the film. There is a great deal in the sound design that will go unnoticed by the average moviegoer but it features some very subtle sound ranging from scratching to moans and groans and a few other twisted noises. These are woven into the films music to create a deep sense of abnormality during the films more freaky moments and mood sequences. The visual aspects of the film are close to perfect a delightful blend of colour that looks digitally graded as opposed to filtered. A strong cold blue dominated throughout the entire film very rarely mixed with any warmth at all with the exception of a few scenes. The autumn colours are used quite sharply in contrast to the cold to create another level of abnormality that accompanies the sound design and makes certain aspects of the film standout quite deliberately. From there the camera captures the direction on screen perfectly and with some very well paced editing you end up with a visual treat as much as a formidable film. Much of the story is told with the camera and most of the stories best moments come from effective use of visuals.I am afraid now that I can't go on without spoiling the film except to say that the climax is one of the more simplistic yet terrifying moments I have had in a cinema. To watch the packed audience all twist in their seats gasp and groan in a sort of painful anxiety while the events unfolded on screen was just as much of a treat as the film. This film should scare or at least in the best part disturb you but I am not promising anything as there have been the odd one or two who claim they found nothing frightening in it at all. Still scary or not it is one of the better made Hollywood horror films and more importantly it does not stick to the Hollywood formula not does it give us a Hollywood ending.".

The music is sparse and atmospheric and the images are beautifully shot and edited with great use of filters and composites to give the appropriate washed out looks where necessary. The effects used minimally are flawless and very creepy without seeming garish or overbearing.As with classics like The Changeling and 1963's The Haunting The Ring is a perfect example of how you can still muster a scare from a jaded populace without resorting to cheap jolts and gore. More Blair Witch Project than Sleepaway Camp and thus far more impressive than most recent attempts at terror. Now if I could just stop hiding from my television...".

	schema:reviewBody "I know there will be some misguided souls who stumble into a showing of THE RING believing that it's either a film of Richard Wagner's famous operatic cycle or has something to do with Hobbits. Needless to say they will be in for a surprise.Gore Verbinski's THE RING based on an extremely popular Japanese film and novel is a creepy and disturbing thriller that may do for VCRs what JAWS did for the ocean. After watching a recent sneak preview I couldn't help but imagine people all across the nation going home and throwing out their videocassettes and players in fear that they might accidentally watch the tape that's at the center of this movie.The fastpaced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legendtype set up two high school girls  Katie and Becca  are alone in Katie's home at night. Conversation turns to a videotape that has a horrifying effect. Moments after you watch it the phone rings and a voice tells you Seven days. And exactly a week later you die. Katie reveals to her friend that she watched that tape at a cabin in the woods seven days before. In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn Katie meets her fate and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.Katie's aunt a newspaper reporter named Rachel Naomi Watts is asked by her sister Ruth Lindsay Frost to investigate the death and she soon finds herself drawn into a world that's as dark and claustrophobic as the grave. Pulled in with her are former boyfriend Noah Martin Henderson and their son Aidan David Dorfman.We see the tape in question early on and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images  a ring of light that looks like a solar eclipse dead horses floating in water a woman leaping from a cliff a fly buzzing a stone wall that encloses a well  playing out like a home movie made by David Lynch and Luis Buuel. As the film progresses however we learn that the eerie blackandwhite vignettes are clues to who made the tape and why. I'd hate to give away too much so I'll just say that the answer takes Noah and Rachel to an island where a horse breeder marvelously played by Brian Cox the original and best Hannibal Lecter seems to be hiding a secret that's by turns sad and horrifying.The acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures alltoooften found in horror films and creating realistic intriguing people. I've met and interviewed Naomi and yes she really is that beautiful and charming in person and here she proves once again that she's an outstanding actress.

I'm sure that some purists who've seen the original Japanese film which spawned sequels and a TV series will pick apart this version but for my money this is one case where the remake of a foreign film can stand on its own merits.If you love being scared grab a hold of Verbinski's THE RING and hang on for the ride of your life.".

	onyx:emotionText "I know there will be some misguided souls who stumble into a showing of THE RING believing that it's either a film of Richard Wagner's famous operatic cycle or has something to do with Hobbits. Needless to say they will be in for a surprise.Gore Verbinski's THE RING based on an extremely popular Japanese film and novel is a creepy and disturbing thriller that may do for VCRs what JAWS did for the ocean. After watching a recent sneak preview I couldn't help but imagine people all across the nation going home and throwing out their videocassettes and players in fear that they might accidentally watch the tape that's at the center of this movie.The fastpaced suspense film begins in Seattle with an urban legendtype set up two high school girls  Katie and Becca  are alone in Katie's home at night. Conversation turns to a videotape that has a horrifying effect. Moments after you watch it the phone rings and a voice tells you Seven days. And exactly a week later you die. Katie reveals to her friend that she watched that tape at a cabin in the woods seven days before. In a brilliantly edited sequence that is sure to make you drop your popcorn Katie meets her fate and we learn that the tale of the tape is no mere kids' story.Katie's aunt a newspaper reporter named Rachel Naomi Watts is asked by her sister Ruth Lindsay Frost to investigate the death and she soon finds herself drawn into a world that's as dark and claustrophobic as the grave. Pulled in with her are former boyfriend Noah Martin Henderson and their son Aidan David Dorfman.We see the tape in question early on and at first it appears to be just a random series of weird images  a ring of light that looks like a solar eclipse dead horses floating in water a woman leaping from a cliff a fly buzzing a stone wall that encloses a well  playing out like a home movie made by David Lynch and Luis Buuel. As the film progresses however we learn that the eerie blackandwhite vignettes are clues to who made the tape and why. I'd hate to give away too much so I'll just say that the answer takes Noah and Rachel to an island where a horse breeder marvelously played by Brian Cox the original and best Hannibal Lecter seems to be hiding a secret that's by turns sad and horrifying.The acting in THE RING is fabulous throughout with the actors stretching well beyond the caricatures alltoooften found in horror films and creating realistic intriguing people. I've met and interviewed Naomi and yes she really is that beautiful and charming in person and here she proves once again that she's an outstanding actress.

It is derived from a superior story and translated to American film superbly regardless of what the naysayers say. And while it starts off typically it ascends into a beautiful darkling twisted genuinely creepy story which holds you through to the end.Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots and suspenseful progression.Actually I found this far superior to most horrors done in the last thirty years or so. A lot has been said about Ringu the work from which this was adapted for American cinema and inevitable subsequent comparisons made however that is certainly NOT the case. That argument is moot as this work was based on the novel The Ring by Koji Suzuki so if you want something to which an honest comparison may be made I would suggest you read the book and leave Ringu where it belongs. Personally I found the American adaptation much more to my liking than Ringu.This is one twisted little creepfest! It rates an 8.710 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:headline " One Of The Most Horrifying Movies In My Early Teens...";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when I was only 13 and I didn't switch on the TV for 2 weeks after I saw this movie. I cursed my parents for taking me to watch it in the theatres I was so afraid. After I actually lived for more than 2 weeks I was feeling better and have watched it and The Ring 2 many times since then. The Ring 2 didn't match expectations. But that is my next review I will explain in that. The Ring and The Sixth Sense were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. Gore Verbinski directs this movie which is a Japanese movie remake. This film and The Grudge spawned all those bad Asian remakes in the coming years.Anyway coming to the story Rachel Keller Naomi Watts is a journalist in Seattle city. Her sister's daughter died under mysterious circumstances and when she investigates she finds out about an urban myth according to which a person after seeing a video dies exactly after a week. Her son had predicted his cousin's death before it had actually happened. She also watches the tape and knows that she is going to die within the week. Along with her boyfriend she tries to find the reason behind the killer video and finds a strange and creepy story behind it. Can she save her son from Samara Morgan Daveigh Chase the girl in the video? Will Samara rest in peace? The beautiful and talented Naomi Watts captures Rachel's motherly instincts perfectly. Rachel is the only person to uncover anything about the video. So far all the others simply died without knowing anything about Samara and her adopted parents. The son Aidan Keller David Dorfman is actually very creepy because his tone is very adultlike. He is no Haley Joel Osment The Sixth Sense Artificial Intelligence but he really made me nervous. The film worked on many levels mainly because the director does not go over the top with cheesy special effects. The backstory is really coherent and the film is completely sure of itself and that is a major plus of the film. It doesn't have long pauses in the story just to push the running time as in many horror movies. For adults the film may not be that scary but it works as a thriller as well. Brian Cox as Richard Morgan is also very good. The story about the horses is something I had never seen before and it was amazing. When the plot unfolds and we know Samara's story it is not too difficult to sympathize with her fate. A very satisfying horror movie which will be classic in the future.910".

	schema:reviewBody "My husband took me to see this film and when he said it was a horror I was expecting to sit through another of his kind of horror films i.e.stupid teenagers with lots of gratuitous blood guts and violence thrown in. I was fortunately very mistaken! I have not seen the original Ringu which everyone keeps harping on about but I am glad I saw this first as it is good not to have anything to compare it to. Taken by itself I think it is a fantastic film. It's not everyone's cup of tea and the usual horror fans may think it slow incomprehensible or just plain unscary. However I loved the mystery and weirdness of it.It begins a bit like your typical American nonsense with two teenage girls chatting and the conversation coming around to a videotape that is supposed to kill people that watch it. My first thought was how urban legendish and ridiculous!! However as the film went on it clearly had a darker more powerful and very much more thought provoking aspect. The images on the videotape itself are so nightmarish in that disjointed and freaky way that real nightmares can be. They really got under my skin anyway and I actually came to believe in the power the tape had to kill. You  wonder how on earth Rachel is going to escape the same fate as the others and I felt real horror and despair on her discovery that Aidan has also watched the tape.One thing that I think really robs horror films of their ultimate horror value is when you come to the explanationdiscovery of what's behind it all at the end. I thought the film had let itself down with a typical rationalised ending. I was very pleasantly surprised with the horrifying twist that developed and I loved the eerie nonending ending  it left me really freaked out and actually believing that the whole thing might be real after all. It is wonderful psychologically terrifying stuff and I defy anyone to watch it and forget it  I am still thinking about it and giving myself the shivers months later! I won't give any film 1010 as this is the ultimate and I am always challenging for there to be an even better film out there this film does exist and is Ringu if everyone else's comments are anything to go by. I give it a superior must see 910.".

The writing directing performances and replay value are amazing in and of themselves. I especially love the premise and I will review this movie as it's own film not a remake. What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is topnotch because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.Do not get me wrong the material itself is great but it would have been nothing were it not for the cast. The characters are all interesting and the main story is quite saddening and effective when it is slowly revealed through many different aspects. While it seems as though the main threat a killer videotape would be a ridiculous and stupid threat hard to make convincing it undoubtedly works to the fullest here and is entirely convincing the videotape's images and the events themselves all being very interesting and entertaining. While the movie is not a masterpiece it is not too short from it having a great replay value and being one of the top 20 most effective horrors of the 00s in my opinion. I am glad it receives a lot of positive reception for it deserves every bit of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "These last years apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow Kill Bill 20032004 was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot. In the derivative the Last Samurai 2003 Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant Lost in Translation 2003. Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper Ringu 1998. Against all odds he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. Mousehunt 1997 was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but the Mexican 2001 was a lame movie. Some friends had told me don't watch the Ring it's a hokey movie. I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. The Ring could well illustrate this famous premise to understand evil we've got to go back to the sources....What distinguishes the Ring from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is wellcrafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides what is notable in the Ring is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten.The thrust of the Ring isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness the figure at the window a hint at Psycho? 1960 might symbolize parental severity.That said Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks. Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense 1999. When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well you get the picture. But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.I repeat it I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches it can be gratifying. And in the case of the Ring rightly so...A sequel the Ring 2 opened last year. Is it worthwhile?".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the American take on the Japanese original and while it absorbs its source material intact it twists around its formula a bit in order to make it fit its new surroundings. The story is the same a journalist after losing her niece to a mysterious circumstance investigates and discovers a cursed videotape which gives a viewer only seven days to live.Like its predecessors the film doesn't spend that much time on the supernatural elements but focuses more on the mystery. However The Ring features a lot more supernatural elements immediately and throughout the film than either previous version perhaps to make more obvious and visceral the impending doom that faces our protagonist. Visually The Ring has been injected with a shot of adrenaline being less the brooding mystery of the original and more immediate and menacing. The color palette is colder than Ringu and the story is also more detached and focused on the ghostly mechanics than the human story which leads the film to be more recognizably intimidating.The story itself is a little more mysterious in that the backstory of our villain is rather thin and unexplained. Furthermore the villain is clearly portrayed as senselessly malevolent this weakens at least two significant scenes. The ending I think is more clever than the previous versions. I like that there is something to the relationship between the protagonist Rachel and her ally Noah but it still seems a little weak when compared to Ringuwhere one line can effortlessly show the development in the relationship.As far as a horror movie goes The Ring is a blunt but nonetheless creepy example. Losing some of the trappings of its predecessors helps simplify the story for faster flow and to create room for more visual creepiness but also loses some of the complexity that helped the story have more depth. It's more of impressive frightfest than Ringu but is a little weaker in story resonance. In the end that makes The Ring just as effective overall if you want more chills catch this version. If you want more meat catch Ringu. Decent entertainment. 710.".

	schema:headline " A good scary film  but please watch Ringu to see how good it SHOULD be";
	schema:reviewBody "A rumour is going around about a video tape that may have some sort of killer virus on it.  Anyone who watches it dies mysteriously seven days later.  Naturally disbelieving the whole nonsense journalist Rachel Keller decides to investigate further when a relative of hers supposedly views the tape and dies seven days later.  She finds the tape and watches it enlisting the help of video expert Noah to help her uncover where the tape was made.  Can she solve the tape's secrets before 7 days are up?OK.  It's important to know where a reviewers bench mark is before you judge where they are coming from.  So let me say that I saw Ringu a year back and it really freaked me out.  So as you can imagine I came to this half expecting it to be a rubbish remake of a film that I didn't see any need to remake.  However it was better than I had feared and probably will stand out as one of the best horror movies of 2003 when it is released in the UK. The plot has changed slightly from the original but not really to the detriment of the film  it actually helps it be more modern and more believable now that it's in America.The film's main problem for me was the fact that it went for the jump scares' rather than creepy scares' which Ringu had.  Here we have more sudden movements where Ringu moved slowly and deliberately.  Ring does this well at points too but for most it will always go for the jump rather than the unnerving creep.  However I defy anyone not to get a little creeped out by the remake as well.  If I hadn't seen Ringu I know I would have enjoyed this more  but I only kept remembering how well it was done in the first place.  For example THAT scene viewers will know what I mean is too quick and too jumpy in Ring whereas in Ringu it was slow deliberate and terrifying in it's sheer unnerving horror.  Likewise in ring we see the child'' face a lot more which detracts from the fear of the unknown  in Ringu it was more of the long hair.The performances are not as good as Ringu in some respects.  Watts is very good and is believably scared.  Henderson is OK but I wanted a more mature man rather than a surferdude type.  The support cast were all good with Brian Cox thrown into the mix.  My only pause for concern was Dorfman  why was he allowed to change the character of the boy? In Ringu he was a normal kid here he comes across like a poor man's Haley Joel Osmond in 6th Sense? His routine took away from the emotional involvement that should have come with the danger he was in  instead he just comes across as difficult.  The performance is OK but 1 the change to the character is strange and unnecessary and 2 it just felt a little too like the 6th Sense!Overall I enjoyed the film and was scared at some points.  However too often it went for the jump rather than just being consistently unnerving as Ringu was.  Fans of Ringu may dislike this but I think those who haven't seen the original will enjoy this.  Word of advice though  go out and find a copy of the original and watch it first you'll enjoy it a lot more and it'll show you why Hollywood fell over themselves to try and copy it in a more commercial way.".

	schema:reviewBody "After her niece and three of her niece's friends mysteriously die on the same night at the same time but in different circumstances reporter Rachel Keller Naomi Watts hears the rumors of a video that when seen curses the viewer so that they die in 7 days. She investigates the phenomenon with the aid of her ex Noah Clay Martin Henderson. They end up seeing the video. Can they figure out a solution in time?For my money although the Japanese original upon which this film is based Ringu 1998 is worth watching this Gore Verbinskidirected U.S. version is superior in many ways having none of the flaws but all of the assets and then some.I'm going to do something unusual and examine the differences between the two films by detailing just a portion of one scene present in both. I think the examination reveals why the U.S. film is superior. The scene is the tail end of the opening which results in a death. Here's how it goes in Ringu Tomoko Oishi's Yuko Takeuchi television mysteriously turns on to a baseball game as she's looking inside the refrigerator. She looks up above the door surprised. We get a reverse shot. We can see the television through frosted glass in the next room. A steadicam follows her from behind peeking around the corner with her. We cut back to her face which is relatively expressionless. We go back to a rear shot and see her walk to the remote and shut off the television. She turns around and walks back to the kitchen pouring herself a drink. We cut to a lowerangled closer shot. We hear a noise. A subtle fear crosses her face. She trembles. Cut to a close shot from over her shoulder. Suddenly she turns around frightened. The frame freezes and quickly turns a bluegraytinted negative color. Here's how it goes in The Ring Katie Embry Amber Tamblyn is in the kitchen just about to drink when the television turns on by itself to static. She stops dead in her tracks her glass just barely touching her lips. Cut to a close up of her slowly turning her head and looking at the television horrified. Almost achingly slowly the camera creeps around the corner to show us the television. We see Katie look for any sign of an intruder. She sees the remote on the chair but no one is around. She hurriedly shuts off the television then walks away trying to rationalize the event. Before she can get out of the room the television turns on again. She stops again and turns even slower. The camera slowly creeps into a medium shot of Katie with the television and its static reflected in a pane of glass. She runs over and puts her face right next to the television. We see this from a fantastically skewed angle which distorts the television screen sticking one end right in our face. We get an insert of Katie yanking the plug. Sparks shoot out. Back to the skewed angle but now the screen is blank. We circle around slightly. Suddenly there's a noise from the kitchen. Katie gasps and turns around. Slowly she peeks into the kitchen just in time to see the refrigerator door open by itself. She runs to shut it now breathing heavily. She mutters to herself and begins looking around with a very subtle panic on her face. As she quickly turns towards the hallway the camera rapidly changes focus. We cut to an interesting overhead angle on the stairway. Katie appears peeking around the corner. She calls for her friend Becca. She trots up the stairs. We cut to a beautiful extremely low angle of the upstairs hallway which exaggerates the perspective. As we see Katie reach the top of the stairs we also see water slowly flowing into the hall from beneath a door. The camera stays at the low angle until Katie reaches the water. We cut to a close up. She's scared and bewildered then trembling. We get an extreme close up of the door handle as her hand comes gradually into the focal range. She grabs the handle. Another closeup of her face. Cut to the interior of the roomher bedroom. Katie flings open the door horrified. With a series of extremely fast cuts we see a snippet of the Ring video on the television set in her bedroom. Cut back to Katie. A super fast zoom to her distorted horrific face. Then back to the Ring video in a series of quick cuts before the entire screen goes to static.The point here isn't that the U.S. version is longer. Rather it's to exemplify the attention to craft from technical to emotional aspects. Verbinski's pacing is much more deliberate and varied creating intense suspense. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. There is an obsession with details from those that integrate and propel the story to those that are artistically striking. The construction is much more complex but every shot is analyzed for relevance. Every angle exists for a reason. The ornate aesthetics amp up the effect of the story. This approach isn't unique to the opening scene but occurs throughout the film including the famed Ring video itself. The music is also better here and is better integrated into the film. The performances are excellent with Aidan Keller David Dorfman just as creepy and disturbing as the antagonist Samara Morgan Daveigh Chase. As would be expected for U.S. audiences Verbinski includes a lot more exposition in his film working in explanatory material from Ringu 2 as well as new material exploring Samara's history. It works well here as the story is much tighter. Everything eventually fits together like pieces of a puzzle and it gives the Ring video and the varied settings of the film more relevance.".

	schema:reviewBody "My girlfriend and I saw the original in Japanese and we both agree that the US version is much more suspenseful and scarier than the Japanese one with the exception of some extraordinarily creepy sequences in the Japanese version. One of the small but significant changes from the original was that the Japanese version had the girl's face mostly hidden by her hair and she never makes eye contact which I found more effective than Verbinski's treatment. The original also had one scene that I thought was a bit creepier than the remake when the girl comes to attack the man. Other than that the changes made were mostly positive.Japanese plots tend to be short on causality and detail so the story changes which add about a half hour to the original story line serve to make the plot coherent to Westerners. The production values in Japan make the fairly highbudget original with Alist actors look like a Bmovie to people accustomed to Hollywood films. The ending shows the difference between cultures since in the original Japanese the woman appeals to her father for help.There are holes in the plot as many people have pointed out in reviews. Those that remain are either intentional like those relating to the essentially unsolved mystery of the tapes and the girl or were left over from the original Japanese.The lighting and deliberately limited spectrum enhance the mood of the film greatly. The attack on the exboyfriend occurring during daylight hours is surprisingly effective even though it flouts the normal rules of horror films. One of the things I liked most about this movie is that it is a bit unconventional through a combination of good director choices and some fresh ideas borrowed from Japan. People who were expecting to see a killemall slasher flick were probably disappointed by the relatively slow pace in the building of the story and suspense.Overall I found the film to be a very good treatment of the original story and a fairly creepy horror movie too. It doesn't try to startle you into being frightened it doesn't offer lots of gore and shocking violence and it doesn't play down to the audience. The result is a slightly cerebral and haunting movie. There are some images and scenes that will stay with you and still give you the creeps for quite some time after you see it.".

Yes the world of entertainment has notably been going through a bit of a trend over the past decade or so... any successful property no matter how old or young or how highly or lowly regarded it may be can and will likely be revisited with one of those labels slapped on.From a business perspective it makes sense. Familiarity and recognizable names are an invaluable thing to have in the world of entertainment with millions upon millions riding in the balance and audiences fickle of which original properties they'll give a chance to or not. But from a personal perspective there are plenty of people who are getting sick of the remakes and reboots. Because they think it represents the loss of original ideas or does a disservice to the original works.But the reason why I personally cannot wholly dismiss goodold remakes reboots etc. is because for every few terrible cashgrab retreads... for every couple needlessly gritty retellings... for every handful of just plain awful retreads... there's at least one good one. Sometimes even one fantastic one. A rarity that rivals the original honoring it while also functioning well as its own artistic piece.The Ring a 2002 horror film from director Gore Verbinski is one such film.Taking inspiration from the worldwide phenomena that is director Hideo Nakata's Japanese thriller Ringu or Ring inspired by the novels of Koji Suzuki The Ring is a stirring thrilling and often chilling excursion into the world of supernatural terror.After her niece is killed under mysterious circumstances journalist Rachel Keller Naomi Watts probes her death soon discovering it is connected to a mysterious video cassette containing a series of disturbing and twisted images... soon after a phonecall with the cryptic message of seven days warns her of her impending doom. Together with her ex Noah Martin Henderson and young son Aiden David Dorfman Rachel must solve the mystery of this supernatural video in order to save her life.One of the most important things a remake must do in order to justify its own existence is to not only give honor and homage to the original but also explore the concept storyline and characters in new relevant and interesting ways. And that most certainly is one of the main strengths of The Ring. It takes the basic premise presented in the Nakata original but builds upon and subverts the circumstances of the story in order to retain a degree of freshness. While most noticeable in the obvious and necessary differences in American and Japanese cultures and horror the film also does a lot of other new and interesting things with the very concept itself and the characters to differentiate the two stories. But it never loses sight of what made the original so effective that being the grand mystery aspect and the oldfashioned ghoststory. You can watch it immediately after the original and still not quite know where it's going while still appreciating the wonderful homages to the original and the familiarity of the story. That's perhaps one of the best things a remake can do... present something familiar but give it just enough of a new spin that it feels fresh once again. Which is sadly something most other remakes fail to heed with many either being too much a slave to the original or too far removed from it.The other great strength of the film is the wonderfully oppressive and dreary visual direction courtesy Verbinski. While he is perhaps most noted as the bigbudget director of fare such as Pirates of the Caribbean and The Lone Ranger I've often found that his strongest work is his more intimate and lowbudget... particularly the quirky drama The Weather Man and this film. Here he paints a beautiful and dark portrait of terror using strong composition and subtle moments of striking fear to create an absolute atmosphere of dread. Along with his keen use of elements like rain muted color and quick cutting Verbinksi crafts a wonderful visual guidance that brings you right into the film. Combined with the cool deathly palate of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli and the freakish and mournful music of Hans Zimmer Verbinski is able to craft the perfect visual and audible horror experience to tell this tale.The performances of the cast are also quite magnificent. In particular Watts who is just perfect in her role. There's a great sense of both personal strength and selfdoubt that she fills Keller with and it makes the character memorable and easily identifiable. Definitely one of the best horrormovie leads of its decade.If I were to nitpick the film's few weaknesses I'd have to say it's biggest issue is that it can occasionally fall for the rare clich and predictable moment. And I'd be lying if I said I couldn't help but compare it to the stellar original which was on the whole just a touch more startling and cohesive an experience. Especially in the way the story comes together in the end and you discover just what's happening and why... it seemed almost a little too farfetched in this remake in comparison to the original.Still those minor flaws cannot detract from the overall film and it remains not only a great film on its own right but also a prime example of why remakes shouldn't be outwardly dismissed without being given a proper chance. If it weren't for remakes we wouldn't have fantastic works like this.I give The Ring a fantastic 9 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans of mystery horror and suspense!".

Before I get scolded for giving this airtime when it's based on a Japanese fright flick I've seen that one and I think this is the stronger film same goes for The Grudge. It's just got such a personality all its own. Watts plays Rachel a journalist who stumbles on an eerie mystery after a suspicious death in the family. She's led to a videotape containing stark disturbing black and white images a video tape that's purported to kill you in seven days upon watching it. She of course watches it spurring on a delirious search for the truth behind it before it's too late. She's led from dreary rain streaked Seattle to a remote horse farm on an island off the coast the adopted home of a strange little girl with some vaguely terrifying abilities named Samara Daveigh Chase also Donnie Darko's little sister and Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. Underrated Martin Henderson plays a colleague who helps her out in the investigation and creepy little David Dorfman is her strange kid. Brian Cox as Samara's adopted father walks away with his segment of the film giving him fierce heartbreak and fear. Heart stopping secrets are unleashed and the threatening presence grows and follows Rachel. I like that the film never really clarifies exactly what is wrong with Samara just makes it very clear that it's something very wrong which for me is much scarier than spelling it out in bland exposition. There's some skin crawling moments in this one mostly iconic now but I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it and will say no more than the sequences involving a well a television and of course the omnipresent video tape are highlights. It all looks fantastic too the colours absent in favour of a suffocating monochromatic tone punctuated occasionally by gasping breaths of red in the fall colours at the motel she visits and a few other moments of brief vibrance among the gloom. A true fright flick that takes its time ratchets up a slow mounting fear and releases it in short bursts of stinging shock moments bridged by lapses of pure atmosphere.".

The suspenseful pace the incredible beautiful but haunting visuals make this a unique experience. I love gory films but this one relies a lot more on psychological horror and imagery to create scares. No jump scares just good story telling.The movie may not answer all the questions it creates but the viewer if he pays attention accordingly will be able to figure them out for himself.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a quote from the trailer for 1963 film version of THE HAUNTING What does it take to prove to you that the dead don't always rest in peace? Well the question is about to be answered in Gore Verbinski's clever and very frightening adaptation of the Japanese movie RINGU.It tells the urban legendlike story of a cursed video that when viewed will bring death unto the viewer within seven days  no less no more. As a matter of fact the tongueincheek beginning in which two teenage girls are chattering about this video sets the stage which inexorably details the unspeakable fate which is about to befall to one of the girls Katie played by JOAN OF ARCADIA star Amber Tamblyn the first of four victims to die in an inexplicable fashion.Enter Katie's aunt Rachel Naomi Harris a reporter called on by her sister to find out about what lead to her death. Rachel learns that Karie and three other friends died at exactly 10 o'clock at the same time and notices that pictures taken at a trip to a remote lodge reveal blurry almost monstrous faces... as if their very images had been completely corrupted. She heads out to this lodge picks up the video by chance rents a room views the tape  which is a collection of disturbing artmovie images... and gets a call in which she has seven days to live.And as simple as that the story of THE RING takes off into uncharted territory as Verbinski develops the events stemming off from the act of viewing this tape while simultaneously trying to find out about its nature where it comes from who made it why does it even exist. Because Rachel only has seven days to solve this mystery as does her exhusband Noah who has seen the tape and because their own son's life is also in danger the tension is greatly heightened. Matters must be settled because it's becoming progressively clear that this is no ordinary tape and because things are getting more and more complicated and the noose is tightening.Verbinski brings forth the backstory surrounding this tape expertly a little at a time almost casually. One is led to believe the woman in the video  Anna Morgan  is the person to focus on but this is far from the truth as are several other details surrounding the illfated Morgan family. This is a trick that Hitchcock used fairly regularly in all of his suspense films and Verbinski clearly knows his suspense in not revealing too much too soon and misleading his viewers he fools them. Adding surreal elements of imminent danger about to manifest itself at every turn only amps up the terror and one sequence is a definite standout. While heading to a secluded island on a ferry a horse sensing something other than Rachel's presence or reacting to her taint since she has seen this cursed tape and is marked by its black energy breaks free from where it's being kept and threatens to cause some grievous bodily harm to someone anyone on the ferry. What happens to that horse is as horrifying as anything committed on screen even more so than the film's denouement and forces us to realize we are entering into a world of true absolute evil.The thing is to fall right into the heart of a mystery can be one of the most awful things anyone can experience and Rachel here being the Final Girl does just that. More than a reporter she is the person who penetrates the inner circle that lies within the images of the video but also in doing so she is also the one who releases its will upon the world and perpetuates its existence. Like the ring from LORD OF THE RINGS like many of Stephen King's monsters and skeletons from his own books Bad Things Want To Be Found because pain and terror are the things in which they feed on.Relentlessly disturbing THE RING is proof that one doesn't need to spell it out to be terrifying. The mundane has become chaos the third wall has been broken and the author of this hellish nightmare has come to vampirize on our very souls. An excellent horror film made better because of its deft direction precise acting rich atmosphere and the law that having no explanation for the whys is the best approach.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is a quote from the trailer for 1963 film version of THE HAUNTING What does it take to prove to you that the dead don't always rest in peace? Well the question is about to be answered in Gore Verbinski's clever and very frightening adaptation of the Japanese movie RINGU.It tells the urban legendlike story of a cursed video that when viewed will bring death unto the viewer within seven days  no less no more. As a matter of fact the tongueincheek beginning in which two teenage girls are chattering about this video sets the stage which inexorably details the unspeakable fate which is about to befall to one of the girls Katie played by JOAN OF ARCADIA star Amber Tamblyn the first of four victims to die in an inexplicable fashion.Enter Katie's aunt Rachel Naomi Harris a reporter called on by her sister to find out about what lead to her death. Rachel learns that Karie and three other friends died at exactly 10 o'clock at the same time and notices that pictures taken at a trip to a remote lodge reveal blurry almost monstrous faces... as if their very images had been completely corrupted. She heads out to this lodge picks up the video by chance rents a room views the tape  which is a collection of disturbing artmovie images... and gets a call in which she has seven days to live.And as simple as that the story of THE RING takes off into uncharted territory as Verbinski develops the events stemming off from the act of viewing this tape while simultaneously trying to find out about its nature where it comes from who made it why does it even exist. Because Rachel only has seven days to solve this mystery as does her exhusband Noah who has seen the tape and because their own son's life is also in danger the tension is greatly heightened. Matters must be settled because it's becoming progressively clear that this is no ordinary tape and because things are getting more and more complicated and the noose is tightening.Verbinski brings forth the backstory surrounding this tape expertly a little at a time almost casually.

	schema:reviewBody "I have always puzzled over criticisms that this film is a soulless cashin of a superior Japanese horror film intended for low attentionspan teenagers. While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.The Japanese RING is effective because of the stark realism and dry terror it evokes the remake takes the opposite route taking on a nightmarish and surreal atmosphere. While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity THE RING creeps forward with a languid contemplative pace. Criticisms for being slow are inevitable but to those who can appreciate it THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes. One is not likely to forget the shot of the well bathed in blue or the leaves lighting up as if they were on fire. But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart. Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions and scandal with tragedy. Kruger also adds layers to the film introducing arcing themes of parenthood the nature of children and empathy.Parenthood is examined in a number of places in the film. Naomi Watts' character a crass and insensitive journalist is also an uncaring mother not wanting to acknowledge the distance between her and her son. Martin Henderson's Noah is a deadbeat dad afraid of taking responsibility of the child. Jane Alexander as the Moesko Island doctor talks to Watts about her mentally retarded grandson. We loved him anyway she says. It takes work. Some people have limits. She is indirectly talking about the Morgans whose daughter shows them the worstcase scenario of becoming a parent. The extent to which they go when dealing with their child is horrifying. Aidan and Samara have a subtle relationship in that they are both victims of parents struggling with their role as parents. It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother and the empathy she creates with the neglected daughter Samara Morgan's plight ultimately reflects on her own son.There is a lot more to this film than one would think. The final climax with the television has its own dark edge even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out. The final scene brings up a moral dilemma though that rivals the original in resonance.For added insight watch the DON'T WATCH THIS feature on the DVD. There is one scene between Rachel and her sister Ruth that should not have been cut from the film their conversation reflects directly another motherchild relationship and how involved a parent should be with their children.Great film one of the best horror films in years. 910.".

The pace keeps the movie going and kept me from getting bored. The writing manages to be both dramatic and witty. The guest starring rappers actually turned out better than I expected. The only downside I found was an excessive use of profanity. It could have benefited from just a little less in some instances. The cast is primarily male and mostly newcomers and music industry celebs. Considering this is a Cop vs. Gangster movie that's understandable. The addition of a female gangster or cop would have made it more interesting but it doesn't detract from it's current status. I think it could have very well have been a TV Show on a cable network providing the opportunity to delve further into the lives and motives of the characters. All in all it was worth the time spent watching it even though it was shorter than an average movie. I definitely recommend that people check this movie out when they have a chance especially if you're bored with the Hollywood hotshots and big name blockbuster action flicks that spend more money on big explosion effects than on hiring actors or writers with actual talent. It was a breathe of fresh air despite the gritty city feel. I predict that we haven't seen the last of DJ Naylor the star of the movie or the director Anghus Houvouras. I know that I for one am anticipating seeing both again as they have quite a bit of talent.".

	schema:reviewBody "20 Funerals was a good drama from relatively new director Anghus Houvouras. Mark Mench played Sean Kietel a cop who had had enough of criminals getting the upper hand while more cops were getting the short end of the stick. The real standout in this movie was D.J. Naylor who played Marcus Chase. Naylor resembles a more hardcore buffed out  tattooed Vin Diesel. His charisma carried the movie and to be honest it needed it. Like other reviewers I would like to see more of Naylor in the future. With the right coaching he could be one of the next big action stars.Other than the original plot which consisted of four cops being fed up with the system decide to go into business for themselves and stop playing by the book. Instead of arresting criminals they killed them not having to worry about lawyers bad juries and judges putting them back out into the street. I liked this idea very much but the movie turned into nothing more than a countdown of the top 20 criminals being hunted down with unoriginal gunfights interrogations  dialog. The original idea along with the ending is what makes it stand out for me otherwise I would have rated this movie much lower.At times the camera work and the inability to throw convincing punches reminded me that I was watching a straighttovideo movie and detracted from the experience as a whole. That and the weak story brought my overall rating down. Recommended if you like low budget cops vs gangster movies. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "20 Funerals is the latest film to hit DVD from Wilmington NC filmmaker Anghus Houvouras Fearsome Thugs Got Game. It's the story of a group of cops who after the death of a fellow officer decide to use some unconventional methods. Twenty names make up their list of scum that must be removed from the street in order to clean things up. The plan comes with a strong set of rules in order to keep things organised but some rules are made to be broken. Things begin to turn sour when the cops are inevitably called upon to investigate the cases they're creating themselves.It's a clever concept that could easily have been created by the mind of Quinton Tarantino and has some impressive dialog to match. This film is a must see for anyone with a dark sense of humour or love for violence action hiphop or simply independent cinema.Being an independent filmmaker myself with many influences and heroes I know how easy it is to stick nods to personal favourites into a script. Quite often these can come across out of place and character. But in 20 Funerals the writerdirector manages to tie in references to pop culture and Greek mythology and use them to the scripts advantage. He is able to add depth and realism to the characters and the world they live in.Clocking in at just less than eighty minutes the film is a tad on the short side. However apart from adding three of four more funerals there's little that could be done with this. The film tells its story in a clear and cool way but does come with a few faults. Sadly the opening sequence doesn't come across too strong but this is soon forgiven and forgot when the film sets itself on track. What follows is a set of great performances from the leads including DJ Naylor Mark Mench and the majority of the supporting cast backed up by a solid HipHop soundtrack and great visuals.I was hooked from the moment the 20 Funerals plan came into play and stayed gripped throughout. With plenty of plot twists character developments and outside party intervention the film kept me on the edge of my seat. While watching you get a strong sense of the fun and hard work put in by the cast and crew which makes the whole experience even more gratifying. I look forward with great anticipation for this exciting filmmakers next piece 'Dead Heist'.".

	schema:reviewBody " BEWARE  MILD SPOILERS I just finished watching an early screener copy of this film by Anghus Houvouras. It stars DJ Naylor as one of four cops who following the killing of a guy in their department go vigilante and work their way up the criminal food chain of the city taking out gangsters and lowlifes as necessary. After all there's nothing that can't be solved by 20 Funerals.The film has a slightly weak opening sequence where we see the cop killed followed by an overly long credit sequence. It sets up the premise of the film okay but interweaving the credits with a more tense intimate scene for the undercover bust and eventual murder would have boosted the opening up a notch.Luckily once their pal is dead and buried it soon picks up thanks to some great acting by all four leads with particular props going to DJ Naylor and Mark Mench. DJ effortlessly portrays the conflicted heroantihero torn between doing the right thing and doing the right thing. Herein lies the film's real strength what could have simple been entertaining pulp violence is supported by a tight script good performances and most importantly and plot and characters to care about and that sustain our interest. Retribution for murdering a cop seems justified and when Chase Naylor slams down a wad of evidence against each and every target we don't question the validity of their mission. But as one soontobevictim pleads for his life petrified with fear and asking for a second chance for the sake of his wife and kids the morality of their quest is suddenly in doubt. And far from ignoring such issues the situation creates doubts within the team. We watch with avid interest as these issues drive some of the characters to empathise with their victims breaking one of the main rules of their mission  We don't let it get personal and others to beyond rationality.It is here that Mark Mench really shines stealing the show from even the fantastic DJ Naylor with an enthusiasm and depraved maniacism reminiscent of Dogma's Jason Lee. By his most fanatical scene his Detective Keitel has undergone a complete character arc either changed by what's happened or simple freed by their success to unleash his inner demons.Inevitably given the structure of the film it struggles to find an ending to match the brilliance of what has come before but the twist in the final moments satisfies none the less and overall the movie works very well. Great visuals a cool soundtrack some killer lines and some hilarious moments make for a highly entertaining film.Well worth checking out when it hits DVD on June 7th 2005.".

Infighting famine and disease took their toll on the survivors. Now twenty years after the bombs fell and the plagues ran their course the few that remain live in fear and without hope. Azura Skye stars as Sarah in this PostApocalyptic Fairy Tale about a young woman's journey to deliver the first child born in 15 Years. Sarah's refusal to give up is inspired by a lone voice on her radio. Michael broadcasts dim and distant messages of hope mixed with the music he scavenges from the dead. Forced from her basement home by drought and relentlessly pursued by those who want her baby Sarah crosses paths with Michael in a cavernous underground refuge of disparate survivors. It is from Three Caves that Michael and Sarah will embark on a journey beyond the boundaries of the Southern Corridor and into the unknown future.";

They even threw in a Harper LeeFaulknerian idiot manchild or two.

Not to mention one of the twins mimed an absolutely ridiculous Carl Spackler lip grimace throughout the whole movie. The South sure hasn't changed much has it? The most confusing element of the whole film is the ventriloquist dummies that just seem to have absolutely no purpose whatsoever to the plot other than to utilize the fact that those things give everybody the damned creeps however even this clich is not developed logically.The only reason I even spent time on this review is to recoup the wasted time and money spent on this clunker by exacting revenge...As the end credits rolled on this film my 11 year old son completely unprovoked said I spent so much time on this thing just now.

We have the seemingly obligatoryfor movies of this type radio man Joshuaplaying music and messages from his bunkerto anybody left in the world with equipment to hear him. We have pregnant Sarahwho's husband was killed 6 months beforewith her mother Margaretsurviving in an abandoned basementuntil the homes real owner Samuel arrives on the scene and convinces them to venture forth to find or start a better life. And we have the also obligatory bad guysthis time searching for the as yet unborn baby.So what was it that let this movie down?It certainly wasn't the acting.Whilst not overly convincingeveryone plays their part reasonably well and special mention should go to Reg E. Cathey as Samuel as a stand out though he doesn't get enough screen time here. Some of the bad guyshenchmen were a bit naff but nothing awful. Even the minimal action scenes were done reasonably well.What lets this one down is the fact that so much that happens doesn't make a lot of sense.No explanation is made as to why the bad guys want the baby. One of the bad guys is actually pregnant Sarah's brother.He has no idea the baby he is searching for is his sisters.Why?No back story or explanation is given. Apparently Sarah is THE only pregnant woman left despite the fact there are plenty of seemingly healthy men and women left.Why?There were many head scratching moments......Howeverthis was for me still a watchable movie despite it's flaws and I remained reasonably entertained until the end.So to quote a many repeated IMDb phrase from so many reviews......Not the bestbut very far from being the worst.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've read a lot of the reviews for this movie and I believe it has been judged a little too harshly.There are far worse movies out there than this but heythat's other reviewers opinions and I respect that.This is yet another low budgetafter the apocalypse effort that for a change actually has actors that act and not just turn up for the pay cheque.As the title suggeststhis is set 20 years after the apocalypsethat had forced people to live underground in basementsbunkers and caves.Nowin a slowly recovering worldpeople are venturing up and outwards in an effort to continue civilisation. We have the seemingly obligatoryfor movies of this type radio man Joshuaplaying music and messages from his bunkerto anybody left in the world with equipment to hear him. We have pregnant Sarahwho's husband was killed 6 months beforewith her mother Margaretsurviving in an abandoned basementuntil the homes real owner Samuel arrives on the scene and convinces them to venture forth to find or start a better life. And we have the also obligatory bad guysthis time searching for the as yet unborn baby.So what was it that let this movie down?It certainly wasn't the acting.Whilst not overly convincingeveryone plays their part reasonably well and special mention should go to Reg E. Cathey as Samuel as a stand out though he doesn't get enough screen time here. Some of the bad guyshenchmen were a bit naff but nothing awful. Even the minimal action scenes were done reasonably well.What lets this one down is the fact that so much that happens doesn't make a lot of sense.No explanation is made as to why the bad guys want the baby. One of the bad guys is actually pregnant Sarah's brother.He has no idea the baby he is searching for is his sisters.Why?No back story or explanation is given. Apparently Sarah is THE only pregnant woman left despite the fact there are plenty of seemingly healthy men and women left.Why?There were many head scratching moments......Howeverthis was for me still a watchable movie despite it's flaws and I remained reasonably entertained until the end.So to quote a many repeated IMDb phrase from so many reviews......Not the bestbut very far from being the worst.";

One thing I liked The plot device of using a broadcast to set the scene for the upcoming action This was a device used to great effect in the Walter Hill 1979 classic The Warriors. it works here as well. Another thing I liked the use of music was effective. not so much a great score but rather a evocative sound design with an emphasis on acoustic. One could stretch and mention biblical parallels The woman is Sarah she is comforted by Samuel who tells her that her child is going to be special. The plot played with the idea but in the end dropped it for a more broad and less mystical Special There are a lot of nice touches throughout the film by no means a thrill a minute blockbuster. What did I not like over convoluted plotting I never did find the bad guys back story that interesting. production of cigarettes or at least of markets to sell tobacco seem to be taken for granted as well as the availability of gas. and electricity. If you can put these points on the back burner and just enjoy the flow you might find yourself entertained.

	schema:headline " Poor Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film please allow me to describe what I love about the books.Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary yet wholly embraced even celebrated by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given and violence a sad but expected part of life.The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death heartwrenching in the book is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol in contrast is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was welldone. However the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible given the subject matter but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a selfdestructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 310 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead.".

	onyx:emotionText "What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film please allow me to describe what I love about the books.Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary yet wholly embraced even celebrated by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given and violence a sad but expected part of life.The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death heartwrenching in the book is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry!

Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted a lot of senseless dinners a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. Just be yourself but do what everyone expects! Katniss went from being tough to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So they get thrown out into the Hunger Games there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom with fireballs launching at her she barely survives. Well lucky for her though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks for some reason in a game where only one survives there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off we're told these are evil dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals what a surprise that is. Well after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently some girl isn't part of their group she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So instead of gathering some supplies Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other but get attacked Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die we don't know anything about this character so we don't care so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay they hobble off after way too long and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back takes a lot more time and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave and the Hunger Game... techs or IT people or whatever they are unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy whoever he is is bloody and looks like he can barely move beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing until Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him and puts him out of his misery.After this there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares they just wish it would end because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look and walks off and the credits roll.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK first let me admit that I haven't read the books and I didn't even know they existed I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So I sat there with a clear mindset no expectations no prejudice no background info whatsoever. First things first whoever invented the the let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike and convinced others to follow him or her should be shot. Twice in fact just to be sure...It is really annoying and so unnecessary it is not making anything more real. For me in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing or not much happening but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off it didn't work at all but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there but in the movie you get 10 lines and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance or even spark a brutal bloodbath especially that it is an annual event so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family. Also the scale is hanging in the air too you don't know how the 2 opposing populations the citizens of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district relate to each other which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story well is very simple and straight once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished and though I din't know there is a series behind I told to the rather disappointed missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse but still left a hollow is this really it? kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context background and story. I'm sorry I'm not a big fan of the lead actress Jennifer Lawrence as I didn't even know her before this movie althogh I saw and really liked First Class but somehow couldn't connect. Regardless she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into at least a good number of scenes in fact her efforts were one of the few ups for me among the many downs during that long 25 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a sugarmonster character and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough just seen in Man on the ledge here I simply couldn't recognise  Based on the movie itself I really don't know how this can be so popular but I admit I'm probably not the target audience and also the books may be much better well it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low. Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying only hope is stronger than fear but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this I would be rather upset...".

Why are their people cheering for these children's deaths and not mourning them? Rue's death satisfied that question. That was the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. Her death struck a chord with Katniss an entire district and me. It was wonderful to finally see someone raging at the death of one of these kids and she was the perfect vessel for it.The lovey dovey stuff was to be expected but this movie didn't try to shove it down your throat like a certain sparkling vampire movie did. It was subtle and not even something of assurance but sweet.Just watch the movie. That's all I can say. I'm gonna go read the first book of the series. That's how good this movie is.

	schema:reviewBody "In the future all wars have ended but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people and pay tribute to the fallen Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12 and we see them whisked off to Capitol City  a pastel coloured Willy Wonka style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty and trained in readiness for the games.Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale'  but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses rather than those playing the game and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and fun for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride  the opening sequences seemingly go on forever  and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale' as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses and even 'Logans Run' but it has enough in it to make it a standup worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative where  in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their Blood and Circuses  love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good  the future Capitol City looks amazing  whilst the acting ranges from excellent the young actress playing the lead role is very good to screen chewing Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!. The other thing about the film is its length  at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema or else take a cushion!".

As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses rather than those playing the game and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and fun for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride  the opening sequences seemingly go on forever  and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale' as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses and even 'Logans Run' but it has enough in it to make it a standup worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative where  in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their Blood and Circuses  love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good  the future Capitol City looks amazing  whilst the acting ranges from excellent the young actress playing the lead role is very good to screen chewing Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!. The other thing about the film is its length  at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema or else take a cushion!";

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I finally saw The Hunger Games and I must confess it's an entertaining movie. Shades of older movies such as Rollerball Logan's Run and more recently Battle Royale are very present in Hunger Games. In a distant future North America goes through a war that leaves the nation devastated. The war was caused by internal uprising not a foreign attack. After a lengthy war the state prevails but much of the nation is left in ruins. As means to remember this sad period the state organizes a reality show called 'the hunger games' where each of the 12 districts that started the revolts years ago must submit a young boy and girl to participate in a televised fight to the death where only one can become the sole victor. This is where this movie veers closely to the Japanese masterpiece Battle Royale with a premise very much alike.Our heroine comes from district 12 Katniss played by Jennifer Lawrence. Despite casting a bombshell as a tough warrior Jennifer pulls it off amazingly well giving a serious performance. I understand this movie is a book adaptation and in my case I haven't read the books or book so I can't really tell if it's a faithful adaptation. A strange feeling invaded me while watching The Hunger Games it felt like something big was going to happen a big revelation or the real truth behind such barbaric game. But this revelation never happened and by the time the film ends I'm left with more questions that answers. Unlike Battle Royale I developed little sympathy for the rest of the young kids involved in the game. Out of the 24 participants the movie is designed for the audience to care for only 3 characters Katniss Peeta and Rua that's it. Little or no background is given of the other participants some of them seemed to really enjoy all the hunting and killing.Little is said about the president of the nation portrayed by Donald Sutherland in what I thought was a waste of talent. Again reading the book would probably help me to understand the many plot holes this movie has. I think more could've been done with the movie's premise a more social commentary but director Gary Ross apparently chose not to. In the end The Hunger Games is really a light version of Battle Royale.".

Then I saw the film and I was blown away. This was one of the best films of 2012 and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out although I am a little upset that they're splitting Mockingjay into two films! Oh and by the way there is a film just like this one it came out 10 years ago was called Battle Royale and it was better than this even though this film was excellent.The film takes place in a dystopia future where the world was destroyed by an unknown event. The area that survived now called Panem North America is now split into 12 districts all ruled by The Capitol. We find out that the districts attempted to overthrow the capital but they were defeated resulting in the destruction of District 13. Now for the past 74 years two citizens of each district a boy and a girl all between the ages of 12 and 18 are sent to die in a tournament called the Hunger Games. The last person standing receives a lifetime of fame and fortune and the district reaps the benefits. This film follows 16year old Katniss Everdeen Jennifer Lawrence of District 12 an expert archer who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games. Her partner Peeta Mellark Josh Hutcherson is a baker and they come with a strategy of pretending to fall in love with each other in order to look good and get help from the outside world during the games. They are guided by Haymitch a great Woody Harrelson a drunkard who is the only surviving winner from District 12 only two from the district have ever won. They head for the Capital and are trained and they meet the other tributes. Here is the movie's biggest flaw most of these characters actually had bigger parts in the book. Here they run around and get killed off. Only Rue from District 11 is given any substantial screen time but it's still not enough. President Snow Donald Sutherland is the wicked leader of the totalitarian Capital and he doesn't want District 12 to win because it results in the poorer districts 9 10 11 12 to stand up and want to rebel again. The games are overseen by Seneca Crane Wes Bentley and the Gamemakers who add new obstacles in order to make the games exciting. Those two were barely in the first book so their larger part in this film is very welcome. Eventually our two heroes work together to try and win and I won't spoil anything else. This was a very well done film. The actors are great especially Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. The effects are all well done and the cinematography which I heard people didn't like is also pretty good. Director Gary Ross who sadly isn't directing the next film did a great job translating the book to the big screen and it was a success. Hope the sequels are as good as this. May the odds ever be in your favor.Final Verdict 810".

The name actors like Stanley Tucci Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herkyjerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead. The simulated monster animals that can actually devour people? Most of the competitors are killed off camera? Come on. . .".

I do not understand why the author of the books would copy so blatantly an outstanding bookfilm and turn it into this. The Japanese filmwhich is also based on a book is absolutely shocking an breathtaking. If you have not seen it yet please do. Nonetheless hunger games is a watchable teen movie. I don't understand why they had to repeat some scenes over and over at the beginning. Its a long film with not much action. The ending seems rushed and very much predictable. It could be worse. But has been better in Japanese.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoilers!!!!I was beyond excited to see this movie...and completely disappointed when I left the theater. In my minds eye I felt the job capturing the Capitol and the people there visually was well done. It looked very much as I imagined as did District 12. However so much from there fell short. I even reread the books after watching the movie to make sure I wasn't making too much of it...only to come away more frustrated. I do realize they only have a certain amount of time to devote to the movie but I felt it could have been 2 parts to help that. I have nothing against the casting for the most part. Personally Katniss was a tall and buxom for how I pictured her....Peeta a little short....Haymitch a little too Woody Harrelson. haha. I feel the darkness desperation and depth of the story are lost. The person I went with hadn't read the books and even felt much was glazed over. Gale for instance you get no real sense of how deeply his and Katniss' connection runs or why. You really have no clue other than a flashback as to why Katniss' mother is a shell of a being when you see her or why that relationship is strained. Prim is an unlovable version of what she is in the books....Rue is simply a sidenote you're sad when she dies because a young girl dies...not because you've come to know her. What of the whole premise of the movie  HUNGER games. All of the shock over how easily food comes to them in the Capitol and why it's such a huge deal to the characters is non exsistant. Why cut out something like Peeta losing his leg? Why no Madge character to give Kat the Mockingjay pin? So so so many small details and character builds that aren't there. It falls flat emotionless and empty. A meaningful exciting heart wrenching story....turned into something to bring in a teenage crowd I can only imagine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have just been browsing thru reviews for Battle Royalle and i chance upon this review and Yes Hollywood did make a watered down version lame.A film Battle Royalle that the US would never could never make... 15 September 2001Author Henry Postan from London England This film is film that I believed had to be made and it was only a matter of time before it was. Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could never have conceived making.Firstly to get it out of the way I will say that I loved this movie although at no point did I feel comfortable while watching it. It had the power and emotional content that while not necessarily apparent in the dialogue was visible on screen at all times.I am truly glad that this film has come out of mainstream Japanese cinema. It would have only been made in the US by independent film makers who would have basked in the glory of its controversy and felt ohsosmug that they had created it while shoving a moral in your face. While I actually have no problem with US Indie film I do feel that a Western background would have comprised on visceral content and upped the content of cheap moral points.For those who say the violence was cartoonstyle and laughable must have been watching a different film. Whilst this film is heavy in black humour I can clearly say that the deaths are shocking in the extreme and there is no relenting from the beginning to the end. Only occasionally does the camera pan away from the final deed. The only deaths that have a dark humour content to them are those involving Kitano Beat Takeshi and the lone vigilante those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about. Other sections such as the Training Video are equally comedic and absurd. Yet other deaths are shocking in the extreme and show how the slightest suspicion can have disastrous consequences for groups that only have trust to keep them together a truly shocking scene in the Lighthouse reinforces this.The fact that this film employs Children as the main protagonists of the story is the key to the whole impact of the film. We have all seen films like The Running Man where adults fight adults for survival and it seems that much less shocking albeit that film was handled in a completely different manner. Children have the innocence that makes the brutality of this film that much more shocking adults in the same situation would have had the reaction from audiences of cheering at the screen as the hero dispatches yet another victim. This could never and would never have been the case with this film.To another commentator who felt that this film sticks with you less than Scream I simply fail to find this to be anywhere close to the truth. The deaths in Scream although bloody are nothing but pastiche of those films that Scream is mimicking ultimately throwaway deaths that up in brutality in order to outdo the last one that have one or two psychotic perpetrators who eventually get their comeuppance. In this film their are no victims and besides one exception there are no villains amongst the children. They simply HAVE to play the game or die.Well I encourage all those who feel they can stomach it to go and see this film or find it available somewhere as I believe it has been banned in the US. It is not truly a film denouncing the evils of Reality TV or showing us the future of that trend of Broadcasting that is merely a plot device to place the children in this situation. The nature of the film lies in its deconstruction of Friendships Trust and our views on Innocence. Go and see it not as a spectator of this BR spectacle but as one of the participants and remember what was important to you when you were at school and whether any of those rivalries hatreds and friendships would have been enough for you to decide who deserves to die and who deserves to live.".

As it stands the movie is a PG13 version of Battle Royale with a hint of Running Man a touch of Truman Show minus any irony or humor with a lot less gore to keep it PG13 no doubt and a lot more cheese.The one thing that might have set it apart from its many predecessors would have been the political and social background story which is hinted at in the brilliant but short performances of Tucci and Banks but gets drowned out by the tedious incoherent and unconvincing attempts at action and cheesy teenage romance of the Twilight variety.Even though the action is clearly intended to carry the movie given the amount of time devoted to it it is largely vapid PG13type stuff where the heroine MacGyvers her way out of a tight corner by dropping a hive of waspy insects onto her assailants  who in spite of being in a fight for their lives guard her and themselves by collectively taking a nap at the foot of the tree their opponent is trapped in. Common sense isn't the strength of any of the contestants which gallivant unguardedly and noisily through woods they know to be full of people out to kill them and spend quite a bit of time publicly and noisily emoting when disagreeable stuff happens. Gimmicks abound many of which easily predictable as they are introduced hamfistedly one by one during the preparation and training phase.Movie making is a business and much of the revenue comes from young people and there is every reason to believe that this movie is successfully catering to their tastes and preferences. Unfortunately for the rest of us this means that all the interesting commentary on our own lives and societies that the source material might have contained is only a small subtext to a teenage drama that has been done before better sharper and more convincing. The scenes with Tucci equipped with dental enhancements that accentuate everything he does and Banks also in magnificent costume are the highlights of this film degrading the main action to mere filler for the teens. Unfortunately for more than two hours that's just not enough.".

It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that or at least neglects to even attempt to address that by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern.

The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. I found it absent vapid and obviously lacking in any real value.

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture because I kind of liked this film but based on the number of negative user reviews you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next Gili. Well it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.But to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins author of the series ever read Frederic Brown or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of Arena which also saw reincarnation via an issue of Adam Strange in Detective Comics. Which is okay because it's not a clone of the story but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.The film is nicely paced and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy real and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture but the rough and tumble scifi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server and I'm talking preteen boys here might probably get little impatient with it. But the young ladies in tonight's audience seemed to really connect with the film.Some critiques here in the original Arena we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizardcaptain with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a more civil manner as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In Hunger Games the main characters must fight for a dystopic world again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique the backstory and the setting because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component but it really wasn't made clear in the film just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens and with such lush green forests one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But that's kind of the premise of the film so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games as I digress bitterly who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.There's romance there's intrigue there's hand to hand combat there's MTV like shakycam cinematography some girlish moments and even some pyrotechnics a rarity for any film. In the original Arena or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. Hunger Games does the same thing only more cinematically and unlike my beloved Star Trek does it with a female bent. Which is better or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's Arena and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution. Technical notes the editing is slow thank goodness and there're few jump cuts which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting and the makeup fell into the same category trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.Not a super sterling film but using recycled material from a variety of scifi sources with a gripping narrative and polishing the package with a pink female bow makes the film an interesting watch.Check it out.".

Pretty much a Twilight version of the original Japanese movie.The characters especially Peeta are insipid and the acting if it can be referred to as such is awful. Peeta should have been dispensed with at the beginning of the Games. For most of the movie he follows The Twilight character Katniss around like a lost puppy doing little to defend himself or his true love. At almost three hours there is so much pure fluff that the movie or is it a film? just drags on. An hour of garbage unnecessary to what little story there is could have been easily cut.And the Games what a joke. Battle Royale so far outshines this piece of Hollywood garbage. This movie is yet another in a long line of Hollywood ripoffs of really great foreign movies Contraband and Dragon Tattoo being just two other examples.The last 20 minutes of the movie is just plain dumb.I don't doubt that this movie appeals to the typical American audience. No need to go into that statement.A 1 rating is way too high for this trash. I'm sure just as with Twilight there will be countless sequels. Hollywood has long since lost any creative talent it once had and is now reduced to comic book movies third remakes of movies and television series not that good to begin with and really awful ripoffs of very good foreign movies.".

To say that the Hunger Games is better than Battle Royale is the same as to say that Coca Cola is better than the best French Champagne because the Coca Cola sells more bottles and it is better known around the world. Oh this power of marketing that sells water with sugar and forces the masses think that it is mana directly from the heavens! To say it simply and honestly The Hunger Games is huge failure. It is super boring nonsense that tries to play emotional sad or whatever. It is thriller written by the worst author of the love books you can ever imagine. It is movie where the only real thrill is a bunch of silly costumes of the Capitol People. But even they do look as a collection of weirdos from very cheap music video from 80ties.I loved Battle Royale for its roughness political message and pure shock value. There is nothing like that when there is the first combat scene it fails miserably. You can basically see only shaking camera. Then there is another long boring part then again some super short combat messed again by another shaky camera. Then some hallucinations then some memories then some other boring sequence. There is a lot of similar movies TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor and every single of them is more thrilling. The only thing that would make the movie even more unbearable would be Sandra Bullock in the leading role.The Hunger Games is a joke it is less thrilling that any Harry Potter movie. It is basically movie for kids dressed as a thriller. It is definitely not recommended for anyone ho seeks real thriller or really powerful movie. But again If you are twelve it might be fine for you. The leading actress is pretty so you may be happy just to observe her in various dresses and enjoy when she runs around the woods. There is a bit of tears flower gathering and shallow morale for these teenage girls who may like this Hunting Barbie kind of stuff. As a male I have suffered horribly however.One extra point for silly costumes and crazy haircuts. This is probably the only shocking thing in the whole movie.".

The film and the book it was based on adapted the premise of a great Japanese filmbook called Battle Royale without ever giving it credit for the original idea.Despite knowing this beforehand I still went to see the film expecting something decent. I was quite disappointed when I walked out. For a film that was supposed to be all about teen violence there seemed to be very little violence in the film. The few scenes depicting violence were toned down and lacked gore.Perhaps good character development could save this but sadly there was hardly any. All the dialogues seemed forced and monotonous. I was hoping to see the characters converse with each other but all I saw was actors reading their lines. I like feeling emotions during films but short of sadness of knowing I just spent 20 and wasted 2.5 hours of my life I can't remember feeling any.The only memorable scene for me was the return of the film's heroine to her district however it was for all the wrong reasons. It struck me as odd that the boy who liked her was all smiles despite seeing his love interest make out with some nerf herder on the big screen.My advice is to wait until you can rent this for 2 and even then only if you really want to see it for yourself. Otherwise buy a nice BluRay of Battle Royale and see how The Hunger Games should have been made.610 1 point added out of my respect for Woody Harrelson".

	schema:reviewBody "Many have drawn a comparison between The hunger games and Japanese cult movie Battle Royale. There are obviously similarities but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG if you observe closely enough the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the game. They are not lilywhite innocent not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside the more gory part of the killing is shown only once at the beginning of the game through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized by an instructor to the protagonists is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics  30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two tributes annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultramodern hightech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter about an hour first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. The much contested lead role by three Oscarnominated young ladies finally went to Jennifer Lawrence Winter bones who edged Hailee Steinfeld True grit and Shailene Woodley The descendants which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two's were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead which is really a supporting role is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from The kids are alright 2010. Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricaturelike roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci Elizabeth Banks Wes Bentley Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones. Donald Sutherland's appearance is more like a cameo.The Hunger Games is good entertainment with a reasonably engaging story. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman The Movie 1978 is a masterpiece of one of the greatest superhero Superman of all time. It is my number 1 favorite Superman of all time. I love love love love this movie to death and even more so much I love it!!! This is a classic the best the original origin story of how a young boy grow up to become the greatest superhero as superman of all time. Christopher Reeve is the only Clark KentSuperman a great reporter who make fool of him self his the best his performance of Superman was written on his skin.He was a good heart person. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10 2004 and I really miss the actor. I was in high school sophomore that year when I heard Christopher Reeve died I was sad. This movie has elements in the film that works. Special effects great acting from everyone great plot and story. It is going to be 40 years anniversary since this movie come out in December 10 1978. Superman The Movie was Nominated for 3 Oscars 17 wins  18 nominations.I grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman saving the world and saving us I believed in Superman. Superman The Movie defines my childhood it is a classic and one of the best superhero movies of all time. From the comics and movies. This movie has heart soul adrenalin and it is a joy ride trough whole movie. Superman for me is an adventure scifi romance and a disaster film which was an earth quake after a bomb explode and Superman was racing against time to fix things and saving people. We don't see fighting or war movies in which superhero fights in here but normal mother of nature disaster earth quakes.Why is this movie so good  We found out more about planet Krypton and how JorEl with his wife Lara sent KalEl to planet Earth.We see Clark growing up and we see his first love Lana Lang. Susannah York played excellent as KalEl's mom she was also in the sequel. Diane Sherry Case was good as Lana Lang but the actress was forgotten she didn't had much screen time in this movie.Marlon Brando was excellent as JorEl he is incredible father figure to Superman. I love the actor and his performance from The Godfather 1972 to Apocalypse Now 1979 to Superman 1978 he is incredible. Director Richard Donner directs perfectly and excellent this masterpiece of origin story and it is a joy watching it.Here we also find that man of steel no fire no bullets no iron or steel no ice nothing can hurt him but only kryptonite green meteorite can hurt him.We have 3 villains here Lex Luthor Otis and Eve Teschmacher and they are good in their roles. The film has a lighter tone and humor thanks to Gene Hackman's performance and Ned Beatty they not so horrible evil villians but comic and funny at times. Valerie Perrine is the only Eve Teschmacher for me and Lex Luthor is Gene Hackman no one else.Margot Kidder is Lois Lane who become love interest for Superman but Clark never reveals his secret that's what I love about this film. No one knows who is superman but us audience.I love how Superman saves those children on the bridge in the bus or how Superman helped a helpless young girl getting her cat back from a tree. Superman saved all the passengers in a airplane. Superman stops a cat burglar. Christopher Reeve doesn't kill anyone the new Superman Henry Cavill kills people twists necks while Chrispoher Reeve saves people he saves the world and he saves Lois Lane Jimmy Olson and of course he stops Lex Luthor. Ms. Teschmacher saves Superman from drowning I love that so much.John Williams made a beautiful score for the Superman music theme even today people talk about the music and this movie. Hans Zimmer score for Man of Steel can't come near this movie score.1010 I hate Henry Cavill's Superman! Christopher Reeve is the greatest super hero and Superman of all time for me. I love Superman The Movie 1978 to death it is my number 1 favorite Superman film it is my childhood movie I grew up watching this movie and it is going to be 40 year anniversary December 10th.".

I love love love love this movie to death and even more so much I love it!!! This is a classic the best the original origin story of how a young boy grow up to become the greatest superhero as superman of all time. Christopher Reeve is the only Clark KentSuperman a great reporter who make fool of him self his the best his performance of Superman was written on his skin.He was a good heart person. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10 2004 and I really miss the actor. I was in high school sophomore that year when I heard Christopher Reeve died I was sad. This movie has elements in the film that works. Special effects great acting from everyone great plot and story. It is going to be 40 years anniversary since this movie come out in December 10 1978.

	schema:headline " A Classic best origin story of a superhero of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "Superman The Movie 1978 is the Original film and the only that is the best origin story of a Superman who changes himself into an ultimate superhero. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark KentSuperman like Christopher Reeve the film is still instantiate classic till it's day.If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent KalEl last son of Krypton and Superman Earths savior from the forces of evil. It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies.Superman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! This is the best superhero of the 70's before Marvel and DC start making superhero movies. The origin story of a man who can fly is terrific believable and awesome. Marlon Brando's role was one of his best the most films that become memorable for me are The Godfather 1972 Apocalypse Now 1979 and this film Superman he completed 1.year earlier this film before he started filming Apocalypse Now 1979. What else can I say that was already told? I love this film! I grew up with this film this is the real original film which has a heart! Man of Steel 2013 reboot to Superman 1978 does not have a heart! This is the real film! The special effects are great the CGI are barely in it they aren't. The plot and the story are terrific. The cast is wonderful and acts believable. Superman and Christopher Reeve are the most beloved iconic heroes till it's day. For me Superman will always be Christopher Reeve no one else! I love Smallville TV Series 20012011 and Tom Welling was playing young Clark Kent. Tom Welling will be Clark Kent for me but Christopher Reeve will be Superman. Reeve also appeared in Season 2 and 3 as special guest in Smallvile which I love that so much. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10 2004. John Williams theme score is the best score done for the character. I hear it and it makes me feel so uplifted and I feel like I can do anything. Great cast beautiful score and an Epic feeling that is lacking from movies in today's age. It is my favorite superhero film. Superman and his portrayal by Christopher Reeve is a masterpiece and is timeless . Incredible after all this time this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. This is a classic of the comic book hero genre and in most respects the one that really set the standard for all comic book hero films that follow it. The special effects sets haircuts and wardrobe may all look dated but Superman The Movie remains among the most beloved films of the 1970s. Director Richard Donner brings the comic book hero to life in Christopher Reeve who admirably adapts from the bumbling Clark Kent to the ultimate caped crusader. The entire cast is brilliant in its supporting roles. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the unapologetically wicked Lex Luthor. And Margot Kidder delivers a portrait of a strong ambitious Lois Lane at a time when women were starting to break the glass ceiling. But it is Donner's dedication to the spirit and style of the original Superman's comic book roots as well as to inject a heavy dose of humor that make Superman The Movie a classic. In some ways it has still not been surpassed even by the CGI effects and fasterpaced action of today's superhero movies.The special effects and CGI look great and they don't suck. This film has a heart and it does not suck and is not bad. Marlon Brando was wonderful a touching movement performance as JorEl Clark's father. Incredible after all this time this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. A boxoffice smash an Academy Award winner and a fan favorite since it first flew into theaters in December 1978 Superman The Movie assembles a cast and creative contingent as only a big movie can. At its heart just as in three sequels is Christopher Reeve's intelligent affectionate portrayal of a most human Man of Steel. Watching Superman again isn't just like being a kid again. It's better. The movie's legacy soared even higher when director Richard Donner revisited this beloved adventure 22 years later and integrated eight minutes into the film. Christopher Reeve Marlon Brando JorEl Gene Hackman Luthor and Margot Kidder Lois Lane give indelible performances that fuel the film's aura of legend. Superman also known as Superman The Movie is a 1978 superhero film directed by Richard Donner. It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and stars Marlon Brando Gene Hackman Christopher Reeve Margot Kidder Glenn Ford Phyllis Thaxter Jackie Cooper Trevor Howard Marc McClure Terence Stamp Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty.I love this film and is the best superhero classic film ever made!!!! 1010 it is my personal favorite Superman movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while you'll be flipping channels or meandering through the aisles of the local videorama and you will stumble upon a film that takes you back to your childhood  and the childlike wonder that accompanied it. After 2 decades as well as numerous inferior sequels and remakes the original Superman is back.Well okay maybe this wasn't the ORIGINAL one but certainly no other version of the legend has had such a lasting impact as this one. Nor has any other telling of the tale been as thorough and ambitious as that put forth by Director Richard Donner and Story writer Mario Puzo. Add to that the utterly inspired and inspiring score by John Williams and you have a dose of that good old movie magic. Even the opening credits manage to raise your adrenaline levels as the Superman symbol soars through space across the screen and Williams' opening theme perfectly builds to a masterful crescendo. It will make you want to stand up from your couch and soar out of the nearest window though I don't recommend it if you live on anything above the first floor.The film begins on Superman's home world of Krypton a dazzling planet dotted by crystalline cities which combined again with William's incredible theme music seem to present an image of heaven itself. A superrace of highly advanced beings the Kryptonians' only weakness is their pride as the infant Superman's father Jorel points out. It is that pride that leads them to ignore Jorel's warnings that the planet is doomed by an impending supernova. In a last ditch effort to save his son as well as some remnant of his race he sends his infant son Kalel to the planet Earth in a deep space probe. Marlon Brando in the role of Jorel gives one of his best performances. His role is the stuff of Hollywood legend since he was paid 4 million dollars for his role of about 10 minutes but despite his exorbitant fee and minimal screen time his performance is no less worthy.The probe crashes in a farmer's field in the early 1950's to be discovered by the Kents with Glen Ford in the role of Pa Kent. Though he seems to have even less screen time than Brando his role as the young Superman's moral example is no less pivotal to the story. Superman's childhood and most of his teen years are completely skipped over however Jeff East gives an excellent portrayal of the teen Clark Kent who is only beginning to discover the real extent of his powers. Most of the supporting cast equally distinguish themselves. Gene Hackman creates a charming and amusing villain in Lex Luthor and while Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane is a bit forced and grating at times she still shines with a kind of charm and it is always fun to watch her slip from the toughasnails reporter to the flustered schoolgirl every time the Man of Steel hits the scene. If you still don't like her performance watch the Lois Lane screen tests in the special features section of the DVD which includes tryouts by various prominent actresses of the day. After watching them I think you'll agree that the filmmakers made the right casting choice.But of course the person we will remember the most is Christopher Reeve as Superman and this is the way he should be remembered. It was certainly his greatest role and although he overplayed the nerdy and fumbling Clark Kent and his Superman sometimes pauses to deliver silly platitudes he does so with an air of wry amusement. He may act like a goody twoshoes but mostly he just seems to be having a good time showing off and damn it why shouldn't he? He's Superman after all. If I could fly you could damn well bet I'd be showing off too. This is confirmed in a brief but enjoyable restored scene in which after saving Lois Lane and the President as well as foiling several crimes Superman flies back to his Fortress of Solitude to discuss it with his Father or rather the persona of Jorel which has been preserved in memory crystals and sent to earth with the infant Kalel so that he could benefit from Jorel's knowledge and wisdom. He admonishes his son that while it is natural to enjoy being able to show off his powers he must learn to be humble and keep his vanity in check.It is surprising how little moments of restored footage such as this one seem to breathe much more life into the characters giving them a depth not seen in their previous cinematic incarnation. And while the film is a tale of the power of good it is ultimately a tribute to the power of love. It is love that makes Superman more vulnerable than even kryptonite love that makes him betray his Kryptonian father's admonition to never interfere with human history and love that makes him truly human. Though it is nearly an hour into the film before Superman finally makes his first heroic and worldstunning appearance it is well worth the wait. The action gets more and more exciting rivaling anything that today's action counterparts like The Mummy Returns can dish out. The effects though antiquated by today's overblown CGI standards are still impressive and manage to maintain their looks and grace in their old age. As Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan involving hijacked twin nuclear missiles the subsequent chase followed by Superman's efforts to save an Earthquakeravaged California are breathtaking even by today's standards.Like the superhero of title the film itself is not without its weaknesses. In trying to keep in touch with its vintage comic book roots it can be a tad cornball at times and occasionally gets bogged down by what I call the golly geewhiz factor. Yet it does so in a very tongueincheek manner retaining enough adult sophistication and genuine drama to keep it from lapsing into a mere kiddy show or a parody of the source material. In fact the film has several surprisingly mature nuances. If like me you hadn't seen this film since you were a kid then you will be in a much better position to fully enjoy the subtleties of the film now. i.e Lois Lane in her rooftop interview of Superman asks How big are you . . . er I mean . .. how TALL are you. I obviously missed that as a kid because it had me rolling with laughter this time around. But despite a few loose threads in the cape and tights The Man of Steel remains quite intact and appropriately larger than life. It is therefore fitting that this film has been remastered and rereleased in collector's twosided DVD format. The sound and picture quality are excellent wiping away the tarnish of age and making the film shine again. Some of the many features include the aforementioned restored footage about 1015 minutes worth a few additional deleted scenes which I thought should have been restored into the film as well commentary by director Richard Donner the Lois Lane screen tests specials on the making and origins of the film and a musiconly track well worth the price of the DVD alone.If you haven't seen this movie since you were a kid and you want to feel like a kid again rent it now. If you've never seen it at all then the release of this DVD has taken away your last excuse. You will believe a man can fly.".

It is love that makes Superman more vulnerable than even kryptonite love that makes him betray his Kryptonian father's admonition to never interfere with human history and love that makes him truly human. Though it is nearly an hour into the film before Superman finally makes his first heroic and worldstunning appearance it is well worth the wait. The action gets more and more exciting rivaling anything that today's action counterparts like The Mummy Returns can dish out. The effects though antiquated by today's overblown CGI standards are still impressive and manage to maintain their looks and grace in their old age. As Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan involving hijacked twin nuclear missiles the subsequent chase followed by Superman's efforts to save an Earthquakeravaged California are breathtaking even by today's standards.Like the superhero of title the film itself is not without its weaknesses. In trying to keep in touch with its vintage comic book roots it can be a tad cornball at times and occasionally gets bogged down by what I call the golly geewhiz factor. Yet it does so in a very tongueincheek manner retaining enough adult sophistication and genuine drama to keep it from lapsing into a mere kiddy show or a parody of the source material. In fact the film has several surprisingly mature nuances. If like me you hadn't seen this film since you were a kid then you will be in a much better position to fully enjoy the subtleties of the film now. i.e Lois Lane in her rooftop interview of Superman asks How big are you . . . er I mean . .. how TALL are you. I obviously missed that as a kid because it had me rolling with laughter this time around. But despite a few loose threads in the cape and tights The Man of Steel remains quite intact and appropriately larger than life. It is therefore fitting that this film has been remastered and rereleased in collector's twosided DVD format. The sound and picture quality are excellent wiping away the tarnish of age and making the film shine again. Some of the many features include the aforementioned restored footage about 1015 minutes worth a few additional deleted scenes which I thought should have been restored into the film as well commentary by director Richard Donner the Lois Lane screen tests specials on the making and origins of the film and a musiconly track well worth the price of the DVD alone.If you haven't seen this movie since you were a kid and you want to feel like a kid again rent it now. If you've never seen it at all then the release of this DVD has taken away your last excuse. You will believe a man can fly.";

	schema:headline " A brilliant Epic for the generations!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is it ladies and gents...my 200th review. I thought long and hard about what I would dedicate my 200th review to...would it be something new and flashy a movie that I knew was a knockout something more personal to me?? One of my faves perhaps?? I finally decided on this film. Since I was a little boy I have loved Superman. Even now many years later I am still fascinated by the character I mean he has withstood 6 decades of changes and world upheaval and still one of the best selling heroes of our time. Without further ado let's talk about Richard Donner's big screen epic Superman The Movie. Thanks for reading my reviews!! Superman The Movie MUST be judged not by today's standards but by the standards set for films of the late seventiesearly eighties. That's not to say that it doesn't stand up for itself even almost 3 decades later but it's true brilliance may be lost if you don't remember when and where it was made. Brilliant Director Richard Donner Lethal Weapon series The Goonies and stocks of brilliant TV series I think really knows what the audience wants out of characters. I'm sure he tread on thin ice when it came to bringing the infamous Man of Steel to the big screen having only comics and TV and radio before him to base it on. Donner took everything Superman stood for truth justice American Way fighting evil his estrangement from his home planet his love for Lois Lane and put it all into this film.Nothing is left out of Superman we have the origins including an in depth look into Krypton which at the time would have been a first. We see KalEl's parents and their conflicts we are given a small introduction to Clark Kent's youth and his coming of age and then everything else we know and love about the Superman legend. Everything from The Phantom Zone to Lois and Clark falling in love. I always thought the casting for Superman was it's one downfall but after watching the film again I really see that it wasn't such an error in judgment.The late and incredible Christopher Reeve truly was built for Superman. He embodied the character and created two completely different people to the point where you believed a pair of glasses and a different part in the hair was the perfect alter ego. His Clark Kent was goofy but pure and honest but completely different from the strength and character of Superman. His Superman was tall larger than life strong honest too good to be true. He was perfect and he looked both parts perfectly too and he will forever be known....in my books...as The Superman of film. Margot Kidder pretty much had Lois Lane nailed. I always thought she was a little old for the role and wasn't sure she looked the part but the personality was perfect strong forceful pig headed leap before you look kinda gal. And the chemistry with Reeve's Superman was very good. They established a fast but very bonding romance between the two characters. The supporting cast was also well done...Jackie Cooper was great as Perry White Marc McClure was perfectly cast as the young naive Jimmy Olsen and Marlon Brando was an awesome screen presence for JorEl and considering the billing he got for his brief role it's good that he had that pull. Gene Hackman is a brilliant actor I've loved him in many roles...he was not right for Lex Luthor or perhaps even his character wasn't written right. Although diabolical and evil it was done in a comedic way right down to the doofus sidekick which was more cartoonish than it was big budget film. You just didn't truly feel the tension and arch rivalry between Reeve and Hackman's characters. The only other beef I can find with Superman is the overlooking of some key elements of reality. Yes I know Superman must leave reality at the door and that's easy to do with such a brilliant beautifully done Epic but the whole concept of Superman reversing time by making the earth spin backwards or turning into Superman and having his human clothes literally vanish into thin air...these are things that the writers should have looked more closely into. But I think they focused so much of their time on making sure other elements were in place that they let these things slide and that's okay but it's such a minor thing but still with such perfection in other areas they stand out.Special effects like this had never been seen before and they are still stunning. Watching Superman fly and the explosions and earthquake and his miracle powers are just wonderful and will forever be in the mind of movie goers. This is such a brilliant film and put a stamp on the genre of superheroes that every other film will try to live up to. For the record I am thrilled and excited about the upcoming Bryan Singer Superman film I think he will take everything that was great about this original and utilize it to continue on the epic. Bravo to him!! Superman The Movie also had and still has one of the most haunting beautiful and stunning scores ever created. The music became his anthem no matter where Superman is. This is one of the best films ever and will always be a classic especially to me!! 910".

This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modernday special effects so it was pretty cool to say the least. It's still very entertaining and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve meanwhile was always a popular Man Of Steel and the special effects are still fun to watch from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this too.Personally I didn't care for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying too. I guess it comes with her character. However being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence it's now on DVD by the way and worth a purchase it was just too weird hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!Anyway this is simply great entertainment. As a superhero Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film the second one being the best in my opinion.".

Ahh to just think that this is the movie that started it all ladies and gentlemen. Carefully adapted from the popular DC Comics character created by Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel Richard Donner's 1978 epic has stood the test of time to become the supreme superhero film. Alongside Tim Burton Batman and Sam Raimi SpiderMan Donner earned his place in cinematic history by becoming the first director to make a perfect superhero film. Superman is the most recognizable comic book superhero in history and when Clark Kent the late great Christopher Reeve rips open his shirt to reveal that symbolic S an hour and 11 minutes into the film you know that it's one of the greatest cinematic moments. This epic defined the superhero film and in the 27 years since its release every subsequent comic book superhero movie is forever indebted to Superman. The plot and what a plot runs complete throughout its epic 154 minutes and believe me there's not a single wasted moment in the film's entire running length. Of course Clark Kent is sent from his dying home world of Krypton by his father JorEl the late Marlon Brando grows up and works at the Daily Planet falls in love with Lois Lane Margot Kidder and must foil the diabolical plans of Lex Luthor Gene Hackman. Put simply there will never be another movie like Superman and who can forget those cosmic credits the aforementioned S scene the Superman and Lois date over New York City and later above the clouds and that one definitive climax when Superman lets out a painful cry that reveals that one glint of humanity that he's earned from his time on earth. Reeve will forever be linked to the role that really made people believe he was a super man even when he wasn't wearing the blues reds and yellows and was instead confined to the prison that's called a wheelchair. But we know that he's up there flying high with the Almighty and proving to us all that he is who we believed he was. The recent news that Bryan Singer XMen is directing a new Superman is not exactly getting me giddy considering the low standards of today's filmmaking and the onslaught of CGI effects that dominate many Hollywood action movies these days. I love Superman and even today I'm still touched by its magic and deeply saddened by the reallife tragedies that have followed it.A perfect super 1010.".

As a new family finds him in the field going home the couple take Clark as their own son and raise him.

Just like any comic book movie there is always a villain with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in a campy role along with Ned Beatty as Otis the sycophant with no sense these two plan to destroy the world with nuclear weapons. Christopher Reeve doesn't get into the Superman Costume until 45 minutes into the film in which he saves Lois in one scene busts bad guys and becomes and icon to the public.

I thought 'Characters that actually interact with one another!'. That is one of the key elements Superman Returns was missing dialogue. This movie had so much fun with the story and the characters that despite its lack of modern effects it was still immensely enjoyable to watch. There was real character development real humor particularly the scenes between Lex and Otis which I found hysterical and a palpable chemistry between Lois and ClarkSuperman. From the very beginning this movie grabs you tightly and keeps you interested. It has an enlivening effect on you where you feel genuinely happy after watching it which to my understanding is what the movies are all about. Gene Hackman had great oneliners for instanceOtis do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and I? Because it's your weight and my IQ and the entire cast sat right. The roles fit the effects for their time were great and the script was wonderful. It's amazing to me that movies like this can still hold up against movies that are made with the gross national product of a small country. If you want Superman in all his glory ignore 'Returns' and pick up this one you won't be disappointed. Otis do you want to see a very very long arm? Oh no Mr. Luthor!".

Alas Superman was the most famous Superhero at the time and the rights were acquired. Then a director and writer were required. This is when they went to first Guy Hamilton and then Richard Donner. Alas Donner won the acclaim and the Newman's were on board for writing a script. After months of screen testing and such a Superman was found and castthat of a young New York native Christopher Reeve who fit the bill and filled the role well. Then a gorgeous woman was needed for the part of Lois Lane no more gorgeous than the manic energetic actress Margot Kidder who was then known for small movie roles such as The Great Waldo Pepper and Sisters. Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando had already signed on before alot of the cast was cast. And to make a long story short Superman The Movie was filmed! A great film indeed with then state of the art special effects to make your views and experiences soar high! Christopher Reeve does a terrific job as the man of steel who learns of a plot to destroy the west coast. Gene Hackman was perfect for the role of Lex Luthor the villain who wants to own his own territory of the would be new coast of California Costa Del Lex! Margot Kidder was just right as the gorgeous Lois Lane who falls in love with Superman but gives Clark Kent lessons on life while Jackie Cooper is great as Perry White. Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine do good performances as well as supporting dim witted characters. The script had to be re worked for a couple of times because of being too hammy and so Donner brought in the wonderful Tom Mank. who did a great job of modifying the script to a more down to earth level. Great musical score by John Williams. T.V. version ran 191 minutes in full length on the famous California tele channel KCOP. But all was not well in paradise. Richard Donner was in opposing thoughts with producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind and so a mediator was brought in that of Richard Lester directer of the Three and Four Musketeers and the Beatles films. This went on whilst Superman and Superman II were being filmed back to back. Then in a sudden chance to get Superman released before the year 1979 the cast and crew stopped filming Superman II to finish the first film. And so it was done but at was price...".

	schema:reviewBody "I had only ever seen the TV version of the original Superman movie until I bought the HDDVD. So as you can imagine on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality I have never seen the 'full' movie until now. And I have to admit it's far far superior to Bryan Singer's selfindulgent mess of Superman Returns.It actually takes quite a while to get going but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that? Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated clumsy meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody including secret love Lois Lane falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor Gene Hackman doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination the modern term for World Domination. But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography the music the editing the pacing. I won't call the SFX fake since it doesn't ever take you out of the film so I'll just call them 'quaint'. For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation.Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando Gene Hackman Ned Beatty Margot Kidder Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don't you think? It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule I think not.".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly do not get why people love this film so much. Did I even watch the same movie these guys did?The movie starts on Krypton a surprisingly dull set piece that looks more like something cooked up by a designer who is very rich yet lacking in imagination. Nothing makes it really stand out as a truly alien world making for a rather forgettable set piece.Once Superman arrives on Earth we see his origin story which doesn't particularly stand out to me largely due to the movie not really examining what his experience with his powers are like when he is young and can't control him. Another point of contention is that when he is 18 he is played by an actor who doesn't fit the look of Superman. We get to the part where he works at the daily planet which is watchable.The acting is decent for the most part I'll give the movie that much. But I honestly feel it could have been put to better use.Now for the plot. My first problem with this is that the missiles Lex Luthor steals would not be transported in any state for which they would be assembled and fit to use for the safety hazards this would pose. My second problem is that even a 100 megaton yield hydrogen bomb on top of a fault line would not be enough to cause a major earthquake. If Lex Luthor was such a brilliant scientist he should have known that. It just doesn't make sense.My third problem is that Superman brings Lois Lane back from the dead by reversing time itself by going backwards around the Earth with terrible yet unintentionally funny special effects which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It also kills what precious little suspense was there to begin with because Superman could theoretically keep doing this whenever he felt like it. It really just felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and pulled something out of their asses to keep the plot going.This movie suffers from a terminally bland character who is never endangered by anything but kryptonite and whose only personality trait is nice and other slight variants. We never see any of the dilemmas a godlike alien who was the last of his species and an alien to the planet he lives on would face. Instead we see a smiling perfect hero who is not merely incapable of doing wrong but incapable of being tempted. If nice and perfect are the only personality traits one has to go by than it becomes meaningless. The smiling easygoing hero feels forced and fake.I have heard that Superman being nigh invincible is interesting when he has to avoid being tempted to use his powers for selfish purposes which would be true if he was capable of being tempted.With poor special effects a plot greatly weakened by holes and general lack of logic and an overdramatic score that blares out even when nothing of importance happens I got one of the biggest disappointments of my childhood in this movie. And what frustrates me the most is that if Superman could be written so he is less one dimensional it would be a movie worth seeing. Ultimately though this movie is a dull unfulfilling exercise in wasted potential lack character development a good plot a good score and decentinteresting special effects. This however is just my opinion and you can feel free to have your own.".

This however is just my opinion and you can feel free to have your own.";

	schema:headline " Most overrated movie of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Superman The Movie has by far the worst plot ever put on film. No movie ever made has a plot that depends so much on stupidity as the plot of Superman. Not even movies about stupidity e.g. Dumber And Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd can top it in that category.But let's take a look at the plot Lex Luthor buys cheap midwestern real state with the intention of sending a nuclear missile to San Andreas fault thus sinking the whole west coast which would cause his cheap real state to become the new west coast thus making him rich. Never mind the fact that the plan is neither physically possible nor economically viable those are the least of this movie's problems. The problems start when luckily for Luthor the US Army who are depicted as the most incompetent group of buffoons in the history of cinema decide to launch 2 nuclear missiles within US territory with enough fuel to reach both coasts and no failsafes whatsoever. They literally just plan to hurl the missiles up into the air and hope for the best because if anything goes wrong they're screwed. The missiles are going to be transported from the base where they are stored to the launching base where no one will ever check if anything went wrong by a group of soldiers so dumb and horny they'll leave their post in unison at the sight of a scantilyclad woman lying in the pavement ahead of them.It's bad enough that the only real difference between Luthor's plan to hijack the missiles and a Coyote's plan to capture the Road Runner is the number of empty Acme boxes lying around afterwards. It's bad enough that the plan actually works thanks to the spectacular incompetence of the US Army. It's bad enough that Otis Luthor's henchman demonstrates that he is the stupidest living being ever put on film by screwing up a task a 6yearold child would've done correctly. But what makes this sequence completely unbearable is the fact that Otis' screw up is going to play such an important part in the plot later on. Quite literally Otis' braindead screw up is the one and only reason Superman manages to defeat Luthor.Then Luthor realizes that Superman could still foil his plans so he decides to get rid of him and using reasoning that Uwe Boll would've been ashamed to put on film he deduces out of the blue the existence and effects of Kryptonite. Then he lures Superman into his lair in the sewers so he can kill him. At this point Superman is completely clueless regarding the missiles and Luthor's plan. If Luthor has kept his mouth shut he would've won. But just to prove that this movie is nothing but a bad James Bond movie written by Ed Wood and that Luthor is nothing more than a poor man's Goldfinger he tells Superman everything about his plan including how to stop it if he desires to do so. Then he puts the Kryptonite necklace on Superman pushes him into a pool and continues his James Bondvillain impersonation by conveniently walking away for no readily apparent reason hoping that Superman is nice enough to die unsupervised and stupid enough not no realize that all he has to do is to bend over and let the necklace slip from his neck. All Luthor had to do was to wait two minutes for Superman to drown. If he was in a hurry he could've helped him. But no he walks away.So Superman is in the pool a Kryptonite necklace slowly draining away his powers and even his very life. This is the first time in the whole movie that Superman cannot simply muscle his way out of a problem. So what does he do? Does he demonstrate that being a hero is about the heart not the muscles? Does he demonstrate that a hero might be down but he's never out? Does he demonstrate that a true hero will always find a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat no matter what the odds are? No that would be SuperGIRL. What Superman demonstrates is that he's absolutely worthless without his muscles. So how does he get out of there? Well it turns out that Otis' screw up in programming the missile has conveniently sent it to the town where the grandparents of Luthor's henchwoman live. And she saves Superman so he can save her grandparents in what is effectively the worst plot twist in the history of cinema.And when you thought things couldn't get any stupider they do. Superman stops the first missile but not the second one which strikes San Andreas fault and causes a huge earthquake. Several really crappy FX scenes later including one where Superman lifts a whole mountain range which incredibly enough stops the earthquake instead of causing a bigger one Lois Lane dies. So and prepare your brain cells for this one Superman flies around the Earth reversing Earth's rotation and thus reversing time magically undoing all the stuff that had just happened. He literally just hits the undo button and makes all the bad things go away.If a lesser superhero let alone a female one had tried to get away with this kind of garbage it would've instantly won a Razzie for worst screenplay of the century.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the ultimate Comic Book Adaptation bar none! Spiderman II was good with the villains and working out the CGI but Superman I and II have it all excellent wire work. Excellent camera angles that make you think Superman actually is flying off into the night. Acting? Excellent! Christopher Reeves' transformation from Clark Kent to Superman is believable you cannot look at Clark and think anything other than nice guy...but a nerd. DC revamped the character to make Clark an exathlete etc. and I always thought that was a copout. To make the disguise work Clark has to be the opposite of Superman and Reeves pulls this off to a T. Margot Kidder as Lois is what you want not some flashy Hottie that cannot act instead she's good looking but fiercely independent.Effects what can be said? This film was shot in 1970's so you don't have too much other than wire work and models but what they have to work with they used to the utmost. The scene where Superman first appears...classic! He turns into Superman love the glancing at the new phonebooth...remember those?...without the doors and flies up the side of the Daily Planet and catches Lois Don't worry I've got you. says Supes...LoisYou've got me? Who's got you? and then catches a helicopter...all with news reporters below I can't believe it...he caught her. as if it really happened. Maybe a foreshadowing of the news media fanaticism of following disasters...? Lex Luthor. Gene Hackman is a great actor. He took a role that was 1 dimensional and gave it life. You liked him...but hated him. Supporting cast was good except every time you see Otis you want to scream squeel! but that's just bc he had done Deliverance prior to this...sorry bad joke.Marlon Brando as Jor El...no one at that time would be a better pick. He was not too big yet physically and had that square jaw etc...plus was an excellent actor.All in all...the movie is top notch and would stand up today to most of the comic movies made despite lack of new special effects...which goes to show you that a movie rich in acting and script doesn't need the CGI that Hulk Spiderman etc. needed...and explains the success of X1 and X2 as well.Superman the Movie...the best ever made.".

	schema:headline " Superman may fly but much of this movie is grounded in caricatures";
	schema:reviewBody "Before the Man of Steel hit the big screen back in the seventies courtesy of Producer Illya Salkind Director Richard Donner and Warner Brothers we were assured that we would believe a man could fly.  I am not one to doubt studio promotions but just like everybody else I was game to find out if it was so.  Did I come out of Superman The Movie believing that indeed the son of Jorel also known as Kalel also known as Superman also known as Clark Kent could take to the airways without benefit of plane hot air balloon rocket pack or zeppelin?   Nahhh...of course not but Christopher Reeve looked a lot better faking it then any of his predecessors such as George Reeve and Kirk Alyn.   The truth is that Superman The Movie has a whole lot going for it besides the flight abilities of Reeve.  It also has a multitude of things that work against it.Unless you're some kind of a vampire who has been locked away in a casket for the past hundred years or so you pretty much know the story.  The Planet Krypton which has a Red Sun was spinning around out there in the far reaches of space somewhere.  Jorel Marlon Brando had come to the conclusion that Krypton was going to explode wiping out all Kryptonians. Unable to convince anyone else of his findings and not having a spaceship available that would carry him and Mrs. Kalel Susannah York he packed up his only begotten son Kalel along with his pampers and blasted him off towards Earth.  Since Earth has a yellow sun this would somehow increase the density of Kalel giving him super powers far beyond anybody but the publishers of DC comics could ever imagine.  After being adopted by a farm couple known as Ma and Pa Kent Phyllis Thaxter  Glenn Ford Kalel became young Clark Kent.  Later in life he took a job as an ace reporter at the Daily Planet ran by Editor Perry White Jackie Cooper which he used as a secret identity until he was needed to get down and get funky in his identity of Superman protector of truth justice and the American way.   It was at the Daily Planet that he met the love of his life Ace Reporter Lois Lane Margot Kidder.  Lois had the hots for Superman too as long as he was Superman and not Clark Kent.  When he was Clark Lois wouldn't be caught dead in a Honeymoon Suite at Niagara Falls with him.  But that's another story as you well know.Before dispensing with the well known back story Superman opens with a sequence where three criminals are banished into The Phantom Zone in order to set up Superman II.  You just have to give it props for that instead of waiting until just before the credits role to tack on the obligatory sequel setting end as most film makers have a penchant for doing.  Of course it helps when you know for sure there's going to be a number 2 before your number one makes it onto the big screen.   Marlon Brando is okay as Jorel but I can never seem to shake the feeling that I'm watching Brando in a white wig our forefathers would themselves have been proud to wear and his delivery amounts to giving some kind of lecture to the Continental Congress. Krypton itself is not at all like one would imagine having read the comics as it is displayed here as some kind of eternal homage to cubic zirconium.  It's pretty to look at but has no substance.This movie version doesn't spend much time with Clark as a boy but they are some of the best moments in the film in spite of the fact that Jeff East who plays young Clark had his dialog dubbed by Reeve.   Other than near the end of the film it's the only time the film shows some real heart regarding Superman or anyone else in it.  One almost hated to see SupermanClark grow up.In the comics that I grew up with in the sixties Clark was always portrayed to be somewhat of a coward by Superman in order to help protect his secret identity.  In Superman The Movie Reeve's Clark is not only a girly man but is pretty much a bumbling idiot.  While it strikes much more of a contrast between Clark and Superman it is overplayed and overdone to the point that it ends up making us dread the moments when Superman does become Clark.  That being said when Reeve does put on his cape and takes flight his portrayal as Superman is without peer.I don't have much of a problem with Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane as it seems to be right on the mark as the character was written for her. The problem is not with her characterization but not for one minute do we believe in Superman's sudden infatuation with her or why he is even attracted to her.  The only concern Lois seems to have is where is her next big story coming from and how long it is till her next cigarette.  She seems to be the epitome of a liberated woman so the fact that she would suddenly go gaga over Superman doesn't quite hold water even if he does take time out to rescue her early in the picture and later give her flying lessons. The relationship is never developed in a way that makes any sense at all.Gene Hackman is way over the top also as Lex Luthor but at least he does it with a bit of style and fun.  Not so Ned Beatty who plays his henchman Otis. Otis is supposed to be comic relief but the only relief you'll get is if you pop a couple of antacids in order to be able to stomach the character. We do not for one minute believe that Lex Luther would keep a total dunce such as Otis around for any reason as there would just have to be less excruciatingly painful criminals in Metropolis willing to run errands for him.  The character of Otis is more than just an annoyance as every scene he is in drags the story down to a mediocre level.  Valerie Perrine's Miss Teschmacher is kind of a dumb bulb also but her character is at least kept in check to the point where she is even likeable.  And alas just as most of the characters are in this film Perry White is played by Jackie Cooper as a simple minded goof ball.What is good about Superman are the flying sequences.  As a matter of fact when Superman is zooming around performing various rescues ranging from a cat to a president and capturing criminals the film as a whole takes flight.  The special effect all around are well done especially Superman's rescue of Lois from a helicopter and later as he races around California to repair the damage being done during an Earthquake.  The scenes where he takes to the sky with Lois for a romantic interlude are almost lyrical.John Williams give us another one of his no holds bar musical scores.  Its well done for this kind of film and apparently the producers and director thought so too as it plays over top of some of the longest running opening and closing film credits known to man.  In other words when the film starts you'll have plenty of time to still pop another batch of popcorn run to the bathroom and make it back to your recliner before we come close to reaching the planet Krypton.Besides Otis the biggest problem with Superman The Movie comes near the end.  In order to resolve a plot situation which if left as it was would have caused major problems for the subsequent sequel the writer director or somebody has Superman perform a stunt that reeks of lazy film making.  It opens a plot hole as wide and as deep as the Grand Canyon.  Usually in a film based on a comic book character one can overlook such devices but this one is so glaring and obvious in its ineptitude that it one will be forced to mumble a certain word pertaining to bull droppings.  I haven't felt this cheated since my first girlfriend dumped me for another guy.Superman The Movie is highly watchable in many aspects.  With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time. Unfortunately when you can only make me think of what might have been or could have been I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Superman The Movie is a C.".

With a little more thought and consideration in how to bring the classic characters to the screen it could have been one of the great comic book films of all time. Unfortunately when you can only make me think of what might have been or could have been I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Superman The Movie is a C.";

	schema:reviewBody "As many of you are aware there is several versions of this Superman film. This review is for the Longest Edition. This is called the RESTORED INTERNATIONAL CUT. I was not a huge Superman fan when I saw this film. I herd this was a good movie. I never seen a cartoon or television show on Superman so U had no idea who Lois Lane was. However I think that served me well. I was taken on an E TICKET RIDE that I never forgot. Even to this day this is still one of my favorite movie going experiences. In fact I loved this more than I did Star Wars. Most of you know the story of Superman. This film starts off with a bang however I am not a fan of the prolonged opening credit sequence. To me that is still pretty to watch but it BORING. Thank god for the fast forward buttons.Academy Awardwinners Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman head an all star cast in the fantastic actionpacked film that made Christopher Reeve an international star playing the greatest superhero of all time. From the doomed planet of Krypton two parents launch a spaceship carrying their infant son to earth. Here he grows up to become Clark Kent mildmannered reporter for the Metropolis Daily Planet. But with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men he battles for truth and justice as Superman.Now the 3 hour Plus edition is worth watching however there is not much in the way of new scenes but more like SCENES BEING EXTENDED. The only NEW SCENE that comes to mind that should have been left in the original theatrical edition is whenSuperman talks to his father after he has revealed himself for the first time. It is a great scene and this is about the only SCENE that Richard Donner added back into the film for its DVD debut. I do however enjoy seeing the extension of Lois talking to the Indian Chief. It adds more information about why the Indians were selling their land. This film is still the best comic book movie ever made. Every film that has been based on a comic is compared to this 1978 Film. Nothing has come close to have the magic that this film captured. Richard Donner created a classic that still Underappreciated. Today's comic book movies are garbage. They have no heart and are cast with the likes of Jessica Alba and other terrible actors. This is a first class production. The actors are all great in the roles they have. Can't say that about any Batman movies.".

So yeah Darth Vader trained Superman. And if that doesn't blow your mind Mario Puzo Author of The Godfather wrote the screenplay how can this movie fail? Marlon Brando is just as fantastic as always. Margot Kidder is my favourite Lois Lane and the flawless Gene Hackman all do solid jobs. As I write I must say that only recently have I got back into the whole mythos of Superman. Nowadays many people will see the special effects as dated but I still thought while watching the movie that it has aged incredibly well. If the effects may be getting on then the acting still remains sublime.Story On what little there is is practically the origins and it was pulled off incredibly well.

AND if he was capable of moving that fast shouldn't he have been able to get to both missiles in like a nanosecond? Either way after seeing the whole movie I still really enjoyed it. It's considered a timeless classic and I think it's more than deserving of that title. There's so much to enjoy about it.Final Verdict Whether it's the scene of Clark Kent outrunning a train or Superman and Lois flying through the clouds at night.

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Reeve is excellent as both Clark Kent and Superman. With his performances he creates two very different characters making it easy to understand why people could actually believe that they were different people. His wonderful chemistry with Margot Kidder and the diametrically opposed ways in which Lois reacts to Clark and Superman form the bedrock of the film. If lesser actors had been cast in these roles the film would still have been brilliant in terms of special effects writing etc. but its emotional core would have been lost. I have nothing but praise for the rest of the cast as well. The effects were remarkable and groundbreaking for their time and still look great 36 years later in spite of all the advances in that time. The design of the sets was beautiful particularly during the early sequences on Krypton. At 145 minutes this is the longest film that I have watched all year but it's also one of the best paced. It never drags in part due to its epic scale and unusual structure the Krypton scenes are made in the style of a Shakespearean play or Biblical epic the Smallville scenes present us with a very cosy Rockwellian slice of Americana and the Metropolis scenes which form the bulk of the film obviously! are essentially a comedy drama. I would say that the Smallville scenes are the weakest but in the sense of being the least good as opposed to awful. In spite of that and one or two other very minor issues such as the film's occasionally contradictory timeline I'm giving this a perfect score.This is the best depiction of Superman that I've seen in any medium outside of the very best comics as well as the best superhero film that I've seen. All other superhero films owe a huge debt to this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just as the 3 Star Wars prequels ruined the Star Wars franchise though I never liked it to begin with this new Star Trek prequel is a damaging blow to the Star Trek movie franchise and this prequel crap needs to stop now. The pathetic writers of this new Hollywood generation can't come up with any new creative ideas so they just keep going back in time as they did with Batman Begins with established franchises as if we need to see over and over again how the characters we love so much got their start. And the BIG problem with this new Star Trek movie is that they TOTALLY foul up the history of these characters and then insult our intelligence by having Spock Prime  the older Spock say that his actions altered the course of history which we learn is why Kirk's father dies on the day of his birth this time around. What a lame poor excuse for why the history of Mr. Spock Captain Pike Captain Kirk Dr. McCoy and even Chekov is so radically different from what it is in the Original Series and its Original movies. What is different? For one in TOS Kirk first served under Captain Robert April on a different starship and had years of experience as a first officer before becoming captain. In this movie Kirk's serves with Captain Pike of the Enterprise first right alongside Spock and on his FIRST day of service he becomes first officer and then on the very same day is suddenly promoted to Captain! Quite a leap up the ladder! In TOS Spock is supposed to have served under Captain Pike 13 years before he and Kirk meet. Also Dr. McCoy suddenly becomes Chief Medical Officer on the very same day that Kirk suddenly becomes Captain. Wow what a coincidence! This movie so ridiculously rushes the whole thing but it's OK because Spock altered everything right? In this movie Chekov is on the bridge as navigator even BEFORE Kirk ever steps foot on the Enterprise. That means he has MORE experience than Kirk! So in TOS how did Kirk become Captain while Chekov was a lowly ensign? Oh yeah Spock altered history. And Chekov is said to be 17 in this movie. When did he start at Starfleet Academywhen he was 13?! Finally this movie has no intelligent or even intelligible story. It has a ludicrous story of the Romulans who look like a biker gang in this movie creating Black Holes out of planets. And this movie is all action and loudness with dizzying camera shaking which totally goes against TOS's cleverness of playing on ideas rather than action. Abrams has no business in the Star Trek franchise and I hope he never makes another Star Trek movie. But I guess as long as they make plenty of  it doesn't matter. That's more important than being faithful to the characters and history of the show right?".

I guess I was a Trekkie in my younger days  but only for the original series and I guess the films with the original crew not the spinoffs. All the more reason I really wanted to like this film.I don't even know where to begin. This film is a mess. It doesn't work for me as a popcorn movie let alone as Star Trek. The plot is ridiculous and full of holes. Black holes get it? Trekkies have always been able to forgive ridiculous plots e.g. Star Trek movies three through six as long as it meant we'd get to see Kirk and crew back in action. This socalled reboot is barely recognizable.Rather than doing a sustained impression of William Shatner's Kirk Chris Pine appears to have opted instead for a sustained impression of Christian Slater. Never mind how Pine plays Kirk the character hardly resembles the original anyway. Instead of James T. Kirk the master tactician who lived and breathed Starfleet but wasn't afraid to buck the system we get James T. Kirk the reckless ahole who has issues with authority.Then there is Spock. Instead of cool logical levelheaded but still part human Spock we get vindictive whiny Spock  who is having a hot affair with Lt. Uhura who herself appears to be a descendant of Beyonce.All of the remaining characters  including the villain  are written and played fairly onedimensionally. The only characters that seem to come close to the originals are Scotty  who is in the film all too briefly  and Chekhov.Yeah I know this is now alternate universe Star Trek because Nero and Spock Prime went back in time and changed the past present and future. That shouldn't mean everything has to suck.Woe to Leonard Nimoy for not being able to resist a little more Spock money. The producers obviously lured him into this film to give it some Trek credibility Trekibility but it doesn't help. Shatner should be glad he wasn't asked.Well I know I am going against the grain here. This film has done huge box office so JJ Abrams and crew will make more of them. Let me save you the trouble of waiting or traveling to the future to see them They will also suck.".

I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.To my great delight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams reimaging of Star Trek. I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them even in younger iterations because most people think of the characters of Kirk Spock Bones Scotty Uhura Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately my doubts were unnecessary.This is not your father's Star Trek. From the moment the movie begins so does the action and it never lets up. However this movie has more than just incredible and intense action it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.But what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles especially Chris Pine as Kirk Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy aka Bones. This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine however takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer lover and captain that you already know but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger bravado intelligence and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.They have laid a solid foundation for a new series with new life perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll start my review with the disclaimer that I am indeed a hardcore Star Trek fan. The Trekkie in me wanted to give this a rating of 010 but I gave it a 310 for a few reasons Good acting good special effect good action.If those things are what you look for in a movie like this you'll probably rank it a lot higher! From a Trekkie point of view this movie was awful! Even for a parallel universe which is a copout I have HUGE issues with the movie. Starting with plot holes and writing issues When children tease other children they do it to feel superior. It is an emotional thing to do. So the Vulcan children that were teasing Spock trying to get him to show emotion were doing so out of emotion themselves. Sarek Spock's father was one of the most logical Vulcan's ever in Star Trek. I can't imagine any universe ever when Sarek would tell Spock it is okay to feel anger and the reason he married Amanda Spock's mother was because he loved her. Romulus was ultimately destroyed by a star that went supernova. The only star that could destroy Romulus by going supernova would be the star at the center of Romulus' system. If the mysterious Red Matter were placed in the star to prevent the supernova Romulus would be without a star anyway and the planet would freeze and die. Beyond that a black hole in the center of a solar system would eat all the planets in the system too including Romulus. So the planet was doomed no matter what. Apparently none of the writers or set designers had ever watched an original episode of Star Trek or seen a schematic. The lattice structures and water pipes in the Enterprise were ridiculous. Likewise the bridge was horrible. A turbo lift where it should be but a second door that doesn't lead to a turbo lift but out onto the ship! The bridge is at the top of the ship...you can't have a door that leads to the rest of the ship. According to canon the Enterprise was commissioned in 2245 under the command of Robert April. This would have been when Kirk was 12 years old. April commanded the ship for 9 years before Pike took command in 2254. Surely the destruction of the Kelvin wouldn't have changed these facts! But in the movie the Enterprise is brand new when Pike takes command. A cadet Kirk that had not yet graduated from the academy that was on academic suspension no less got a field commission to first officer!? The hearing at the end of the movie appears to happen days after Nero is defeated. Consequently Kirk is given command of the Enterprise. So Star Fleet saw fit to promote Kirk from Cadet past Ensign Lieutenant JG Lieutenant Lieutenant Cmdr and Commander straight to Captain and give him command of the Flag Ship of the Federation!? Kirk was born in 2233 and this movie most likely took place in 2254. That would make Kirk 21 when he takes command. According to canon Spock was born in 2232 making him one year older than Kirk. Yet in this movie Spock is a full fledged Commander at the age of 22. Romulans are not first seen until 2266 TOS Balance of Terror yet everybody seems to recognize the Romulans as Romulans!Those are just a few of the larger plot holes that I noted. Second Star Trek has always been based on science. Warp drive transporters tractor beams etc. They are all based on science. Beyond that Star Trek science has rules just like real world science has rules. For example there is a limit on Warp drive and there is a range on transporters. Here are a few of the science issues that I had Red Matter  what is that all about? No explanation whatsoever. When it is placed in the center of a massive body a planet star etc it creates a singularity black hole. A single dropyet the massive blob on Spock's ship is stable. And if it is stable because it is being suspended and not touching other matter how is the hypodermic needle used to extract the red matter explained? At least antimatter has always been based on science. If it comes into contact with matter the two annihilate each other destructively. Hence the reason for antimatter containment chambers warp core breaches etc. Transporters have a range! In Star Trek 6 The Undiscovered Country Kirk and crew need to beam down to Khitomer to stop an assassination. Kirk asked if they are in transporter range and Spock says not yet and starts a countdown. They are well within the boundaries of the solar system at this point. In this new movie Kirk and Scotty beam to the Enterprise from Delta Vega. The Enterprise was traveling at Warp 4 away from Delta Vega. That is roughly 100 times the speed of light 18.6 million milessec or 67 billion mileshour. If we assume Kirk was on the surface for 3 hours before he and Scotty beamed back to the Enterprise the ship would be roughly 200 billion miles away from the planet. It is roughly 2.7 billion miles from Earth to Neptune the outer limits of our Solar System. So they transported to a ship traveling at Warp 4 from a distance equal to almost 75 times the distance from Earth to Neptune. Oh and earlier in the movie they were having a hard time locking onto Kirk and Sulu because they were falling not holding still.I hope the world of Star Trek will quietly ignore this movie! Seemed to me like a simple excuse to try to shake the money tree once again.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me start out by saying I am a Trek fan. I love the original series. Not the kind of fan that knows everything that happened to everybody in every episode on every stardate type of fan but a fan nonetheless. The last few movies were dull and I never even bothered to watch The Enterprise TV series. When I heard a new movie was in the works I was very happy. Once I heard JJ Abrams was directing my heart sank still can't forgive him for what he turned Lost into.First of all the plot is so full of holes the whole starfleet could fly through. Why is it that a cadet crew some not even cadets yet are the only ones who can save a planet or two? The movie relies too much on visual effects and too little on plot. The effects got boring after awhile. The time travel thing has been done and done so many times it's obvious the writers can't come up with new ideas. Even if we are to accept this is some alternate universetimeline it still doesn't explain how Chekhov aged so closely to Kirk. In the original series he was only 22 and Kirk in his 30's. In the original series no one knew what Romulans looked like or that they were similar to Vulcans yet it's common knowledge in the film. None of the movie makes sense. You have to have a lack of imagination to truly enjoy this film. Leonard Nimoy doesn't even seem like his old character.I saw this with both trek and non trek fans and everyone agreed it dragged on too long was boring  they couldn't wait for it to be over. Star Trek needs to take another long rest and any future movies must not involve JJ Abrams. This is not Star Trek reimagined it is Star Trek rewritten.".

Not the kind of fan that knows everything that happened to everybody in every episode on every stardate type of fan but a fan nonetheless. The last few movies were dull and I never even bothered to watch The Enterprise TV series. When I heard a new movie was in the works I was very happy. Once I heard JJ Abrams was directing my heart sank still can't forgive him for what he turned Lost into.First of all the plot is so full of holes the whole starfleet could fly through.

This isn't even my Star Trek.This isn't even Star Trek and has no business being called Star Trek. Oh sure the names are there and yes it's glitzy and expensive with lots of explosions...Spocks mom dies...for the really hardcore there is a reference of Cardasians...OH yeah and there is Uhura making out with Spock on the transporter pad and before that asking him if and I quote just tell me what you want of me and i'll do it in a turbo lift as a way to console Spock after Vulcan had just been destroyed. What a way to make Uhura a cheap thrill ride...It's okay though cause OLD Spock played poorly by Leonard Nimoy says that is an alternate time line and because of that it makes everything better...Let me put my view into perspective. I watch the Old series I watch the Next Generation I watch DS9 I watch Enterprise. And I'm not even one of those guys who wears the uniform and lives the lifestyle...But you know I am so tired of Hollywood butchering the things that I grew up on.And Trekkies? Oh the Trekkies will hate this.Yeah sure there is the Kobayashi Maru which in all honesty is about the only thing canonical to this whole mess of a film but other wise it was just one slight after another.Chekhov is suddenly this wiz kid physicist scotty is basically a garage mechanic Uhura is suddenly this linguistic genius Spock is just a tool Sulu is a ninja and Kirk... Well Kirk is apparently the smartest person in Iowa with a genius I.Q. and a pension for being a rebellious wild child.And for a moment let's talk about the Leonard Nimoy cameo. Why it's got Leonard Nimoys endorsement it must be good! And look he even says some key Spock Quotes! OOOO...Yeah so what. It is a cheap ploy to get the trekkies to spend their money on something that will very soon be universally known as the absolute worst Star Trek in history.It's even worse then 5...In my many years and dollars of going to see movies I have only walked out on 1. Tonight was my second. I never in a million years thought that I would walk out on a Star Trek movie. Never. But I went in there expecting and knowing it would be a reboot...I never imagined this being a slap in the face.People who know nothing of Star Trek will probably love it. However when they go back to watch the originals they wont get it.People who love Star Trek will hate this and be thankful that there will always be the series.But you know? It's okay that Spocks mom dies! It's okay that Spock and Uhura are lovers and that she throws herself at like a cheap callgirl it's okay that Chekhov is even there and all these things are okay! Because it's an alternate time line! And that makes everything better!!!!!!!! True Fans you have been warned. This is not anything remotely close to the Star Trek that we know and love. It is hurtful and near hateful towards the series that has inspired us to look up into the star and dream of boldly going where no man has gone before.It is disrespectful towards all of the black woman who were inspired by Nichelle Nichols to rise above the stereotypes of that day and age and become more then what they told they could be.It is a perversion towards all of us kids who dreamed of being Captain Kirk and discovering new life and new civilizations. A Kirk who was a seasoned hero and not hot headed firebrand who was given command like being given an expensive sports car by a rich uncle.And it is an insult to all of us who crave knowledge and that delicate balance between logic and emotion.End Spoilers".

As with all time travel plots the paradoxes and logical inconsistencies batter you about the head until you just give up thinking. TIME TRAVEL IS SCIENCE FICTION FOR MORONS.I won't bother to list all the specifics  you can read them here in other reviews and they are legion. Vulcan is destroyed. There are two Spocks the younger of which is having an affair with Uhura. Spock's mother and Kirk's father and billions of other current and future people are now dead or will never exist. The Federation somehow knows about Romulans and Cardassians already. It goes on and on.Oh and despite the Burger King commercials there are no Klingons in the film. Klingons are mentioned a couple of times as a minor plot device.The short version is this if you liked Trek before this film you will not like this film. This film brazenly reboots everything you ever knew. None of it ever happened.I'm ashamed of Leonard Nimoy for selling out for this piece of garbage. Kudos to everyone else from the REAL Trek who stayed far away. In my opinion this film will be rejected by fans as never having happened.

That would be too easy and would just invite others to castigate me for not suspending disbelief during a fun summer scifi. No this movie sucks on a very base level. The first and most disturbing part of the movie is the villain Nero who I think is the worst villain Hollywood has given us and Hollywood once gave us Arnold as Ice Man. Nero is awful because his motivation makes no sense whatsoever.As the story goes Nero is furious at Spock and by extension his whole race of Vulcans because Spock did not get to Romulus' star in time to save it from super nova which destroyed his planet and all those he loved and cared for. In the process both he and Spock are sucked into a black hole and spit out the other side well in the past except at different times Nero 25 years before Spock. In waiting 25 years for Spock to come through the black hole as he had Nero and his crew seethe with rage and plot their revenge against Spock and his evil race of Vulcans.But why? Did Spock create the super nova? No. That was explained as a natural disaster. Did Spock try to save his planet? Yes. In fact he had every reason to believe that he was going to die in the process. After failing to stave off the super nova he was sucked into a black hole which is assumed to destroy anything entering it after all black holes literally crush atoms to the point of not existing. Personally I think that makes Spock a hero to the Romulans! Having a vendetta against Spock and the Vulcans would be like tracking down and killing the family of a fire fighter who died in your house while he tried to save your wife and kids. That makes no sense. None. Last Nero is now in the past no? Why doesn't he just go about saving his planet from destruction? He's got the red matter to do it.The other thing that ticked me off was the silly string of accidents that put a gang of 22 yearolds in command of the Federation's flagship. Do they not have even a single 40 yearold who has actually been in space before? It's even worse than that if you think about it. Before the ship takes off Kirk is about to be booted out of Starfleetbut now he's put in charge?I'm willing to suspend disbelief in scifi movie but there's a difference between suspending disbelief and watching a movie like I'm a 3year old. 3 stars out of 10.".

I was extremely disappointed.While some of the casting was spot on I truly loved Karl Urban's portrayal of McCoy others were horrible. This movie turned Uhura from the elegant professional she was into an oversexed adolescent. Scotty went from a dedicated professional to a buffoon. The worst however is Chris Pine's take on Kirk. Pine's Kirk is just another rubber stamp action hero  the same character we've seen in dozens of big budget action movies before. At no time did I believe him as James T Kirk.The set designer for this movie should be blacklisted from Hollywood for the cheesy crap heshe threw at us. The engineering set looked like something from a bad Sci Fi Channel movie! I understand it was filmed in a power plant. They had 150 million to make this movie and they couldn't build some actual sets? Ditto for Scotty's outpost. The auditorium at Starfleet Academy looked like and probably was a tired and worn college lecture hall complete with dingy 70's curtains. I could almost smell the mildew. Every time they showed that garbage I was rudely jerked out of the tiny amount of suspension of disbelief that I was able to muster.There were so many plot holes you could use this movie as a doily.It felt as if the producers really hated Star Trek and were going out of the way to wipe out 40 years of canon. When they destroyed Vulcan and killed Spock's Mother I nearly walked out.This movie is not Star Trek. There is no heart no soul. Nothing but over the top effects and violence. I know that this is what adolescent audiences want nowadays but why pander to the lowest expectations? Why not give us something that wows us and not just because it has awesome explosions but because it engages our minds and imaginations. Even if you ignore it being Star Trek and examine it as just another effects laden Sci Fi movie it comes up short.This movie had so much potential. It was all wasted.".

Strong meaningless emotions were intermingled with fancy special effects and a nonsense plot. If you want to see the movie because of the trailer stick with the trailer it's all the content you get. Anyone that says this movie was good wasn't paying attention at all. The target demographic of this movie must have been toddlers.They quickly rushed between scenes ignoring any relevance to or continuity of the plot. Characters made bold speeches and impassioned decisions that were either meaningless or simply defied in the next ten seconds. Characters also blatantly threw out their catch lines every chance they got to speak. I got a sense this movie wasn't geared toward trekkies but to people who just knew the catch lines. Awful.I back up what I say here's a list..spoilersThe first scene where the young kirk threw a car off a cliff had nothing to do with anything.. at all.The plot was free of any logic. Romulus's planet is destroyed. Why didn't they evacuate? Why was one man spoc charged with billions of lives? How did a miner find a way back in time? If it was common knowledge why didn't everyone just go back in time to destroy the supernova? Why didn't he just save his planet when he got to the past? Obviously even if he destroys the federation and the vulcans the supernova will still destroy his planet. And how the hell did he go back in time? Oh he got sucked into a black hole. Just like the one he put in the center of the vulcan planet? Just like the one that destroyed him at the end? Why didn't they all just go back in time at the end and save EVERYONE??If you really payed attention few scenes actually made sense with regard to where they were and what they were doing.Kirk makes spock beat his face in and then becomes captain. Spock has a severe emotional breakdown and they're best friends in less than two minutes.You don't have to drill to destroy a planet with a black hole. A planet wouldn't be around for minutes if it had a black hole at it's center. At the end they create a black whole with like 10000 times the red matter as before right next to earth.Romulus could kill kirk at one point but just doesn't.. for no real reason..At some points they're warping around faster than light speed. Sometimes it takes them a few minutes to get somewhere. Sometimes it takes half the movie.I have more points like why were the drill operators wielding axes from 150 years in the future like they don't have guns in the future?? but suffice to say I felt dumber having watched this movie. I hope it tanks.spoilers".

	schema:reviewBody "After the recently terrible James Bond film and the equally terrible ending to the Bourne trilogy it appears that the wobbly camera disease has spread to another franchise with similar results. There appears to be a direct correlation between the rate of camera wobble and the pace of the action scene being shot. We all know that this camera wobble is artificial and often done during editing and special effect overlay but the outcome is the same and it is unwatchable. It appears to me to be a technique used today in many films to prevent the audience clearly seeing the shot the special effects and the action occurring. Possibly because the audience would see mismatches between the special effects the action being overlaid and the poor quality stunt work. I gave this film a rating of one out of ten principally because the wobbly camera technique is something we now see in many films particularly films with large amounts of special effects and it is cheating the audience out of the opportunity to see if the shot actually flows and to observe how the special effects are melded to the shot and the action. Do we really want to come away from every film thinking we have been in a small boat in a rough swell? I certainly don't and I now add JJ Abrams to the list of Marc Forster who created the worst Bond film of all time with jiggle camera and Paul Greengrass who destroyed the Bourne Trilogy with shaky camera. Hang your head in shame this trio had the opportunity to make great films each carrying their franchise forward and each in turn has been unable to achieve an outcome without the use of shaky camera which is an automatic turnoff for the audience.".

	schema:headline " And when I say alternate future I mean unintelligent and pointless";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a really disappointing movie. This reboot of the Star Trek universe is way off the mark. The original series certainly shows its 1960's roots but the characters and almost all of the stories were intelligently written and imaginatively and consistently developed.The relationship between Kirk and Spock was built around each providing a counterpoint for the other's strengths with Spock of course balancing Kirk's passion with a healthy dose of reason. Between them they formed a symbiotic medium reflecting the human condition that leadership and advancement comes from a balance of both reason and passion.The original Kirk was passionate and decisive but was not reckless. Nor was he consumed by his own crude punk emotions. He was a leader who understood that his responsibilities extended to his ship his crew Star Fleet and the rules and aims of the larger society. He let this guide his decisions. Even by himself there was responsibility rationality and reason within him. Spock represented and added to the pure rational component of any argument. Put together the two characters showed us that goals and problems are best addressed by moving the human condition towards a stronger sense of responsibility rationality and reason. It was a vision for the future.Against that in this new movie both characters have moved decidedly away from the rational and towards the emotional. Kirk is now just some onedimensional selfobsessed reckless angry rebel who treats every situation as an opportunity to start a bar fight literally andor figuratively. One expects future dialog to be along the lines of Spock did you see the way that ambassador glanced at me during negotiations? He needs a lesson in respect. Fire all photon torpedoes!! Who in their right mind would want such a character as a starship captain?And the new Spock has had the strengths of his rational side completely neutered. This new movie makes it obvious that his rational Vulcan side is ineffective unimportant and weak and that the emotional human side is where all the important cool parts are. The arc of the story in this movie seems to be constantly telling him Dude...stop thinking so much!

Six billion lives lost from a culture that was as advanced peaceful and intelligent as the Vulcans remember...it was the Vulcan's who first reached out to humanity to make First Contact is an tragic important event. The original series would have made THAT the point of the event as it should be. But in this movie the only really important thing was that Spock's mother was killed. Well! Now it's personal I guess! No wonder he's mad! Why is it that movies such as this can't talk in the important abstract? Why is there always the need to introduce the personal vendetta? Why can we not have an important cause that is worth struggling for in its own right? In the aggregate whereas the point of the original relationship between Spock and Kirk was that the addition of stronger reasoning adds to our human capacity the point of this movie seems to be the opposite that what humans need to do is reason less think less make everything personal give authority and responsibility the finger break as many rules as possible and get into as many bar fights as we possibly can. I was hoping that we'd left that attitude behind us with the passing of the Bush years...but I guess not.As a side rant on that...the American psyche is frustrating in its contradictions. We live in gated communities to keep us away from exactly the barfighting trash represented by Kirk in this movie. We want harsh lockemaway laws if such characters challenge our peace of mind. But in the movies we celebrate those same characters fighting authority breaking all the rules thumbing their noses at exactly us and those we appoint punching anyone who asks them to be reasonable killing anyone who tries to stop them and winning only by fighting not by thinking or working together. The same effect shows up in shows like Prison Break. How does a society both impose capital punishment AND cheer for the supposedly wrongly convicted to fight against the police that are trying to enforce the very laws that us as a society put in place? If we recognize that people are sometimes wrongly convicted...why are we killing them? The other sad direction in this movie was the removal of Vulcans and Romulans as alternate societies. Again we seem to be taking the attitude that only us humans matter. The others are uninteresting unimportant and potentially get in the way. Whereas the original series celebrated the idea of different societies and recognized that any society even all of humanity itself will benefit by coming together into a larger common society with others of sympathetic goals this movie promotes the idea that we would be better off if everyone was more like us or better yet if everyone else BUT us would disappear. In this movie the us is humanity compared to the them of other planets. In our world the us is our culture or country compared to the them of other cultures or countries. Again...I was hoping that such a provincial attitude would pass with the Bush years...but again sadly I must be mistaken.The original series was a vision for the future...a larger more interesting future. The new movie is a vision for the past...a provincial isolationist fearful past. In the end the world and the galaxy are both poorer places because of this movie when compared to the vision and intellect of the original series.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a really disappointing movie. This reboot of the Star Trek universe is way off the mark. The original series certainly shows its 1960's roots but the characters and almost all of the stories were intelligently written and imaginatively and consistently developed.The relationship between Kirk and Spock was built around each providing a counterpoint for the other's strengths with Spock of course balancing Kirk's passion with a healthy dose of reason. Between them they formed a symbiotic medium reflecting the human condition that leadership and advancement comes from a balance of both reason and passion.The original Kirk was passionate and decisive but was not reckless. Nor was he consumed by his own crude punk emotions. He was a leader who understood that his responsibilities extended to his ship his crew Star Fleet and the rules and aims of the larger society. He let this guide his decisions. Even by himself there was responsibility rationality and reason within him. Spock represented and added to the pure rational component of any argument. Put together the two characters showed us that goals and problems are best addressed by moving the human condition towards a stronger sense of responsibility rationality and reason. It was a vision for the future.Against that in this new movie both characters have moved decidedly away from the rational and towards the emotional. Kirk is now just some onedimensional selfobsessed reckless angry rebel who treats every situation as an opportunity to start a bar fight literally andor figuratively. One expects future dialog to be along the lines of Spock did you see the way that ambassador glanced at me during negotiations? He needs a lesson in respect. Fire all photon torpedoes!! Who in their right mind would want such a character as a starship captain?And the new Spock has had the strengths of his rational side completely neutered. This new movie makes it obvious that his rational Vulcan side is ineffective unimportant and weak and that the emotional human side is where all the important cool parts are. The arc of the story in this movie seems to be constantly telling him Dude...stop thinking so much!

Picard Riker Data...Furthermore all the past Star Trek movies are great so this one will also be good...Or will it?!? As a recent thing I begun watching the original Star Trek series with Kirk and Spock. You can imagine when I heard about this movie I was thrilled So what about this movie? Well it is quite bad with no Star Trek feeling in it. Though I know why it made so great at the box office. It is because people love this kind of movies. But if you are a hard core ST fan it's really hard to chew it.Spoilers don't read if you haven't seen it!My personal list of mistakes.1First mistake is that you lose half a movie because of character development. 2 Captain Pike had no first officer? The humanity was left with a bunch of raw cadets. Please consider today's armed forces. Where the hell on this earth all the experienced troops go out to war leaving their homeland unprotected. Anyway I would imagine Pike could never promote a cadet like that. BUT hey the movie has only 2 HOURS and at the end Kirk must be captain you get the point 3Then of course Chekov loses Spock's mother in the most idiotic scene I have ever seen. By the way anyone noticed how the transporters take FOREVER to dematerialize?4The romulans were digging up the planets with some sort of a chained drill how ancient is that?. I'm just wondering maybethough very unlikely there were no space ships around to disable that drill but I would AT LEAST expect some sort of interceptors to be a last line of defense for any planet. The only defense of Vulcan were 3 cadets jumping with parachutes? Give me a fing break please! And you could also stop and think why would a mining drill prevent teleportation and communications? Or was this forced in just to have the exciting parachute jump? 5 Kirk's mutiny made him end up on the same planet as the old Spock and Scotty. That is really cool and original...WOW good call there. They found each other probably within hours on a very hostile planet . Again I must remind you the movie is short we must have a full crew by the end. Nevermind on how we do that 6 Red matter?!? I missed that...Never heard of it. Hell that's some powerful stuff. Again please how did you come up with it? And if one drop was that powerful why was Spock carrying like a tone of it?7 Old Spock failed to save the Romulan homeland because...he arrived TOO late. Anyone here thinks they should have come up with a better story?8 Nero instead of destroying Earth goes after Spock? Yeah of course... Anyway nice looking mining ship you got there Nero with lots of ammo on board. Apparently it can destroy entire fleets. Not too safe inside though dangerous walkways one wrong step and you're gone...9 Kirk and Spock they only sent those 2 on the enemy ship instead of a trained assault team. 10 20 30 men...Give them hell but noooo instead we get an overrated shoot'em up comedy.There is other stuff wrong but hey if you liked it no matter what I think. Good sound and effects in this movie. I must rate it a 3.".

SPOILER ALERTProsMy wife and I liked the actors who portrayed Kirk Spock and McCoy  we could imagine them as younger versions without too much trouble. Much less so for Uhura Checkov Sulu and especially Scotty.We liked a lot of the in jokes and back references. For instance seeing how Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru or Spock's hassles as a kid and his refusal to join the Vulcan Science Academy. How Kirk learns early from Spock to bait Spock when it suits his purpose. Spock's dad finally admitting that he loved Amanda. Iowa wild man farm boy.ConsWe didn't like the frenetic intercutting.We've all seen movies with gratuitous sex and violence. But gratuitous plumbing? The cargo bay was filled with pipes and that sequence with Scotty in the tubes was so dumb it was offensive. The whole Scottyascomedyrelief thing didn't work for us. Neither did his Star Wars sidekick.The young Spock was distinctly pink in closeups not green as his cupraglobinbased blood would make him.Physicists have long maintained that a black hole smaller than a pea could if it intersected with a planet collapse it to nothing in a matter of seconds. But such a black hole would have to have the mass of 100 planets so a ship with malicious intent would have to be able to tow 100 planets worth of mass. And of course the ship would be sucked up too. The business of drilling a hole was nonsense. A black hole would sink through bedrock far more easily than a knife cuts through soft butter.The transporter effect reminded me of a silkworm cocoon. Everybody knows transporters don't work like that.No Star Fleet officer would strand another on an arctic planet. Especially not on Delta Vega a desolate planet near the edge of the galaxy containing only a lithium cracking station. This is used to manufacture the dilithium crystals that moderate the flow of power from the warp drive antimatter converters. Oh but wait this is a different Delta Vega one that just happens to be in orbit around 40 Eridani close to Vulcan.Star Fleet vehicles do not burn 10footdeep holes into ice when they land.Spock and Uhura? Come on  Spock is only interested in romance every seven years.I was perhaps most offended by the bad guy's ship. Everybody knows you can't have warp drive without separating the engine's nacelles from the rest of the ship since they produce toxic radiation while in use. This ship with its absurdly nonfunctional pointy barbs and no nacelles should win the Silliest Starship award. The Romulans make nice starships. They wouldn't make a ship that looks like a porcupine.And speaking of Romulans since they share relatively recent common ancestry with the Vulcans they look like Vulcans. They don't look like Vin Diesel and tattoo themselves like 21st century rogue bikers.A green Orion slave girl as a cadet at Star Fleet? They hadn't yet been emancipated.Red matter? Looks like blood and is removed with a huge hypodermic? Get real!Spock's pinwheel ship? Who would design a ship to spin around as it flew? What were they thinking???Slowmoving easily destroyed missiles launched from the Romulan porcupine ship? More nonsense! The Romulans had a very formidable plasma weapon at that time.The Enterprise didn't look right or sound right.The Enterprise was on a five year mission in the original series three years of which were presumably covered by the original three years of shows. This means that somehow in the first two years the crew went from being freshfaced cadets to mature travelers.In summary this was a comic book not a drama. We were deeply offended. We've seen the future and we know what it's like. And don't give us any of that alternate timeline crap we know better.This is somewhat tongue and cheek but we really were disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Another great Hollywood movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Every Star Trek fan knows the ST movies aren't that good. This is because they try to be different from the series in appealing to the mainstream. But Star Trek is rock solid and it can handle some of the absolutely silly scripts we have seen in some past movies.In this case we have a prequel that recasts the original cast. Questionable but if there is a lot of story to tell then that should be acceptable. But that is exactly the problem. There was no way to tell a new story without destroying the existing storyline. So they made a new one. Makes no sense right? Well in Star Trek you can just call it an alternative timeline and suddenly it's acceptable.The movie starts and any fan of Star Trek will be shocked by the cinematic style. The camera shakes like crazy lighting effects literally blind you. They can't get a solid shot of someone face or of two people talking. No they give you shaking closeups with only part of their face actually on screen quickly switching between the two persons.The 4 of the 5 first scenes with Kirk are horrifying. In the first he apparently tries to commit suicide. Or he almost accidentally wins a Darwin award can't tell. In the second he gets beaten to bloody pulp while touching breasts. Then afterward his father's friend just bluntly tells him to join Starfleet and he does it. Makes no sense. In the third he has sex with a female Shreklookalike. I had to press stop again and regain my composure. The fourth is where he has a conversation with McCoy. This is stiff as wood and not redeeming but the contrast with the previous scenes is big. They throw out some old oneliners but that doesn't work either. In the 5th he takes the Kobayashi Maru test for the third time while eating an apple and acting like it is one big joke. Apparently this is this movie's attempt at humor.Here I had to stop the movie for a third time.Now you have to remember the comments the director made. He said he disliked Star Trek and thus never watched any of it himself. This explains the complete lack of the slowpaced dialogue driver story. Isn't that what Star Trek is all about? Social issues ethical dilemmas philosophical explorations. And what about Gene Roddenberry's vision? Wasn't Star Trek to inspire kids not only to be inspired to study very hard on math and science but also to instill hope in them that in the future we would be able to improve our societies and values?Star Trek was able to do what it did by not requiring the viewer to suspend disbelief in many cases so you were able to do it when it mattered. In this movie even basic dialogue seems awkward. Why the hell does Kirk join Starfleet? Just one stupid fight? Or just because this Pike guy wants him to? This movie has no story to tell. They decided they wanted to make another ST movie first. Then they had to make up a story Big evil ship piloted by the big bad guy is out to destroy the universe merely out of spite. They decided upon that. Didn't we already have exactly that with Star Trek Nemesis? And isn't that already the most basic SF storyline you can come up with? Khan?One of the most glaring problems of this movie is the decisions the characters make. You expect all decisions to be reasonable or at least within a certain range making it believable enough. Sometimes the writer may want to move the story in a certain direction and it is difficult or apparently impossible to make the characters sway in that direction. This is where writing skill comes in. But they decided that at any point the story can do whatever they want no matter what. This is why Starfleet can load up their flagship with fresh cadets. This is why McCoy desperately tries to get Kirk on the ship as if he already knows why Kirk has to be on the ship. This is why for example Kirk can take over as captain of the ship while Starfleet judges him to be completely incompetent.The third biggest problem about this movie is that every dialogue is unnatural. There has been this trend in Hollywood where a natural dialogue is going to be awkward because the viewer expects an artificial style dialogue. People speak a certain way in Hollywood movies which is different from a natural dialogue. This makes them look fake even more.We all know Hollywood can't tell a story. But what is best about Star Trek is worst about this movie. This movie is to Star Wars as Star Wars is to Star Trek. If you think Star Wars was too cerebral then maybe this movie is for you. This movie is literally intentionally made for people that hate Star Trek. This movie is literally made so that people that like Star Trek hate this movie.So the big question to me is why? Why make this movie. Why make a movie that is nothing like Star Trek in the Star Trek universe and even with a recast of the original characters? Money of course. And I don't really blame them. But the fact that they succeed amazes me. How the hell does this movie have such a high score on IMDb. And also on Rotten Tomatoes. WTF is wrong with you people? Look at the insane box office revenue. This movie literally is Star Trek from a parallel universe a universe where humanity isn't smart enough to get into the industrial revolution even if it hit them in the face. I blame the people liking this movie. They create demand for this kind of trash. Shame on you!".

	onyx:emotionText "Every Star Trek fan knows the ST movies aren't that good. This is because they try to be different from the series in appealing to the mainstream. But Star Trek is rock solid and it can handle some of the absolutely silly scripts we have seen in some past movies.In this case we have a prequel that recasts the original cast. Questionable but if there is a lot of story to tell then that should be acceptable. But that is exactly the problem. There was no way to tell a new story without destroying the existing storyline. So they made a new one. Makes no sense right? Well in Star Trek you can just call it an alternative timeline and suddenly it's acceptable.The movie starts and any fan of Star Trek will be shocked by the cinematic style. The camera shakes like crazy lighting effects literally blind you. They can't get a solid shot of someone face or of two people talking. No they give you shaking closeups with only part of their face actually on screen quickly switching between the two persons.The 4 of the 5 first scenes with Kirk are horrifying. In the first he apparently tries to commit suicide. Or he almost accidentally wins a Darwin award can't tell. In the second he gets beaten to bloody pulp while touching breasts. Then afterward his father's friend just bluntly tells him to join Starfleet and he does it. Makes no sense. In the third he has sex with a female Shreklookalike. I had to press stop again and regain my composure. The fourth is where he has a conversation with McCoy. This is stiff as wood and not redeeming but the contrast with the previous scenes is big. They throw out some old oneliners but that doesn't work either. In the 5th he takes the Kobayashi Maru test for the third time while eating an apple and acting like it is one big joke. Apparently this is this movie's attempt at humor.Here I had to stop the movie for a third time.Now you have to remember the comments the director made. He said he disliked Star Trek and thus never watched any of it himself. This explains the complete lack of the slowpaced dialogue driver story. Isn't that what Star Trek is all about? Social issues ethical dilemmas philosophical explorations. And what about Gene Roddenberry's vision? Wasn't Star Trek to inspire kids not only to be inspired to study very hard on math and science but also to instill hope in them that in the future we would be able to improve our societies and values?Star Trek was able to do what it did by not requiring the viewer to suspend disbelief in many cases so you were able to do it when it mattered. In this movie even basic dialogue seems awkward. Why the hell does Kirk join Starfleet? Just one stupid fight? Or just because this Pike guy wants him to? This movie has no story to tell. They decided they wanted to make another ST movie first. Then they had to make up a story Big evil ship piloted by the big bad guy is out to destroy the universe merely out of spite. They decided upon that. Didn't we already have exactly that with Star Trek Nemesis? And isn't that already the most basic SF storyline you can come up with? Khan?One of the most glaring problems of this movie is the decisions the characters make. You expect all decisions to be reasonable or at least within a certain range making it believable enough. Sometimes the writer may want to move the story in a certain direction and it is difficult or apparently impossible to make the characters sway in that direction. This is where writing skill comes in. But they decided that at any point the story can do whatever they want no matter what. This is why Starfleet can load up their flagship with fresh cadets. This is why McCoy desperately tries to get Kirk on the ship as if he already knows why Kirk has to be on the ship. This is why for example Kirk can take over as captain of the ship while Starfleet judges him to be completely incompetent.The third biggest problem about this movie is that every dialogue is unnatural. There has been this trend in Hollywood where a natural dialogue is going to be awkward because the viewer expects an artificial style dialogue. People speak a certain way in Hollywood movies which is different from a natural dialogue. This makes them look fake even more.We all know Hollywood can't tell a story. But what is best about Star Trek is worst about this movie. This movie is to Star Wars as Star Wars is to Star Trek. If you think Star Wars was too cerebral then maybe this movie is for you. This movie is literally intentionally made for people that hate Star Trek. This movie is literally made so that people that like Star Trek hate this movie.So the big question to me is why? Why make this movie. Why make a movie that is nothing like Star Trek in the Star Trek universe and even with a recast of the original characters? Money of course. And I don't really blame them. But the fact that they succeed amazes me. How the hell does this movie have such a high score on IMDb. And also on Rotten Tomatoes. WTF is wrong with you people? Look at the insane box office revenue. This movie literally is Star Trek from a parallel universe a universe where humanity isn't smart enough to get into the industrial revolution even if it hit them in the face.

Mihajlo is vying for the affection of Danica who at first does not seem interested in Mihajlo and rather prefers Mihajlo's brother. Although Mihajlo's and Danica's story is the centerpiece of the plot there are several intersecting stories involving professors and other students from their class.

Despite that he manages to win the affections of the girl he likes and he's one of the funnies characters in the film.The movie has several other interesting and funny subplots including an excursion trip by the students that produces several memorable moments.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best modern Wu Xia movies with overwhelming combats and spectacular scenes . Being well set during China's Imperial dynasty  and spectacular and colorfully directed by Peter Chan . It deals with a sinful martial arts expert called Liu Jinxi Donnie Yen wants to start a new tranquil life only to be hunted by a determined Detective called Xu BaiJiu Takeshi Kaneshiro of House of flying daggers who investigates his dark past and his former master Wang Yu .

Later on  the village is attacked and in order to seek vengeance Liu uses his extraordinary martial art skills . This classic Wu Xia flick displays lots of violence  action filled  thrills and fierce combats . This luxurious martial arts film was marvelously filmed with good production design  colorful cinematography and breathtaking scenes . The flick displays lots of violence action filled  thrills and fierce combats . This is a colourful China set and quite budget movie  leave no clich untouched  though the fighting are magnificently staged . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action  surprises  fierce combats and groundbreaking struggles . Amid the grandeur of the scenarios and impressive fights is developed an intrigue about a villager who bears dark secrets and stubborn Detective exploring his hidden side using C.S.I methods .

Suffice to say both actors delivered riveting performances that kept me glued to my seat. What else can I say about this movie? Just watch it already. It's an entertaining take one man's desire to leave his violent past behind and start anew. If you want drama build up and great action then this is the ticket.".

	schema:headline " Fusing strong character drama with thrilling action 'Wu Xia' is a unique martial arts epic that boasts Donnie Yen's best performance since the 'Ip Man' movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite starring in seven movies over the last three years Donnie Yen has had difficulty trying to top his iconic performance in the 'Ip Man' movies. But as the enigmatic papermaker in a small idyllic town with the unassuming name Liu Jinxi Donnie has finally delivered a performance which equals that of 'Ip Man' one that showcases his best as a dramatic actor and as a martial artist.For this Donnie has to thank director Peter Hosun Chan who makes his return to the director's chair after a four year hiatus since 2007's 'The Warlords' for an intriguing and innovative spin on the period action epic genre. Indeed while its title may suggest similarities to Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' or even Su Chaopin's 'Reign of Assassins' Peter Chan's 'Wu Xia' is less akin to a typical 'wu xia' movie than to Tsui Hark's 'Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame'.Like 'Detective Dee' this film unfolds like a procedural the investigation here headed by one smart 'bespectacled' county detective Xu Baijiu Takeshi Kaneshiro sent to the town where Liu has resided over the past ten years to investigate the death of two wanted criminals killed 'accidentally' in a brawl. Xu's methods are scientific and his superior knowledge in forensic science leads him to suspect that Liu is more than who he says he is. After all Xu surmises how can the lowly and unassuming village person Liu defeat two highly skilled martial arts pugilists? The first half of the movie is essentially a battle of wits between Liu and Xu as the former attempts to conceal his true identity that the latter so doggedly pursues. But more than just a catandmouse game the script by Aubrey Lam who also wrote 'The Warlords' exhibits surprising depth in setting up these two opposing characters Liu is the man with a dangerous past who has eschewed his former life in favour of a simple and peaceful life and Xu is the law enforcer whose own traumatic experience has led him to respect the law over humanity.Aubrey's story raises a number of moral dilemmas in particular whether a man can truly start anew without having to atone for his past sins and whether there is a place for humanity in a world governed by laws and regulations. This is at the very heart of the complex intertwining relationship between Liu and Xu and a fascinating one which Peter Chan explores with panache. There is no hero or villain between the two per se rather both are simply pushed up against each other by their past and the circumstance by which they had made their mutual acquaintance.This attention to character and drama means that fans of Donnie looking for some action will have to be patient. Instead Peter gives room for Donnie to flex his acting chops and Donnie's method for understatement works perfectly for a subtle and nuanced performance of a man fighting to protect the life he has built and family he loves from his own destructive past.Takeshi is a surprisingly good complement for Donnie the former the source of the film's humour and wit with a droll Sichuan accent. The multilingual actor shares a nice rapport with Donnie but he also shines when forced to confront his own moral assumptions about the wisdom of upholding the law without compromise. His character is not without his own demons and Takeshi turns in a multifaceted performance that allows the audience to empathise with his predicament.Nonetheless Takeshi is mostly sidelined in the second half of the movie as Liu's past catches up with him. Action fans will be pleased with the introduction of gongfu legends Kara Hui and Jimmy Wang Yu both of whom play characters closely in fact intimately related to Liu Jinxi's past life. By this time the action pretty much goes into overdrive and Peter shrewdly leaves Donnie in charge. In turn the latter who also serves as action director delivers some truly outstanding action choreography that is pretty much on par with the 'Ip Man' movies.The highlight of this is no doubt Donnie's extended fight with Kara which begins in the village's open square progresses to a foot chase across the rooftops and culminates in a cattle pen where the confined space adds to the thrill of watching them go at each other with knives and later on pure fisticuffs. The climactic showdown here is between Donnie and Jimmy and comes after a very late plot development which pays homage to Chang Cheh's classic One Armed Swordsman series starring Jimmy. Paradoxically while it certainly is thrilling to watch Donnie's onearmed swordsplay somewhat pales a little compared to the sheer exhilaration of his twoarmed fight with Kara.Still Donnie's work here as action star and choreographer is clearly at its peak and the fight sequences here will probably go down as one of the best if not eventually the best that you'll find in a martial arts film this year. Peter Chan keeps the pace of the movie moving along with a thumping rhythm so the film does not lose its momentum between these elaborate fight sequences even though it does feel like two distinct halves. Because of both cast and crew's excellent contributions 'Wu Xia' is more than just another addition to the surfeit of period action epics that is bound to be a fixture in this Hong Kong Mainland coproduction climate. It isn't a 'wu xia' movie in the traditional sense of the genre but the creative liberties that scripter Aubrey Lam and director Peter Chan have taken with the material are the very reasons why it stands high above its peers. That and of course the fact that us Donnie Yen fans here have been rewarded with his best performance since the 'Ip Man' movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wu Xia may not be the martial arts flick in the Ip Man vein but it grips us right from the start with an intriguing plot rich characterisation breathtaking locales and top class performances. This combination is rare in a Chinese movie let alone a kungfu flick. But then again Wu Xia is not just a kungfu flick. It is also a detective mystery with CSI elements and a familyclan drama with welldeveloped characters. The one downside to this effort by director Peter Chan is its supernatural ending that borders on the absurd.The plot is set in 1917 and Liu Jinxi Donnie Yen is a papermaker in a small village where he lives with his wife Ayu Tang Wei and their two sons. However when a couple of bandits try to rob the local store Liu intervenes and accidentally kills them in selfdefence. Or so it seems until detective Xu Baijiu Takeshi Kaneshiro investigates the botched robbery. While Liu claims to be just the average guy Xu who is also a physiology expert and acupuncturist suspects that he is hiding a deep secret and goes all out to uncover the truth behind Liu's identity. Xu's dogged persistence threatens the peace of the typical clan settlement and even his own life.The first thing that grabs us is the movie's detailed setting  in an idyllic valley with quaint thatchroof homes that have cattle grazing on its roof. Scripter Aubrey Lam defines the social structure of the times in a scene when Xu asks Ayu to show him the back door. There is no need for doors in a village like this she replies.The movie's 'CSI touches' are intriguing and even educational. As Xu probes into the deaths we get replays of the action with illuminating insights into Xu's detective powers. There isn't much wushutye action in the early segments but the probes are nevertheless fascinating as Chan adds narrative details and character backgrounds to story.The cast is top notch with Donny Yen and Kaneshiro verbally sparring against each other. One can safely say this is one of Yen's best portrayals as a caring husband and father trying to escape a sinful past. Kaneshiro gets our sympathy as the obsessive cop who will risk anything to find truth and justice. His demeanour reminds me of Peter Falk's Columbo. Tang Wei of Lust Caution fame personifies the rural housewife who is fearful that Jinxi would abandon her  just as her first husband did years ago.And of course it is nice to see veteran Wang Yu of OneArm Swordsman fame in a cameo as a crime boss and fighting another onearm swordsman himself. All in all Wu Xia which was one of the highlights at the 2011 Cannes Fest is a refreshing change to the usual kungfu thrillers. Now if Chan had rendered a more credible ending it would have been a masterpiece. limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Move Thee Reviews A Fascinating Fusion of Different Genres";
	schema:reviewBody "Before watching Director Peter Hosun Chan's latest movie Wu Xia starring Donnie Yen I expected to watch a typical martial arts movie. Contrary to my expectations the movie is a fascinating fusion of a detective story forensic science action humor politics and family drama.Wu Xia is a gripping story about the dark side of human nature. There are several intriguing things that are worth nothing. First Detective Xu Baijiu believes that the law is more important than humanity. His blind obedience to the law contrasts sharply with the corrupt officials accepting bribes which is a political satire. Please note what happens to the villain at the end which ridicules the unscrupulous legal system invented by humans. Second the difference between humans and animals is highlighted. Please note that cows horses flies and worms are shown in the movie and respect for animals is emphasized. Moreover in a fighting scene Kara Hui's character can be seen through a cow's eye which symbolically shows her ruthless character. Third in some scenes the candles glimmer in the darkness which symbolically shows the struggle between good and evil in a human being.Peter Chan and Oiwah Lam have grasped the key to writing a good story. Indeed threedimensional characters are more important than fancy fight scenes so they take their time developing the characters in the movie. Thanks to the capable cast the wellcrafted script the restrained costumes and the breathtaking setting most characters are lifelike. In the movie Takeshi Kaneshiro gives the most memorable performance considering his dual role as his good self and his dark self. Detective Xu Baijiu whose biggest battle lies within is torn between his conscience and his blind faith in the law. Also his attempt to speak the Sichuan dialect is comical. As for Donnie Yen he is charismatic and his action is wellchoreographed. Still he slightly underacts in the crying scene and the one in which he kills the butcher and his children. Playing ruthless villains Yu Wang and Kara Hui deliver flawless performances. Their characters albeit monochrome look eerily menacing.As for my suggestions for improvement some insignificant details can be trimmed and Liu Jinxi's change can be further developed. Despite these minor flaws the movie grabs me from beginning to end not only because of the adrenalinpumping action but also the welldeveloped characters that the audience cares about. Featuring a creative mix of different genres as well as a fine balance between drama and action Wu Xia is so far the best Hong Kong movie I have watched in 2011.".

In the movie Takeshi Kaneshiro gives the most memorable performance considering his dual role as his good self and his dark self. Detective Xu Baijiu whose biggest battle lies within is torn between his conscience and his blind faith in the law. Also his attempt to speak the Sichuan dialect is comical. As for Donnie Yen he is charismatic and his action is wellchoreographed. Still he slightly underacts in the crying scene and the one in which he kills the butcher and his children. Playing ruthless villains Yu Wang and Kara Hui deliver flawless performances. Their characters albeit monochrome look eerily menacing.As for my suggestions for improvement some insignificant details can be trimmed and Liu Jinxi's change can be further developed. Despite these minor flaws the movie grabs me from beginning to end not only because of the adrenalinpumping action but also the welldeveloped characters that the audience cares about. Featuring a creative mix of different genres as well as a fine balance between drama and action Wu Xia is so far the best Hong Kong movie I have watched in 2011.";

I admit with a title like Wu Xia which means Martial Hero I've a preconceived notion of the way plot lines should be unfolded. However it doesn't follow the tried and true formula and even though I was entertained I felt a little let down at the beginning. The first half of the movie is basically CSI China Ching Dynasty. I thought it's pretty funny but it lacks a certain epic and mystical quality that good martial arts movies have. Then the second half of the movie complements the first half beautifully it becomes more like a traditional martial arts movie. But what it lacks in innovation more than made up by the heartpounding action set pieces. The movie is beautifully filmed with unusual composition and gorgeous color. The score is unorthodox as well it's almost like a rock score but not so modern that it becomes incongruous with old China. One small quibble the stunt people are too easily spotted on many of the death defying scenes. All in all highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's strongest in this film isn't the martial arts action sequence or the much talked about Sichuan accent that versatile actor Takeshi Kaneshiro adopts in his role as a detective seeking to unearth the truth behind a peasant paper maker Liu Jun Xi played by Donnie Yen. Rather it's the art house sensibilities that director Peter HoSun Chan fuses in the film that makes it a cut above the average martial arts movie pretty much focused on characters motivations and plenty of drama about family and karma hidden behind an investigative narrative providing a more scientific approach to fantasy.The opening shot establishes Peter Chan's intent to want to be different with little nuances put into roles and a painstakingly beautiful set design and art direction to introduce us to Liu and his family with wife Ayu Tang Wei and two children living quiet almost anonymous lives until two robbers enter their village to rob a provision store and Liu finding it hard not to lend a hand to a fellow villager in need. It's the classic top pugilist whose retirement plans of tranquility getting cut short no thanks to circumstances that spell trouble where trouble got attracted to them like bees to flowers and for that innate chivalrous spirit to be unleashed with expected consequences. Yes some quarters equate this to History of Violence and to a certain extent it undeniably does possess parallels.Elevated to a folk hero in the village where praises get sung in his name the detective Xu Bai Jiu Kaneshiro enters the scene for an autopsy and to examine the crime scene only for his suspicion to be piqued that Liu may be more than meets the eye perhaps even one of three most notorious wanted men he had been pursuing. Here's where the story shows off its flash of brilliance with flawed characters providing added depth to characterization and story keeping your interest level up as we discover how Xu's a little schizophrenic in his investigative approach constantly communicating with his alter ego and we get to see some CG animated body internals sort of like the way Guy Ritchie treated his Sherlock Holmes with dalliances to the question of is Liu or isn't Liu the powerful pugilist as Xu's investigations have made him out to be.Takeshi Kaneshiro continues in similar vein with his Zhuge Liang character in having to form an uneasy camaraderie with his skilled counterpart where in Red Cliff was with Tony Leung's Zhou Yu here it's with Donnie Yen's Liu as investigations gets underway to try and coax something out of the latter. Yen has ample time producing some rarely seen acting chops thanks to a role that requires duality and also showing he's no pushover when it comes to fighting in front of the camera and taking on the directing responsibility to choreograph the action as well. And to balance the testosterone level of the movie Tang Wei takes on the role of a demure wife who also bore some dark secrets from her past but unfortunately this aspect remained largely vague and not as well explored as is Kaneshiro's detective when he goes back to seek assistance from his estranged wife Li Xiao Ran in a one scene wonderwander.In a tale of two jarring halves suddenly remembering that it needed some cornerstone token villains in come the legendary kung fu stars such as Wang Yu the one armed swordsman being paid an obvious homage in this film and Kara Hui who has seen a renewed lease in her career after an award winning turn on Ho Yuhang's film At the End of Daybreak. Both return to their martial arts roots which were hallmarks of their heydays and it's really a pity how as villains they don't get much of a respect they deserve having to come back to the silver screen especially for Wang Yu portraying mean looking ass kicking caricatures to give our heroes a run for their money. Both were severely underutilized but there is little doubt about their screen charisma when they finally appear to further the plot. Kara Hui was there solely for some of the set action pieces like a rooftop chase not again and between the two it's of course Wang Yu who got the better deal portraying a Bane like brute and I thought his heft with age provided plenty of gravitas and weight as the gangster chief who's not to be trifled with providing the film a much needed climax and proceeding at breakneck speed toward the finale fight which pitted science against fantasy in some ways how modern day mechanics trounced martial arts though you get the idea employed here the execution left much to be desired since all it could elicit wasn't a sense of brilliance but unintended comedy involving the much dreaded Deus Ex Machina yet in some ways keeping in line with the notion of karmic retribution albeit very literally.Perhaps it was the weight of expectations that a movie titled Wu Xia would provide something more from an action front and some may have gone to the extent to call this a redefinition of the martial arts genre through scientific methods and explanation. I thought that would really be stretching it with big battles few and far between the spotlight clearly centered on its story and characterization instead.".

The primary theme is that redemption from past transgressions is never free and can be very expensive.The overall plot and storyline of the movie brought to mind Les Miserables Victor Hugo and Crime and Punishment Fyodor Dostoyevsky.The cinematography reminded me of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Beautifully done.The martial fight scenes were excellently choreographed and very exciting to watch.The language is Chinese with subtitles However when I finished viewing the movie I actually had to ask myself if there were subtitles because they were totally unobtrusive to the film or spoken dialogue.The story is taken from the point of view of a detective investigating the death of two criminals when they attempted a robbery and murder of the shopkeepers in a small town. The detective is the primary storyteller and also the narrator for transitions between scenes. The transition from scene to scene is almost totally seamless to the extent that there is no noticeable break.During his investigation of the two deaths the detective suspects that the hero of the story is not a common laborer but highly trained in the martial arts. The story centers on his relentless pursuit of the truth regardless of the consequences to the families and community.I classify this film in the same category of the best Chinese films released in recent years Hero Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and others I have watched.The only surprise for me was that I haven't found it nominated or receiving any awards in the foreign film category.Respectfully MJR".

	schema:headline " A strange almost surreal yet dark mystery thriller laced with some great martialarts sequences";
	schema:reviewBody "The advertising for this movie basically focuses on Donnie Yen once again going ballistic. You'd think he's had enough fighting by now but never mind. The trailers are wrong. This is not an all out actionmartial arts spectacular. It is in fact a dramatic and surprisingly very moody mystery thriller set in the nottoodistant past in China.The beginning sequences show Yen as a simple farm man a family man who does menial things to make a living. When foiling a bunch of criminals Yen manages to seemingly accidentally subdue both of them. A quirky investigator Takeshi Kaneshiro soon arrives and is intrigued at Yen's seemingly innocent farmer.Let it be said that in the first half of the movie Donnie Yen was not acting as the wisebuttough guy roles he is more famous for but rather as a happygolucky farmer that is a cry away from Jackie Chan. The villagers are so happy that they even chant out their feelings. One would suspect comedy and lighthearted fare from this point onward. However that is not the case. Peter Chan HoSun tensefully crafts the film away from that direction and starts veering into dark dark territory. We're talking deep dark secrets involving a heinous violent and brutal crime that gives off a dark ominous atmosphere and a somewhat mean streak that continues from that point onward all the way until the end of the film. In fact the darkness of the movie overshadows pretty much everything even the camerawork looks less colorful as the scenes progressed. Sort of like what would happen if Walter Hill made a ChineseKungFu movie. You'll get the idea.During this change of pace Yen completely transforms his character not into a tough guy but rather of a haunted tortured soul. Yen's versatility as an actor really shines in this movie and I honestly think it is one of his very best performances. As a martial artist no worries Yen's still got the moves.Takeshi Kaneshiro's character is an interesting one. His performance has an aura of quirkiness and yet sadness as the film progresses his character becomes ever more tragic and his onceaimless cause becomes justifiable. Lust Caution's Tang Wei has a supporting role that is basically a stereotyped character in all of this sort of films  the concerned wife. By that standards she pulls it off well. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Shaw Brothers kungfu stars Jimmy Wang Yu The OneArmed Swordsman and Kara Hui My Young Auntie on the big screen as the villains and their fights between them and Donnie is an ironic tribute and homage to their famous characters in KungFu Cinema at least. Hell this could very well be a Walter Hilldirected Shaws Brothers film for all I know.Production value is top notch especially the locations and cinematography which were superb. The locations are shown in all of their glory and the camera nicely frames them without being to overblown. The action sequences were wellchoreographed a staple of Yen but I can imagine some people wanting more action. The editing is nicely framed  the CSIlike flashbacks coupled with Kaneshiro's detailed monologue provides a fascinating view into human pressure points. The music is a refreshing trait for me  the score is too tense and somber and not melodramatic although I never knew an electric guitar can be that effective in a period kungfu film sort of like Ry Cooder in Hill's Last Man Standing but then again...The only thing I didn't like was the ending of the final fight  a near literal Deux Ex Machina. But even then I didn't see it coming at all.Overall it is a strange yet dark and moody and definitely interesting gem in the Donnie Yen category. By no means is it bad just somewhat offbeat but the moody gritty atmosphere of the film took me by surprise. It's solid stuff this movie but don't expect an allout fightfest. It's a mystery thriller and a good one at that.Overall rating 70100PS On the reason of mentioning Walter Hill I find this film's atmosphere to be somewhat similar to Hill's films Trespass and Last Man Standing both very violent and gritty films with a mean streak. No really. You can feel the uneasiness when watching these films. I certainly did. On this film too.".

In fact the darkness of the movie overshadows pretty much everything even the camerawork looks less colorful as the scenes progressed. Sort of like what would happen if Walter Hill made a ChineseKungFu movie. You'll get the idea.During this change of pace Yen completely transforms his character not into a tough guy but rather of a haunted tortured soul. Yen's versatility as an actor really shines in this movie and I honestly think it is one of his very best performances. As a martial artist no worries Yen's still got the moves.Takeshi Kaneshiro's character is an interesting one. His performance has an aura of quirkiness and yet sadness as the film progresses his character becomes ever more tragic and his onceaimless cause becomes justifiable. Lust Caution's Tang Wei has a supporting role that is basically a stereotyped character in all of this sort of films  the concerned wife. By that standards she pulls it off well. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Shaw Brothers kungfu stars Jimmy Wang Yu The OneArmed Swordsman and Kara Hui My Young Auntie on the big screen as the villains and their fights between them and Donnie is an ironic tribute and homage to their famous characters in KungFu Cinema at least. Hell this could very well be a Walter Hilldirected Shaws Brothers film for all I know.Production value is top notch especially the locations and cinematography which were superb. The locations are shown in all of their glory and the camera nicely frames them without being to overblown. The action sequences were wellchoreographed a staple of Yen but I can imagine some people wanting more action. The editing is nicely framed  the CSIlike flashbacks coupled with Kaneshiro's detailed monologue provides a fascinating view into human pressure points. The music is a refreshing trait for me  the score is too tense and somber and not melodramatic although I never knew an electric guitar can be that effective in a period kungfu film sort of like Ry Cooder in Hill's Last Man Standing but then again...The only thing I didn't like was the ending of the final fight  a near literal Deux Ex Machina. But even then I didn't see it coming at all.Overall it is a strange yet dark and moody and definitely interesting gem in the Donnie Yen category. By no means is it bad just somewhat offbeat but the moody gritty atmosphere of the film took me by surprise. It's solid stuff this movie but don't expect an allout fightfest. It's a mystery thriller and a good one at that.Overall rating 70100PS On the reason of mentioning Walter Hill I find this film's atmosphere to be somewhat similar to Hill's films Trespass and Last Man Standing both very violent and gritty films with a mean streak. No really. You can feel the uneasiness when watching these films. I certainly did. On this film too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Yen does it again in this mind bending detective thriller. A man who wanders into a village as a simple vagrant is accepted by the locals after a few years of settling down. Little do they know that his past is as dark as the night itself. Donnie's character Jinxi is a self reformed serial killer. Once part of a clan called the 72 Demons. Their rituals played a part for most of the dynasties for those in power but as with all emperor's changing their minds are no longer needed for their services. Angered they vowed to take revenge on all humans because their philosophies lead them to believe that all manners of people are beyond corrupt and lower than animals. Jixi Donnie Yen was on assignment with his clan to butcher local villages and burn them to the ground until one surviving young boy called him by a simple name  Sir. This revelation then led Jinxi to leave the demon clan and find his own answers to life's most difficult questions. But in the middle is a brilliant detective who is called into Jinxi's adopted village because of two murders of would be thieves. The detective Xu BaiJiu Takeshi Kaneshiro deduces that Jinxi who helped protect the village is not all that he seems. With perfect clue finding and evidence gathering he finds that the man he has been interrogating is none other than the son of the master who leads the demon clan named Tang Long. Problems start to mount as the demon clan hears of tang's location. And now the master wants him back in the fold. Yet the detective who blinds himself in front of the law as a crutch now develops a small conscience and tries to help Tang escape the clutches of the master's grips. This film is by far Donnie's best to date. It has action drama fight scenes which Donnie himself choreographed and twists and turns to make the viewer question whether or not Jinxi is really a cold blooded killer named Tang Long. And there were a few scenes which actually made me cringe when Donnie's character looked as though he was actually going to kill the detective at one point. If there was a psycho serial killing thriller in the future Donnie could pull it off without a hitch. A perfect detective film. Not recommended for those under 14. Highly recommended to those who like this genre. Fantastic movie.".

Of course it's a Donnie Yen film so there are the inevitably lengthy and detailed martial arts sequences which are typically strong and help to lift the movie's entertainment value immeasurably.Elsewhere the material does feel a little strained at times and the story seems to fall apart as it progresses. The second half is noticeably inferior to the first and the film seems to be merely treading water up until the final confrontation between antihero and villain. Still the producers deserve kudos for casting martial arts star and genre icon Jimmy Wang Yu completely unrecognisable these days it has to be said as the chief bad guy.In addition there's a serious and finelytuned performance from Takeshi Kaneshiro as a detective investigating Yen's background. Kaneshiro's character is somewhat incongruous given the provincial nature of the rest of the movie but Kaneshiro can always be relied upon to deliver carefully mannered performances and his role here proves no exception to that rule.Come the roll of the final credits I was left feeling mildly entertained by the material but also slightly dissatisfied purely because the quality of the action isn't on par with the highs of IP MAN 1  2 FLASH POINT and other Yen classics. I've been spoilt by such films and as a result Dragon felt a little lacklustre more watchable as an interesting curio than a fullblooded fight flick.".

The main character is pretty familiar  ordinary peasant in two horse village who somehow manages to overcome a merciless bandit in a one on one fight! Premise is familiar but this takes some working out because it is brilliantly filmed so that the peasant does not look very capable just lucky. But a brilliant detective is on his heels and desperately searching for the truth. Of course the peasant turns out to be a brilliant martial arts exponent played by Donny Yen what would you expect? who has committed horrific murders. Cue his old gang with ruthlessly violent old fatherleader in the van find out and the scene is set for the final battle between father and son evil and maybe good.It is a film that takes its time with beautiful photography fine acting and an interesting plot that takes its time to unravel. The direction and action work very well. But it could do with a bit of 'go' at times.".

Minor spoilers Killer assumes new identity and tries to live peacefully with his new family detective cuts off his own empathy using acupuncture. Nothing new likely or realistic here but the parts are played seriously by the actors and who is ever disappointed by a martial arts movie lacking in an original story line.Then we have the fight scenes over the top trash Donnie Yen makes another guy punch himself in the face so hard his teeth fall out this probably happened before he flew into the air and attached his feet to the ceiling. Crouching Tiger had wire work but it also managed to have some amazing realistic fight choreography alongside it. In Wu xia we have the standard rubbish you would see in Hero and House of daggers where wire and other special effects are used to make the unreal look real and failing in the attempt. Another Spoiler man has his heart stopped with acupuncture cuts off his own arm then goes home to have a long boring drawn out fight scene with a fat bald man. Someone gets struck by lightning. This is exactly what I have come to expect from Chinese cinema of late not to mention the hit and miss mostly miss master Donnie Yen. Because I had paid for the movie I kept watching and waiting for it to get better or show the reasoning behind its many shining reviews but of course it proved to be nothing more than something which could have been dreamed up by the 4 yr old character in the movie playing Yen's son. The only positives are the settings and look of the movie don't waste your money!".

The film consisted of different story lines woven together though it was hard to see the connection of some of them especially the worldwar II pilot. The cinematography and views of Prague were great and some of the small insights and details in some of the characters were universal and therefore very recognisable. Definitely worth another viewing on DVD!".

What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed and less soap operaundercover drama. Consider me surprised.".

The story follows American teenager Sean Boswell Lucas Black whose reckless driving lands him prison time but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.I say teenager as that's what IMDb says and he does go to school in the movie but honestly he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other teen in this movie! While I talk negatives the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95 of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese especially when Sean isn't present!But unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious choke this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities as Sean says early on It's not about the ride it's about the rider from Sean's fishoutof water acceptance to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious king of a little hill problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious gag the cars have never looked better sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular especially when synchronized. Plus no CGI just skilled professional drivers making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera no rats in buckets no CGI just an entertaining albeit poorly localized flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top has cheesy dialogue and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said it's actually pretty entertaining and isn't all that bad.We are introduced to Sean Boswell Lucas Black a high school kid who can't seem to find his niche in life. He's moved from town to town with his divorced mother and getting into problems with the law before finding himself in Southern California. The California scenes pay homage to Justin Lin's earlier film Better Luck Tomorrow almost feeling like an extension of that film. We see the crowds of students in the courtyard almost peripheral to a particular point in time. Moving to California doesn't change anything and Sean the outsider finds himself racing Clay Zachery Ty Bryan from Home Improvement a rich kid who has it all including a brand new Dodge Viper.In trouble with the law yet again Sean finds himself moving to Japan for reasons that aren't particularly clear. We don't know exactly why he had to move however it doesn't really matter anyway.Sean continues to find himself as an outsider. From his distant father to his language barrier to being unfamiliar with traditional customs. Unlike other particular American films the culture of Japan was portrayed in a positive light. This was particularly refreshing as the food jokes Engrish jokes height jokes etc. have become very tiresome over the years.Sean meets Twinkie Lil Bow Wow and Han Sung Kang the latter of which appears to be the same character from Better Luck Tomorrow. Both Twinkie and Han serve as guides or mentors to Sean as he becomes more familiar with Japan school drifting and its associated group. In retrospect Twinkie seems like an unnecessary character and quickly gets shelved to Sung Kang's Han who steals the show like a pimp.Sean also meets and is attracted to Neela Nathalie Kelley who is the girlfriend of DK Brian Tee. DK is a nickname for Drift King. Sean quickly realizes this as he loses badly to him in his first race in Japan and smashing up Han's S15 badly. The altercation between Sean and DK heats up leading to the climax of the film.Sean Boswell is an unlikeable character. His mannerism is interesting during the California scenes and you actually do get to like him however he quickly outwears his welcome. From his unjustified temper to his grating southern accent Han becomes more of the likable protagonist.The dialogue was cheesy as hell too remember the I'm free line from the first one? This is worse  the moonlight drifting scene is embarrassingly bad.Character development is too hurried at times much like this review.As with Kill Bill Sonny Chiba is as charming as ever this time playing a Yakuza boss who happens to be the uncle of DK.Now the racing scenes were actually not that bad. Compared to the outlandish effects of the first two FF films Tokyo Drift is pretty understated.Racingwise this was a vendorfest. 350Z's VERY prominently displayed RX8's and an EVO. Other than that there was an R34 GTR S15 and the Veilside RX7. That's really about it with the obvious exception of the Mustang. I think I saw a glimpse of an AE86 hatch.Will it make people drift in the parking lot leaving the theatre? Yes. In fact I saw some guy in a Camry attempting to do so.Will it spark interest in the vendorsponsored cars? Probably.Will it increase resale value of your S13 or AE86? Probably not.Finally there are two notable cameos in this film among others. The first cameo has to do with DK not the film character. The second cameo ties the film to its predecessor. Both appearances were pretty well done and drew laughter from the crowd.".

There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it... The three cameos in the film were well placed though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.I give 810 because of low expectations and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected.".

The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking.

We got a kick out of it and I put it out of my mind.. A while passed and a few of my buddies were trying to get me to watch the movie with them I declined and made fun of it Until one rainy day when I was bored out of my mind and the only thing on PPV was guess what... So I ran down and got a bag of chips which at the time I thought would be better than the movie and started watching... Well I have to admit I was quite wrong about this one..Very well done they got rid of the police guy in this movie... Thank God The cinematography is awesome a few parts of the movie you might think you're going over... HEY! This movie actually has a storyline!

	schema:reviewBody "The Fast and the Furious franchise relies on the simpleness of 2 factors to attract an audience from boys to men  sexy cars and fast babelicious chicks topped up with plenty of testosterone and adrenaline in overdrive. Racing cars of all makes be they the European American or Asian models one thing's for sure the stunt driving team deserves all the credit. The first movie made a huge star out of Vin Diesel while the rest had relatively smaller shots at glory from Paul Walker who returned for the second to babes like Eva Mendes Michelle Rodriguez and Devon Aoki.The third installment decided to insert refreshing elements and set itself in the land of the rising sun. Presumably influenced by the driving technique called drifting which made it to mainstream consciousness via the Japanese manga Initial D it's just too bad that the Hong Kong movie by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak adapted from the manga got to it first like almost a year ago. Perhaps if the latest shenanigans of racers from both sides of the Causeway were widely publicized this film could even be made closer to home! In case you're wondering the Malaysian police had recently conducted a dragnet rounding up illegal racers on its North South Highway. Flashy cars with raunchy stakes  the winner gets to take home the loser's chick for a night's worth of lurveThere will be no doubts comparisons between the East's Initial D and this one from the West. In my opinion this one edged out Initial D. There are many aspects in which Tokyo Drift is superior and naturally having a bigger budget means that the filmmakers can afford to put more cars on showcase more cars involved in races and more races in varied locations like a tight car park on the streets of Tokyo and as a homage too to the source they couldn't miss the mountain range. Scenes were for both day and night unlike Initial D's predominantly night scenes.It's never about the acting though Tokyo Drift will lose out in terms of having relative rookies helm the show throughout unlike Initial D's stellar supporting cast of Chapman To Anthony Wong to established popular teenyboppers like Edison Chen and Shawn Yue. But Tokyo Drift did have veterans like Sonny Chiba lend a hand and the coup was the casting of Keiichi Tsuchiya the original inspiration for the manga in a cameo.Taking over the lead role from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is relative newcomer Lucas Black as Sean Boswell a good for nothing troublemaker with the inborn need to speed. He comes from a broken home and is the root cause of his and his mom's moving from city to city because he cannot get out of trouble from the law. When the final straw broke the camel's back he gets sent reluctantly to live with his father in Tokyo.Thinking that the Asian city has nothing to offer before you can say drift he finds himself drawn into the world of underground racing with plenty of flashy cars hot chicks and mean Yakuzalinked punks itching to challenge anyone to a race. As clichs rule over this movie Sean falls for the Drift King's Brian Tee main squeeze Neela Nathalie Kelly thought she looked like a cross between Paula Abdul and Rosario Dawson while unwittingly got brought under the wings of Han Sung Kang business partner of Drift King who teaches him the true meaning and purpose of drifting which is a nobrainer purpose of snagging hot chicks.Anyway to a gaijin Sean is ignorance personified from culture to racing he takes these challenges head on stupidly. And surprise! A movie like this offered some onedimensional character development of troublemaker turned good who learns the meaning of brotherhood although fame did get into the way of course. But herein lies another strength against Initial D the lead did not turn out to be all powerful  here he has to learn the basics of drifting in an incredible short period of time and turn out well of course at the expense of expensive tyres and cars always a pain to see them being wrecked.Any racer worth his salt must pimp his ride or zhng his car and this one offered no less. The star attraction in the franchise are the vehicles. From the Nissans to the Mustangs it seemed that the Mitsubishi Evo will be a mainstay and the hero always drives one. It's almost a no brainer to film movies like these having stunt drivers to do the actual stunt driving then cut to actors looking as if they're driving and insert multiple cuts of hands on steering foot on pedal looking mean etc. Instead of just incessantly focusing on drifting there are the standard zigzagging car chases and some usage of Nitro for that quick boost of horsepower which the first two movies frequently used.Given its ending by an uncredited cameo which will send fanboys of this franchise into highs this movie still has potential to be relatively popular and the franchise can indeed continue. It wouldn't be far out if there's an announcement of The Fast and the Furious NorthSouth Highway and yes you heard it here first! So race away and unabashedly indulge in this movie that makes no apologies for being fast and furious to the loud sounds of its contemporary soundtrack!".

First the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second until the ending we don't see anybody familiar.

Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here particularly during a town race is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift ranks as a good movie. Of course the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fishoutofwater hero. Brian Tee makes a firstclass villain as TK while Sung Kang is appropriately laidback and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts adrenalinlaced races and a sympathetic protagonist make this Fast and Furious installment a breath of fresh air.".

	schema:headline " The Fast and the Furious reborn in Tokyo";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about Tokyo Drift and realised that it would feature none of the original cast members I was sure it would be a major let down that was just cashing in so I ignored it. Eventually I sat down to watch the movie when it arrived on Sky and I must say that I'm impressed. The film more than exceeded my low expectations and whilst it way a little bit routine in places I had a great time watching it.Not only is this film a damn good caraction film in it's own right it is arguably the best in the series. The new cast is great with Lucas Black heading up the roster as Sean Boswell an American street racer who moves to Japan and becomes embroiled in the underworld Tokyo street racing scene. Black proves to be better to watch than Paul Walker was in the previous movies in the franchise because he is a better actor which isn't saying much but still... whilst the other characters all have chemistry on screen too creating an authentic Japanese street racing feel. The stand out character in the movie for me though was Sung Kang as Han easily the coolest character in the film.Justin Lin does a great job of capturing the art of drifting as well as keeping a good sense of speed and a focus on the character development. Whilst it's never going to win any Oscars The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is infinitely better than 2 Fast 2 Furious and is in some ways better than the original movie too. If Lin can continue this trend into the fourth film in 2009 I will be the first in line at the cinema to see Vin Diesel return to the franchise.If like me you were initially put off by the lack of ties to the first two movies give Tokyo Drift a chance and you'll probably find you'll enjoy it. Car fans should have no problems liking the subject matter Cars and beautiful girls and whilst it doesn't make you think a whole lot you really can't go wrong with the 3rd effort in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Oh and by the way the last scene is guaranteed to make fans of the series smile the movie is worth watching just for that.".

The film more than exceeded my low expectations and whilst it way a little bit routine in places I had a great time watching it.Not only is this film a damn good caraction film in it's own right it is arguably the best in the series. The new cast is great with Lucas Black heading up the roster as Sean Boswell an American street racer who moves to Japan and becomes embroiled in the underworld Tokyo street racing scene. Black proves to be better to watch than Paul Walker was in the previous movies in the franchise because he is a better actor which isn't saying much but still... whilst the other characters all have chemistry on screen too creating an authentic Japanese street racing feel. The stand out character in the movie for me though was Sung Kang as Han easily the coolest character in the film.Justin Lin does a great job of capturing the art of drifting as well as keeping a good sense of speed and a focus on the character development. Whilst it's never going to win any Oscars The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is infinitely better than 2 Fast 2 Furious and is in some ways better than the original movie too. If Lin can continue this trend into the fourth film in 2009 I will be the first in line at the cinema to see Vin Diesel return to the franchise.If like me you were initially put off by the lack of ties to the first two movies give Tokyo Drift a chance and you'll probably find you'll enjoy it. Car fans should have no problems liking the subject matter Cars and beautiful girls and whilst it doesn't make you think a whole lot you really can't go wrong with the 3rd effort in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Oh and by the way the last scene is guaranteed to make fans of the series smile the movie is worth watching just for that.";

The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two.

It's ridiculous and it's boring.The main character Sean is a 34 year old street racer who has apparently been held back in school....for seventeen years. He's the oldest high school student on Planet Earth. In fact in a remarkable feat of human biology he is about the same age as his mother and father! He also has the most improbable and unconvincing Southern US accent imaginable. After smashing up some cars and destroying an entire housing development he is sent to live in Japan with his Navy dad who apparently fathered him at the age of about 9. For reasons never explained his father is not allowed to live on the Naval base but has to reside in a minuscule Japanese slum and Sean yup still in high school despite middle age doesn't go to the Navy base school where instruction would be in English but instead is enrolled at a private Japanese academy despite the fact that he knows not a single word of Japanese. Apparently no one not even his teachers there seem to think this will be a problem.Naturally the first girl he sees in class is the only Caucasian student in the entire school if not the entire city and so she becomes the very boring love interest. He also meets the only African American student. Obviously these two must be his best friend and girlfriend since they are the only nonAsians around.Subsequently he gets into drift racing something I never heard of before and I can see why. It's not very interesting to watch. Apparently it consists of taking a small import vehicle with front wheel drive and while going fast through a sharp turn allowing the car to fishtail. While this seems possible enough for a skilled stunt driver on a closed track per the credits I do wonder if it is possible to do this continuously while driving i.e. to essentially drive sideways almost the entire time. Seriously I doubt this. It's also not especially fast which makes it fairly dull to watch.Also the big final race occurs and the hero's dad amazingly has the body of a classic 60s Mustang in his garage a somewhat unlikely situation in Japan  not just the car but the idea that he has a entire garage for this purpose in one of the world's most expensive and crowded cities. So Sean and his friends take the engine out of one of the Japanese cars he has wrecked earlier in the film and in a few hours they manage to install this into the 60s muscle car. HELLO? Is this possible? I admit I am not a mechanic or specialist but it does not seem logical that you could retrofit a Japanese front wheel drive engine into a vintage 60s American rear wheel drive car....if it could be done AT ALL it seems to me that it would take a long time and involve a lot of custom parts. That's not even considering that they drive on the opposite side of the road in Japan or that a 60s era car would be much heavier than a current model Japanese car.There are too many other absurdities to list along with the inclusion of the Yakuza Japanese mafia. I wish I could say that Toyko Drift was campy or that you could have a good time just laughing at the many absurdities but actually its fatal flaw is that it is extremely dull. The least you would expect from it title wise is that there would be lots of exciting racing  and there isn't  and that the hero would probably have a hot sexy Japanese girlfriend and sexy love scenes  and there is absolutely nothing in this regard as he's barely hooked up with the only Caucasian woman in his high school. The film is entirely devoid of sex appeal you could show it to a convention of Mormons.SPOILER ALERT Because it's so dumb and utterly lame I am alerting anyone who has seen the TV ads that Vin Diesel does appear in his role from the first film for a few seconds at the very end. It's stupid and it's gratuitous and it says something terribly sad about both this film and Mr. Diesel's career that he was able to be compelled to appear even uncredited. This is a franchise with every ounce of the life juice sucked out. Here is hoping that they never ever consider making Fast  Furious IV.".

	schema:headline " The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected  but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not critically appealing";
	schema:reviewBody "I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift. Of course I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings or at least the worst ones such as the movie being unbearable to even look at were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time mainly because of the souped cars but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching a lot except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' as seen in Need For Speed Underground to those that don't know. Sounds stupid? Well it is the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han is pointless. I will admit that noone looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie but still the less said the better.The dialogue as I stated can be funny  because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean You know what DK stands for? and Sean replies Donkey Kong. At least its original I guess.The acting is OK  far from turgid which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are wellfilmed and eye catching highlighting the cars as they should. However except in a few fleeting moments they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation for me is pretty good to watch but only arouses the senses once in a while. Time didn't drag though which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable despite its other preeminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film which may lead to my rosetinted view of it compared to my original perception of what it would be like. So let me summarise my thoughts Didn't expect much got more than I bargained for. The acting is satisfactory for a racing film otherwise it would more or less suck the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective with frequent closeups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a relatively favourable rating is the fact that it is like I said quite watchable. However it is still little more than satisfactory so it's rating cannot therefore rise above35 stars If you don't like cars the rating is obviously much lower".

Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.Now down to business. Sean a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' as seen in Need For Speed Underground to those that don't know. Sounds stupid? Well it is the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han is pointless. I will admit that noone looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie but still the less said the better.The dialogue as I stated can be funny  because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean You know what DK stands for? and Sean replies Donkey Kong. At least its original I guess.The acting is OK  far from turgid which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are wellfilmed and eye catching highlighting the cars as they should. However except in a few fleeting moments they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation for me is pretty good to watch but only arouses the senses once in a while. Time didn't drag though which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable despite its other preeminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film which may lead to my rosetinted view of it compared to my original perception of what it would be like. So let me summarise my thoughts Didn't expect much got more than I bargained for. The acting is satisfactory for a racing film otherwise it would more or less suck the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective with frequent closeups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a relatively favourable rating is the fact that it is like I said quite watchable. However it is still little more than satisfactory so it's rating cannot therefore rise above35 stars If you don't like cars the rating is obviously much lower";

To his credit he does a decent job in parts but his lack of experience is clear based on the high number of action scenes. All he really needs to do for the most part is give a few huffs and puffs to look like he's really driving those speed machines.Unfortunately the guy gets involved in racing yet again and gets mixed up with the Japanese drifters. He is shown to attend school but for a man of his age i question why? and tries to keep his father happy in the process.The tuned up cars emulated the Need for Speed Underground games which isn't really a bad thing because at least the story is supported by a decent plot and that's where 2 fast got it all wrong.The backdrop of Tokyo seemed ideal and made for some great viewing at times.All in all a wellpaced action movie but mostly comes good cause of half decent plot.Lin did really all he could.".

	schema:reviewBody "We just saw this movie in Kansas City and to say that it was a huge disappointment does not begin to tell how bad it was. The race sequences were okay but there is absolutely no point to the dialog or plot. This movie is unbelievably demeaning to women starting with the blonde babe at the beginning who offers herself as the prize to the winner of the race between the Lucas Black character and the exkid from Home Improvement and continuing with the Janet Jackson lookalike who has nothing to offer but coy smiles and short skirts not that there's anything wrong with that. What's worse is the fact that Lucas Black is cast as a 17 year old when he looks like he's already in his thirties and the Yakuza uncle character who looks like he's doing a very weak imitation of Don Fanucci from Godfather II. We were hoping for a little summer entertainment a la Transporter 2 but what we got instead was too little action and too much posing. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this piece of garbage should be blacklisted from Hollywood. In fact to say that this was worse than the worst movie ever gives it too much credit. It is the worst movie imaginable.".

With Aftershock he dealt with the Tangshan earthquake of 1976 Assembly had his war between the Communist and Nationalist soldiers and now he goes a little further back in time to 1942 where China's Henan province suffers through its deadliest drought resulting in the death of 3 million through starvation.I guess it's quite challenging for many here to have experienced true hunger in today's relatively affluent society but those who have been through some days without having to eat something usually through vanity reasons of keeping artificially slim will attest to an uncomfortable feeling. Multiply that by months on end with a war looming and then experienced and one can almost picture how miserable life then would have been with food being literally scraped from what would be unthinkable as food such as tree barks and many willing to offer anything most often children as barter trade for foodstuff.Based on the novel by Liu Zhenyun titled Remembering 1942 it charts the huge drought and famine through one of China's provinces told through the eyes of various protagonists in this sprawling epic. There's a well to do landlord in Master Fan Zhang Guoli who opens the movie as we bear witness to his slow and inevitable descend from prince to pauper having a stockpile that got naturally targeted by bandits and when all hell broke loose he suffers tragedy after tragedy joining the millions of others on their trek westwards to find food and also incidentally escape from invading Japanese forces.Then there's the religious arc with Priest Sim Zhang Hanyu a Chinese man seeing opportunity in all these distraught to spread the word of Christ amongst his fellow countrymen with his faith being shaken by constant questions how his God would have allowed this to continue where at one point he had envisioned this situation to be similar to Moses' leading of the exodus out of Egypt. Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody also took up roles in this film much like Christian Bale in Zhang Yimou's The Flowers of War with the former being the priest whom Sim confides in and the latter playing the role of a Time magazine correspondent who also lends his perspective to the growing atrocities and ignorance of the many politicians who prefer to enjoy the company of elites and turning a blind eye to the true situation thousands of miles away.While the film does not offer pointed accusations it does present a series of events that may have contributed to the immense human tragedy and this largely involves politicians soldiers and the Japanese where WWII almost becomes an excuse for the existence of millions of refugees uprooting themselves and moving elsewhere not only to escape from enemies but to look for sustenance. Director Feng engages some of the best in the craft for this ironically lush production for a film that deals with those with absolute nothingness to bring out vivid looking shots and conditions in which the actors thrived in delivering heartfelt performances with no holds barred effort poured into the production to make every shot look believable plausible succeeding in its attempt to put you right where the action unfolds.War and battle scenes also looked notches above what the director had done with Assembly. Blood and gore moments were kept realistic without the need to be gratuitous from major scuffles amongst bandits and villagers to constant Japanese air raids which saw bombs raining down indiscriminately against both soldiers and the long lines of civilians trying their best to escape from hunger now having to deal with another threat which some see as a lifeline to end their miserable lives. But if looking from yet another angle outside from the premise of the film the narrative also deals with the adage of fortunes being cyclic in nature telling such a story where a rich man's most prized possession will be that final slap in the face when Maslow's basic theory of needs come into play like a warning to the newly affluent that when it boils down to survival it's every man for himself with the elite class likely to suffer the most when the people trodden upon calls it quits.Chinese films have come a long way over the last decade and Feng Xiaogang has shown that he's amongst one of the best out there to deliver big budgeted productions that doesn't have to void of a soul or emotional core. It's an epic on the grandest scale succeeding because it tells stories of the human condition that everyone can identify with. Highly recommended as I ponder what other historical backdrop the director would be tackling next since he has a keen eye and a knack for it!".

	schema:headline " A big budget examination of another little known piece of Chinese history";
	schema:reviewBody "Labelled 'the Spielberg of China' with 15 box office successes in the last 20 years ranging from familyfriendly comedies poking fun at China's materialistic culture to weightier big budget historic epics such as 'Assembly' 'Aftershock' and now 'Back to 1942' Feng Xiaogang has become the most popular director of mainstream cinema in China. Yet despite the work of Chinese directors such as Chen Kaige Zhang Yimou Wong KarWai and Ang Lee Feng Xiaogang is virtually unknown to Western audiences something that the Chinese government is attempting to put right by submitting 'Back to 1942' as the country's official Oscar submission for Best Foreign Language Film this year.Adapted from the book 'Remembering 1942' by Liu Zhenyun the film is a historical disaster epic following the fates of refugees during the drought and famine in Henan Province which devastated the region and left 3 million dead of starvation during the Second SinoJapanese War 193745. As well as featuring famous Chinese stars such as Chen Daoming Aftershock and Zhang Hanyu White Vengeance the film is one of the few Chinese productions to boast Hollywood talent in the form of Oscar winner Adrien Brody and Tim Robbins recalling Christian Bale's turn in 'The Flowers of War' 2011 chronicling the Japanese attack on Nanking.The film follows the fortunes of landlord Fan Zhang Guoli who with his family joins the mass exodus of people after their village is destroyed by bandits leaving behind their privileged lifestyle and falling in with the desperate masses as they head west looking for solace and hope. Hoping to lead the refugees is deserter turned priest An Ximan Zhang Hanyu though he soon comes to realise the hopelessness of the situation with starvation spreading Chinese soldiers raiding for supplies and the Japanese bombing indiscriminately. With Nationalist Kuomintang politicians bickering over what to do and how to profit from the situation with their American British and Soviet allies it is left to Time magazine correspondent Theodore White Adrien Brody to reveal the true extent of the catastrophe that has befallen Henan Province by venturing into the disaster zone and exposing the full horror of the people's suffering.Back to 1942 is a hard hitting and unrelentingly grim disaster movie playing through the eyes and experiences of its ensemble cast switching between the three main stories of Fan White and the Nationalist and provincial governments at a pace that cracks along despite its 145 minutes length. Through his earlier work Feng has demonstrated a talent for tapping into public sentiment and mining melodrama on a national scale. The result has been a slew of hit films that have dealt with little known areas of Chinese history and in doing so reveals a little more about China itself and for a Western audience that is a welcome change from the usual diet of Hollywood teen comedies superhero movies and remakes.Feng said recently in an interview that if it were not for censorship Back to 1942 'would be even more cruel'. I am not sure how this could be possible without the film lapsing into parody. Feng pulls few punches and does a good job of recreating a believable sense of desperation and despair and at times darkly satirical comedic moments are exposed which puts the viewer in an awkward position as to whether to laugh or cry the loss of the donkey being a good example. In part this is due to the real horror of the situation depicted in fairly graphic detail in the film as the refugees run out of food and trudge onwards through incredibly harsh conditions being reduced to eating bark and eventually resorting to cannibalism and selling family members for meagre bags of millet in order to survive. Feng presents much of this without fuss or fanfare and the film is all the more harrowing for the way in which it shows conditions spiralling quickly out of control against the backdrop of the government jockeying for position.Where film can often be politicised by the Chinese authorities as criticisms of the government Feng does a good job of appearing neutral and never assigning blame for the disaster nor criticising the behaviour of the Chinese soldiers who frequently rob the refugees for their own survival. Even the casual and indiscriminate violence of the Japanese soldiers is portrayed as a by product of war rather than as any grand social or historical criticism which no doubt the Chinese government would have preferred. In doing so the film has escaped much of the censorship that plagues Chinese directors who are often welcomed as the darlings of the international film festival circuit.For students of Chinese history the complete omission of the government's taxation policy is jarring since it made the food shortages far worse nor is there any reference to Mao Zedong and the communists ironic given that the refugees are travelling to Shaanxi Province to escape the famine which was the headquarters of Mao's fledgling Chinese Communist Party.Despite these pedantic omissions Back to 1942 is a gripping telling of a little known period of Chinese history that wears its heart on its sleeve without the film being too melodramatic or trying to drown the viewer in manipulative tears. No doubt tears will be shed as a result of the horror of the situations that the refugees find themselves in but Feng tries hard to make his film politically neutral and to tell the story as it was. Feng is one of China's most talented directors and the huge budget he has to play with by Chinese standards really shows up on screen with some stunning visuals and action. Though grim and quite depressing Back to 1942 is a worthy addition to the pantheon of epic disaster movies and succeeds in revealing the horrific human suffering behind a monstrous and quite possibly avoidable tragedy.".

Surprisingly unjudgmental and unsentimental for a historical film recreating despair and lowest possible form of human existence.Feng presents the multiple layers of clues and facts that lead to the ultimate tolls almost asmatteroffactly leaving the audience putting together the puzzles and drawing their own conclusions which is a rather clever way of avoiding censorship and engaging the audience.Could have been A LOT grittier and more affecting. The acting is powerful in this film. However for a film depicting a major famine that claimed over 3 million lives in recent history not much huger is shown as visuals in the film most of the lingering hunger is talked aboutacted out as opposed to being displayed visually which reduces the general affecting power of the film.Xu Fan and Zhang GuoLi are amazing in this film with their acting. Xu gives her most powerhouse performance yet portraying the tough bottom feeder hillbilly btch who would attempt anythingeverything in defending her and her family's rights to live. However for a country woman who's been starving for over 100 days and more than willing to sell her bottom half for a couple of crackers what's with her double chin? think Jennifer Lawrence's face in The Hunger Game  she can act all she wants but I'm sorry girlfriend is just NOT that hungry What TF happens to her makeup artist team and special visual effects people?!Adrien Brody is effectively engaging as a very eager T.H. White who's desperately trying to expose the truth whether driven by his journalist instincts Pulitzer or a genuine sympathy for the poor and depraved. However don't even get me to start with Tim Robbins  why is he even in the film??? The couple of scenes he's in are cringeinducing. Even if you edit them out altogether it would not affect the story's flow whatsoever.".

This is something you'll never truly understand. But you should really try...I have lived here in China a fair number of years I'm Canadian. I'm still fumbling with understanding the culture. I mean a deep understanding not Western superficiality. Try and recall it's a culture of 5000 years give or take. Western culture is sliver in comparison. Why? Because we in the West do not now live like the Greeks nor the Romans. Why? Because those cultures died. Sure there are remnants but sorry they are freaking gone. But the Chinese remain contiguous continuous they never died. No one seems to 'get this'...The world's oldest continuous culture. The West can't comprehend this.Old culture is like 1970...Moving on it appears to me most professional reviewers I use the term lightly continue to judge Chinese movies in the context of Western cultural perspective. I suppose they believe that having thought theydeciphered French and German cinema they now know the Chinese. Wrong again. No surprise frankly.Chinese culture is so vast and so unfathomably deep most will never truly understand unless you are born Chinese. It's called genetics.It's called nature and nurture. It's called socialization of the human psyche. And it's very very very old... Western civilization is an infant in comparison.But  this is the greatest thing! It's called 'mystery'. It's roaming into a land undiscovered by yourself. Completely foreign. And then trying to piece together the meaning. It's like a treasure hunt.Frankly I've watched a lot of Chinese movies subtitled and not old and modern. And these have frustrated me beyond belief. Even angered me. Why were they so damn depressing was my first argument. At the end I felt like crap. But also it made me keep thinking wondering exploring this conundrum. It angered me but it made me feel. It made me feel something I hadn't ever felt before. And I know foreign cinema.This was different.It made me think. A lot. About history about China about human nature about cultural differences about art. About everything about existence life. Its essentials its irony travesty betrayal joy hope good evil. The complex mess we call human. I use the term loosely. I just saw this movie for the first time shame on me. I have worked and lived in China for seven years off and on... Anyway I had to give it a 10 due to the 'other guy' euphemism of for dork gave it a '2' because it wasn't a 'leisure' film. I think this pretty much sums up the problems in today's world. It's called 'narrowminded'. And that's another euphemism for a word I prefer not to write being a gentleman an all.So back to the point another classical Chinese movie plot done with modern artistic verve. Classical as in almost everyone dies anyone you thought was the hero dies and no happy ending in the true sense. And yet done with a modern cinematic panache.And as I said a deepthinker's movie with many unanswered questions.About life and living. About the true mysteries.Take a chance and give your brain a cultural workout. I'm still out here on the playing field trying to learn. See you there...".

	schema:reviewBody "I chosen the film is 'Back to 1942' that is an epic film about a horrible famine of Henan province in China. Feng Xiaogang is the director of the film and the film was released on Thursday November 29th 2012. Feng Xiaogang who is a famous director in China he graduated from The National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts and is good at directing the comedy film. However 'Back to 1942' is a breakthrough of him again. In this film there are not only many famous Chinese such as Zhang Guoli Chen Daoming Xu Fan and Zhang Hanyu but also have two American actors namely Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody. Obviously 'Back to 1942' is expected to have influence at the international marketplace not just for domestic marketplace.'Back to 1942' tells the story about more than 30 million of Henan's people began a 1012 km fled in order to survive from hunger which lasted 106 days and approximately 3 millions people died. A terrible drought and locusts lead to this horrible famine and the war between Japan and China makes it worse. The film' plot structure is unique. There are three main story lines the first one is that civilians fled from famine the second one is the behavior of the Chiang Kai shek's government and the third one is Theodore H. White who is an American journalist reported the situation for Time magazine and his rescue operations. These three clues bonded together by tragic fate of millions of victims that made the film express a distinctive dramatic tension. The color of the film is gray it can accurate convey the emotion of the film which is people suffering in famine and death. Indeed the film shows that people have changed during unprecedented hunger. Specifically sexual physical and even personal freedom becomes tools to exchange for food and the traditional Confucian and even basic family ethics is abandoned such as the husband sale his wife father peddle their children and so forth. There are several plots that shock me. The first rich property owner Fan and his family also are on the road in order to survive. However during this period time his daughterinlaw give birth to a child. The puerperal is very weak and no milk for child because she did not eat anything for few days. Fan deiced to cook a cat for a soup which is company her daughter all the way in order to supplement nutrition for his daughterinlaw so that the grandchildren can survive. But his daughter Xing Xing love her cat so much she often feeds her cat using her own food. When Fan want to explain to his daughter about cooking her cat his daughter ask him that want to eat the cat soup. There is no any sadness in her eyes. People have been changed by extreme hunger and the life instinct defeat all emotions. The second during the famine time every thing could happen for example a few liters of millet can buy a person. Xing Xing which is Fan's daughter want to exchange self for millet but Fan does not allow. She explain to her father that she cannot stand hunger if sold her her family not only can get some millet but also she can live. When Xing Xing was selected there even is a smile appearing on Fan's face that is unimaginable in the present age. Therefore the value of millet is over the value of gold or a person in the famine time. The third Fan takes a train with his grandson into the Shaanxi province and others of his family's members went away or dead. Fan told to his grandson There are only us. However he found that his grandson was already dead. He feels helpless and hopelessness. Hence he made a decision that came back to Henan and he already does not think about how to live he just want to die closer to home. These plot express the despair of losing all family members that give me a big shock because he already lose the life instinct when he lose his family and he even does not affair the death anymore. To sum up I think 'Back to 1942' is a great movie and it almost reflects the damage caused by the famine. It also makes me to think about what is the most important things when people face the disaster.".

Talent refuses to be swamped by the toxic environment. The movie is shocking to watch. It's so realistic dramatic and sad that the weight is almost unbearable. It looked at a historical event with a new lens a modern Chinese view. It calls Chinese people to rethink patriotism. In a time when your life is in grave danger and would vanish at any moment your government sits there doing nothing and kicks you around as baggage and throws you to the enemy and the enemy gives you food that saves you life. Do you pledge patriotism to the government? Do you blame the people who avert to work for the invader? What does patriotism mean when our government doesn't care about your life? Chinese history is full of sad stories and the movie is one of the first that tells those stories in a realistic way such as the irony that the moral of situation all falls on a foreign reporter.The acting is respectable especially in all the male characters. Some of the female actors are not well selected including Xu Fan and not well situated in settings. Overall a great movie for Chinese to relive a dark time to rethink about many fundamental questions about Chinese culture and society. It is probably good for foreign viewers who have some knowledge of Chinese history and culture to appreciate the movie.".

Unfortunately most if not all of these episodes are clich' and predictable there is a pregnant woman guess when she will deliver there is a girl with a cat guess what will happen to the cat there are corrupt officials out to buy women for their own pleasure guess who they will buy. The episodes told are so many that there is no time to sympathise for a character or at least that was my feeling. Most scene are a brutal graphic depiction of what hunger is but I found it less involving than for example Fires on the Plain. the good the subject treated is historically important especially the fact that the government was awareunaware ableunable to do something to prevent this catastrophe. The action scenes the bombing of civilians are shot with mastery and makes you feel uncomfortable all the way through. What I found more interesting though but haven't seen anybody pointing it out so far is that Feng Xiaogang is indirectly and very subtly of course criticising todays government. There are many parallels with what is happening now in China the top leaders who lost touch with the people corrupt officials who take money and women foreigners who have to point out faults of officials Chinese against Chinese with their insatiable hunger for wealth. Even the Japanese though enemies are depicted as more human than the Nationalist officials. The Ugly Tim Robbin's role or the whole religious part for that matter. It doesn't add anything to the already thin plot. Also why Christians and not Buddhists or Daoists?Overall it's an interesting movie to be watched not only for the famine but also as a new step for Chinese cinema becoming more international.610".

	schema:headline " Epic and interesting story! 610";
	schema:reviewBody "Review This is an epic and interesting movie about the famine in a place called Henan during the 1942 Japanese war which took 3 million people's life's. It follows a wealthy family who are forced to flee Henan with the rest of the many families who struggle to reach a better place which will supply them with food and shelter. The journey takes its toll on the many families and the lack of food and freezing weather takes many of there life's. There's a lot of political issues connected to the reasons why they are forced out Henan which are addressed in the movie but it's the touching story of the family which really made the movie for me. The acting is great from all of the cast and I really can't imagine how it must have been for the real people that were forced into this gruesome situation. I would have liked it dubbed in English so I could have concentrated on the emotional scenes but thats just me being picky. Although the subject matter is quite deep and the storyline was pretty interesting I did get bored in some parts and it did seem to drag after a while. With that aside the true story is amazing and I'm surprised that this epic journey about the people of Henan and there search for a better life wasn't told earlier. Watchable!RoundUp This is another one of those films were they put the big names on the poster and there not really in the film. In this case the people are Adrien Brody and Tim Robbins who only had small parts in the movie. To be honest they were the reason why I rented the movie because I was wondering how they were involved in this epic tale but they wasn't the main characters in the film. Brody did play a massive role in getting the aid to the starving people who took part in this amazing journey but I didn't really see the point in Tim Robbins role. Anyway I personally enjoy movies were you actually learn something and in this case it's a piece of Chinese history which I hadn't heard about before. Its a shame that it didn't get the big Hollywood treatment because I'm sure that a lot of people will be shocked when they see what these individuals had to go through. They ended up thinking that dying was a blessing because the journey became too much for the people of Henan and the ones that survived had to live with the fact that they lost there families and loved ones in such a terrible way.I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic dramas about the famine in Henan and there epic journey to find a better life which took 3 million people's life's. 610".

	onyx:emotionText "Review This is an epic and interesting movie about the famine in a place called Henan during the 1942 Japanese war which took 3 million people's life's. It follows a wealthy family who are forced to flee Henan with the rest of the many families who struggle to reach a better place which will supply them with food and shelter. The journey takes its toll on the many families and the lack of food and freezing weather takes many of there life's. There's a lot of political issues connected to the reasons why they are forced out Henan which are addressed in the movie but it's the touching story of the family which really made the movie for me. The acting is great from all of the cast and I really can't imagine how it must have been for the real people that were forced into this gruesome situation. I would have liked it dubbed in English so I could have concentrated on the emotional scenes but thats just me being picky. Although the subject matter is quite deep and the storyline was pretty interesting I did get bored in some parts and it did seem to drag after a while.

The young Petar struggles to graduate from high school mainly for one reasonhe is so infatuated with his Marxism teacher that he cannot think of anything else but her during the classes. So when the graduation time comes he lies to his father about passing in all the subjects while in reality flunking in Marxism.Of course the truth is not easy to hide and when it eventually comes out his father is appalled and decides to punish him and lead his mind off from girls by finding a job for him in a local bakery. But that becomes complicated too when it turns out a beautiful and voluptuous girl is working there and she is an easy catch as well! Complications and comical twists just keep coming and coming here and the laughter never ceases. All this is going on during a very turbulent time the '68 student revolution. My favorite scene is when Stojkovic throws out the TV because of the student uprising claiming it's immoral to watch it and then when Tito approves of the reforms he brings it back saying Comrade Tito has said that the students are right. We can watch television again! Paskaljevic was a master of socio comedy and all the actors do a great job. The ending is specially great and this is probably Slavko Stimac's best role.".

Early in the movie the family sees the Paris uprising on the news and towards the end there's news that the Warsaw Pact armies have entered Prague.I'd say that this story could've taken place in almost any country. It's well known that the '60s were all about sexual awakening and protests much of it scorned by the parents' generation. Indeed the movie shows some of the protests that took place in Yugoslavia.

Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year it is worth it.The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fedex deliverer who has a fiance Helen Hunt and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia but alas the plane he's on crashes in the water and dare I say more well I can because practically everyone saw the allrevealing trailers?  Well Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way probably remenicent of 2001 Hanks' favorite film and even finds a silent companion named Wilson a volleyball.  That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay is one of the films triumphs.  The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance.  If it was someone else it would not be as successful but Hanks gives his all and as usual pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A".

It made me think about all my creature comforts and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic!

Far too many of these fall into 2 categories Those who thought the movie was a Crusoelike story of survival and loved it and those who thought the film was an ad for Fedex and hated it. But the movie is neither about man against nature nor about Fedex.Cast Away is about love  about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it about an ordeal that led one man to rethink what is meaningful in life and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland  creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped  not against his will  in a job that is eating him alive. How many actors could have made Noland's attachment to Wilson believable? Yet Hanks does.The last section of the film much reviled by many is immensely touching. Noland has survived 5 year's of utter isolation hoping to be reunited with his fianc and has resigned himself to death at least a few times before he is miraculously rescued. Anyone who remains dryeyed during his meeting with Kelly when their rich feelings are both acknowledged and of necessity abandoned  is unworthy of being allowed in the theater to see a film of such quality as this one.That Noland's hardearned wisdom about love and family will not be wasted makes for a marvelous ending to the film. It has required all of his ingenuity and endurance to survive on the island. It will now require strength of a different kind to accept the irrevocable loss of Kelly and open himself to a new experience perhaps with Bettina. The last scene with Noland standing at the crossroads as the haunting theme is reprised for the last time as Bettina drives toward her house and as Hanks looks into the camera with newfound resolve  is classic  though again cynics are absolutely barred from enjoying it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been intrigued with Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe particularly the importance of the items that Crusoe salvaged from the shipwreck items that Crusoe could not have made himself and which make his survival and the relative elegance of the life he built for himself quite plausible. The reallife inspiration for Crusoe was one Alexander Selkirk who in 1704 choose to remain on one of the Juan Fernandez islands  four hundred miles from the Chilean coast  rather than continue on a voyage with a captain and on a ship he did not trust. Selkirk was left with bedding a firelock rifle some powder bullets tobacco a hatchet a knife a kettle a Bible his mathematical instruments and some books. Selkirk's four years on his own were a bit more austere than Crusoe's fictional life in large measure because of his relatively meager stock of good quality tools. Selkirk also lost a lot of his social skills.I was interested to see how Cast Away was going to solve the tool issues and how they would deal with a person living on his own for a long period of time. The solutions were simply marvelous ice skates volleyball etc. Tom Hanks is superb in the role.And as a bonus the castaway's return home is a fascinating part of the story. The driveway scene between Hanks and Helen Hunt is very powerful and reminds me of the great Emma ThompsonAnthony Hopkins 'book' scene from Remains of the Day. Highly recommended.".

I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But all in all I've watched the film enough times now that I can say I love this film!!!When I really stop and think about it the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis case and point Forrest Gump.  The acting is very good although there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in Gladiator I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more although that would be his third Oscar.  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film and it is done very well.This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So if that is the case then you are off the hook.  So I hope you watch the film and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for readingChris".

His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island. We're drawn into his long arduous journey as he struggles not only to keep his sanity but to stay alive so he can make it back to the love of his life Hunt. A fascinating believable and thoughtprovoking portrait of a man and his fight to live with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks and steady effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey.

Everything about it works the cinematography the locations the acting the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!".

	schema:reviewBody "At the turn of the millennium technology started to get bigger and better. Films were starting to develop in a way that was never predicted but so did the actors. After watching Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump 1994 I thought I had seen a true drama but that was clearly only the beginning.Tom Hanks Big Forrest Gump stars in his Oscar nominated performance as Chuck Noland a Fed Ex executive who is stranded on an isolated island after a thunderous plane crash.When doing background research on this film I was surprised to see that Russell Crowe had beaten Hanks to the Oscar in 2001. As good as Crowe was in Gladiator I personally thought Hanks made the most sensational performance of his career here. Hanks' character Noland is truly remarkable. From being a comfortable and hard working executive at home with his long time girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt to being an isolated figure in different circumstances. The change in character allows Hanks to express his full acting potential and dive deep within the soul of the character. It is a true battle of human intelligence and human power that Hanks does so well to give and some scenes really got to me it is such a powerful role and does well to rival his other Oscar wins.The text's semiotics are remarkably significant. Having left the wreckage of the plane with only a few supplies Noland builds himself around what he can salvage and none is more recognizable than Wilson. A silent volleyball which was encoded into Cast Away so Hank's could use dialogue to express his traumatic emotions.The plot is made exciting through various scenes. The plane crash is very dramatic and beautifully directed by Zemeckis and scenes shot on the island when Hanks is alone and wandering what to do are silent and chilling justifying the drama genre.The beautiful island is contradicted by the drastic situation a truly magnificent incentive.The ending too is wonderful as it paves the way for many possibilitiesa spellbinding film".

	schema:reviewBody "Cast Away was Tom Hanks' second film with director Robert Zemeckis. The last time they collaborated was on the 1994 multiOscar winner Forrest Gump. I must admit I was never exactly a huge fan of Forrest Gump despite being a great admirer of Zemeckis' work. It was a film that painted a rather naive portrait of America and its relationship with the common man. And the special effects however impressive they might have been were only a nifty sellingpoint to wow the Academy award winning crowd. One of the most commercially calculated and overrated films ever made.Happily Zemeckis seems to have learnt from his mistakes with Forrest Gump. Because Cast Away is a much more accomplished piece of storytelling. A fascinating portrayal of a man cut off from civilisation and when he finally returns to it he's just as shipwrecked. This is the type of film Tom Hanks should be winning Oscars for. Because the film rests entirely on his shoulders. And best of all there's none of the false optimism that plagued Forrest Gump.Hanks plays FedEx Express worker Chuck Noland. He is a man who lives and dies by the clock. Always on the go. One minute he's sorting out packaging schedules in Russia. The next he's delivering much needed vaccines in Malaysia. Its a hectic lifestyle and one that doesn't leave a lot of time for a social life.Nonetheless Chuck is in a happy relationship with girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt even though she gets exasperated when they can't even finish a dinner date because his damn beeper goes off. And that's exactly what happens on Christmas Eve. After he's just proposed to Kelly he's called away for a job. At the airport he tells her I'll be right back. Famous last words.The plane he is on is caught in a storm and divebombs into the ocean. Chuck survives in an inflatable liferaft just barely and is washed ashore on an island. Now all alone Chuck must gather every resource at his disposal to survive. To make it through to the next day.Cast Away is an outstanding film. One of the great survivalist tales you'll ever see. Robert Zemeckis' direction has never been so astute and intelligent. In fact for my money Cast Away may be the best film yet to emerge from Zemeckis' mostly excellent body of work.Before we even get to the island there are the scenes of the plane crash and Chuck's valiant voyage in his rubber dinghy. The crash is a tour de force of action and effects work. Zemeckis shoots it in a series of frenzied camera angles and jolting closeups. Its a startling scene so affecting for its suddenness. And the scene where Chuck nearly gets shredded by an out of control engine turbine stays in the memory and doesn't easily fade.Only for Zemeckis to outdo himself by staging the equally striking scenes of Chuck in his boat caught in the ravages of a fierce thunderstorm. And its a brutal scene of frightening imagery. A scene of almost complete darkness illuminated only by flashes of lightning highlighting the tiny speck of Chuck and his boat on the vast ocean.But its when we get to the island that Cast Away really opens up. Zemeckis' direction is clipped and concise. He never shows us more than what we need and want to see. The film goes through the motions of Chuck's trials and tribulations. But there's an almost terrifying immediacy to these scenes. Some of them are only about ten seconds in length. Little interconnected vignettes.Chuck writing HELP in the sand. Shouting for help to noone in particular. Spending his first night on the island surrounded by the sounds of crashing waves and birdcalls. Exploring the summit of the island. Gathering washed up FedEx packages for supplies. Cracking open a coconut something that takes a very very very long time. Fishing. Sheltering in caves. Cutting himself. Bleeding. And the monumental feeling of ecstasy Chuck feels when he makes a fire for the first time.Tom Hanks really turns in one of his finest performances here. Certainly his best since Big another film he should have won an Oscar for. What makes his performance all the more impressive is its almost in complete silence. Which makes his isolation seem even more potent and poignant. And a little eerie too.Zemeckis also comes up with an unusual method to draw upon Chuck's slowly unravelling mental state. A volleyball that washed ashore too. A volleyball Chuck names Wilson. It becomes like a character in the story. Its Chuck's only companion and as he feels affection for this inanimate object you'll find you will too.Zemeckis constantly keeps coming up with grander and grander developments. None more shocking than when the film flashes forward four years and Chuck is much more lean and hardened by his experiences. Tom Hanks deserves some commendation for losing so much weight for the role.And his method of escape is clever. Building a makeshift raft from timbers and using a portable toilet cover washed ashore as a sail Chuck overcomes crashing waves and turbulent storms in his fragile craft to get home. The scene where he loses Wilson is a moment of surprising poignancy. Watching him float further and further away. Ultimately Chuck is saved. But the story doesn't end there.Once Chuck is home safe and sound he finds the world has moved on without him. Kelly has remarried and Chuck is unsure of his place anymore. The ending is bravely not a happy one. There is something very bittersweet to Chuck's sudden salvation crashing into harsh reality.If you haven't seen Cast Away you're missing out on a modern classic. An expertly crafted tale of survival that's enthralling from beginning to end.".

Disaster strikes during the flight and the plane crashes into the ocean. Managing to free himself from the sinking jet Noland is washed up on an uninhabited island. Without basic modern comforts and fighting solitude daily Noland must live in hope that one day he might be saved before he loses his mind or the will to live.Tom Hanks Noland reteams with director Robert Zemeckis after their hugely successful collaboration on 1994 awards stealer Forrest Gump. Though Cast Away didn't win any awards the usual cry of it being Oscar bait had preceded it it can be argued to be Hanks' best performance. Few actors in the modern era could carry the film the way that Hanks does. Beguiling and drawing us into his loneliness Hanks with minimal dialogue his only company being a volleyball that washed up with a few other FedEx parcels excels with facial and bodily acting. Zemeckis who should be applauded for the middle section and the terrifying plane crash that precedes it puts Hanks' Noland through the mangler. The convenience of said parcels washing ashore aside Noland is bumped bruised and dentally challenged the Robinson Crusoe clichs exist of course but Zemeckis and a heartfelt Hanks put us there on the island as well with a pat on the back due for the excellent work by the sound department I might add.Sadly Cast Away is bookended by not so great work. The opening character introductions are unremarkable but just about good enough for the plot set up but the ending lacks emotional punch and defies what has been built up. Things aren't helped by Helen Hunt's lack of chemistry with Hanks but that in turn is not helped by the writing from William Broyles Jr. since it's only really now that it's Noland that we care about. It's a bit churlish to complain too much though because Zemeckis kept us on the island with Chuck there was no cutting back to grieving family or fruitless rescue attempts. With that it was a truly fine one man show even if that is something that ultimately renders the ending something of a let down. 7.510".

Though Cast Away didn't win any awards the usual cry of it being Oscar bait had preceded it it can be argued to be Hanks' best performance. Few actors in the modern era could carry the film the way that Hanks does. Beguiling and drawing us into his loneliness Hanks with minimal dialogue his only company being a volleyball that washed up with a few other FedEx parcels excels with facial and bodily acting. Zemeckis who should be applauded for the middle section and the terrifying plane crash that precedes it puts Hanks' Noland through the mangler. The convenience of said parcels washing ashore aside Noland is bumped bruised and dentally challenged the Robinson Crusoe clichs exist of course but Zemeckis and a heartfelt Hanks put us there on the island as well with a pat on the back due for the excellent work by the sound department I might add.Sadly Cast Away is bookended by not so great work. The opening character introductions are unremarkable but just about good enough for the plot set up but the ending lacks emotional punch and defies what has been built up. Things aren't helped by Helen Hunt's lack of chemistry with Hanks but that in turn is not helped by the writing from William Broyles Jr. since it's only really now that it's Noland that we care about. It's a bit churlish to complain too much though because Zemeckis kept us on the island with Chuck there was no cutting back to grieving family or fruitless rescue attempts. With that it was a truly fine one man show even if that is something that ultimately renders the ending something of a let down. 7.510";

Zemeckis directing Burgess cinematography and some nice special effect and make up also do good to this movie.My only points of critic The time on the Island is to short it last only about 13 of the movie and I really wanted to see more of Hanks on the Island because those are definitely the best scene's.

On Christmas Eve his beeper calls him to catch a lastminute FedEx flight to Malasya for official business and he waves I'll be right back before he boards. Then his plane crashes in the Pacific and Chuck is indefinitely marooned on a desert island with only a volleyball as his company.I have huge affection for 'desert island' premises and subscribe to the thinking that whatever you do with the execution it will still be a wonderful experience. It simply cannot go wrong. It does not go wrong in 'Cast Away' either  although I would have loved to see more exploration of the lush island jungle  in fact its island sequences are all golden. The only problem this film has is the lachrymose final act in which Hanks fades and director Zemeckis pulls up the directing chair and starts pouring in relationsmelodrama to sew things together.Everything up until this rote lukewarm point is wellcrafted with patient strokes courtesy of the film's protagonist. Tom Hanks who put forward the idea for the film to Forrest Gumppal Zemeckis is in nearly every scene and carries so much dramatic weight effortless leading man appeal and sympathyladen charisma that he sucks you in entirely. Initially I applied some skepticism to judging his businessman character and it was not until the vivid epileptic plane crash sequence that he started to absorb me. As the airplane was sinking into the deep blue with Chuck trapped inside I can't imagine anything more frightening you knew judging by how much you were pulling for him that he was our hero. This is man vs. nature at its best.Upon waking up on the beach of the stormy desert island Chuck is faced with some of the weapons mother nature has in her arsenal you can feel the energy being slowly drained out of him during the first couple of days as he struggles to crack coconuts find water build shelter make fire catch fish and tend to his wounds. Insanity sweeps across the shore and Hanks aptly embodies the hardedged bloodspilled sweatdripping tearshedding transformation of a timedriven businessman to a primitive instinctdriven maroon. It is eerily crafted with an harmonic silence and sans your dutiful MacGyveresque inventions scaffolds or nifty tools. Here is a mere man seen through epic aerial shots and with underlying subtitles that spell out desperation and loneliness both of which Hanks assuredly and crisply exemplifies.So then what is really wrong with 'Cast Away'? Nothing  aside from marginal missteps  is wrong with the cast away part it's the ending that that is not intune once Zemeckis wields his clearcut spelledout and moralist trademarks. I refuse to spoil anything mostly because I remember the film having been spoiled to me long before I sat down to watch it just rest assured you will be begging to be taken back to the exciting island.7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed. Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island. However even with that said the previews didn't really spoil the movie. Though it would have made the messages that much more powerful if they didn't give that much of it away. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place. Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend  fianc Kelly who is very understanding of Chuck Noland's plight. One day just before Christmas Chuck is called away to Malaysia. This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane most realistically crashes into the ocean. As the only survivor he washes up on shore of a small isolated island in the south Pacific. This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character. On the surface Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level and a girlfriend he is completely in love with. His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash. Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival. There are no cuts to the rescue efforts no meanwhile back in Memphis scenes. It's all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film. There are four basic needs of survival. Most people know about the first three Food Water and Shelter. Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls Wilson. The acquisition of food water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs. We suffer with him as he does his own dental work. This goes on for four years... Finally one day a piece of metal from the plane? washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape. He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island. He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued. Along the way he losses his only friend of the last four years Wilson in a strange but very emotional scene. Shortly thereafter on the brink of death from dehydration he is rescued. In any other movie this would be the happy ending. But this is not any other movie. Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life. And now he must find a way to move on with his. When he first arrived on the island he only needed to find ways to physically survive but now rescued he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him. The final scene just before the credits roll reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie. This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering pain or tragedy that someone may go through their life will always be worth living. And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience. This is a moral and spiritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another.".

He superbly played the part of the person who's struggling to find his place after being out of touch for five years! The scenes are so touching especially his reunion with Hunt.I was almost convinced this was based on an actual account so much so I was looking to see the trailers at the end of the movie saying Based on the real life account of... Tom Hanks is one of the best character actors of his generation right alongside of Robert Duvall Robert DeNiro Dustin Hoffman Robin Williams Gene Hackman Morgan Freeman and Russell Crowe.As an aside this is the only movie I've seen that's been a showcase of a corporate logo from beginning to end and not a bad association I might add to which I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't produced by FedEx.  If you're looking for something more than the shallow and contrived dramatics of the reality series Survivor or a movie without the standard pyrotechnics or other adrenalin boosting gimmicks then this film will be well worth your time.It's a human interest story pure and simple.I was so drawn in that when the movie ended I really wanted to see what happens to Chuck in the new phase of his life after meeting his next potential love interest at the very end of the film.I guess that's left up to the imagination. Happily ever after. Enjoy a superb tour de force performance by Hanks.".

	schema:headline " Don't even think of casting away this movie! This harrowing tale of survival deserves to be told.";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie tells the story of a FedEx worker Chuck Noland Tom Hanks whom find himself away from his normal life with his love one Kelly Helen Hunt when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island. Chuck has no choice but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment and find the courage to escape his island dwelling when he's able to. Without spoiling too much of the movie the structure of this film is divided into three parts Chuck's life as a FedEx employee the struggle to survive on the island and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change. Each one has this 'show don't tell' modality of storytelling. The movie doesn't have that much dialogue which in my opinion works. This allows the beautiful yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film's story. The way the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work show how Chuck Noland's lives life under the punctuality of a running clock. The way Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is where time doesn't really matter anymore. I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning to slow near one location standstill. The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch. Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin. It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island and return back to normal home. Again this could symbolizes how much driven he is at his job. It's really up to debate what this item was really about or what's in it. Glad they didn't use the deleted scene from the script that actually has Chuck open the box. It would had kill the movie for me. Another symbol is that of Wilson the volleyball. The character was created by screenwriter William Broyles Jr. while researching island survival techniques in a beach in Mexico in which this time a volleyball washed up on shore. While talking to a volleyball might seem weird on paper it makes a lot of sense as it show how much people are willing to go for a sense of normal connection when isolate from others. From a theatrical POV Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a onepersononly situation. The movie really does makes a good job to it seem like Wilson could be a person. In my opinion he's the most famous inanimate object put on film. It was heartbreaking what happen to him toward the end. Only Tom Hanks can make us feel something for a volleyball and make it seem believably. In any lessor actor this might come across as silly or boring. This movie is very engaging because of him. Tom Hanks is a master of showing great range of emotion with his facial features and the way he moves his body. You can tell how much trauma he went through the way he looks at things or how he reacts. Not only that Hanks went through great stress to get his body ready for the role. Hanks gained 50 pounds during preproduction to make him look like a pudgy middleaged man. After a majority of the film was shot production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his beard. He look like he had been living on the island for years. This was a very extreme weight lost that might cause a lot of Tom Hank's health problems in later years. Hanks even was nominated for Best Actor that year for a Oscar. While Helen Hunt isn't in the film much. She did a great job as a supporting role. You really can tell the struggle she has with trying to love Chuck while also trying to move on. The film gives fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone. It's somewhat educational. I like how the movie begins and ends at crossroads. Two possible paths to an unknown future. It's all very symbolic. This movie has a lot of replay value. There are tons of little clever things that change into the timelines of the movie you can only pick up on if you watch it a few times such as how Chuck wears his shoes during airplane flights the irony of the dentist that cause him so much pain or the name of the ranch where the angel wing package came from. Then there are those slight things that foreshadow a lot of what will happen later on the film such as seeing Chuck's sailing certification or the off comment mention of a tooth ache or the song 'Return to Sender' playing the background. While the movie doesn't have that much music. Alan Silvestri's minimal score was beautiful to listen to and good enough to win a Grammy Award in 2002. I like how he use nature sound effects to reinforce the feeling of isolation with his music. The weird product placement didn't really hurt the film. This film features a FedEx cargo plane crashing in the Pacific Ocean but it didn't hurt the company as the film's success ensured help increased brand awareness. One thing that kinda did hurt the film is the trailer that really did spoiled too much. Seriously. Don't watch the trailer until you've seen the film. I like how the film later helped developed the show Lost. Overall A great movie that showcase the triumph of the human spirit under harsh conditions. It's brutal haunting and painful yet compelling enigmatic  uplifting. This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie tells the story of a FedEx worker Chuck Noland Tom Hanks whom find himself away from his normal life with his love one Kelly Helen Hunt when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island. Chuck has no choice but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment and find the courage to escape his island dwelling when he's able to. Without spoiling too much of the movie the structure of this film is divided into three parts Chuck's life as a FedEx employee the struggle to survive on the island and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change. Each one has this 'show don't tell' modality of storytelling. The movie doesn't have that much dialogue which in my opinion works. This allows the beautiful yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film's story. The way the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work show how Chuck Noland's lives life under the punctuality of a running clock. The way Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is where time doesn't really matter anymore. I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning to slow near one location standstill. The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch. Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin. It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island and return back to normal home. Again this could symbolizes how much driven he is at his job. It's really up to debate what this item was really about or what's in it.

	schema:headline " Cast Away Review";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Cast Away centralizes its focus on a FedEx employee Chuck Noland Tom Hanks who is the sole survivor of an airplane crash only to be stranded on an island that is drastically offcourse. Throughout Chuck's extended stay on the deserted island he battles isolation depravity and the will to survive. After Chuck realizes he may never be found he battles the island both emotionally and physically in hopes of one day seeing his lover Kelly Frears Helen Hunt again. Even though Chuck is faced with disparaging odds he manages to accomplish great feats while maintaining his sense of humor and his drive to survive. The major theme in the film is the importance of relationships. Throughout the film this theme was repeatedly highlighted in various scenes. For instance every night Chuck would fall asleep while staring at the pocket watch Kelly had given him with her photo in it and in other scenes the camera would focus on the cave walls where he stayed revealing the multiple pictures of Kelly's face that Chuck had drawn. Furthermore as Chuck battles the crushing isolation of being helplessly alone his desperation for communication and a relationship begins to show when he begins to build companionship with a volleyball that he names Wilson. The bond between Chuck and Wilson becomes so strong that in a certain scene Chuck becomes angry at Wilson and throws him out of the cave only to rush out to the beach desperately trying to find him and apologize. Chuck's sanity wavers as the time on the island stretches longer and as his hope begins to fade but with the help of his bond with Wilson Chuck is able to talk through his struggles both physical and emotional as Wilson seems to represent the rational side of Chuck's personality. Similar to the Life of Pi Cast Away has a sense of dread and isolation that battle with the will of survival with metaphoric companions. There are several techniques the director of Cast Away Robert Zemeckis uses that amplify the feelings and settings in the film to its viewers. The camera angles that were used in multiple scenes were able to allow viewers to grasp the perils of Chuck's situation of being stranded on the island. In one scene the camera was angled downward as Chuck leaned over the edge to retrieve rope at the island's highest peak this angle showed the danger of the task at hand for Chuck but also conveyed the intensity and tension of the moment. Another scene that used angling was when Chuck was attempting to start a fire again the camera switched back and forth between Chuck's sweat covered face and the two pieces of wood he was using in his attempt to make an ember. With each shift between Chuck's face and the action of rubbing the sticks together the camera zoomed in closer on his face with each shot. This technique created a shared feeling of tension between the Chuck and the film viewers. Another technique that was used was lighting in many night scenes where Chuck was in the cave the screen was almost black and all that was viewable was the outline of Chucks face or body due to the faint moon beam the trickled in through the small opening at the top of the cave. In another scene the cave was tinted with the glow of a fire that Chuck had created as he uses the orange glow to view his swollen gums on the blade of an ice skate. Both dark scenes and even those lit by fire produce a feeling of solitude for the film viewer that instills the feeling of isolation. Ultimately Cast Away is a story of never ending hope that is riddled with gut wrenching scenes and depicts the human nature and its need for companionship and relationships. The old saying you never know what you have until its gone is amplified in this film as Chuck's love for Kelly never fades throughout his perilous journey.".

That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war his overprotective mother smothering him and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage when on tour he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.";

	schema:headline " An assault on the senses and a really great film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Pink Floyd The Wall is a great film based on the already great album by Pink Floyd!  I was stunned by the use of imagery combined with the great soundtrack of the album which gave us a strange drugged up vision of what a burnt out rock star would see.  It's really crazy!  Yet it shows how these famous rock stars are bombarded with fame and applause and how insane it can drive an already disturbed person.  The Wall itself is the isolation and separation from society and saneness which is a place that can easily be avoided if only people gave us a fair chance to.  The depressing part about the film is that none of this is the rock star's fault.  He was driven to it by loneliness in his growing up yearssince he lost his father to the war along with psychological torment by his teachers parents and above all his sexually controlling wife.  The movie is twisted because this is how the lead character sees the world.  Worse yet after he has already been driven to the edge of his own sanity in his mind the people who drove him to that edge come back to testify against him.  It's weird the first time you watch it and looks a lot like a crazy music video that was pulled out of MTV.  The only difference is that this one is telling a story and has been transferred to the big wide screen.  Alan Parker has directed the film but Roger Waters seems to be in charge here because it's his album his story and his conception.  All that's really been done here is transforming the album to celluloid.  I in some ways like this better than the album because now we have images to reinforce the songs and the story.  I wish I could have seen this on the big screen because the variety of images and the loud music seem compressed and compacted on a small TV set.  You might not understand this the first time especially if you haven't heard the album yet.  But it really is a great film and it actually has a story and a point that most music videos today unfortunately lack!  I think that this film will teach people the reasons why these talented individuals suffer and lose their minds.  The people that have guided and taken care of them while they grew up often take away their ability to happily and normally function on their own.  And the album and film's lesson is for not only the people who drove him to his wall to back off but for him to pull himself out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pink Floyd The Wall is a great film based on the already great album by Pink Floyd!  I was stunned by the use of imagery combined with the great soundtrack of the album which gave us a strange drugged up vision of what a burnt out rock star would see.  It's really crazy!  Yet it shows how these famous rock stars are bombarded with fame and applause and how insane it can drive an already disturbed person.  The Wall itself is the isolation and separation from society and saneness which is a place that can easily be avoided if only people gave us a fair chance to.  The depressing part about the film is that none of this is the rock star's fault.  He was driven to it by loneliness in his growing up yearssince he lost his father to the war along with psychological torment by his teachers parents and above all his sexually controlling wife.  The movie is twisted because this is how the lead character sees the world.  Worse yet after he has already been driven to the edge of his own sanity in his mind the people who drove him to that edge come back to testify against him.  It's weird the first time you watch it and looks a lot like a crazy music video that was pulled out of MTV.  The only difference is that this one is telling a story and has been transferred to the big wide screen.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently rented and rewatched Pink Floyd The Wall for the 200th time and I had forgotten over the years why this is my favorite movie. Surprisingly the reason it is so good has little to do with a rock star having a mental breakdown. Pink being a rock star is almost incidental to the real message of the film. It seems as if director Parker took the initial idea of Pink Floyd's album and ran away with it. The film serves less as a study of one celebrity individual instead serving as a cinematic indictment of all of our worst aspects as human beings cruelty brutality insanity herd mentality fascismall the most negative traits of twentieth century man are splashed upon the movie screen as if the Director was asking the audience Why? This is a film in rebellion against the status quo. Funny then that it should be driven by the music of a major rock and roll band. But all in all that is besides the point. The film of the Wall begins and ends with scenes of oppression by authoritarian figures police men skinheads teachers etc.It is almost as if the entire sub textual content of the film is drawing a parallel between the internal alienation of a single individual and the social and global alienation that fostered the cruelties of World War 2 the holocaust ad infinitum. Pinks degeneration is the degeneration of Everyman confronted by a world that is still spinning increasingly out of control away from the light further behind the wall of its own nihilistic will toward selfobliteration. The violence of the imagery the final Trial and the psychic attack of the final montage of disturbing images masked children put into a meat grinder cartoon teachers becoming hammers neoNazis on a rampage as the scene fades into a blank grey wall are grand satirical operatic Theater of Cruelty in a cinematic framework. But it is the final lyric sung by a repulsive animated Judge that puts the entire scope of this picture into focus I sentence you to be EXPOSED before your peers... The Judge  of course is not merely talking to the fictional Pink but to the viewers of the film and well the entire world for all that and again the Director has seemingly high jacked the rock opera format and used it as a vehicle to ask that ultimate question why is mankind so mutually interested in its own selfdestruction? Why do nations and civilized cultures slide easily into fascistic thinking? How many war orphans are we still to this day creating?I am not now a fan of Pink Floyd's music although all of the music in this film is beyond excellent. Oddly enough I am the farthest thing from the dopesmoking hippy that is supposed to be a Pink Floyd fan. I am an Industrial musician and a writer. My favorite music at this point is anything by NON Throbbing Gristle etc. This film has over the years though shaped my own artistic outlook in ways I am probably not even aware of. One does not need to smoke dope or even be a Pink Floyd fan to be affected quite deeply by this film. Roger Ebert once said that Star Wars was to him at least a perfect film. Well Pink Floyd The Wall to myself is a perfect film whether you are a pothead or no. I have given this film ten stars but it is a little beyond that. If it was simply a rock movie it could be rated in a conventional manner. But Allan Parker has done something here that is beyond even the concept of the bestselling album that this movie is based upon. He has crafted a surreal essay on the madness and selfdestruction that lurks within the human spirit. And he has created one of the most sobering angry and dizzying satirical pieces ever committed to celluloid. In short this film is a work of sheer jaundiced brilliance.".

No other rock opera or most movies in general can top the insanity that is this movie. This movie peers into the mind of an over protected reclusive and sometimes violent rock star who has taken enough of life and the people in it. This is the story of Pink poor old Pink who's father left him one morning in black 44' and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears who's wife tried so hard to open his heart but found that nobody was home and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he nor the rest of the world would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic Hitleresc side takes control of the world with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier it could be too late. So goes the quote above taken from The Trial which is the end of the Wall and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. This is just an outstanding movie. Everything works in this movie the twisted live action the animation that probably is what being insane is like and most of all the music that is in my opinion the greatest album ever created to Hell with Dark Side of the Moon it was good but it doesn't even compare to The Wall. Pink Floyd is my favorite band along with The Who and The Rolling Stones an odd combination I know and when their best album was made into a movie I knew that Hollywood had at least a little common sense even though Hollywood shunned it and most of the reviews I've read here are negative but I don't care I'm watching it and enjoying for me and no other opinion matters. My favorite songs off of this moviealbum are Mother One of My Turns There's Nobody Home Comfortably Numb probably my favorite song actually and of course The Trial.  One last thing if you are ever in a position where you have to choose between this and Tommy pick this because Tommy wasn't very good. Infact if it didn't have the great music of The Who in it I would say it blew. Just a quick reminder. 1010".

As it stands Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made a cogent film explaining why humans are the way they are and how they react to the surrounding universe . It's a film whose soundtrack is every bit as powerful as the human condition";

	schema:reviewBody "The opening tracking shot of a hotel hallway that resembles a prison should clue you in as to what awaits. There are so many things to like and be fascinated by in this movie. And for all of its avantgarde leanings this is actually a very classically designed story. An iconoclastic music star Pink Floyd triestries not to think about his past and how he got to where he is which is borderline psychotic. And because he's so disturbed he can't even think in a linear way so the journey we take into his mind is necessarily whackedout.We also get to see how fascism is born from misdirected hate and idolatry. As a rock star Floyd has seen the adulation of his audiences so he's familiar with the phenomenon. But at the same time he detests them for buying into his act. It's like the old Groucho Marx joke about refusing membership to any group who would let you in. He knows he's a fake his teachers and people like his wife have told him so so everyone else who thinks he's real must be fakes also. It's a big cyclic game. So he can't let any of them in behind his wall because they are by definition phony.It's interesting also to think about how he has turned full circle into fascism. It's just part of his dream and how he deals with his anger but it's also an interesting reaction to the absent father. Had there been no homosexuals or Jews etc. there would have been no need for a Hitler and therefore there would have been no need for his father to die. But instead of hating Nazis he hates the people that provoked the Nazis. I could go on for days with stuff like this but I'll stop here.Just watch the movie and be impressed with the way it works on so many levels.".

I think that it definitely does.  The issues today may be different from those of the late 70's but the sentiment and the dangers are the same.  We have huge segments of alienated people we have bigotry and hate and we have governments which operate in secret.  We have movements that preach rigid conformity and hate we have religions that have lost the message of caring and we have schools that only want to turn out mindless corporate robots.In fact I think that this film and therefore the message behind the music is MORE important today.

	schema:headline " My favorite movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Some people have told me that they didn't like this movie because they didn't understand it. Well the first time I saw it I understood it perfectly. This movie is excellent is my favorite movie. Pink Floyd made an excellent work here. The movie is about a nonexistent singer called Pink Floyd as the real band. In the beginning it shows Pink in his hotel and then it comes to Pink's childhood. It shows Pink as a child and his mother and how he loved her. After this it shows Pink's terrible life at school. In the school there were certain teachers who would harm the children anyway they could. With this life and the fact that the father died in World War II it starts to make Pink insane. He in his mind starts to imagine things and to create his own world. This world is in some way the real world but represented in another way. In this world the faces of the children are masks meaning that the teachers don't let the children see what is happening really but hiding everything and doing everything as the teachers want. In his imagination Pink burns the school with other children perfectly singing We don't need no education.... But nothing really happens is just in his mind. At the beginning the links between the past faraway past and present are very present. But later it stays in the present and it shows Pink's life with his wife. Because of this sad childhood Pink is really depressive. So his wife goes with another man. And this is just another brick in the wall. The wall is what Pink was creating since he was a child that is his own world in his mind. In various parts of the movie we hear this is just another brick in the wall that is another reason for Pink to continue doing the wall. After his wife leaves him Pink goes with another woman because he needs a dirty woman. But this is just to prove that his wife's choice doesn't hurt him because he's going with another woman. But he really doesn't do anything with her. Instead of that he destroys his apartment. That's how the wall works. Everything after that are just bricks in the wall. And then in fact it shows a wall. This movie has various representations and we have to interpret it. That wall completed represents that Pink's world is complete in his mind. Now he just has to use it. Pink's life is confusing after this. It shows again links to the past and then returning to the present. It all ends when Pink's manager discovers him drugged and he takes him to the hospital. But in his way Pink in his wall imagines that he has transformed in someone like Hitler. And that's how the wall works. The Hitler group instead of be called Nazi are called Hammer but are with the same colors. Then he goes everywhere with this group and is really a Nazi group following the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews. But this is just in his mind nothing of that is really happening. But then he realizes that everything's wrong that he wants a break of the wall. What is happening really is maybe that he's in the hospital after all the drugs that he has as we see before. How he says that he wants a break? In this way before it was mentioned that he has a little black book with his poems in also seen in his school. Well in his mind he's reading a poem that is really a Pink Floyd's song called Stop and he says I wanna go home take of this uniform and leave the show... I'm waiting in this cell because I have to know have I been guilty all this time...?. Guilty of making all that stuff like Hitler in his mind. In the wall this is good but in the real world this is bad. So he is not sure that what he's doing. Really he's saying What I do is good or bad?. But because he has entered the wall and now he has put a doubt about it he goes into trial. In the trial he's found guilty. And he's expelled of the wall. What is really happening? Pink's world is over. Pink has died probably in the hospital and this is confirmed by his last scream when the wall explodes. The last scene shows children picking some stuff from the ground. That is how the world will end. A great movie. If you haven't seen it see it now. The album is also great. Some tracks have changed. The movie is incrediblegoodnarrated with Pink Floyd's songs.".

	schema:reviewBody "How to describe Pink Floyd The Wall? Feature length music video? Bad acid trip? Good acid trip? The Wall is one of those interesting experiments where I can imagine many people walking away shaking their head and saying What the hell was that?!? It is not a traditional narrative film by any definition and yet it is not without some power from it's combination of images and music. It is difficult to define whether this is a film someone should check out or not but it should mostly be based on your willingness to accept a movie that does not operate within the typical confines of standard cinema.The backstory to this project was formed when rock group Pink Floyd was wrapping up a major US tour in the 1970s and lead singer Roger Waters felt disconnection and contempt for his audience going so far as to spit on a fan during the tour's final show. As a result of this experience he conceived the concept album The Wall a tale of isolation and the building of barriers between Waters and those around him. The album was later adapted into a major multimedia concert experience and finally a film. Waters had originally wanted to film the concert but director Alan Parker convinced him that that was a bad idea and instead pushed for an original film telling the story of the album in visuals. What emerged is an interesting collection of moments that do tell a tale of sorts if a somewhat disjointed one.The basic outline of the film as far as I can tell is this Pink Bob Geldof a rock singer has isolated himself in a hotel suite and is slowly going insane. He remembers moments of his childhood his father's perishing in World War II his mother trying to fill the gaps his education etc. He later reminisces about his marriage and how he tries to push his wife away. He eventually snaps trashing his hotel room and shaving off all his body hair in the process. When he is finally pulled out of his hotel room by his entourage he envisions himself as a fascist dictator bringing death and mayhem to all those around him.The above description is one interpretation of The Wall I am sure there are others. The film is very much a tale about cutting oneself off from the world retreating into the individual until there is nothing left for the mind to feed on but your own paranoia and unhappiness. Much of this material resonates giving us a glimpse at ourselves at times. Parker's imagery accompanied by animation by Gerald Scarfe is surrealistic and difficult to penetrate at times but The Wall eventually builds on you until you find yourself understanding more than you might think.Of course the centerpiece of the film is the music by Pink Floyd. The Wall is often referred to as their greatest album and it works well as a complement to the visuals. The music replaces dialogue in telling the tale although as with many rock albums some of the lyrics are open for interpretation and if you are unfamiliar with the material The Wall might prove more difficult to follow.Can I give The Wall a recommendation? To a certain extent yes. It does have the ability to move you and some of the film's message is powerful and insightful. At the same time is it easy to follow and without confusion? Not at all and many people are just not comfortable with that kind of film. I would say that Pink Floyd The Wall is an acquired taste that may or may not be suitable for your palette.".

He remembers moments of his childhood his father's perishing in World War II his mother trying to fill the gaps his education etc. He later reminisces about his marriage and how he tries to push his wife away. He eventually snaps trashing his hotel room and shaving off all his body hair in the process. When he is finally pulled out of his hotel room by his entourage he envisions himself as a fascist dictator bringing death and mayhem to all those around him.The above description is one interpretation of The Wall I am sure there are others. The film is very much a tale about cutting oneself off from the world retreating into the individual until there is nothing left for the mind to feed on but your own paranoia and unhappiness. Much of this material resonates giving us a glimpse at ourselves at times. Parker's imagery accompanied by animation by Gerald Scarfe is surrealistic and difficult to penetrate at times but The Wall eventually builds on you until you find yourself understanding more than you might think.Of course the centerpiece of the film is the music by Pink Floyd. The Wall is often referred to as their greatest album and it works well as a complement to the visuals. The music replaces dialogue in telling the tale although as with many rock albums some of the lyrics are open for interpretation and if you are unfamiliar with the material The Wall might prove more difficult to follow.Can I give The Wall a recommendation? To a certain extent yes. It does have the ability to move you and some of the film's message is powerful and insightful. At the same time is it easy to follow and without confusion? Not at all and many people are just not comfortable with that kind of film. I would say that Pink Floyd The Wall is an acquired taste that may or may not be suitable for your palette.";

But  when he's going crazy he is taken to a concert but he's still travelling  through his fears and his dreams. The wall is in himself and he'll have to tear it down and come back to reality. I saw this film when I was fifteen and it enchanted me because I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd. I saw it recently and curiously It left me unsatisfied. Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made an audacious and seductive film and this one features some clever visual and ringing brainwaves. Moreover Bob Geldof is quite convincing in the main role of this helpless and outraged man and the animation sequences are very successful and they epitomize Pink's inner universe particularly the last sequence with the hideous judge. However the screenplay of the film is very repetitive when a lot of pictures are passing by very quickly the film looks like a huge clip and this one is multiplying the flashy effects. As a conclusion even if this film isn't a masterpiece it's probably Parker's best musical film at least better than the boring The Commitments".

I loved the animations and became intrigued by the inner motivations of the main character although there were some parts of the movie I just couldn't make anything of it. Then I decided to watch the extra materials that came with the DVD including the running commentary by Roger Waters. And it all made sense. This is one powerful movie an interesting rebellion against rock stardom and its perks. It's completely unexpected since we are listening to all of this from a rock star himself which makes it all too real. The groupies the drugs the alienation the feeling of being sick and fed up with it all. This is not an uplifting movie by any means. In fact Roger Waters summed it up pretty well describing it as a sour 2 hours. And the fact that Mr. Waters has never been able to fully recover from the loss of his father makes it even worse almost every Pink Floyd album  and a complete album The Final Cut  has a song about his death in WWII. Even with this cons the film is a must see for the animation sequences. And Bob Geldof proves he can act.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw the film a few weeks ago for the first time on DVD. The film looks good sounds good and it's still holding up not only with the passage of time but the passage of my own personal life. There are times when I pick up The Wall the album give it a listen and think to myself god what a selfabsorbed person this is. But I realize in my better moments that Roger Waters was just letting us in on some of his deep personal issues. I used to not understand how politics and the whole fascist angle related to the rest of the film but at this point it all makes sense to me. Waters is saying that the walls that we build up individually in our lives to protect ourselves and separate ourselves from others are just miniature versions of the political and social walls built up by people who rule over others through fear and intimidation.On a technical level only the scenes which integrate animation with live action have aged somewhat poorly. The film still has a striking and unique visual style even after all these years of MTV that have followed.Geldorf is sufficient as Pink though he doesn't get many lines or much to do except sit in that room.All in all a great film for Floyd fans but it might leave some non fans scratching their heads because it's a film you have to see a few times and think about if you really want to get it. I know this film was panned by a lot of critics and also a lot of them said the film's stance was insulting to the Floyd's core audience. I couldn't disagree more I think the Floyd never made the mistake of underestimating their audience's intelligence and that they were here making a personal statement not only about their own lives primarily Waters' and Barrett's but about the changes in how they interact with their fans.I agree though with Waters' comments on the documentary  the film's great weakness is that it lacks humor even the biting or negative humor of Floyd songs like Have a Cigar. I think possibly doing part of the film in a less documentary style especially Young Lust would have helped here.".

The film looks good sounds good and it's still holding up not only with the passage of time but the passage of my own personal life. There are times when I pick up The Wall the album give it a listen and think to myself god what a selfabsorbed person this is. But I realize in my better moments that Roger Waters was just letting us in on some of his deep personal issues. I used to not understand how politics and the whole fascist angle related to the rest of the film but at this point it all makes sense to me. Waters is saying that the walls that we build up individually in our lives to protect ourselves and separate ourselves from others are just miniature versions of the political and social walls built up by people who rule over others through fear and intimidation.On a technical level only the scenes which integrate animation with live action have aged somewhat poorly. The film still has a striking and unique visual style even after all these years of MTV that have followed.Geldorf is sufficient as Pink though he doesn't get many lines or much to do except sit in that room.All in all a great film for Floyd fans but it might leave some non fans scratching their heads because it's a film you have to see a few times and think about if you really want to get it. I know this film was panned by a lot of critics and also a lot of them said the film's stance was insulting to the Floyd's core audience. I couldn't disagree more I think the Floyd never made the mistake of underestimating their audience's intelligence and that they were here making a personal statement not only about their own lives primarily Waters' and Barrett's but about the changes in how they interact with their fans.I agree though with Waters' comments on the documentary  the film's great weakness is that it lacks humor even the biting or negative humor of Floyd songs like Have a Cigar. I think possibly doing part of the film in a less documentary style especially Young Lust would have helped here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Pink Floyd's The Wall is a film in which I see tribute to from many modern day films. This film primarily focuses on the fascism and destruction of WWII told through the eyes of a drugged out rock star.This film is definitely about more than just Pink Floyd's great music. Pink goes through a metamorphosis in the course of the movie. Pink starts as drugged out zombie rock star that feels nothing not even for his beautiful and sexy wife who he once loved deeply. There is a message to be had throughout this film if you can look past the music and drugs commonly associated with Pink Floyd.Slowly Pink's emotions build until the only way to control them is to let them loose as he hits rock bottom realizing in many ways he has given up everything for nothing. As he regroups he becomes cold and calculating 'there can be no exceptions'. This conflict is meant to show how often the pendulum swings from one extreme right to the opposite extreme. By the end of the film Pink has figured out what it means to be normal.If you've never seen The Wall I'd recommend you see it. It's not for children it's rated R. If you identify with many societal problems for example the problems with public schools you'll probably identify with most of the movie. At the same time some of these parts are a little slow and some might find them boring or pointless. If you like Pink Floyd's music then you really shouldn't find any parts of the movie too painful.This movie basically covers most of the songs in The Wall album which were redone for this production. It also features some songs from Pink Floyd's The Final Cut album. One of my favorite scenes is animated and fans of The Final Cut's 'Not Now John' will recognize the music from this song in that scene of the movie.There is something for everyone to appreciate about this film.810".

They have kept to the time frame of the book  it looks like the 1930s1950s. They haven't tried to modernize it with pop culture references and silly jokes like so many kids' movies nowadays do. Fern isn't break dancing with the pig. No there are no musical numbers. Fart jokes were kept to a minimum. I think they are required by law nowadays to put fart jokes in all children's entertainment. They didn't dumb down the lovely words E.B. White used  Charlotte uses her grand language as she speaks to Wilbur and spins her webs.I kept thinking of Babe at the start of the movie. A white runt pig saved. Similar barnyard companions. Even the voice of Wilbur sounds like the voice of Babe. Even tho Babe was voiced by a 32 y.o. woman and Wilbur by a 9 y.o. boy! But I think the writers of Babe must have been fans of the classic Charlotte's Web.Steve Buscemi as the voice of Templeton the Rat is just perfect. Poor guy even has a ratlike face  is that why they cast him? And the CGI animation is flawless. You can't tell the animated animals from the real ones. Flawlessly blended.That little pig is SO cute at the beginning  I just wanted to watch him play in the mud for 10 minutes. But no they kept the story moving along. They even tried to make the spider cute but that's quite a challenge. Still Julia Roberts' soothing motherly voice helps. Nevertheless the little girl next to me climbed into her grandma's lap when the spider appeared. And Dakota Fanning as always is a darling.So go  and if you loved the book as a child bring plenty of Kleenex!".

Instead he offers a delightfully filmed version of the story with CG effects so realistic and subtle that they detract from the live action base not even a little bit.This movie is very true to the original story and the comic relief was in my opinion not at all overbearing. I got a lot of genuine laughs out of the movie and at 40 that's saying something for a Grated movie aimed at families with small children.The movie has an oldfashioned but familiar feel to it. It seems to represent the America we all think we remember and want to see when we visit the country. It seems in many ways timeless without feeling Disneyesquire. I'm sure this is what the filmmakers were going for and they hit it right on the nose.I thought the casting was excellent for the most part. Though Agnes Moorehead from the original animated version absolutely bowls Oprah Winfrey over as the goose and Julia Roberts' voice was maybe a bit too matteroffact for Charlotte. Debbie Reynolds' extrasweet voice did I think a justsoslightly better job in the original. That aside Miss Fanning is perfect as Fern and Siobhan Fallon could not play the incredulous Mrs. Zuckerman one iota better.I think E.B. White would be pleased. This is as honest a representation of his wonderful story as anyone could hope for.If you have small kids read them the book and then go see the movie.If you read the book as a kid and still smile when you think about it then go see it yourself.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had initial hesitation in deciding whether to watch this movie  not because it features a talking pig ala Babe but probably because if rumour has you believe that viewers will swear off pork. They look so cute that you would not imagine them being on your dinner table ever after. I've read the book when I was a kid but heck I can't remember much of the details beyond the friendship between spider and pig.Wilbur the piglet's destiny is set from birth  being the odd one out without access to its mother's teat he's earmarked for immediate transformation to pork but the intervention of a young girl Fern Dakota Fanning helped prevent it albeit for a little while. Put in a barn with the other animals Wilbur is in desperate need of friendship to wilt away his loneliness but given the indifferent attitudes amongst the resident animals he gets a none too friendly introduction to farm life. That is until he meets Charlotte a spider who will try help to extend the lifespan of Wilbur saving the spring pig from becoming Christmas ham.It's a story about friendship and the miracles gained from trust help and the fulfilling of promises. And this movie gets a huge boost through its Alist voice talents with the likes of check this out  Julia Roberts as Charlotte Steve Buscemi as Templeton the selfish rat John Cleese as Sam Sheep leader of the pack of sheep followers played to hilarity Katy Bates Cedric the Entertainer Oprah Winfrey Robert Redford Thomas Haden Church Andre Benjamin and Sam Shepard. They seemed to have a riproaring time and I thought Julia Roberts' Charlotte came across as extremely calm and collected while probably the character with the best lines was Templeton the rat.Fanning already got experience playing opposite her animal counterparts like in Dreamer earlier this year though this time in the barnyard the animals are enhanced by technology and graphics. Her role however is limited in screen time and although there are hints on puppy love it's very much unexplored in depth as the focus is squarely on our animal friends. The score is an unrecognizable Danny Elfman contribution without the dark overtones and the songs played during the animated stills of the end credits do sound radio friendly enough to warrant airplay.Charlotte's Web is a feel good heartwarming family movie which is suitable for this holiday season. It is uncomplicated and has a simple message but is engaging enough for both children and adults. A warning though the movie is poignant yet hopeful so to sentimental folks a tissue or two will help.".

This movie is very well done both in terms of money spent but also in the time and quality taken. The story moves along nicely never dragging and the emotions are never overwhelming. I do have to say that I missed Henry Gibson as the voice of Wilbur but that was a personal bias the young actor who voiced Wilbur did a good job. My sons found many things to laugh at and the darker moments not wanting to spoil anything for anyone who does not know the storyare handled deftly so sensitive children will not get upset. An excellent family movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on November 13th 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.There is a lot of responsibility to be taken on when you put an E.B. White classic book to film. There is even more responsibility when there is already a wonderful and popular animation video of the book available. But this film takes on this responsibility in spectacular fashion. Half live animal animation as in Babe and half live action the film is stunningly made.The story is about the runt of a pig litter. There are ten teats available and eleven piglets. The eleventh piglet is doomed to be destroyed until the farmer's daughter Dakota Fanning saves and adopts the runt who is named Wilbur.Finally the piglet Wilbur gets to be too big to be a pet in the house and is sent across the road to another farm. The farm animals and Wilbur become humanized as we understand their animal talk. Five 5 goats two 2 cows two 2 geese one 1 horse one 1 rat and one 1 spider become a microcosm of society and Wilbur's family and friends and neighbors.It sounds preposterous but it is utterly believable because the special effects are so good it all seems real and your disbelief disappears so you can get lost in the story. And  what a story.Wilbur slowly realizes that he is an animal raised for his meat and the end of his life is months away and he is disconcerted to say the least. But he has a friend determined to help him out  a spider named Charlotte voice by Julia Roberts who will try many things to keep Wilbur as a permanent farm animal and not just food on the table for the farm family.The society of animals have many lessons to teach children and adults specifically friendship sacrifice living with the death issue hope determination love duty fairness respect humility and much more.However this is not a heavy lesson on mature life issues. Laughter and joy permeate the film and puns and chuckles are everywhere throughout the film.The artistry of the film is outstanding. The farms and surroundings are idyllic. The synchronizing of the words and animal movements are right on. Everything on the screen leads you to believe the story is real.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlotte's Web based on the book by E.B. White directed by Gary Winick film story by Earl Hamner Jr. and screenplay by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick is a heart warming story of friendship loyalty and acceptance. When a runt pig is born a little girl Fern talks her father out of slaughtering the pig. Fern played by Dakota Fanning raises the pig Wilbur by hand until the pig is too large to stay in the house. She takes Wilbur voice by Dominic Scott Kay to live with her uncle. It is only after Wilbur goes to live with her uncle that Fern realizes that her pig will be slaughtered for Christmas dinner. In the barn where Wilbur goes to live there is a collection of funny and uptight animal characters. Each character's voice is provided by a recognizable familiar voice. Samuel the sheep voice by John Cleese is the uptight leader of the sheep and occasionally provider of sage advice. Steve Buscemi provides his voice for the mischievous and selfminded Templeton the Rat. Expecting geese parents Gussy and Golly Goose whose voices are provided by Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer. Bitsey Kahty Bates and Betsy Reba McEntire cows provide the physical and fart humor for the movie. Wilbur is not so delicately informed by Templeton that he will be slaughtered. This sends Wilbur into an emotional downspiral. Luckily for him he makes a new friend Charlotte the Spider who promises to find a way to keep him from being slaughtered. Taking her promise seriously Charlotte spins a series of webs that have the words Radiant and Some Pig to draw attention to how special Wilbur truly is. Julia Roberts was a wonderful cast for Charlotte. Her soft sweet voice effectivelyembodies the spirit of E.B. White's character. Charlotte's cool headand confident demeanor give hope to the barn and most importantly Wilbur. Roberts does a great job at making Charlotte a constant and level character. Charlotte was completely animated. The computer animation wasn't anything to sneeze at nor was it anything to praise.There were several scenes where Charlotte looks to be the size of or larger that of a tarantula. There are other times when she doesn't seem to be a daddy long legs. Still the animators did a good job of making her feel like a character rich with emotion. I'm sure it was a challenge to make a spider both realistic and emotional. Dakota Fanning was adorable in the movie. I was disappointed because at times her acting was inconsistent and strained. Still there is a reason why she is one of the most desired child actors in Hollywood. The problem with having voices done by celebrities is you spend so much of your time seeing their faces instead of the character that it can be a little confusing. Can you imagine a movie where Julia Roberts is put in a jar by a little boy as Cedric the Entertainer and Oprah Winfrey stand by and watch? It gets even worse when you associate a voice to a character. One of the crows is played by Thomas Haden Church. Church used to play the airplane mechanic on Wings. During the extremely funny scenes with the crows all I could see was the mechanic on Wings.  While I think you should defiantly have a recognizable voice in your film if you do too many it's distracting. Even though I was distracted by the different voices occasionally I was generally lost in the story. I was in a theater with several small children and most of them made it though the movie with out yelling fussing or getting bored. Either they were the best behaved children ever or they were truly enjoying the movie. I knew how the story was going to end I started to cry when it actually happened. I don't think this movie is the end all be all of what Charlotte's Web could be. I think it will do just fine until a better one comes out. Don't be afraid to take your children they'll love it!".

Although the movie boosts a heavyweight cast of Oprah Winfrey Kathy Bates and Cedric the Entertainer it was Academy Award Winner Julia Roberts who breathes in life into Charlotte with maturity and genuineness.Pardon me but I never found Dakota Fanning cute or sweet in any way. She was really quite irritating in War of the Worlds. Perhaps she is too mature and smart for her age and thus somebody younger and more innocent may be suitable for the role of Fern.Children of all ages should be thrilled by talking animals and a charming storyline by E.B. White. This is a moving story to teach them about life and death trust and friendship. Adults may be a little impatient at the bland storytelling and most would have already known the ending.The final scene will still tug heart strings and do bring your Kleenex.

	schema:headline " Take the Kids Read the Book";
	schema:reviewBody "I have for years adored the book Charlotte's Web. As a parent of two children I was happy to own the 1973 animated version of this book which I believe was a splendid adaptation of the book.I was somewhat apprehensive about taking my children to see this movie because I was afraid that it would be so different from the animated film that they already knew by heart and loved I feared that my children would immediately have a disdain for this new version.I was pleasantly surprised. My seven year old and four year old both laughed sat at the edge of their seats and yes cried with the movie. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. There was enough subtle adult humor that I laughed at which my children did not get.However as brilliant as Steve Buscemi's narration was I was sorely disappointed with Julia Roberts performance.Charlotte is a loving wise spider almost a foster parent to Wilbur. I found Ms. Robert's narration dull humdrum and frankly tedious. I could actually visualize her reading her lines into the microphone her hands and body moving slightly with the flowing of her words ... all the while Ms. Roberts was counting the dollars in her mind that she would collect for this job. It sounded like she was simply doing her job and frankly with little or no conviction compassion or empathy.Perhaps Ms. Roberts reading of children's stories would be best left to those times with her own children. Not to paying audiences.The animation was very good impressive most of the time. Steve Buscemi as Templeton is definitely a fine performance Dakota Fanning will continue to capture America's heart for many years to come.I wish that I could rate the movie higher because it was a fine adaptation of the book. However Julia Roberts performance was so disappointing that I cringe to think of her ever narrating another animated character.Take your children they will love it. Just try to ignore Ms. Roberts.".

As a parent of two children I was happy to own the 1973 animated version of this book which I believe was a splendid adaptation of the book.I was somewhat apprehensive about taking my children to see this movie because I was afraid that it would be so different from the animated film that they already knew by heart and loved I feared that my children would immediately have a disdain for this new version.I was pleasantly surprised. My seven year old and four year old both laughed sat at the edge of their seats and yes cried with the movie. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. There was enough subtle adult humor that I laughed at which my children did not get.However as brilliant as Steve Buscemi's narration was I was sorely disappointed with Julia Roberts performance.Charlotte is a loving wise spider almost a foster parent to Wilbur.

The farmer gets his ax and selects the runt of the litter when he is stopped by his daughter Fern Dakota Fanning. Fern begins to feed her new piglet and names him Wilbur voice of Dominic Scott Kay.

There is only one problem that Wilbur doesn't know he is a spring pig and they don't usually get to see winter. Charlotte promises Wilbur that she will do something to save his life. Charlotte spins the words some pig in her web to show the farmer a miracle that may save Wilbur's life.My Comment This classic story teaches the values of friendship trust and sacrifice that unites an assortment of creatures for a common cause. The pig is so cute that you would love to play with him. We get to hear the animals talk and they become kind of human to the audience. Julia Roberts' voice is enchanting and so motherly that she could get you to do anything. It may be hard to believe but the CG special effects are so good and look so real that you begin to think that it is normal for the animals to talk. You even begin to lose yourself into the story and look at the movie as a band of talking animals bonding together like a family to save Wilbur. The film will make you laugh and cry but I think the best things it teaches are the many values and lessons of life especially to children. Dakota Fanning's acting was just excellent. It may be a clich but this is one tender children's movie that the whole family will love. I loved it and I actually shed tears at the end. Paramount Pictures Run time 137 Rated G1010".

Templeton and Wilbur were the best characters but Julia Roberts' Charlotte was extremely flat an unappealing. I would have preferred if she had tried to find her own voice instead of trying to mimic the original film. Dakota Fanning was adorable and terribly underused. There was no relationship between she and Wilbur after the webs appeared. She simply became background. The worst thing about the film was the overall message. Even my 7 year old said Gee I guess if you can't get a medal on that farm you just get eaten.. Yep. That's pretty much it. Outside of the lovely animation I was terribly disappointed. And so was my family. Give this one a miss and rent the original instead. Or better yet... read the book.".

Another year's installment of flowers leaves nightingales thrushes finches and such ephemeral creatures took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles. Thomas Hardy Tess of the D'Urbervilles The Mainefarm is idealized almost as if there were no smells from farting cows or slops to muddy the barn. But in the new Charlotte's Web both are sweetly displayed in a still pristine world where a pig wins your heart and a spider is all heart. Welcome to old time filmmaking that updates itself with CGassisted animatronics and pretty people dragged off the pages of a children's story book.This new version also standing proudly next to the successful first Babe is refreshing with an absence of sardonic pop culture references prevalent today in children's films. Just a solid classic where a lovely spider named Charlotte the voice of Julia Roberts   maybe her best work yet! saves a lovable spring runtofthelitter piglet named Wilbur Dominic Scott Kay from the smokehouse by relying on an arsenal of words.As has always been the case with the 1952 E.B. White classic adults can enjoy the story given the allegorical levels of meaning that jump out like Rat Steve Buscemi out of his extravagant hole. On one level Charlotte's Web is about promises kept as the spider fulfills her promise to Wilbur despite the sacrifice she will have to make. On another level it is about the cycles of life that include the glory of birth and the inevitability of death. White and Winick don't hammer the lessons home they gently portray them as if we were listening to a song about every season having its turn.As Charlotte searches for the right words to save Wilbur another level of the allegory is the necessity to be educated if you want to be a surviving productive being. This film together with the wordheavy History Boys has renewed my enthusiasm for satisfying holiday fare.".

The film is beautifully shot with lovely photography and stunning locations and the music is gorgeous. Of course the script isn't as sharp as it could have been but that is a minor criticism compared to how wonderful this was. Dakota Fanning gets better and better every time I see her what a very talented child actress she is! Wilbur was just adorable even more adorable than he was in the animated film. And the voice acting is top notch Julia Roberts being the biggest surprise in a very warm vocal performance as Charlotte. John Cleese and Thomas Haden Church are sterling in their roles as the sheep and the crow but other than Roberts the real standout is Steve Buschemi as the hilarious Templeton. All in all lovely to watch definitely memorable and cute not as good as the book but well worth the watch. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " This Little Piggy...";
	schema:reviewBody "Babe reinvented the talking animal movie by using what seemed at the time cutting edge effects to give the appearance that animals could talk just as much as any human could. It was a delightful fable of many charms. Such success never goes unnoticed by Hollywood and Babe opened a floodgate of similar talking animal movies.While technically on a par most of these have failed to repeat the things that Babe did so well. What these imitators never understood about Babe was that it wasn't merely a special effects show. It was also a timeless story about clear delineated characters we cared for it had an involving plot and a genuine magic.These other films by comparison let loose a litany of popculture gags animal flatulence and an all too familiar monotony. In the field Babe was and still is the first and last word on the subject.And so that brings us to Charlotte's Web based on the classic children's book by EB White and a perfect stablemate to The SheepPig. Thankfully the film doesn't fall into the same company as Racing Stripes a perfect example of how not to make a talking animal movie. But neither is it in the same league as Babe by a very wide margin.The story is so familiar that I really don't see the need to go into detail about it. Everything has been faithfully rendered. Wilbur the Pig Charlotte the Spider Templeton the Rat and Fern the Girl Dakota Fanning.And certainly the film starts well Wilbur as a runt can't get any milk from his mother because all the other piglets are bigger than him Fern saving Wilbur from the axe bottlefeeding him taking him to school pushing him in a pram etc. This all evinces a genuine affection for the character. For a time it seems like Charlotte's Web is on the same wavelength as Babe.But ironically what kills the film stonedead is the very thing that made Babe so magical. Once the animals start talking the novelty it once had has worn off. The effect has become blas by now. There was something so natural to the first ten minutes where Fern and Wilbur's budding friendship was warm and genuine and not at all false and artificial.But as soon as the voiceovers come into the film Sam Shepard's narration is an especial irritation it felt to me like Charlotte's Web was constantly nudging me to feel emotions at any given time. Practically underscoring every dramatic point with a bludgeoning heavy hand.I can't say that's a surprise when the director is Gary Winick. Winick got off to a promising start with Tadpole an insightful coming of ager. But he soon gravitated to throwaway fluff like 13 Going On 30 Charlotte's Web and the later likes of Bride Wars and Letters to Juliet before a sudden death of brain cancer. Tadpole was the one shining light in an otherwise undistinguished career where the success of that film must have been more to the script and the performers than anything on Winick's part.All of Winick's typical shortcomings are present and correct on Charlotte's Web where he feels the need to spell everything out to an audience in broad brushstrokes. The crucial failing of the film is that Winick lacks faith in the story's ability to tell itself. To see how it should be done look no further than the 1973 version from HannaBarbara where they got the essence of EB White's writing down perfectly. They managed to impart the same messages without having to lecture on anything.Winick assumed he was a director of many faces. Coming of agers. Children's films. Romcoms. But he was just a onetrick pony who put talented actresses like Jennifer Garner Dakota Fanning Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried at the mercies of disposable material they were clearly uncomfortable with.The biggest crime of the film is Winick lets an immensely gifted child actress like Dakota Fanning go to waste. As the plot progresses he does very little with her and allows her to fall by the wayside. She becomes less important to the film and her relationship with a farmboy never connects.The special effects are as good as you'd expect. Wilbur Charlotte and Templeton all look and move with conviction. I barely saw the joins but its a more gimmicky film than Babe. Babe used effects as a means and not the end. Charlotte's Web is constantly in your face with dazzling CGI shots of Wilbur backflipping or Templeton scrounging through the maze of his rathole. It really becomes quite tiring.The fact that its a Walden Media production also says something about the film. Aside from Bridge to Terabithia and City of Ember Walden's trackrecord has been banal at best. Charlotte's Web fits in nicely with they're productionline family fare with a vaguely Christian agenda. What else are you supposed to think when a film has the tagline Help Is Coming From Above This Christmas.With so many talented performers Charlotte's Web is a real disappointment. There are no jivetalking animals and endless film references so its more tolerable than most talking animal movies but unlike Babe this little piggy should have stayed home.".

Tadpole was the one shining light in an otherwise undistinguished career where the success of that film must have been more to the script and the performers than anything on Winick's part.All of Winick's typical shortcomings are present and correct on Charlotte's Web where he feels the need to spell everything out to an audience in broad brushstrokes. The crucial failing of the film is that Winick lacks faith in the story's ability to tell itself. To see how it should be done look no further than the 1973 version from HannaBarbara where they got the essence of EB White's writing down perfectly. They managed to impart the same messages without having to lecture on anything.Winick assumed he was a director of many faces. Coming of agers. Children's films. Romcoms. But he was just a onetrick pony who put talented actresses like Jennifer Garner Dakota Fanning Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried at the mercies of disposable material they were clearly uncomfortable with.The biggest crime of the film is Winick lets an immensely gifted child actress like Dakota Fanning go to waste. As the plot progresses he does very little with her and allows her to fall by the wayside. She becomes less important to the film and her relationship with a farmboy never connects.The special effects are as good as you'd expect. Wilbur Charlotte and Templeton all look and move with conviction. I barely saw the joins but its a more gimmicky film than Babe. Babe used effects as a means and not the end. Charlotte's Web is constantly in your face with dazzling CGI shots of Wilbur backflipping or Templeton scrounging through the maze of his rathole. It really becomes quite tiring.The fact that its a Walden Media production also says something about the film. Aside from Bridge to Terabithia and City of Ember Walden's trackrecord has been banal at best. Charlotte's Web fits in nicely with they're productionline family fare with a vaguely Christian agenda. What else are you supposed to think when a film has the tagline Help Is Coming From Above This Christmas.With so many talented performers Charlotte's Web is a real disappointment. There are no jivetalking animals and endless film references so its more tolerable than most talking animal movies but unlike Babe this little piggy should have stayed home.";

The voice characters are very good funny the setting was very well done also perfect buildings and location. Dakota Fanning was a perfect fit as well as Emma Davis as the mother. No objectionable material or cussing very nice for todays movies. The character picked for the uncle and his family were just spot on. Movie holds true to story line of E. B.

	schema:reviewBody "21 is definitely the major film for the spring time it has young hot actors including an incredible academy award winner Kevin Spacey and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie a decent plot over all a good combination of actors and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed I think this movie was more for the teenagers with the actors and the rating I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with clich'd characters. Kevin Spacey seriously my favorite actor he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot upcomer Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs 300000 for Harvard Med. School he's extremely gifted with numbers so when his professor Micky Rosa notices his gifts he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school but of course when he gets so hot he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.Now 21 has decent enough acting the movie itself is decent I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up I seriously doubt that would happen for real but for the movie they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes clubbing drinking etc. 21 is worth the watch but to be honest if you're reading this wait for the rental it's just a regular rise and fall story.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this factbased story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell Jim Sturgess who along with his brainy Ivy League chums travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor Micky Rosa Kevin Spacey leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process the shy cautious Ben who only wants the money for tuition costs morphs into his alter ego a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely then alternates between fastpaced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend fellow conspirator Jill Kate Bosworth talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip and contains minimal tech jargon. Variable change is one such math term and it has thematic implications toward the end as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And winner winner chicken dinner is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish this is a big budget film. Color cinematography by DP Russell Carpenter is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and closeups. The best parts of the film are the closeups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is allaround good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still the script is credible and stays close to its book source Bringing Down The House by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism 21 is a terrific film one that has greater import than other films because the events in 21 really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before making a movie about blackjack and card counting it would have been a good idea to read some of hundreds of books on this subject available in any major bookstore. That would have prevented the creators of this movie to look like a bunch of ignorant fools totally lacking even general knowledge of the game of blackjack card counting and casino's countermeasures. Here is why1. Nowadays blackjack is played with 468 deck shoes cut in the middle or 23 at best which makes the player's edge if any so small that making any profit is mathematically possible only in the long run. It means that no matter how favourable the count is you chances of winning a particular hand are increased by such a small percentage that before making any profit you may be losing many hands and even suffer substantial financial losses. Only if you are ready for losing streaks in the process and patient and if you don't make mistakes with count and basic strategy you may be winning in the long run. Coming to Vegas for a weekend and making fortune by winning all the time is an absolute nonsense.2. To prevent card counters from making money casino's security personnel do not abduct them in the middle of a crowded casino torture them in the back office and take away their winnings  casinos simply ban card counters. Casinos in the US are legally private clubs they don't charge admission fee and it's up to them to decide who will be allowed to enter the club. Since card counting is not illegal it's just a skill nor casino security nor law enforcement can arrest anybody for it without serious consequences like losing casino license and possibly serving jail time. Not all casinos ban card counters but those which don't changed blackjack rules to the degree that card counting would not overcome house edge.3. Besides blackjack related issues a person who keeps more than 300 grand cash in his dorm room can only be seen as a complete idiot. Obviously depositing this money in a bank account in the US could have caused problems with IRS money laundering regulations etc. but renting a bank safe deposit box could have solved the problem altogether. The image of a brilliant MIT student acting like a retard doesn't make any sense and makes me question the intellectual level of the screenplay writers.Conclusion stay away from this movie  don't degrade yourself by watching it.".

Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few hamfisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. 21 would have been great ten years ago give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters and the underused Jacob Pitts who helps recruit Ben into the group.21 does well to show the allnightlong decadence of Vegas and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night.

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold it should come as no surprise that 21 a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student Sturgess's desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However this opening proves overlong overly predictable and largely unnecessary dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing clearing away such unnecessary subplots such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the Hollywoodizing of the MIT team with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas and once the film gets going it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the troubled but well meaning hero archetype. As one might expect Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However fans of similar works will not be disappointed and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity 21 should prove an ideal watch.710".

I'm kind of glad that there was an Asian guy and girl that didn't really fit the typical Asian stereotype...Expect for the Asian guy being really cheap..but I laughed at that...because I'm Asian myself and I'm cheap along with my family x.

	schema:headline " 21 A Bad Shuffle of a Superb Nonfiction Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's bestselling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with 3 million card counting at various casinos around the country beginning in the early nineties.The movie makers have constructed a halfbaked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21 the movieseems bent on helping casino ecurity Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos at least at times it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.In the book the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes Casinos spread the story that once multidecks were placed in shoes card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact multidecks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.In the film Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. MickeySpacey the crew leader and organizer is not an MIT prof but a professional gambler.The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make 300000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey Spacey fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact though there was some minor bad blood after the split it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.In the book the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table was so blatantly obvious no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell Jim Sturges was supposed to have been halfenticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor Kate Bosworth. But the romance seemed halfhearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writerdirector like Dave Mamet. The film was marekt designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs but the rest of the audience stayed silent.The Filmmakers who are not worth mentioning destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are three kinds of bad movies. The kind that you'll see for free on HBO or the like if you're bored enough the kind that are so bad they're actually funny and worth the occasional viewing and then the kind that you never want to see again. 21 is the latter. And the only reason it got a two instead of a one was Kevin Spacey since he was the only interesting part of the whole movie.You know those movies that leave you with the feeling of thank god that's over? Well 21 goes above and beyond in terms of bad moviedom and found a way to rob us of that nice warm and lovely feeling of accomplishment for managing to sit through the whole thing. Among the incredibly numerous clich's in this film you find the hero of course getting everything he ever wanted in life at the end yet for some reason the director decided to play You Can't Always Get What You Want during the wrap up portion and credits of the movie. Now I am all for movies that make you think and have a big message at the end but playing You Can't Always Get What You Want while the main character is going over in detail how he did get everything he wanted is like saying violence is bad while shooting someone repeatedly in the head it just doesn't work.There was one thing I will give the movie. It's predictable. I love the comfortable feeling of knowing that I will be able to predict the course of each and every scene two seconds in to them. I can't stand it when the scene where the main character becomes estranged from his best friends due to varying reasons depending on the movie that are usually incredibly childish springs on me from left field especially when its followed by the scene showing him losing his cool and doing something stupid I hate seeing that coming! And I wouldn't have been so touched by his mom offering him 68000.00 dollars to pay for college if it hadn't been painfully obvious she was about to do so. And of course who would want to not know without even having to think that he was going to refuse the money and make up a lie about why he was because he was ashamed of himself? Because of course no one likes original work we need more clichs damn it! More story arcs and more recycled characters we all have seen god knows how many times!! I will cease this ragging after I bring up one more point. At the end surprise surprise there is a case scene of the main characters running away from the casino security. SPOILERS the main character Ben gives the bag of chips to Spacey's character and split up to ditch the guards. Later Spacey opens the bag and its all fake chips and they justify this by showing Ben and his girlfriend Jill switching bags but the problem with that is simple there was no time. From the moment that Ben had the bag to the point he gave it to Kevin he was with Kevin every step of the way and the shot of the switch they're in a bathroom or some kind of hall calm and taking their time. It again just doesn't work.I'll admit I didn't have the highest hopes ever for the movie but I had expected it to be better then this. Just keep this in mind if you're thinking about seeing 21 you have seen this movie. You have seen it many times with many different names. But you have in fact seen it. I promise you.".

I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and reedit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films".

	schema:headline " Slick Entertaining But Far From Reality";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people led by the smartest of the all the group the only veteran in this college agedominated cast Professor Mickey Rosa played by Kevin Spacey. Well Rosa would not do what he did here for starters meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revengeseeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade  Ben Campbell Jim Sturgess  either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.There are a bunch of other holes too such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen hand signals that a junior detective could see and are never changed! and  maybe the worst  winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session because it draws attention. You win a little here a little there and go from placetoplace and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life  not what you see here.Still facts aside it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films it succeeds and I still give it an 8 star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.Oh as a postscript they don't beat up card counters in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards which I don't believe is illegal they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture there are security people everywhere and you aren't allowed back.So enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "21 is one of those movies where if you are only looking for an investment where all the dollar value was put into the visual presentation and not a dime was spent on the story it's right up your alley. If you like movies that are eyerolling in their idiocy but make up for it with ohsopopular clichs it will suit you as it did the majority of my generation. But if you are like me where you realize that the story and the integrity of a picture is most important then 21 is nothing but sheer boredom. Just as a measure of my ennui I didn't have high expectations but I looked at my watch for the first time at the fortyfive minute mark. And my eyes shot back there every ten minutes for the remaining onepointtwofive remaining hours of the film before the credits finally rolled and I unleashed a big sigh of relief. The torture was over.21 is also one of those movies that assumes that just because it's based on a true story that it's automatically going to be gripping. Well documentaries are the same and I've seen some documentaries that were flatout boring as well. It all depends on the quality. And in terms of its visual presentation 21 works. But where it really counts in the story in the characters in the timing it falls before it even takes off. It's about a Harvard professor Kevin Spacey who enlists the top students in his classes to travel to Vegas for the weekends to count cards at the casinos and make millions. The latest recruit is a stereotypical dweeb wellplayed by Jim Sturgess who needs money to pay for tuition. And what follows is just one tired old clich after another.There was hardly a moment in 21 that I could not predict. It's just the standard rise and fall story with the same old morals about pride and greed. Once again we have the dweeb with talent but no money. Things go well at first then he goes over his head things go bad his hot girlfriend gets ticked off at him so on and so forth. I knew right off the bat the sort of mentorstudent relationship that Spacey and Sturgess would have. I knew that Sturgess would have a pretty girl Kate Bosworth smiling at him from the corner of the screen. I knew there would be a moment where somebody just blows it andwell you get my point.Most premises even clichd premises can work out if they are done right. But 21 is not done right. The look of the picture is good the directing is acceptable the acting is quite good but the story the characters the energy of the picture the believability it all just goes out the window or should I say into the card dealer's pocket. And it's our money they're snatching unfairly away from us. It's got the look of a professional picture but is just as fun as watching a gambler's home videos. 21 is not a worthy investment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is based on so I went in with no preconceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie it was definitely worth a night at the movies however I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes I know it's just a movie but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over 300000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all he won it gambling in Vegas where gambling is legal hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account or better yet a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do drop 300000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet they stayed in suites walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission because again he hadn't done anything illegal and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for 68000 for medical school telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate huh? Again the main character hasn't done anything illegal other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room OK so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas if your trying to get away with counting why would you go back to the same one the Hardrock again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again I did enjoy the movie but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were in the end kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence.".

The characters throughout the movie are visiting a variety of casinos in Las Vegas. All kinds of different casinos on the strip and some of the casinos that are nowhere near the strip such as the Red Rock Casino. However no matter where they go Lawernce Fishburn's character is watching them and happens to be at the casino they are in no matter when they are there. How did he magically transport himself around the entire Las Vegas valley like that? It was really obvious that the movie makers did not take this into consideration. They just expect you to believe the Fishburns character is inside every casino at all times.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the geographic setting of the casinos. I live in Vegas so I know that the Hard Rock casino is NOT located on the strip as it was depicted in the movie.Anyway this movie sucked I hated it and I wish I had not wasted my time seeing it. So take my advice and go see a different movie. Hopefully one that has a decent plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many movies in the modern era have experimented with fractured chronology but most of the time this technique is used for entertainment purposes only. 21 Grams is an intense and thoughtful film enriched by this technique taken to an extreme I've never seen before. We're not talking Pulp Fiction here where a small series of vignettes are arranged out of sequence. Every individual scene in 21 Grams seems to be distributed almost at random anywhere in the film. You have to concentrate when seeing this film for the first time because you'll have trouble figuring out what's going on and even as a plot starts to emerge some of the details won't be understandable until the very end. But it pays off this isn't like Memento or Mulholland Drive where you may need multiple viewings to understand it all. By the end of this film the story turns out to be quite straightforward. It's like seeing a gigantic jigsaw puzzle gradually pieced together.Unlike many other films that use this sort of device 21 Grams is a character drama not a psychological thriller. The story would still work if it were told in chronological order. Why the scenes are arranged as they are is not altogether clear on the surface. I felt like I was watching a mystery but after everything came together it became evident that none of the mystery was contained in the plot itself. This fact has led some critics to suggest that the scrambled scene arrangement is nothing more than a cute gimmick designed to make the film more engaging. But I believe that the device does serve a legitimate purpose by drawing out the complexity of the characters and their situations.Life is not good for the three principal characters and it isn't getting better. Sean Penn plays a 40something man with a failing heart Naomi Watts plays a young woman facing great tragedy and Benicio Del Toro plays an excon consumed by guilt. Penn and Watts come off as ordinary individuals reacting as anyone might under the circumstances but Del Toro's character is particularly fascinating. He's been rehabilitated through religion but he's still far from perfect. As a father he has a scary presence that makes him seem borderline abusive at times. But he has developed a powerful conscience. Is he right to hate himself for what he did? The movie never answers that question. I just appreciated that the film resisted the temptation to make him into a caricature. He is neither hero nor villain. He is simply understandable on a very basic human level as are the other two characters.We have the feeling that Watts and Penn are wrong to condemn him as strongly as they do. They do not understand his situation or that he's suffering just about as much as they are. On the other hand we as viewers can perfectly understand where Watts is coming from. That's what makes the scrambled scene arrangement so effective it never allows any one character to gain our total sympathy. By the time we've sorted out the plot threads we've identified with all three characters on an emotional level while at the same time understanding their faults. These people are trapped in their own limited worlds and with our omniscient viewpoint we can scarcely blame any one of them for their feelings or actions. We can see clearly what these characters cannot which is that they are more victims of cruel fate than people who are truly guilty of anything.What is the movie's message? That people shouldn't be so quick to judge others? That could be one interpretation but what's nice about the film is that it doesn't hammer this lesson into us. It just tells a moving and stirring tale about complex characters and viewers can take from it what they please. The title refers to a parapsychological belief about the weight of the human soul and it's used in this film as a metaphor for the fragility of life. If life is fragile then it's also precious and people need not waste their time on vengeance.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie directed in inimitable style Inarritu's 21 Grams is a provocative deeply moving filmic work that explores several fundamental questions What is a life what is its value and can we place a value on it? Directed in a series of small seemingly disconnected fragments that come together as the film progresses the film is thus shot in a style deeply unfamiliar to American moviegoers. At the beginning most American viewers will find the choppy nonlinear timeline distracting and frustrating  a cinematic form of coitus interruptus where once on the verge of revealing an underlying plot concept the fragment abruptly stops and is picked up at an unrelated point. This style continues throughout but don't worry. The answers do come after a while.It is worth noting that the actual storyline when told linearly is not as gripping as when told in this style. The linear form would resemble a typical mindless story of the wounded seeking revenge. The way Inarritu constructs the story allows him to give the viewer a sense of where various characters are at the same time without the appearance of repetition. It allows moviegoers to see actual events first then form associations later. There is a sense of Oh now I get it! that would be conspicuously absent if 21 Grams were told linearly.Moving on the performances of the actors and actresses in the film are incredible. All are believable. The animalistic hatred of Christina Peck Naomi Watts for Jack Jordan Benicio Del Toro the deeply troubled father who regrets his big mistake and has become a born again Christian is palpable throughout. Paul Rivers Sean Penn is genuine in his efforts to repay literally a life debt. The performances breathe further life into the series of events that 21 Grams attempts to chronicle.By the film's ending the entire tale of what has transpired is revealed to the viewer. Since key plot elements often appear in several of the disconnected sequences they come to be points of reference that astute moviegoers can use to sort the rest of the plot. By the end everything is complete. The title is finally put into context and the attempt to answer the three previously mentioned fundamental questions is made. Yes at the beginning this movie may not seem to make much sense and it may even be frustrating to watch. Still resist the temptation to get up and leave the theater. Stick around and watch the whole thing. The pieces do ultimately fall into place. I promise. And besides there's only one way to find out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm actually the opposite of a drama fan but this movie really touched me and although it's quite tough to take in I loved it.I think above all one has to bow to Guillermo Arriaga the writer as 21 Grams features probably the best script I've ever seen. I guess the story itself is not that new but the way how it's done is simply excellent. The first say 30 minutes are just scraps moments in the lives of the three main characters that mean absolutely nothing to the viewer yet. Adding to that initial confusion is the fact that these scraps are not in temporal order so that in the beginning personally I wasn't sure I'd be able to follow it was more like a music video that's just not making any sense at all. But then the pieces begin to come together just beautifully until in the end you can see the whole picture. Usually in these episode movies everything comes together at once somewhere in the middle of the film but in 21 Grams the viewer puts the pieces together one after another like a jigsaw puzzle and every bit as satisfying when everything's completed. This truly is a masterpiece scriptwise and I've never seen anything like it.That brilliant script is supported by excellent actors. Sean Penn Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are delivering the most convincing acting performance I've ever witnessed. Like when Christina Watts screams at Paul Penn trying to get rid of all of her anger frustration grief and hate I usually think these emotional outbursts don't seem real on screen but in this movie it is just deeply touching. I haven't seen Mystic River yet but if Sean Penn was as good as he is in 21 Grams then the Oscar finally really went to someone who truly deserved it. And Benicio del Toro really is every inch the wonderful actor his reputation claims I saw him for the first time but had heard a lot of him before so I was very curious.Finally thank you Mr. Inrritu for putting everything together this nicely. You've made a very impressing 100  quality movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "'21 Grams' tells of a number of loosely interlinked characters in an achronological fashion jumping backwards and forwards over their stories. There can be reasons for doing this for example to reveal the plot in a way that offers an extra kick or to enable the plot to conclude with a scene from the middle of the story that gains impact from the viewer's prior acquaintance with what happens next. Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' justified its own complex plot structure on both of these grounds. But in the case of this film I couldn't see how telling the story in such a broken way was supposed to add anything and the fact that most of the leading characters possess a death wish or at least very little will to go on living hardly aided my emotional involvement. At times the film appeared to be shaping into a story about the possibility or otherwise of redemption but it never quite grew into anything more the harrowing tale of a number of people who suffer and in some cases die. The pretentious voiceover from Sean Penn's character that ends the film and accounts for its title felt to me like a desperate and failed attempt to inject some meaning into a movie strangely devoid of it.That said the acting is good and the film is undoubtedly skilfully made. But people die is not in itself an adequate or interesting unifying theme.".

But in the case of this film I couldn't see how telling the story in such a broken way was supposed to add anything and the fact that most of the leading characters possess a death wish or at least very little will to go on living hardly aided my emotional involvement. At times the film appeared to be shaping into a story about the possibility or otherwise of redemption but it never quite grew into anything more the harrowing tale of a number of people who suffer and in some cases die. The pretentious voiceover from Sean Penn's character that ends the film and accounts for its title felt to me like a desperate and failed attempt to inject some meaning into a movie strangely devoid of it.That said the acting is good and the film is undoubtedly skilfully made. But people die is not in itself an adequate or interesting unifying theme.";

Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu he gives the audience the puzzle unraveled demanding that we piece together the story from interlaced past present and future events.  It is part flashy gimmick part artistic mastery but always compelling.This is not a film for either the faint of heart or lazy of mind.  Nor is it for those who become frustrated by film that dares to step outside the linear plot and paintbynumbers formula.  The mishmash of pastpresentfuture is allegorical in the sense that we all carry our past all hinge our hearts on the future and all struggle with a present' as dotty and haunted as this film so wildly illustrates.In 21 Grams' it is required that the viewer surrender.  As in life there is no control.  I must admit that I became a bit antsy and pressed for answers when none were being provided.  You are riveted by events and players that intermingle in a haphazard mishmash of time with a rebellious lack of structure.  You can either go with the flowor back out to your car. Since I saw only one person exit the theater for any reason in the 125 minutes running time I conclude that the fully occupied theater was as riveted as I was even to the point of extreme bladder control.The performances are stunning.  Sean Penn is always good Benicio Del Toro solidifies his Oscar and Naomi Watts is the big talent to watch.  Her emotional honesty is beyond actingI believed her to feel the pain she displayed.The plot' almost seems inconsequential.  The film is about the depth of human feeling in our brief interplay between living and dying.  It's about damnation and redemption revenge and forgiveness surrender and salvation. It offers no explanations.  It merely illustrates the human experience in a trenchant manner that makes us aware that every minute of every day is a precarious drama that we look upon more lightly than we should. The dramatic cortex is the human heartlost gained tormented anguished and confused.  The metaphorical context is the fleeting nature of each heart's temporal beat and our desperately valiant struggle to flesh out our mortal hearts' desires.".

How much does life weigh? Irritu may not answer that question directly but he does indirectly answer the question darkly and beautifully in 21 Grams.21 Grams tells the story of three lives brought together by tragedy the life of a very sick man Penn a mother who has lost much Watts and a Christian who has recently reformed his ways Del Toro. Really these characters and their oncesimple lives are the focus of this film and all three characters are mysterious and deep. Each of the three actors gives an excellent performance but it is Watts who stands out in all her angst. All of them deserved Academy Award nominations and Penn would've received one along with Watts and Del Toro if not for his incredible performance in Mystic River.Arriaga's screenplay is incredible too leaving the outcome inexplicable enough to be real and to make sense. Santaolalla's score is odd enough to fit the dark atmosphere that pervades the film and stick around for the credits to hear Dave Matthews' fitting conclusion. Also Prieto's and Procopio's cinematography is gritty enough to depict the unbearable anguish of the characters.I would praise the direction as well except that I do have one complaint regarding it. It is often so choppy and irregular that it causes the story to lose a tiny bit of its impact. Perhaps this choppiness fits the film too but to me it was distracting.Yet you should definitely check this one out for a sorrowful picture of torment disgust and a strange beauty.Final Grade A.".

The script brings some mesmerizing scenes ones with great tragedy that bring out a viewer's compassion. Nevertheless there was something about the structure that I didn't think was all that great. In films like Once Upon a Time in America Reservoir Dogs and even Memento the scrambled story structure had a purpose adding appropriate twists and turns for the audience. 21 Grams like Amores Perros in a sense has that nonlinear basis to it too and sometimes it works for the audience to react. But I think there would be a lot more power to how these characters' fates and tragedies unfold if it was told linearly from start to finish. In many moments in the film I found myself knowing a little too much before a particular scene unfolded or I found myself guessing about something that I didn't need to one of the points of nonlinear storytelling is answers first questions later. It wasn't an aspect that made the film bad yet the stock that writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Inarritu put into this structure over interlocking the stories in order or perhaps telling each story separately is the film's only drawback.".

It is hard to describe why but I was not as stunned as I usually am after watching movies I rate at 10. Thus I was deciding between 8 a 9 finally I voted 9 but it is a rather weak one.";

	schema:reviewBody "A year or so ago I saw a film about a horrible accident that affected three different parties. This film followed these three lives and we saw how the accident caused their lives to intertwine. The film was directed by a man named Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu and was notable for it's gritty styling and downtrodden acting. The film was of course called 'Amores Perros' but from the information given so far it could easily have been 21 Grams. The only real difference between the two is that the first version of this story was massively superior to this retelling. 21 Grams has all the ingredients to be considered a great film by today's standards a tragic story lots of shouting...sorry I mean powerful performances it's gritty it's downbeat and it's even got the split method of story telling. However there's just one problem having these things in place is not the way to a great film. Ingeniuty interesting stories great acting  these are the things that make cinema great. I don't know what's wrong with people these days why does stuff like 21 Grams always receive a strong critical reaction? The acting in this film is really great...or is it? Are you sure it's not just dull? One of the side effects of these gritty dramas taking over is that the art of acting has been cut back and cut back again until all that's left is a dreary residue of which so many actors are more than happy to wallow in. And why wouldn't they be? Anyone can mope and these guys are getting Academy Award nominations for doing it! Death and tragedy has always been a favourite of Hollywood and the dreary and depressing nature of this film takes advantage of that fact. 21 Grams attempts to explore the subject of loss and personal trauma by way of the soul which is shown by the '21 grams' that we lose upon death. This is extremely ironic when you consider that this film has no soul. It's backbone is dissolved into the tedious screenplay and 21 Grams doesn't offer us a single reason to care for any of the characters on display meaning the only reason we should get behind them is because they're the protagonists and that's no reason to care for a character. The characters in 21 Grams can kill people be told that they have a month to live and lose their family until they go blue in the face  but if I don't have a reason to plug into their plight I'm afraid I simply don't care.All in all 21 Grams is a tragic waste of film stock. It's a product of it's time and reflects the way that cinema has changed this century. It's a shame that films of this nature will continue to get strong critical reactions and as long as that keeps happening the studios will continue to churn them out. 21 Grams is nothing but another film.".

You think? My patience was wearing with the highly overdramatized character of Christina Peck Naomi Watts as she wallowed in her own selfpity skipping the normal process of grieving. And there was no more pathetic character than that of Paul Rivers Sean Penn whose obsessive dying math obsessed character made me wonder why any woman would find him attractive. The only character I felt any sympathy for was the beautifully acted and portrayed character of Marianne Jordan Melissa Leo who perfectly acted the pain of keeping together a family torn by abuse and alcoholism. The biggest problem with this film is that it fails in what it sets out to do. It wants to be a piece to show the dark side of human beings by bringing to surface contradictions that we wouldn't otherwise notice. But it reveals little that isn't already known and it does not show the faults in everyday people in any sort of entertaining and refreshing way. It simply shows us their lives unfolding backwards a feat that Seinfeld already accomplished yet with such better results. In the end it is just dark and dreary and leaves little to be gained from the experience. The dialogue is trite the scenes are dreary and this drama about life reflects nothing more than a teenage angstridden attempt to make sense of the world.My life is worse off for having seen it.".

This is a popular fad in films these days which reminds me of choose your own adventure books because this is how I imagine these films are created. Instead of providing real content the movie is a hodgepodge of gimmicks. A little life and death drama some action some mystery some blood and guts give it a big budget  Hey we've got a blockbuster.  To top it off the 21 grams premise is weak and never developed and has very little to do with the rest of the film.

The greatest reference I can mention is the IMDb User Rating Amores Perros top 250 139 with 8.2 and 21 Grams top 250 188 with 8.0. Therefore many viewers share my opinion in this regard. The performance of the cast is something unique Naomi Watts proves that she is not only a beautiful face and body on the screen but also a terrific actress being nominated by the Academy for the Best Actress Award. Benicio Del Toro who was found some years ago has another great performance in an important role the trigger of the situations exposed in the story.

When the connection was finally made there was really no more story to be told but there was 90 minutes left in the movie. ARGH!!!!!!! It was excruciating. The three of us who saw it including one HUGE fan of Amores Perros were all extremely relieved to be out.".

There seemed to be no connection between the characters other than the fact that they were shown together in the final scenes. When the connection was finally made there was really no more story to be told but there was 90 minutes left in the movie. ARGH!!!!!!! It was excruciating. The three of us who saw it including one HUGE fan of Amores Perros were all extremely relieved to be out.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu did it but he was able to not only get one nor two but three great performances out of his leads. Naomi Watts Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are examples of how well good actors actresses can collaborate when they are giving the write material and the right direction. The film starts of a little confusing for the audience not much is revealed because of the non chronological way the story is told. For the first 2030 minutes I found myself guessing and grasping at which event takes place when and where. However for me at least this made the experience even more enjoying being able to piece these puzzle together. By the second act of the film we get a look into the character's lives so without spoiling anything critical let me start by saying that Naomi Watts's character Christina Peck is a woman with a troubled past involving drug addiction married with children. Benicio Del Toro's character Jack Jordan is an excon who aims to reform himself through Jesus and God. Sean Penn's character Paul RIvers is a mathematician whose wife is trying to get pregnant whilst he has only a short time to live. These three entities are brought together by as quoted in the plot summary above 'a freak tragic accident'.The situation's these characters are placed in are tense to say the least however. where the director's skill is shown is the way in which he draws away from the tension and rather focuses on the character's emotions and sometimes in the most unlikely situations makes us feel sympathy for them. It's in those subtle noiseless moments where the audience is really able to care for the characters. Don't get me wrong though this film has moments were you will get edgy on your seat. This film isn't for everybody as it will be confusing at first and some people will find this off putting. However I urge you to watch this film as the character's learn about their hardships we also learn more and more about the directors message. And also from a technical point of view this film isn't bad either there are some great camera angles and some great usages of cinematography with symbolism. The sound effects during one particular scene are very notable as effective. 21 grams  9.1 10".

Review itself This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill his fashion of humor or his fans at all but I personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. The success of Project X seriously worries me.... Anyways having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy. But damn. I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was to me surprisingly satiricalsmartrelevant in today's society selfaware and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichs seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build upcontext to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies Ice Cube The Principal etc.. What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.All in all... genuine clever vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart. IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. Stoked for the sequel.".

There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn't even control my laughter in a full cinema.All in all I'm not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill's ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show I would definitely recommend this one!

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen the original 21 Jump Street series so I can't compare. I had only watched the trailer and thought it looked alright but wasn't planning on paying to see it. I received free advance screening passes to see it last night and I am so glad! It is honestly the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I usually don't laugh out loud but this movie had me and the rest of the audience laughing at least every ten seconds.Who knew Channing Tatum could be so funny? He really steals the show half the movie with his great comedic timing. The backandforth that he and Jonah Hill have is so refreshing. They have clear comedic chemistry and play off of each other very well. The dialogue is fresh and hilarious. Another standout actor was Dave Franco. I am a big fan of him and have always found him funny and he really shines in this movie. Overall every actor played off the next very well. It's clear they had a great time making this movie.I can't recommend this enough. If you want a good laugh then SEE THIS. It has clever outrageous comedy and some great acting. There was a great cameo surprise towards the end that had the entire theater gasping and laughing. This is one of the few movie experiences I've had where the entire audience enjoyed themselves and laughed out loud even clapped at some parts. Go see it you will not regret it!".

	schema:headline " Unexpectedly hilarious and clever. 21 Jump Street subverts all expectations.";
	schema:reviewBody "21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation and it isn't just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart exciting and often hilarious actioncomedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as Schmidt and Jenko respectively two rookie cops who went to high school together though belonging to different social circles. Jenko was the popular jock while Schmidt was the unpopular nerd. When they realize each has something the other one needs a friendship sparks and they become partners. After a failed drug bust they're reassigned to a special division when their police station decides to revive a cancelled program from the 80s get it?. They're sent to a local high school undercover as students to investigate and bring down a drug ring. Despite identical titles I don't know if we can even call this an adaptation of the show. While the TV show was primarily a drama the film is essentially a satire of movies and shows like 21 Jump Street fully aware of all of the clichs of its genre. Writer Michael Bacall Scott Pilgrim vs. The World seems to have realized nobody really cared about a 21 Jump Street movie and instead decided to make something totally different. Early on in a scene of dialogue that may as well have been delivered directly into the camera a character explains that there aren't any original ideas these days and so we're stuck rehashing old concepts from the 80s to make a quick buck. In this way and many others the movie is all about subverting your expectations which based on this premise are probably very low. It's anything but a lazy cash grab taking everything you know about buddy cop films and turning it on its head. It embraces the stupidity of its concept too by constantly acknowledging that Hill and Tatum are way too old to be posing as high school kids or by having Ice Cube play the stereotypical black police captain from every 80s movie ever and then outright acknowledging that. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko's roles are reversed with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock. 21 Jump Street thrives on the unexpected.Many were initially unsure how Channing Tatum would perform as he is an actor who has never headlined in any major comedies before. While Jonah Hill is without a doubt the star having had tons of experience in films like Superbad and Knocked Up Tatum does a fine job as well and the two actors have great chemistry together. In movies like this with two main leads the rapport between them can make or break the film. With 21 Jump Street it absolutely makes it.That's ultimately why the movie works as well as it does. Any successful comedy needs real stakes. Otherwise it just feels like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches with no real purpose. A few years ago Superbad was extremely successful not just for being a goofy and raunchy comedy but also for having a believable high school friendship at its core. Similarly 21 Jump Street works because the friendship between its protagonists feels real and as a result there are real emotional stakes to go along with the satire. Driving this silly raunchy comedy is a truly interesting story about popularity and friendship in high school and about how you might act differently if you could go back as an adult. It's easily the funniest comedy in well over a year but it's not just a vehicle for jokes 21 Jump Street tells a great story too.Phil Lord and Chris Miller seem to love surprising us. As with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 21 Jump Street is a movie nobody expected to be great. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it knows all of your complaints ahead of time. Think it sounds like a cheap cash crab based on an 80s property? They make a joke about that. Think Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are too old to play high school kids? They make a joke about that too. It's extremely clever and always two steps ahead of the audience. But what really stands out about 21 Jump Street is that it's not just an enjoyable and hilarious time at the theater it also tells a genuinely interesting and emotionally compelling story developing its characters in a way you probably wouldn't anticipate from a raunchy high school comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.I'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.The direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.All turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart sweet hilarious and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite all the hype I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series just isn't very funny. My problem with it is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.For example when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings or even worse when Jenko fires his gun in the park after tackling a bad guy these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party anyway? not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place without authorization.The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House' where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one it doesn't really work in the police setting since as stated above improprieties are simply not tolerated.While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor' Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt out of his shell.Actually it's the bad guys who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric' the ecofriendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer and his supplier Mr. Walters a physical education teacher whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off an assorted bunch of nasties consisting of bikers and gang members led by the menacing 'Domingo' lend an air of verisimilitude not found in the antics of the principals Jenko and Schmidt.Occasionally there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole Jonah Hill and cowriter Michael Bacall's fratboy humor lacks subtlety and relies on lowlevel slapstick routines to get by. At this point America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days that a mediocre exercise such as this is hailed as a comic masterpiece!".

	schema:headline " Gets Old Fast spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. The jokes try to hard to be hip and end up being just plays on stereotypes. For example in a misguided attempt to look cool one of the characters punches a guy for being nerdy. The victim mistakenly believes he was punched because he is black and gay which makes the cop look uncool. In another example throughout the movie the head of the jump street program acts like a stereotypical bad tempered black cop even calling himself that. It is vaguely amusing the first time but the next umpteen times it gets a little lame as do the frequent jokes about the guys not looking like teenagers. The visual and verbal humor are like this through the whole movie. The movie portrays alcohol and drug use as a funny joke. It shows scenes of the cops high on the supposedly deadly drug they are supposed to be in high school stopping. It shows them buying booze for an underage party and it's supposed to be funny because they have to use false IDs. It shows them stealing marijuana from the evidence lockup to share with the kids. I know it's a comedy not a message movie but this is just not funny. To top it off they don't even get reprimanded for any of the illegal things they do from giving drugs to minor to engaging in a high speed chase on a freeway to reckless discharge of firearms to taking further police actions when technically fired. The action is boring. The interminably long scenes of bicycle car and limousine chases do not even begin to liven up this bomb. They are not interesting. The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids they act more like two kids pretending to be cops. I used to watch the 21 Jump Street series and it was a serious drama about serious issues like homosexual bullying drugs suicide and peer pressure. It may have been a little soap operish at times but it was dramatic and interesting. I think it deserved more respect than this.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. The jokes try to hard to be hip and end up being just plays on stereotypes. For example in a misguided attempt to look cool one of the characters punches a guy for being nerdy. The victim mistakenly believes he was punched because he is black and gay which makes the cop look uncool. In another example throughout the movie the head of the jump street program acts like a stereotypical bad tempered black cop even calling himself that. It is vaguely amusing the first time but the next umpteen times it gets a little lame as do the frequent jokes about the guys not looking like teenagers. The visual and verbal humor are like this through the whole movie. The movie portrays alcohol and drug use as a funny joke. It shows scenes of the cops high on the supposedly deadly drug they are supposed to be in high school stopping. It shows them buying booze for an underage party and it's supposed to be funny because they have to use false IDs. It shows them stealing marijuana from the evidence lockup to share with the kids. I know it's a comedy not a message movie but this is just not funny. To top it off they don't even get reprimanded for any of the illegal things they do from giving drugs to minor to engaging in a high speed chase on a freeway to reckless discharge of firearms to taking further police actions when technically fired. The action is boring. The interminably long scenes of bicycle car and limousine chases do not even begin to liven up this bomb. They are not interesting. The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.

Instead they go right back to how they were as kids bumbling and fumbling their way along and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie.

The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb sorry.This is easily Tatum's worst film and I can't stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny just annoying and it makes sense that he cowrote the script.You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes along with the usual drug and sexual comments which take no imagination or creativity at all.Big time bomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not see this movie in the theaters and now I can honestly say I am really glad I didn't. After watching the DVD I am still trying to figure out what the appeal is of this film. Is it Jonah Hill Channing Tatum..? It does not make sense.But for Bruno Wang the most glaring aspect of this film the one that makes it tank for me is the fact that the film centers around a couple of oddly opposite misfits who wind up working for an undercover unit of the police department to infiltrate a synthetic drug ring and stop the drugs from spreading from one high school to many in the community. So the logic here is that drugs are bad right? However the movie then proceeds to glamorize the drug HFSwhich stands for Holy Fing Sht and shows 60s Batmanlike graphics of the different phases of the drug's effects. Even more twisted is that one of the students dies after taking HFS. This is supposed to be funny?The movie is based on the TV series and the plot is weak. Two guys now in their mid 20s who were at opposite ends of the social spectrum in high school one a jock and one a nerd meet back up again in police academy training where they figure out that their strong traits can help each other overcome their weaknesses and get them to pass the academy. Jonah Hill plays the nerd Schmidt and Channing Tatum plays the jock Jenko. Jenko helps Schmidt with the physical part of the training and Schmidt helps Jenko with the bookwork. Together they succeed in passing the academy where they are immediately assigned as park cops riding bicycles. In the park they witness drug usage and wind up capturing one of the criminals but neglect to read him his Miranda rights. The screw up has them being reassigned to an undercover crime unit 21 Jump Street. They are chosen for this because they have 'youthful looks' and supposedly will fit into a high school unnoticed. The two wind up going back to their original high school posing as brothers and living in Schmidt's parents house. From here the movie is a strange mix of violence drug humor and just bad plot. Schmidt and Jenko wind up accidentally trading identities while under the influence of HFS and now Jenko has to cut it with the nerds and Schmidt is hanging with the cool kids. The twist is that now the 'cool' kids are not the jocks but the ones who are environmentalists and activists...and in this case also drug dealers.Schmidt and Jenko are supposed to find the supplier of the drug before the drug spreads. After one massive failure after another they do eventually discover that it is the PE teacher played by Rob Riggle. Riggle's role is the most unbelievable of all and really waters the film down. We have this halfcocked PE teacher who supposedly stumbles on to a formula for a synthetic drug and he now is supposedly dealing with underworld figures and guns etc.Yes there is a love interest Schmidt is supposedly falling for one of the high school girls Molly who is in with the 'in' crowd in which Eric played by Dave Franco. But again here's a plot twist that is borderline sick e.g. a 20 something guy hitting on a high school chick? There is also a cameo appearance by original 21 Jump Street DEA Agents Tom Hanson Johnny Depp and Doug Penhall Peter DeLuise near the end of the film. Sadly this is one film that not even Johnny Depp can save. The whole film is just a disturbingly bad amount of really stupid humor and pretty much unbelievable plot line. It leaves you feeling a little numb and dumb. I give this movie a Bruno Wang 1.5 stars out of 5. The laughs are few and far between and the plot appears written by a thirteen year old.".

It brought up subjects that kids dealt with. They did blow up cars or destroy a city. This should not have been called 21 Jump Street. Another thing mostly everyone in the REAL 21 Jump Street looked sexy and young. Neither the two guys in this show even looked their age. They both looked fat ugly annoying and pathetic. Also Hanson and Duggy would not have been killed at the end of the movie. They wouldn't have been that pathetic to look away while apprehending criminals. I think if someone stupid says this is good they need to go back and watch the REAL 21 Jump Street then can talk. Hanson and Duggy brought down kids in school with class and dignity not destruction and degrading ways. Why must they say the F word thru the entire movie every second. I mean come on. This could have been a better movie if they had actually watched 21 Jumpstreet. Also those kids they had in school does not fit how kids are now. Kids are not into the tree hugging crap or two straps. Nah I'm sorry this movie was a HUGE disappointment to society. Don't WATCH".

	schema:reviewBody "'21 Jump Street' is a largely forgotten late 80searly 90s television show which today is widely acknowledged for helping launch the career of actor Johnny Depp who you made of heard of. Having not seen a single episode of the program which was before my time could I make it through this film with a complete understanding without any backstory? Let me get one thing straight unlike the show which deals with such heavy issues as child abuse homophobia AIDS and hat crimes this is a raunchy comedy. And the movie's not afraid to admit it as the first ten minutes alone provide us with a galore of genitalia and gross out gags. Normally these would scare me away and become a liability when considering how one movie would score. Maybe it's the fact that the funniest moments stem from witty banter or creative sequences rather than gross out themselves but it the raunchiness didn't seem to bother me for the most part. Then there's Channing Tatum. If you were to bring his name up anytime before this year I would shutter.I mean we all know he might not have the greatest resume 'Fighting' anyone? but he's honestly one of the best things about this movie. So much so that he even manages to be better than Jonah Hill one of the best comedic actors working today. Rob Riggle and Ice Cube each provide inspired supporting roles that are nearly laugh out loud funny each time they're on screen never feeling forced or overused.Does the film have problems? Well...yeah. I won't deny that. Some of the jokes fall flat while some jokes that initially worked are stretched a little too far. There's the inevitably love story between one of the main characters and a high school girl feels too forced and only is there to serve as a 'love story.' But for the most part I completely enjoyed it though I can't ever see myself taking time to watch it again.So if turning a seriousthemed show like '21 Jump Street' into a very good raunchy comedy does make me wonder if other old 80s TV shows would make a similar transition. Wouldn't Alf as a potsmoking pottymouthed slacker who still lives with his mom in modern day Los Angeles be an instant classic?".

He ruined GI Joe for me and countless fans and a few other movies I had expectations of. As for Jonah Hill his B grade comedy skills should be left out of Hollywood. They don't fit in this movie or this genre for that matter. Honestly I wouldn't waste money watching this movie its not worth even 30 minutes of your time.

	schema:headline " An unassuming film that is thought provoking on so many levels well acted and thoroughly enjoyable however you come to it";
	schema:reviewBody "Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean everything is perfect he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. Paralysed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky a man who reminds him of his dead father a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong  but what is it that he seeks but feels he cannot find?When I first saw this film it was with my girlfriend who would then become my wife then exwife! and I remember how she and our friends felt a little bit cheated by the film that they had expected to be yet another wacky Jim Carrey comedy. In fairness to her and the others it was easy to do this at the time  who would have thought that Jim Carrey would be able to act  certainly not the marketing department that sold this film on the basis of it being a hilarious film as opposed to the thoughtful and rewarding film it turned out to be. The plot can be viewed on so many levels that it is honestly easier to leave it to each viewer to take what they will from it. On the most obvious level it satirises the media the emotional faade of television and the increasingly relevant look at reality shows. To others it will say as much about God the empty drone of life and the things that we all desire. Of course to others it will just be a comedy with general comments to make  and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever in fact the multilevel approach works to make it appeal to many audiences.Starting as a comedy I am always taken by how well the film moves to become more and more interesting but yet never loses sight of those audience members who have come for the basic story. Hence it delivers an enjoyable and engaging central narrative that plainly put makes for a comic and involving yarn  we grow to care for Truman and this makes the ending an emotional and satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan the fact that to them it appears 'open ended'. That it is also a very thoughtprovoking affair is only a bonus with the satire working on many levels. Of course by seeming to tackle so many subjects and issues in such a short running time the film never really gets its teeth deep into any one of them but this is not a major problem because it leaves us to do that in our heads after the film finishes.The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. Of course it is easy now to look back at Carrey and accept that he can act straight but at the time it seemed so unlikely and few felt it was a good casting choice. Of course seeing the end result it is clear that he can and he delivers such a great performance that he really makes the film work.He is comic but yet serious sympathetic but not worthy of pity  it is a great delivery and one that basically meant that I now look at his Ace Ventura stuff as the 'other' category and see his acting as his real work 6 years ago that was vice versa. Carrey carries the film being on screen for almost the entire film but he has good support from Linney Emmerich Krause and others who play it well despite being stuck in the necessary stiff and unreal roles. The controller etc roles are all well played and feature a collection of well known faces including a great support role from Harris through to roles for Giamatti Shearer Baker Hall and a few others. It may be Carrey's show but the support certainly helps.Overall this is a great film that can be appreciated as much for what it is on the surface a great little comic story as it can for the issues that it hints at all the time. There was a time when some viewers may have looked to a Carrey film to be a load of mugging an crude basic laughs but this was the film that saw that change. Thought provoking funny entertaining short enjoyable and well acted throughout  well worth seeing and well worth coming back to several times.".

The point the media and its destructive powers  is subtlely relayed through dark humor and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great Ed Harris is stellar what were they THINKING at the Academy? and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final sceneI will not reveal itis a majestic longawaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here of course you won't like it!".

I love the dialogue camera shot performances direction music and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman underplaying him not making him too comic or too dramatic but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director Peter Weir deserved their Oscar nods.Weir who directed the great 'Witness' uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic.".

	schema:headline " Life is Starting to Imitate Satire";
	schema:reviewBody "Life is starting to imitate satire. The Truman Show was only made seven years ago but it predates the current mania for socalled reality television shows such as Big Brother. The idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality real people in real situations with real emotions rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries. The flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show. The presence of the cameras has a distorting effect inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists. The Truman Show takes the central concept of reality TV shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television? Truman Burbank is an insurance executive living in a small American seaside town called Seahaven and happily married to a nurse named Meryl. Or at least he thinks he is. What Truman doesn't know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction. The company he works for does not exist. Seahaven the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome. Everyone in Truman's life Meryl his mother his colleagues at work his best friend Marlon are actors playing out their roles in his drama.For thirty years Truman has accepted his world unquestioningly but at the beginning of the film a series of incidents a light falling from the sky the reappearance of his father who was supposed to have drowned in a boating accident when Truman was a boy strange messages picked up on his car radio awaken his doubts. Although members of the cast make strenuous attempts to dissuade him he decides to try and explore the world outside Seahaven in particular he wants to travel to Fiji where he has been told that his former girlfriend Sylvia now lives. Sylvia was written out of the show when the scriptwriters decided that he should marry Meryl instead.The film has certain similarities with another film from the late nineties Pleasantville which dealt with an inverted version of the same idea two teenagers from the real world are magically transported into the world of a fifties television show. In my view however The Truman Show is the better of the two. Pleasantville deals with its political themes in a heavyhanded way with some very obvious symbolism. The Truman Show although it deals with some weighty issues is never ponderous or excessively serious indeed it is often very humorous. The main source of humour is the contrast between the nave trusting Truman and the behaviour of those around him all living a lie and desperately trying to prevent Truman from finding out that it is a lie. I had previously thought of Jim Carrey as a rather annoying actor whose appeal was based upon the idea that manic overacting is in itself funny but here as Truman he is very good indeed both amusing and touching. I was also impressed by Ed Harris as Christof the show's enigmatic producer.Another factor in the success of the film is its visual look. Seahaven like the town in Pleasantville appears as an eerily perfect notquitereal version of the typical American small town but was actually filmed in a real place the purposebuilt village of Seaside Florida. There are similarities with the cult British sixties television series The Prisoner which was also filmed in an eerily perfect seaside village Portmeirion in North Wales.The film is obviously a satire on the intrusiveness and obsession with celebrity of the modern media added relevance was given by the fact that it came out shortly after the death of Princess Diana. There is however more to it than that. Much has been made of the film as religious allegory it has been pointed out that Christof whose name is clearly and quite deliberately similar to Christ is a Godfigure whereas Truman the True Man is a symbolic Everyman. It has even been claimed that the film is an antireligious allegory with Truman's final escape from Seahaven symbolic of man's need to break away from outdated religious dogmas. This is not an interpretation with which I would agree if one is trying to put across a God is dead message it seems odd to provide a Godfigure who is very much real not mythical or illusory. The imagery of the final scenes  the calm after the storm the ascent up a flight of stairs into the sky and clouds also struck me as religious rather than secular. Moreover the film seems too complex to be reduced to any single allegorical meaning although it certainly deals with the relationship between man and God. It also touches on man's need to explore both to explore new places and also to explore new ideas and to break away from established ways of life and ways of thought and on the nature of reality. Truman's world may seem unreal to us but as Christof says we accept the reality we are presented with.This is a brilliant multilayered film part comedy part satire part philosophical speculation and in my view one of the two best movies of the late nineties. The other was American Beauty. I felt it should have taken the Best Picture Oscar for 1999 Shakespeare in Love is a good film but The Truman Show is a great one. It confirms my view that Peter Weir is one of the best directors currently working. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging didactic witty dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.Taking this entirely original concept writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.The acting performances are amongst the best I've ever seen. Jim Carey is superb as Truman effortlessly conveying his fears desires and personality. Ed Harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. In addition the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are acting for Truman but in some scenes let their genuine feelings shine through. The ensemble simply cannot be faulted. Carey was hardly done by not to get an Oscar nomination for his performance.The music and visuals are top notch. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality particularly in the movie's final sequence. Muscially this film is incredible. Phillip Glass is a dream on the piano perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. The two combine excellently during the scene in which Truman breaks his routine for the first time. During the sequence Truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. The emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of Truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful I'v ever experienced.This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy drama strong character development atmosphere originality superb visuals a superb score tight writing raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. One cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. It touches on our sense of adventure desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'The Truman Show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. One of the greatest films of our time.".

He made you think you were him as the whole movie did. Watch it... its a must.Imagine being captivated all your life in a show without knowing. Your neighbors your family your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors pretending to be people they are not. Well Truman Burbank not only imagined it but also lived it. This is a hilarious movie that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. Just be aware... once you start watching it it will be difficult to stop. I rate this movie 55 with no negative comments.".

	schema:reviewBody "It not so easy to be Jim Carrey because nobody takes you seriously after many funny movies even when he is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. He proved himself so many times in dramas he is so great actor.This time there is no grade for the script 10 is too low maybe 10 would suffice. I must agree that in everything around us we can see only what we are capable to see but this movie gives so many levels and many people would see it differently and ALL WILL BE THRILLED by this movie.People who are interested in the phenomenon of 'Big Brother'a kind of TV voyeurism so present today will see the ultimate human desire to observe somebody's life from its beginning and without consent of the person which is the object of that observing. There is nothing special in this man who is watched but we like to have mirrors of our lives in other people who knows why. Of course the next layer is ethical do we have the right to watch somebody's life because we don't talk about a rat but a human being who doesn't know that he is watched in a TV show. If we go further we must ask ourselves what is real in our life? There is is always some possibility that we are observed directed guided monitored... by somebody and our life is not so authentic as we used to think.Next layer this movie talks about freedom and personal choice. How we want to be free no matter what are the other alternatives are. Free to love who we want free to go free as much as it is possible. Of course if we want to be free if our mind and society stop us.FINALLY... The most interesting level is the spiritual one.This is a guidebook of the spiritual path. At first this world is so secure and predictable place. We have our little lives and we can define everything what is important for us to have some simplification of reality to feel safe. This kind of ordinary life is a bit boring but we are in a herd we are not alone in our dungeon.But... at some moment this world is maybe not what we thought it is... maybe we want more of our livesand the world is not so simple and ordinary place. We feel that there is something BEHIND this so called 'reality'. And we start to search to test that reality which gives us more and more 'magic' things as we go deeper. This is still a stage of curiosity many people tasted this path and feeling but at some superficial level.If we go further we must fight the world. All possible obstacles will arise people and circumstances. When Truman wants to see reality what it is to be free all his 'friends' and the complete crew don't let him to go our the ordinary tracks. So alike the spiritual quest. Then the moment has come men must be separated from boys that is the curious people from the real seekers. The latter are ready to give even their lives to 'waste' their time to face their worst fears to be 'hunted' by the society which wants they to be 'normal' again... but a true spiritual person won't give up. The same as Truman 'you'l have to kill me!!!!!!!' the quest is the real one only if we are totally determined to follow our inner feeling and to search the truth. AT LAST... we hit the 'border' of the world the frontiers of the reality we get know what this world really is. We are free to talk with our 'God' though I think it is the final trick of our ego to bring us back to be 'normal' again and it plays so many games to pull us back by saying that there is nothing out there everything is the same and it is better in realm of ILLUSION. Only a real spiritual person will say 'thanks' for the offer and go to freedom no matter what it is but it is OUR freedom our insight the world won't be the same anymore. It is such a pity that this is a kind of review that I can't make a spoiler to give more details to relate the scenes from the movie and my points. But when you see it you'll know what I am talking about.Again you'll see what you are able to see the movie will be deep in degree of your ability to open your mind. This scenario can't be beaten even by movies like Gandhi or Mozart or any other. An excellent work of Andrew Niccol.".

On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of Groundhog Day about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the stolen kiss on the beach at night and Cue the sun!In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and scifi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current reality TV obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face most people do so in childhood some I fear never do.  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic childhood existence.  How's it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same.".

The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things? This is a deep movie bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?When the lady comes on the bike with the basket then the dog and then the yellow Volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes. The Director was like God  the creator  although at times he was a mean guy I think that all of us have questioned God and have been angry at him. Truman's world seemed so perfect no messy hair no trash. Just phony! Our world seems much like that everything is a matter of perception.The audience that watched the Truman Show in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to Truman reminded me of the soaps of the Paparazzi of how we like to know about the celebrities and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as Princess Diana or Truman Burbank.Purchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind.

He plays Truman Burbank a vaguely unhappy insurance salesman in the perfect little seaside town of Seahaven. Following some strange occurrences Truman starts to think that he is being watched. Little does he know that his entire life is secretly filmed his town is a gigantic soundstage everyone he has ever known was an actor and that his every waking and sleeping second is broadcast around the world as a toprated docusoap.Critics have been lavishing enormous praise on this movie since it opened in America last June and probably rightly so because it is a superbly crafted piece of work. Weir's direction is outstanding frequently viewing events from the point of view of hidden spy cameras such as the one in Truman's car radio. One stunning shot has the town's main street full of motionless extras waiting for Truman to turn the corner. Jim Carrey's performance has been singled out for particular praise and though his acting is of a much higher standard that his usual comedy antics it is not exactly Laurence Olivier. This said an Oscar nomination would have been well deserved.The setting of a chirpy small town from which escape is impossible echoes cult 60's series The Prisoner but the balance of reality and poetry is much more restrained here than it was then. The opening credits are especially clever using those of the actual show' e.g. Truman Burbank as Himself. There are however a few problems. The film is simply too short to adequately explore Truman's situation and the character of Meryl his wife' disappears about halfanhour from the end. This kind of slightly sloppy scripting was not something I expected from writer Andrew Niccol whose previous film Gattaca which he also directed was such an immediate classic. Gripes aside this is an extraordinary and highly original film that really is worth seeing several times to fully understand the director's message. It doesn't even matter if you never liked Jim Carrey before. You will now.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Truman Show is a rarity in Hollywood  or movies in general  a film that actually makes the audience think and is about ideas. How do we know what we see is real? Why do we accept what is around us without questioning it? What would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong? You'd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through but in fact The Truman Show is great fun. I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy although there are a few light moments here and there but it's not too heavy and goes down easy.It might sound like exaggeration but the scene where Truman first starts to realize what's going on is one of the best scenes I've seen in any movie because of Carrey's acting the direction and also because of the Philip Glass soundtrack which was critical to making that scene work.If you haven't seen The Truman Show do yourself a favor and check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times and each time it gets better. First watching it at a young age Roughly 10 years old I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film. The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining. Now as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot. Truman plays the star of a 247 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect island. Throughout the film we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you and although difficult you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that. Several other hidden messages Ideas appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie the actorsactresses show no emotion for Truman. This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens. Overall The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings all of which can be directly tied back to daily life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision Ed Harris of having someone's life be on TV that being Truman played by Jim Carey...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his father drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to Fiji because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart he's there. When Truman just needs a friend he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this town. The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible. When everything seems like it doesn't add up it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie. The Truman Show is in a league of it's own.".

	schema:headline " Very engaging even for non Jim Carrey fans";
	schema:reviewBody "As many fans know Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end I did not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank Jim Carrey who is viewed live 24 hours a day uncensored as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a setup. And when I mean everything...everything...is a setup. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the set that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself written by Andrew Niccol brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. Carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans it may upset.".

It is a scathing indictment of the media.  My only guess is that they saw the word comedy and Jim Carrey and decided not to look at it too hard.  And judging from some of the comments here it went over the heads of a pretty good slice of the viewing public as well.  This story is a modernday fable  for those with the eyes to see.If you are watching this to be entertained by Jim Carrey or to see a great scifi flick  you will be disappointed.  If you are watching this to see the most elegant satire ever to grace the silver screen maybe ever then this movie is for you.I will have this one on DVD.  910 ".

It is a scathing indictment of the media.  My only guess is that they saw the word comedy and Jim Carrey and decided not to look at it too hard.  And judging from some of the comments here it went over the heads of a pretty good slice of the viewing public as well.  This story is a modernday fable  for those with the eyes to see.If you are watching this to be entertained by Jim Carrey or to see a great scifi flick  you will be disappointed.  If you are watching this to see the most elegant satire ever to grace the silver screen maybe ever then this movie is for you.I will have this one on DVD.  910 ";

Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the postmodern age in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life the film says is an illusion a lie. Or perhaps  all our lives are illusions but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca  lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career it's Niccol's sarcastic intelligent innovative script that made The Truman Show great that and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris who plays Christof creator and director of The Truman Show and again special attention should be given to the character's name  and also to Laura Linney Noah Emmerich Natasha McElhone Harry Shearer Peter Krause Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally a word of praise for the excellent musical score composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message which takes some time to seep in and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as scifi and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming and just like the people watching The Truman Show we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old the way I see it once a decade has passed a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust.".

I did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year where after seeing Bruce Almighty and becoming somewhat of a Jim Carey fan I made an effort to watch more of his movies. Truman Show is an instant classic in all the right ways it's a smart well acted somewhat eerie and utterly unique masterpiece. It also gets better the more you watch it.I don't happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny Truman Show's got a bit of sci fi but I don't think it really falls under any one genre. What's really scary is the ideathis conceptis not so out there anymore in today's times that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen. It's creepy very much so in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple.I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty a great movie and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for. But as good as he was in that he simply shines in Truman everyone does I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then oncethe first time I saw it I thought it was about an 8 or 9 it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure I wish it had not ended so ambiguously I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more. Also the audience. Was Truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred? Truman Show unlike about 95 percent of movies made does seem like a sequel could be made although with how bad most sequels are I'd be a bit wary. Still any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction.".

The Truman Show is a film about a man called Truman Burbank Jim Carrey. Who lives a normal life with his normal job. But he is living in an abnormal world. Because Truman is living in his own world called sea heaven sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie. Truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it. His Mum Dad Wife and even his best friend are all actors. The Truman show is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around. Small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen. But when Truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has coordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious. The Truman Show has been nominated for three Oscars and has won three Baftas. Award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece. The Truman Show is a film that just about makes up for the horrible disasters of Godzilla and Armageddon this film might be the film of the 90's.The Truman Show had a strict budget of 60 million and earned 125 million in film screenings alone. The Truman Show hasn't got any fancy graphics or any expensive cars or props its just pure film making and passion.Overall the Truman Show is a very good film but my only criticism is that some of the background actors didn't look like they knew what they were doing. But overall there was no big mistakes in the plot. I would give this a five star rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "With The Truman Show released in 1998 Peter Weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask. This underrated gem of the 90's tells the original to say the least story of Truman Burbank played by Jim Carrey in a breakthrough dramatic performance with this bit of tender wackiness we expect from him. Truman is an ordinary insurance salesman living in the small peaceful town of Seahaven. He's popular and lives in harmony with his wife his mother his best friend his colleagues and neighbors. In appearance only  What Truman doesn't know and here's the visionary originality on which relies his life is that Seahaven is in fact a huge studio with 5000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyone's an actor including his wife his mother his best friend etc. and last but not least all his life was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longestrunning reality show in television history 'The Truman Show'. Truman believed in a reality which is in fact completely fictional and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality are puppets hanging on the string of the show's Creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes. The Creator is Kristoff brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris like a kind of almighty God and the human incarnation of media's omnipotence. And Truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax and decides to leave the perfect utopia of Seahaven and go discover the real world. Because that's the point reality shows don't depict reality but paint it with fiction it's real fiction but fiction nonetheless. The ambivalence is obvious in The Truman Show. Truman's life is fictional because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers. Viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a 'realistic' dimension. Indeed Truman's character is real as stated by the creator of the show he is the only real protagonist of this world his reactions are spontaneous and sincere. The reality is pushed to unscrupulous limits because unlike other shows Truman doesn't know he's filmed he's natural. His life is a fiction but paradoxically a 'real' one. This is the semantic loophole unscrupulous TV program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows. The script's fascinating brilliance reminds of Network in the 70's highlighting many unpleasant aspects of TV Reality including the viewer's tacit complicity. Indeed the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in TV programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment like for all these people who were assiduously following 'The Truman Show' in all over the world. The second aspect is the subjectivity of reality. Truman for all his spontaneity and sincerity was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced. And all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script. The process of mediation doesn't prevent from spontaneity but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions. Like in some programs where two people who don't appreciate each other or whose views totally differ are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation supposedly unexpected to please the audience.Finally the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where Truman tries to leave the fictional world of Seahaven materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky. Truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show. The latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere and invites him to join the perfect utopia of Seahaven where he's a hero. Truman's reaction is very symbolic. He left the cameras' world like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time with his famous catchphrase as a farewell and finally gets out. This last pirouette sublimated by the thrilling score of the film earned him the applause of the audience as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending. Indeed when the show was finally interrupted two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions and zapped to another program. The end. Truman is a genuine character who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom. He therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world. Television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we viewers observed their everyday's moves the details of their life's banality during weeks or months. But that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges. And that's because camera's point view as depicted in the film presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way. The 'staging' admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship fame success and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality. The risk is less for the viewer who accepts the process than for the protagonists of these emissions whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later. The emotional excitement is binary and plays on both positive and negative poles it may present for the sake of transparency real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions whether in the context of stories talk or reality shows. The danger here is moral because with this constant clash between reality and fiction how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathy?The Truman Show denounces the fictionalization of reality through a remarkable fiction that makes today's reality look like a less believable fiction ".

For Mattei it's almost giving the other cheek up for another slap when the mob goes after him in the hospital but the last straw that broke the camel's back came from the targeting of his remaining loyal soldiers and thus the avenging angel is born nevermind if one of his arm is now paralyzed.It's a story of honour amongst thieves how some hoodlums fail to pay heed to the established rules of engagement of never crossing the line to hurt women and children and essentially family members in their violent public spat. As for the cops led by Marie Goldman Marina Fois she's eager to look for an opening to avenge her husband's killing yet bounded by duty to know that she has to keep personal and business separate. What more it's to the police's advantage that the mob is killing one another and thus warned to keep an arm's length at the explosive gangland war. In a strange parallel between those finding on opposite sides of the fence it's all about doing a job and then going home to family at the end of the day.Directed by Richard Berry who also had a small role in the film 22 Bullets is unflinching in its violence and the mowing down of Charly Mattei early in the film somehow is reminiscent of other massacres such as that of Sonny Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather or Murphy in Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. Don't expect Mattei to be dishing out revenge with creativity though as his is a simple dispatch involving a signature one shot to the head and one to the heart two critical areas to ensure the grim reaper comes calling. There are the occasional lapses into monologues although it does play up the fear factor here when he carries out the threat of striking when his enemies least expect him to.Jean Reno as usual excels in this role and you'll find yourself rooting for his character despite his flaws and what his character actually was in the past. As Zacchia puts it succinctly a wrong is a wrong no matter what layer of morality gets draped over it. Kad Merad's Zacchia too puts in a moment of brilliance when he delivered a hypocritical speech about the value of close friendships while his demeanour behind closed doors is anything but lying to the masses without a flinch.22 Bullets is a straightforward thriller that worked without too much surprises but its slick delivery more than makes up for any of its shortcomings.".

I saw for the first time Kad Merad in a bad guy role and he played this one very convincing. Then Jean Reno was as usual great. Director Richard Berry created here a fast paced thriller that was never boring. The pictures around Marseille and the sea were wonderful. The only thing I missed was that the story is told rather superficially. The act of revenges could have been executed variously than all the time in the same way. My vote with my wife is a 710 because all in all it's another example how with a low budget a solid popcorn movie can be done. French movies are the best in Europe so far and sometimes even better than the other average Hollywood productions.".

But it's quite a good movie quite a long one at a whisker under two hours and so I stuck it out. My three stars is not altered by feelings on this aspect.Reno as Charly Mattei is reliably grizzled and back in his native language does not suffer the stumbling block he had with the English language that he did when he made films in the U.S. Here he's natural and believable  not exactly likable but it's impossible not to side with him when he stalks his enemies. There's a pretty high body count accompanied by some very realistic looking wounds that really aren't very attractive to look at! The makeup department did well here.The music has a big part to play in creating the tone often thunderous and pounding and along with often frenetic camerawork the film's undeniably jolting and exciting though those prone to suffering one may well get a migraine as bad as the one that one of the mobsters did.There are a good number of reviews for this title that outline plot details. I'm going to leave that out  people don't need to read that over again.All in all it's a solid movie on a familiar theme quite involved with some exciting action and stunts. Reno is very good as all the actors are. If you like your thrillers fullblood and graphically violent then this could well be an excellent rental or DVD purchase. Me  it's not my favourite and will leave it at that.".

If I were reviewing it for people with a limited attention span I'd describe succinctly as Mesrine with Real Acting. This is because for one thing leading man Jean Reno actually has a genuine acting RANGE that spans outandout comedy Les Visiteurs comedydrama TaisToi and even RomCom Decalage Horaire whereas Vincent Cassell is merely a thug who makes a handsome living playing himself under various pseudonyms. As if Reno were not enough we have JeanPierre Darroussin one of the finest actors in current French cinema who has also distinguished himself as a fine director Kad Merad an excellent light comedian here extending his range and playing against type and Marina Fois amongst the finest actresses currently working in France. Director Richard Berry has 98 acting credits on his CV and this is his fifth outing behind the camera and he begins the movie beautifully with a long elegaic sequence as exhood Reno drives leisurely into Marseilles with his small son. Though we know that there are 22 bullets with his name on them at the end of the ride we are happy to suspend our disbelief so effective is Berry's direction. If you like for example the work of Olivier Marchal 36 Quai des Orfevres then you'll surely like this one which shows up Mesrine for the merde it is.".

Jean Reno does not go out on a rampage of revenge after being shot 22 times. In fact he discovers who was behind it and then leaves it at that. He is a retired gangster and a man perfectly happy to forgive. This film isn't just about revenge but also pride honor and how crime never lets go. Reno was sucked into this world of crime after committing one hit out of revenge. He hasn't been allowed to quit since. It's only later after the grisly murder of a friend that the revenge part kicks off. What I like about Reno's revenge is that he takes his time. In Faster The Rock just shoots people. Here Reno tells them he is coming and makes them sweat it out. The second half turns ALL action. It's more like a Bourne film than gangster film. The action scenes are excellent even if Reno's morality speeches are often contradictory and unnecessary. A film that mostly deals with revenge in a mature fashion showing the cyclical nature of vengeance.".

Still L'immortel is trying to sell itself to us as serious crime drama showing some historic snippets of Reno becoming the kingpin and so forth. But L'immortel never really is more than skin deep when it comes to the characters' backgrounds careers or lifestyles therefore their actions thoughts and motivations stay in the dark.L'immortel has a few highlights but complexity character development and consistency are not its strong suit. Most importantly however it lacks the street cred and its authenticity of e.g. GOMORRAH. L'immortel may not be a terrible movie but it's not much more than overcooked stew made of the genre's most frequently used ingredients.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie unexpectedly. One moment I had never even heard of it. Less than 5 minutes later I was renting it. I went to a local videoclub and its owner told me about this movie and how fantastic it was for him. He also told me this movie was brand new and that it was french and that he hadn't seen a movie like this in a long time. In other words for him it was one heck of a movie. After thinking a bit I decided to rent it.However the way this guy talked about the film made me perhaps create too much expectations on it. The movie was nothing special for me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either.One of the reasons maybe the main reason that made me give it a try was because of its nationality. It's good to see films from other countries for a change. The actor Jean Reno from 'Leon the Professional' was another reason. Also I thought of what the guy told me about the film and it was also a chance to see something different.The film is promising in the first minutes but after Jean Reno's character gets shot it isn't generally much of a movie. Since I mentioned Jean Reno's character Charly Matte getting shot that is the reason of the movie's title. The original title is 'L'immortel' 'The Immortal' in french but its alternative title is very different yet makes as much sense as the original if not more appropriate  '22 Bulletts'. Charly is shot 22 times but miraculously survives. This brutal scene reminded me of the original 'The Godfather' and an extremely violent scene which a guy gets shot about 75 times.The film is french and spoken in french language which is a good thing. I like french it's a charming language. The movie takes place in sunny Marseille France. There are some really beautiful settings and landscapes of Marseille both in the first minutes of the film but also in some other parts of it. There are also some exciting chasing scenes with fine cars but nothing beyond that.There is brutal violence in this sometimes too much for me to handle. The plot is a bit confusing as the story hardly gives enough time to understand what exactly it is about and who is who  which is quickly followed by the homicides. Certain parts are also somewhat inconsistent and mixedup.The story is basically about Charly Matte an exmobster who has been retired for 3 years he's even got a wife and 2 kids including a cute little boy who is shot by 22 bullets while his fine Volvo 850 Station Wagon was damaged by about 10 bullets in the underground parking of Marseille's Old Port and later after recovering he goes on a quest to kill those who tried to kill him and those who had anything to do with that.In conclusion it was not such a great movie for me. I prefer 'Leon the Professional' it's a better film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special  but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful magical yet earthy it has a remarkable cast with standout performances all round.A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly selfassured as 12yearold Ofelia and I especially liked her almost Alicelike approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones who gives a towering performance  and in this case literally as well as figuratively  as the guardian of the labyrinth a faun full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed his Spanish is perfect Jones speaks not a word of the language and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man'  a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of postCivil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices good and bad and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes a choice is always available  although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent  very violent but each moment of brutality although graphic has a purpose  nowhere is it gratuitous.I loved it  as I knew I would  and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece and Del Toro's greatest work to date.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful dark fairy tale that in a metaphor for Spain itself teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption violence and the death of innocents.This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised and are fairy tales in the truest sense in that they are dark fey dangerous and violent most of the story about three quarters of it in fact exists outside of the dreamland in the even more frightening and sometimes shockingly violent world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal and possibly sadistic Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife a widow of a former marriage who is carrying his son and his stepdaughter Ofelia played to absolute perfection by the then 11 year old Ivana Baquero.Uncomfortable with her new surroundings suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress they intertwine with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20minute standing ovation at Cannes when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.For all the evident truth of these observations to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them a dangerous world where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet part in terror part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency particularly at the end for a Narnialike moralism and the fact that the faun is perhaps is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year and a must see on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was and the whole 20min ovation at Cannes thing. Really who stands for that long? That said it's an amazing work.Skipping the plot recap find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama part fantasy part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy it still enchants.Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verd really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes the head housekeeper or something who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.When the fairy tale elements return it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish it may get a bit much for you.A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making the set design costumes and effects are superb. That's all.I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately and try not to read too much more.".

	schema:headline " In Depth Analysis of Interpretations";
	schema:reviewBody "Second viewing My appreciation only grows. Interpretations1st interpretation Ophelia's world is real happy ending.If this interpretation is valid we deal with themes of war and disobedience. Here Pan's Labyrinth serves as an allegory against the totalitarian regime of Fascist Spain symbolized by Vidal. Vidal is represented in the fantasy storyline by the Pale Man they both sit at the end of the table at the feasts and they are both violent and cruel. Furthermore the Pale Man is an allegory to Saturn Devouring his Son by Fransisco Goya as both Cronus and the Pale Man eat the heads off of their victims first. If Cronus represents the Pale Man and the Pale Man represents Vidal and Vidal represents Fascist Spain Del Toro implies that Fascist Spain is just as cruel as Cronus like how Cronus devours his own sons Fascist Spain kills their own people.2nd interpretation Ophelia's world is her imagination tragic ending or is it? Some might say that she was better off dead than having to live with her terrible hardships.If this interpretation is valid we deal with themes of selfdeception and how reality and fantasy can coexist. Here Pan's Labyrinth explores how Ophelia creates a fantasy for herself to deal with the harsh realities of war. In this case we can interpret the final fantasy sequence as Ophelia's imagination her creation and the world she wished to live. Besides you can tell she is still alive as Del Toro shows her lips quiver right after the fantasy sequence.ObservationsThe film features many smooth cuts which Del Toro hides with trees and black screens. This could imply how reality and fantasy intertwine supporting the second interpretation. BUT smooth cuts never go from fantasy to reality or reality to fantasy only fantasy to fantasy or reality to reality. This could suggest the first interpretation where reality and fantasy are separate.Vidal sees the monster under the bed which supports the 1st interpretation. Yet at the same time he does not see the faun at the end which supports the 2nd interpretation. But again Vidal has just consumed some kind of poison so it may be his hallucinations in which he does not see the faun.Del Toro never cuts away from the violence emphasizing the brutality of war.Cinematography is magnificent dark gloomy blue colors in reality sequences to depict its dreariness while bright vibrant reds and oranges to depict enthusiasm. In the final scenes the reds of blood and explosions stand out because the blues have become so common with the eye. Del Toro consciously had the blood and explosions to stand out to emphasize the violence of war.Notice how Del Toro establishes tension between Ophelia and Vidal When Ophelia shakes with the wrong hand Vidal points it out forming an uneasy tone between them. This first encounter between the two main characters in their respective storylines is vital for their relationship in the future scenes especially the climax.Bottom line is both interpretations are valid and Del Toro utilizes both of them to deliver both of their respective themes.As magnificent as this film is there may be authenticity flaws. For example why didn't Mercedes kill Vidal after she escaped? Is she still obedient to Vidal? Then why did he directly disobey his order at the end when Vidal asked to tell his son the time of his death? For me it's clear why Del Toro left these authenticity flaws to drive the story forward. Attempting to patch these flaws would've been at the expense of pacing and the audience's engagement is more important than plot holes.After all these flaws are more or less hidden visible only to those who know where to look.".

	onyx:emotionText "Second viewing My appreciation only grows. Interpretations1st interpretation Ophelia's world is real happy ending.If this interpretation is valid we deal with themes of war and disobedience. Here Pan's Labyrinth serves as an allegory against the totalitarian regime of Fascist Spain symbolized by Vidal. Vidal is represented in the fantasy storyline by the Pale Man they both sit at the end of the table at the feasts and they are both violent and cruel. Furthermore the Pale Man is an allegory to Saturn Devouring his Son by Fransisco Goya as both Cronus and the Pale Man eat the heads off of their victims first. If Cronus represents the Pale Man and the Pale Man represents Vidal and Vidal represents Fascist Spain Del Toro implies that Fascist Spain is just as cruel as Cronus like how Cronus devours his own sons Fascist Spain kills their own people.2nd interpretation Ophelia's world is her imagination tragic ending or is it? Some might say that she was better off dead than having to live with her terrible hardships.If this interpretation is valid we deal with themes of selfdeception and how reality and fantasy can coexist. Here Pan's Labyrinth explores how Ophelia creates a fantasy for herself to deal with the harsh realities of war. In this case we can interpret the final fantasy sequence as Ophelia's imagination her creation and the world she wished to live. Besides you can tell she is still alive as Del Toro shows her lips quiver right after the fantasy sequence.ObservationsThe film features many smooth cuts which Del Toro hides with trees and black screens. This could imply how reality and fantasy intertwine supporting the second interpretation. BUT smooth cuts never go from fantasy to reality or reality to fantasy only fantasy to fantasy or reality to reality. This could suggest the first interpretation where reality and fantasy are separate.Vidal sees the monster under the bed which supports the 1st interpretation. Yet at the same time he does not see the faun at the end which supports the 2nd interpretation. But again Vidal has just consumed some kind of poison so it may be his hallucinations in which he does not see the faun.Del Toro never cuts away from the violence emphasizing the brutality of war.Cinematography is magnificent dark gloomy blue colors in reality sequences to depict its dreariness while bright vibrant reds and oranges to depict enthusiasm.

Ofelia retreats into herself finding in her fantasy world the lessons of courage selfdiscipline and integrity she will need. With her we travel beyond outward appearances through a labyrinth of fears and uncertainties from which Spain will not escape for several decades.A dark brutal fairytale chillingly set in the real world but full of hope and warmth Pan's Labyrinth accomplishes a masterpiece.Our film opens with a momentary shot of Ofelia blood from a nosebleed disappearing as the frames are introduced in reverse. A voiceover takes us back to the time of the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother at a nationalist military base in the woods and is introduced to her stepfather a vicious commanding officer. Capitn Vidal dispenses arbitrary justice to anyone he suspects is against him. Two suspected rebels caught by his men are summarily executed. Only afterwards is a rabbit discovered in their bag proving their claim that they are just woodsmen and maybe also a throwaway reference to Alice in Wonderland. Ofelia is unwilling to accept this harsh adult world. She retreats into a labyrinth where she meets a strange Panlike creatures Fauno who gives her a set of tasks where she has to face some of her darkest fears winning a key for her next task. The story becomes more intense both outside the labyrinth where Vidal is busy torturing people and inside where Ofelia has to face the Pale Man  a creature that has plucked out its eyes and can only see by placing them in the stigmata on its hands. Around the walls of the room are pictures of people being cast into hell by the Pale Man From inference or the director's comments it is apparent that the Pale Man represents authoritarianism whether that of the Fascists or the Church. In Pan's Labyrinth we have a parable about the journey of Spanish society from the 1940s to postFranco a magical fairytale of stunning beauty a story of the struggle and character development of a child on the edge of puberty and a tense story of battles between Nationalists and Republicans. That they are all welded together seamlessly and precisely in a multilevel narrative is a remarkable achievement and thrilling experience. The sheer artistry recalls Cocteau's La Belle at la Bte. Del Toro sweeps us into a dreamlike poetic vision with a minimum of CGI and a grasp of dialogue that seems almost transcendental. In a brave decision an actor Ivana Baquero who is only as old as her character has been used to play the young Ofelia. But as the ethereal figure between two worlds she is also there to cast the earthy characters involved in material battles into more visceral contrast. Editing is crisp throughout without a single frame wasted. Rich colours and unflinching camerawork keep us rooted in the experience whether it is Ofelia crawling facedown in the mud and covered with insects or a hapless victim having his nose smashed in by the Capitn. Yet scenes of tenderness and beauty are equally as moving  Ofelia retreating into her mother's arms a nursemaid powerless to help her republican lover or a doctor performing an act of mercy.The movies like our dreams folklore and imagination are rich with symbols and images that can strike a chord in our deepest being. Artists as well as creators of myths and religion have long employed such symbols to guide and inspire knowing that the conscious mind may accept a sign more easily than rational argument alone.In watching a movie we combine ideas of the real the imaginary and the symbolic to find an inner affinity. And if the filmmaker has done his job properly will feel truly moved.One of the things that can make or break a movie that makes extensive use of symbols is whether those symbols echo in the collective unconscious often through time honoured association or not. Knowledge of mythology or Jungian psychology can make all the difference. Much has been made of the title. Originally 'El Laberinto del Fauno' the translation at first appears sloppy but Del Toro has done his research well. While quipping that it 'just sounded better' a little investigation of classical authorities shows Faunus as a form of the ancient god Pan Lempriere. Pan the goatlike god that represents a totality of possibilities together with goatlike stubbornness and independence of thought is the perfect symbol. In the film he says I've had so many names... I am the mountain the forest and the earth. . . . I am a faun. Your most humble servant Your Highness. In Greek Mythology Pan also won the affections of a princess under the form of a goat. The freedom of thought and sexuality he advocated with the rise of Christianity caused him to be portrayed as the Devil but we learn his intentions are good whereas the holylooking Pale Man offers temptation only as an excuse to rip his victims apart. As an aspect of the creative power fauns in mythology also symbolise firm aspiration and human intelligence.The one symbol that Del Torro is less adept in using is that of dying. He tends to use the valid if flawed connotation of redemptionthroughdeath promoted by the religions he disavows but it is a small point that in no way spoils the story.Pan's Labyrinth leads us through parallel stories and themes without once losing its internal consistency. Some audiences may be put off by the idea of using flights of fancy in such a blatant way or sadly by the fact that it is subtitled. Such minor monsters should not get in the way of enjoying the film on a simple entertainment level. Cinephiles on the other hand will not want to miss such a rare treat of talent.".

	schema:headline " Not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006";
	schema:reviewBody "Carmen has married Captain Vidal and pregnant with his son travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the smallest cinema on earth it wasn't but it must have been close. Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which contrary to the marketing is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging realworld horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where like the real world she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but as much as I want to see this it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story although less so the real parts and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the horror part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door in the UK this was rated a 15. At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story again specifically the fantasy.By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue albeit subtitled interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. Lpez could have hammed it up but while he doesn't really make a person here he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verd is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Carmen has married Captain Vidal and pregnant with his son travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the smallest cinema on earth it wasn't but it must have been close. Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which contrary to the marketing is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging realworld horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where like the real world she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but as much as I want to see this it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story although less so the real parts and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the horror part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door in the UK this was rated a 15. At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story again specifically the fantasy.By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue albeit subtitled interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything.

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres including drama fantasy thriller and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film The Devil's Backbone 2001 the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror suspense and coming of age during the war time story.I hoped and expected Pan's Labyrinth to be as compelling insightful interesting and engaging as The Devil's Backbone was. I finally saw Pan's Labyrinth couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as Forbidden Games Spirits of the Beehive which Pan's Labyrinth tried to be but never was the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war as well as Wizard of Oz Alice in Wonderland Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece. One movie that Pan's Labyrinth has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's Tideland his fairy tale for adults his Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho which also tells the story of an 11yearsold girl and her world of imagination. Tideland was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with Tideland but I found it much more interesting that Pan's Labyrinth in all aspects. The main difference between the two  Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in Pan Labyrinth. I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story the writerdirector was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia and who would not feel empathy for an 11yearold girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous stepfather but if frankly her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's Tideland that was completely ignored by the Academy is always technically superb visually arresting and much more impressive than Pan's Labyrinth. I should admit that at least one scene in Labyrinth was absolutely brilliant  dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting Saturn Devouring His Children and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling Pan's Labyrinth a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards The Devil's Backbone is much more deserving than Pan's Labyrinth and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had unsurmountable expectations for this one and alas they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film but as a whole it feels halfbaked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War a little girl Ofelia is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill where her new husband a sadistic army captain awaits. At the mill she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly except for a couple of sequences there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive though is that Guillermo del Toro extends the twodimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films the director did of course previously make Blade II and Hellboy. Wow it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't really. I have some ideological problems with it obviously and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horrorfantasy film. You could do better but you could do worse too.".

But the praise this is getting from critics and people writing here is way over the top. I was fully expecting a work of real vision andor originality but what I experienced was a film that borrows from other films and admittedly gels everything together into a cohesive and impressive whole. A lot of great films do the same but 'Pans Labrynth' has other faults that prevent it from being put in the same category as the truly great films. 'Pans Labrynth' at times is too predictable  a side effect from borrowing from other films  therefore some scenes feel clichd. Also the tasks the girl has to complete in order to take her place as princess could have been more imaginatively realized. Finally the messagepointallegory of the film is trite and simplistic.

I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best according to current IMDb ratings movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said it is a good picture. However I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adultoriented nature was due to its substance such as an intellectual sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adultoriented however merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout becomes fairly predictable and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse show some blood and have pretty imagery.Please see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also however allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adultoriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies.".

Sadly that moment never came.Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.1. Though truly beautifully shot Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children'spicture on the one side and a dramawarmovie on the other provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful. 2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the wardrama bit I was very disappointed that it had no followthrough and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless clonedoff shortimpression of movies like Alice in Wonderland The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story to name but a few but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies. 3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in I found it all annoyingly superficial and clich. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. In the end of it all there is simply no hope..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappyhappyendings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end. Furthermore with style over substance as its fort the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their too obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways powerful story AND powerful cinematography which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional moviecritic who somehow seem to think that foreigndifferentMasterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories a it was too violent b the fantasy element was too mutedWithout getting too political worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world one shouldn't get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. Capitn Vidal was a fictitious character but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology such as parallel worlds dangerous tasks hidden identities sacrifice and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie which is part of why it was such a great film.".

	schema:headline " A Terrible Misfire...";
	schema:reviewBody "I seem to be among the only people who consider this movie to be a terrible misfire on a par with Shyamalan's Lady in the Water and Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm.So be it. I shall back that claim up.Many people are reportedly enjoying the movie's ability to 'reinterpret traditional fairy tale motifs'.If only that was what del Toro was up to here. He didn't reinterpret anything. He just grabbed a bunch of classic themes and plot points the three tasks the magical guide the unexplained magic rocks that are the bane of an evil creature for some reason the magic book that foretells the future the golden key and the choice of keyholes the prohibition against eating in the underworld that is broken simply because it would be no fun if it weren't the magical creatures that adults can't see because they aren't really there the young girl on the cusp of puberty who fears her growing sexuality and capacity for reproduction and so retreats into a fantasy world to deal with her traumatic environment the climactic flight into a maze that is conveniently nearby and threw them into a ridiculously drawn shadow of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. On this front Sergi Lopez and his lame impression of Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List was particularly outrageous. The points which are meant to build him into a threatening character were always taken from elsewhere and even worse always CAME ACROSS as points meant to build him into a threatening character his vaguely harassing caress of Mercedes' shoulder his rampant chauvinism his graphic crushing of an innocent farmer's face his slashing at his own reflected throat with a straight razor his tortured relationship with his dead father's watch...etc. At no time did he seem like anything more than a caricature.Unfortunately this was not unusual. The overall weak characterization meant that any real sense of Fascist Spain was just entirely missing and the brief fantasy sequences lacked any real resonance.The dinner party was meant to relate the connections between the wealthy the church and the Fascists but it was too short to register.The faun himself had few lines and was entirely cryptic. If Ofelia was simply dreaming him up this perhaps accounts for the fact that she was never not for one second surprised that a giant faun was offering her faeries and tasks but not his complete lack of any helpful worldbuilding clues. And since we are not welcomed into his world the threat of its destruction simply doesn't matter to us. The predicament of Mercedes didn't make any sense. Why was she not in the mountains with her lover? Was her ability to sneak mail and keys to hilariously flimsy wooden doors out to the rebels really so essential? In fact having a few female rebels would have been more authentic and less offensive than having them all chopping potatoes for the Captain. Did anyone for one second think that she would not find some use for that blade she kept tucked into her dress? Why did she not kill Vidal when he was at her mercy? She had no trouble later on. Was it really because he needed to live in order to continue driving the plot? Because that would be pathetic.Did Ofelia's mother actually say out loud that she married a cold brutal psychopath who made it clear that he valued her only as a vessel for childbirth simply because she was 'lonely'? What the hell was up with that? I mean as the widow of a tailor it isn't as though she needed to marry a soldier in order to maintain her accustomed level of luxury. Why be so massively antifeminist simply because you can? The death of the doctor who tries to make a moral statement despite offering his skills to the Fascists whom he hates was also hackneyed. Hint Don't turn your 'sympathetic' character into a cowardly Fascist collaborator who is so terrified of losing his sense of privilege that he would rather euthanize rebels than fight alongside them.The attempts to work in allegories of change the death of Vidal the fact that his son would never know of him the sly glances at 'Red Propaganda' which claims that we are all equal also caused me to frown.Franco won in '39 the 'heroic' rebels who were just as given to atrocity were hunted to extinction and the Fascists ruled well into the 1970s ruining the lives of further millions socialism in the Spanishspeaking countries turned out to be just as bad. Just what the hell is del Toro getting at? He seems very muddled. Even the special effects which are getting excellent press were cartoonish and poorly executed. The toad that vomited up its tongue wouldn't have been out of place in The Phantom Menace nor would the fairies whom Ofelia never quite seemed to be looking at...and did I actually spot a goddamn elfear on Ofelia's resurrected mother? Leftover sets and props from the Lord of the Rings I suppose.The overall lesson seems to have been that innocence is lost and death is everywhere so the only course is to delude oneself to the point that you are willing to trust 'the voices'. Ofelia needed psychiatric treatment not a richer fantasy life. There was no value to my mind in her visions or her death. And that WAS a tragedy of a different kind than the one intended. I could go on but I'll stop there. PS. If you thought that this film was excellent just wait until Coraline comes out. Then you might see a truly reinterpreted fairy tale with a greater depth of explanation mystery and menace.".

The cinematography is quite impressive and del Toro displays a fine visual flair. However the script is too random and contrived to be interesting and the characters are onedimensional. The captain for example is pure evil lacking a single redeeming character his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents but the two threads don't complement each other.

By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc development evolution. It is in fact a formula movie this thread and one that follows a formula that is based on strict strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by The Captain the bad guy here.It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than Dark Crystal which was similarly banal in its cosmology?Look I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like The Matrix but if lacking in imagination is copying was deep complex manylayered. This is something that Franco would have written and little fascist parents would have trotted to because its all about absolutes and the inability of humans to be rich subtle varied beings.The best we can do is be innocent.I often can see some good in any film.

Pan's Labyrinth PL is the most typical example when it's completely incomprehensible for me how a movie can be so highly rated. The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of storytelling technique but the story is so unpleasant onedimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema which almost never happens.Since I do not understand how anyone can find this movie enjoying I will just try help you people who get disturbed by the same movie elements as myself. So if you often find the following aspects annoying in movies you should be careful before buying a ticket to this one. Oversimplification of evil through characters that are extremely bad for no obvious reason black or white  no gray scales  Extreme violence that is completely pointless and makes you feel sick Sympathetic characters that you are supposed to sympathize with immediately without really getting to know them  Two parallel storypaths fantasy vs reality none of which has any absorbing plot and are completely unrelated to each other during most of the movieNormally I hate when people express their anger and give a 1 star rating because they hate a movie that everyone else finds so great so the only good thing about PL is that I can at least start to understand how people can become so angry with a so called cinematic masterpiece.PS. My interpretation is that PL is a movie for artistic people that enjoy getting emotional through fuzzy fairy tales about good and evil whereas it is not a movie for thinking people that wants to attain a higher understanding of the good and evil in man with some structure and logical congruence in the end. OK PL actually has some congruence in the end but this doesn't save a movie that is simply repugnant from start to finish.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished the movie today and I must say that this is by far one of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have seen in years. The producers of the film were right to call this a modern fairytale since it has all the ingredients for an authentic Brothers Grimm story. Just don't expect there to be lots of happy faces in the film. This is a real bloody very bloody moody emotional fairy tale just like the ones in the past.First of all I have to say that the technical design in this film was astounding. The art direction was spot on for all the locations whether its the imaginary world of the labyrinth or the mill that the fascists call their base. The music is some of the best I've heard in a film for a long time drawing that fantasy feel of the movie perfectly and inspiring so many emotions in one chord than other films could in their whole screening. The sound was top notch as well never sounding like just a compilation of reused sound effects. And of course the makeup design is flawless and imaginative. The biggest shock was the cinematography. Now I personally thought Children of Men should have got the Oscar for this but understand now why this won. Each shot is beautifully staged colored and detailed in a way that they cease to be movie shots and become portraits of art.Guillermo Del Toro really surprised me. Not only did he assemble a surprisingly talented cast but he was able to make you really connect with the situation. The characters are all well developed and the symbolism though subtle is so delicious that it makes me tingle with the thought of it. The dialogue is natural and authentic and he handles the film expertly to convey that timeless feel even through some of the film's harsher moments. You really feel this is a labor of love since it bears its fruits at every scene. I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene.If I had any complaints its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation.".

I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene.If I had any complaints its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation.";

All this and the 80ies editions of German weekly Der Spiegel come to mind while watching 23.The main character Karl Koch is a highstrung intelligent youth without a family some sort of modern time Young Werther who is obsessed with personal computers and a weird science fiction story in which a world wide conspiracy of Illuminates is described. The figure 23 is the secret code of the conspirers.

Apparently the story is based on true facts the young man  and his friend did enter computer systems of nuclear power stations military installations etc. and they did deliver information to an intelligence agency in East Berlin.

So Karl Koch's life spirals downward he is guilt ridden and ever more close to acute persecution mania. When the 80ies are over and the Iron Curtain is lifted it is over with Karl Koch. He pays a heavy price for his obsessions.Tragic as the overall story is there are quite a few really funny scenes. A fine sense of humor prevails throughout the story.

	schema:headline " Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you.";
	schema:reviewBody "Or so it says. The 1998 movie 23 centers on paranoia hacking and government involvement. Even if the references related to the number are interesting I'm not too fond of the title. They could have come up with something better here. What I was very much fond of though is August Diehl's performances. He plays young German hacker Karl Koch whose death is as mysterious as his life to this day a man who starts out as a true revolutionary but finally becomes just a pawn in the hands of the mighty and powerful. And I was not the only one who was amazed by Diehl's portrayal. He had not acted in movies before was in his early 20s not even 23 when this film was made and won right away Best Lead Actor at the German Film Awards that year. This film was the cinematic birth of one of the finest German actors of the last 15 years. Because of his looks many compare him to the young Christopher Walken and to this day that Diehl slowly approaches 40 you'll have a hard time to find another actor in the Germanspeaking parts of the world who's that gifted in portraying the abysses of the human soul you could maybe make a case for Daniel Brhl in Das weie Rauschen. He's starred in many German films since his breakthrough and also here and there in Hollywood. His turn in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds was a real highlight and he showed tremendous screen presence that makes you regret he was in it only for so little time.But Diehl is not the only impressive component 23 was HansChristian Schmid's second film for the big screen and he was only in his early 30s at this point as well. Just like Diehl Schmid made it to the top of his branch in the last 15 years. The two united for Schmid's film Distant Lights a couple years later but Diehl only had a supporting part there and I truly hope we'll soon get another SchmidDiehl movie starring Diehl as a meaty lead character. Another actor I love is Burghart Klauner but his part here was just too small and insignificant to really make a difference. It's all about Diehl.

Another highlight are the many references to political events this movie includes like the Palme murder.It's a decent film. I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite German movies or best films I've seen from 1998 but for those interested in the by now not so new wave of German Cinema it's truly worth a watch. Let me close this review by saying another thing I liked was the famous Ton Steine ScherbenRio Reiser song used for the ending credits. It fit the tone of the film nicely and is just such a classic. Sometimes German films struggle with their choices of music but this was a perfect pick.".

	onyx:emotionText "Or so it says. The 1998 movie 23 centers on paranoia hacking and government involvement. Even if the references related to the number are interesting I'm not too fond of the title. They could have come up with something better here. What I was very much fond of though is August Diehl's performances. He plays young German hacker Karl Koch whose death is as mysterious as his life to this day a man who starts out as a true revolutionary but finally becomes just a pawn in the hands of the mighty and powerful. And I was not the only one who was amazed by Diehl's portrayal. He had not acted in movies before was in his early 20s not even 23 when this film was made and won right away Best Lead Actor at the German Film Awards that year. This film was the cinematic birth of one of the finest German actors of the last 15 years. Because of his looks many compare him to the young Christopher Walken and to this day that Diehl slowly approaches 40 you'll have a hard time to find another actor in the Germanspeaking parts of the world who's that gifted in portraying the abysses of the human soul you could maybe make a case for Daniel Brhl in Das weie Rauschen. He's starred in many German films since his breakthrough and also here and there in Hollywood. His turn in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds was a real highlight and he showed tremendous screen presence that makes you regret he was in it only for so little time.But Diehl is not the only impressive component 23 was HansChristian Schmid's second film for the big screen and he was only in his early 30s at this point as well. Just like Diehl Schmid made it to the top of his branch in the last 15 years. The two united for Schmid's film Distant Lights a couple years later but Diehl only had a supporting part there and I truly hope we'll soon get another SchmidDiehl movie starring Diehl as a meaty lead character. Another actor I love is Burghart Klauner but his part here was just too small and insignificant to really make a difference. It's all about Diehl. Storywise the film is fine especially in those moments where the fine line between paranoia and actually being followed blurs. Another highlight are the many references to political events this movie includes like the Palme murder.It's a decent film.

That's the question I asked myself after watching 23. Maybe it's for the better that the question doesn't get a clear answer because there won't be one.

In my opinion the film renders quite a nice picture of what must have been the atmosphere during this period in German history at the same time allowing a look back at early hacking.

	schema:reviewBody "The 90s was home to a slew of great raw uncut action flicks that shot straight for the rated R despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the moneyfriendly PG13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jumpstarted this craze the peak of this was during the next decade when we saw the likes of Terminator 2 Speed FaceOff Con Air Die Hard With a Vengeance The Matrix Bad Boys Point Break Under Siege True Lies Desperado among others Quite a list I accumulated eh?. The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful gripping and edgeofyour seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects superb acting great action set pieces and good dosage of writing and Michael Bay on top of his game.Few action movies carries as much morality and questionable circumstances as this one. In The Rock we follow a furious general Ed Harris leading a group of Marines to take control of Alcatraz Island along with tourist hostages a location that used to house criminals. Accompanying them are over a dozen missiles that can spell tens of thousands of innocent lives with every blast. However he isn't just a triggerhappy man gone crazy he is a man seeking justice for the dozens of lives he saw taken from warfare without compensation. A villain with a moral agenda yikes. The only hope for the United States is the only man that has ever broken out of that prison Sean Connery and a chemical superfreak Nicholas Cage. With the odds obviously against them the Pentagon is one order away from destroying the entire location regardless of the innocent lives located in the island. Mindless this movie is not as the stakes are high there is always a risk of an innocent life going under and our heroes rarely ever have the scenario under control. It's just enough to make you squeal in frustration.With the tension remaining edgy and the solution never being ohsoclose we can thank the writers for delivering a slambang storyline full of great oneliners likable characters and a villain that isn't as simple to figure out as the average evildoer. The writing staff ranges from the writer of the third Die Hard to even Tarantino. A major reason for the film's quality is the casting. Sean Connery and Ed Harris are excellent in their roles and Nicholas Cage albeit a few lines does a good job. The supporting staff helps as well as we see the likes of David Morse John Spencer and Cage's love interest Vanessa Marcil.Unlike Michael Bay's latest films which run from mediocre to just plain bad he blends plenty of drama and suspense along with action here. As a matter of fact the first half of the movie is all suspense as the situation is developed and the risks are presented. Disregarding a superb car chase there isn't much exploding in the first 80 minutes. However once the protagonists enter the Rock it all goes on the uphill action swing. We get brutal fights brutal shootouts nearmisses doublecrosses triplecrosses chases and enough explosions for action fans to sink their teeth into. The funny thing the two main actors at the time weren't expected to be in such action. Connery was aging and Nicholas Cage just didn't have the look or the attitude for it. Fortunately for us they proved us dead wrong.Bottom Line If you want to see a true action classic The Rock is a great example. Rising above the average action movie and above the decent ones as well this is by far Michael Bay's best work and one of the signature flicks of the 90s. Combining tension you can cut with a steak knife with thrills chills and plenty of carnage The Rock has aged well and continues to influence the work of modern action movies and the work of Michael Bay as well. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this ruthlessly clever movie. Recommend to the max as long as you don't mind a bit of blood spewing onto the screen. They just don't make em' like they used to.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rock is one of my alltime favorite suspense  thrillers. Believability  almost always a problem for this sort of film  is enhanced by a very compelling script sets and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting editing directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage  in a performance which approaches his best work  adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture and John Spencer Tony Todd David Morse and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting fastpaced and emotionally draining film. Any avid moviegoer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.The plot takes a number of twists and turns along the road so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoilers. None of the plot twists are unbelievable if you are willing to accept the basic premise. The story begins with Ed Harris  a Viet Nam war hero and field leader who is now a general and has become fed up with the abandonment of covert forces operatives by the US government. To get what he wants he recruits some of the best officers under his command to take control of and hold Alcatraz Island holding 70someodd civilians hostage and aiming four missiles loaded with deadly Sarin gas directly at the heart of San Francisco.Biehn heads an elite Navy SEAL team assigned to infiltrate and disable Harris' capabilities.

Connery's John Mason escaped from Alcatraz during his incarceration and for all intents and purpose  is a much rougher more real James Bond character without the gadgets and the comicbook supervillains.

There are no discernible powerful political messages in this film. While it must be acknowledged that the USA does sometimes treat members of its armed forces in an unappreciative and cavalier manner this film does not really drive this point home in the way that for example Saving Private Ryan did. While it is also true that the US government does occasionally coverup its own illegal activities or softpedal them with propagandistic white lies these issues are not really the subject of this film. This is made abundantly clear by the oddly outofplace references to Roswell New Mexico. The writers either did not want to dignify any perceived political messages by bringing up realworld transgressions and coverups  many of which are far more sinister than the secret development of stealth planes. This film is pure entertainment and  at that  a work of art. Treat it as such and you might just have a good time with it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Rock is one of my alltime favorite suspense  thrillers. Believability  almost always a problem for this sort of film  is enhanced by a very compelling script sets and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting editing directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage  in a performance which approaches his best work  adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture and John Spencer Tony Todd David Morse and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting fastpaced and emotionally draining film. Any avid moviegoer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.The plot takes a number of twists and turns along the road so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoilers. None of the plot twists are unbelievable if you are willing to accept the basic premise. The story begins with Ed Harris  a Viet Nam war hero and field leader who is now a general and has become fed up with the abandonment of covert forces operatives by the US government. To get what he wants he recruits some of the best officers under his command to take control of and hold Alcatraz Island holding 70someodd civilians hostage and aiming four missiles loaded with deadly Sarin gas directly at the heart of San Francisco.Biehn heads an elite Navy SEAL team assigned to infiltrate and disable Harris' capabilities. Cage joins him as the FBI biochemical specialist assigned the task of disarming the warheads and the only man who can get them in to do their respective jobs is an aging British intelligence agent who has been incarcerated for 30 years or so by the government that now needs his help. Connery's John Mason escaped from Alcatraz during his incarceration and for all intents and purpose  is a much rougher more real James Bond character without the gadgets and the comicbook supervillains.

	schema:reviewBody "THE ROCK  1996 12Starring Sean Connery Nicolas Cage Ed Harris Jon Spencer David Morse William Forsythe Bokeem Woodbine and Vanessa Marcil. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time 135 minutes. Rated R for strong intense violence language and brief sexualityNotes taken while screening The Rock The film contains superior character development of both the antagonist and protagonist. Each is clear and well defined. We also learn the characters motives reasoning dramatic situation and premiseall brilliantly introduced within the setup. Sean Connery provides us with strong character development through John Patrick Masonalthough the character is somewhat a rip off of the Anthony Hokins' Hannibal from The Silence of the Lambs. It is uncanny how well the movie's visual style works. It propels the film's suspense the extra mile increasing the tension and enticement. Also contributing to the style is the fitting soundtrack. Some of the events are excessively coincidental. For example during an exciting chase scene Mason dashes out of a building escaping the clutches of concealing police discovering a HumV seemingly awaiting his arrival. Experienced chemist Stanley Goodspeed Nicolas Cage chases after him in a high speed Ferrari  sitting outside his position in a building. Another coincidence occurs in the high security prison where Mason escapes a grenade blast by dashing at random into a room where of course there just so happens to be a secure bathtub to climb in.  There is a stolid aggressively effective cast present. Each actor contributes a taut penetrating performance especially Ed Harris as the film's villain General Francis X. Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake. The character's motives and perfectly defined especially General Francis X. Hummel.  Even as the film's bad guy he serves an understandable position thus we empathize with him unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers. The standard three act structure is flawless each scene propels the plot forward. The sequences either create a new problem or complicate a previous conflict favoring with the later concept. This raises the line of tension even further. Most of the production takes place in a high security prison Alcatraz crafted with a complex aweinspiring atmosphere towering over that of most action movies. Sean Connery handles the complicated role of John Mason with mere simplicity yet easily torments the audience with a sense of omniscient knowledge of the plot. The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us. The conclusion is not fomulatic. The Rock is filled with artful design and crafty performances. It is one of the year's best action films.Brought to you by  Hollywood Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is definitely for action junkies. If you enjoy disecting a movie looking for silly dialogue plot holes or looking for innermeaning in a movie you might want to skip The Rock. This movie is 2 hours 15 minutes but the action is almost nonstop and the movie moves briskly. It's typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare including plenty of action an implausible storyline and big stars doing a fine job of acting.Some Bruckheimer characteristic events were obvious such as the scene immediately after the car chase where Cage stands and the camera rotates around him. This is reminescent of a similar scene in Bad Boys another Bruckheimer film where Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are standing in a similar pose with the same rotating camera view. Also present was the presidential address and accompanying slowmotion dramatic scenes near the end ala Armageddon. I'm not saying it's bad for Bruckheimer to reuse his old ideas just that if I was able to spot them other people probably did as well.Some of the dialogue was way over the top and tended to get a bit macho and silly. When Mason tells Lomax ...you're between the Rock and a hard case I felt like groaning. There was plenty of selfreferential comments such as this one where Mason refers to himself as a hard case. There were also other comments where the characters would try to build up the other characters such as when Lomax says You don't know Mason. I hate it when movies do this. They try to make you believe how tough a character is by other characters talking about him. I would prefer to SEE how tough he is by his actions rather than be told about it constantly using dialogue. Several parts of the movie such as the stalemate in the shower seemed melodramatic and reheased. I couldn't imagine Michael Biehn in real life giving the We spilt the same blood in the same mud speech to a general that's holding a gun on him but that's just my opinion.Cage plays the geek very well with some very humorous scenes. The scene near the beginning where he's difusing the bomb and finding the Playboy mags and gas mask and his assistant screaming about the long needle was darkly hilarious. I love that sort of humor. There were lots of very good scripting such as the dialogue between Cage and Connery about the difference between winners and losers and Cage's Actually I'm a chemical SUPERfreak response was a great oneliner.I did feel like there some were plot holes or at least some weird occurances. For example when Cage calls his girlfriend and tells her not to come to San Francisco she yells back into the phone Like hell I won't! and hangs up. Why would she do that? Wouldn't she more likely ask something like Why not? Or at the very least maybe start accusing him of being with another woman? Of course this was the perfect vehicle for her to come to San Francisco against his wishes and have to be rescued. It didn't make sense but it made the story move along. Also she runs away from the FBI agent when he comes to pick up her. Why? Because the FBI agent refused to answer her questions about where her boyfriend Cage is. Why would she run away? I would assume the FBI agent is there to take me to safety or to her boyfriend. But again by running away this furthers the plotnow she's in danger and Cage can agonize about her fate and thus he has motivation to disarm the poison rockets. If she had stayed and allowed the FBI to whisk her to safety he would not have been motivated to save the city. He'd already been shown to be a bit of a coward in the scene where he's throwing up out of nervousness. Of course in other scenes he's terribly heroic. His character was a bit inconsistent but you could explain it as him being thrust into the situation and once there exceeding his prior limits.The incinerator was another weird plot device. It looked a bit unrealistic. It was obviously something dreamed up for an action movie with moving cogs wheels that would turn and have to be dodged by the hero all the while fire is rushing through the same area. I've seen an incinerator and it didn't resemble this monstrosity at all. I have no idea if the motion sensor that detected the marines arrival was accurate and if the military really has something this sophisticated but I thought it was an ingenius idea.You may feel differently but I actually enjoyed the villains of the story more than the heroes. Most of the lines that struck me as powerful were delivered by the noble villains Harris and Morse. I found the combination of Ed Harris David Morris and Michael Biehn admittedly not a villain in this movie a powerful combination. I consider all these actors excellent and the stalemate in the shower room was especially powerful as well as the standoff with the villains near the end. These scenes didn't feature Connery or Cage or the occasional humorous tension breaker. These scenes showed us that all villains are not the same and that some villains are evil and some just misguided. This degree of gray in an otherwise black and white character movie added a level of complexity to the film. Thus a film that I would have otherwise said was okay became a really good action movie with some characters that I actually cared about.There was lots of violence and profanity and a brief sexual situation although no nudity near the beginning. Despite my problems with some of the dialogue and plot I found this movie enjoyable and engaging. If you don't mind overly macho acting and some silliness in the dialogue and you love action then you'll probably love this movie. If seeing serious characterization and motivation if more your style you might want to check out Steel Magnolias and leave The Rock at the video store.".

	schema:headline " Finally an action film about its characters";
	schema:reviewBody "The Rock is an action movie alright but it's an action move about its characters and that's what saves it. It has a strong cast and strong characters and therefore the plot about a militia group taking Alcatraz hostage and threatening to fire bombs into San Francisco if they don't get 100 million dollars isn't what comes off the best.There are four central characters in this film. Hummel is the man in charge of this hostage takeover. He is a highlyranked general who is doing this to teach the government a lesson they've been neglecting forgotten soldiers who died in the Gulf and Nam and instead of their families being told the truth they've simply been marked as Missing in Action. He is played by Ed Harris who does such a good man torn between duty conscience and vengeance he is the best film villain since Jack Nicholson in The Shining.Goodspeed is a computer nerd working for the C.I.A. He's never been in combat situations but because of his advanced knowledge of chemical bombs they've sent him into Alcatraz with a group of Navy SEALS and he has no idea how to react in warlike situations. Played by Nicolas Cage his performance is believable and powerful.Anderson is the man in control of the Navy SEALS on the mission to Alcatraz. Tough as nails bound by duty he freely admits he agrees with Hummel's reasoning but he says those are risks that are part of the job and Hummel is wrong in his action because he took an oath to serve his country no matter what. He is played by Michael Biehn who delivers a topnotch performance and one similar to his role in Terminator.But the most powerful character in the film is Mason the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Tough cunning and full of oneliners he has been caged up in a maximum security prison for years. It's hard to say whether the viewer can trust him or not and he has many secrets and much knowledge of the facility...which is why he was chosen to go with the SEALS. He is played by Sean Connery who's performance is perfectly Sean Conneryish. But who would want it any other way?This film is great and it is a great character study for anyone who might be majoring in it or just likes to watch films with good casts. Recommended. 12 out of .".

	schema:headline " Michael Bay's best...";
	schema:reviewBody "To sum up the Rock succinctly is fairly easy it is a buddy film. This is a movie that brings all sorts of clichs together but achieves the difficult success of making them seem like they're original and apt.In short The Rock doesn't have an original bone in its body but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Michael Bay the film's director who is somewhat notorious due to his penchant for mindless action clearly hadn't learnt many of the bad tricks he's picked up in more recent offerings. Most impressively for Bay rather than spending genuine hours with over the top car chases helicopter action foot chases and just about everything else we've all come to loathe in 'A Michael Bay Film' the director succeeds in turning in an extremely tight well paced movie which thrusts you into the top notch action almost immediately but doesn't fail to show you the human side of the protagonists. Nicolas Cage is excellent as the lab rat Stanley Goodspeed a man who would probably call himself a geek. He's happy drives the epitome of dull vehicles has a gorgeous girlfriend and usually lives a very boring life. However work in any department of the FBI during a Michael Bay film is seldom going to be prosaic and it's not long before good old Stanley is disarming bombs getting sprayed with poisonous gas and finding out unfortunate ill timed wonderful news... But that's all in a day's work. What is unusual is when Ed Harris wonderfully straight laced and sincere steals a number of rockets armed with a chemical capable of eradicating an entire city in the time it takes to breath in the gas... Harris' or General Hummel's choice of target is San Francisco and what better choice of venue to launch a battery of VX poison gas a compound that exists and is genuinely as horrible as described than Cisco's most famous penitentiary? Hummel turns up with a bunch of 'can do' type marines who all agree that America particularly the Pentagon has been screwing the Special Forces for too long... it must stop! Naturally as a bona fide patriot and all round good army guy Hummel reckons the best way to achieve this is to take several dozen tourists hostage on Alcatraz aka the Rock ring up the director of the FBI and demand 100 million dollars most of which will be given away in a fairly hefty act of altruism. The fact that none of this rings untrue is the central tenet of the movie and is all down to Harris whose lined worried face manages with almost no overacting to portray a wide range of emotions. These vary from impassioned orator to reluctant villain and he does it with a wit and skill that Michael Bay might well not have asked for. Regardless having such an excellent central bad guy is what pulls The Rock away from the pack.It's also helped by Cage's comedic foil in all this Sean Connery clearly relishing the part he receives and probably amazed that someone decided that he could genuinely be Scottish in at least one major role! With a mixture of twinkly eyes physical brawn and his typical slurred delivery big Sean comes away with the lion's share of the good lines and the humour his best moments coming when he's face to face with Harris or nattering with Cage.The two leads work very well together the hyperactive fidgety Cage inhabiting Stanley with just the right mixture of nervous fear and 'let's do it!' attitude. Connery smirks his way through the entire piece loving every wet dark dank moment while Harris is clearly on another plane of acting imagining himself as the devil's advocate rather than another bad as sin Michael Bay villain. All in all the film cannot be faulted for its three principles the pacing the script the one liners the quality of acting the suspension of disbelief or any of the things that have grated on me at least with films like Bad Boys 1 and 2 Pearl Harbour The Island and so forth. This is a tightly wound action thriller that achieves both goals handsomely throwing in the comedy and happy ending without detracting from anything.That is not to say there aren't faults. One personal bugbear is Hanz Zimmer's awful use of panpipes to indicate moments of emotional growth. There are occasions when Cage's wide eyed mania gets a little annoying and the standard continuity problems are present... how does Connery's John Mason get from hanging upside down on a wrecked mining cart to poised delicately above a pair of marines who are travelling on an entirely separate vehicle? However these problems are usually over before they've started and seldom detract from the feeling of fun and excitement. Other standouts are the supporting cast John Spencer on fine waspy form for example the limited well crafted car chase not chases including one of the most legendary lines ever committed to film from Cage and the rest.In short this is as perfect an action film as you're ever likely to see creating an overall product certainly the equal of if not superior to the sum of its parts. I'd advise any fan of action flicks who hasn't seen this movie to buy it not just see it at the first possibility. However there's unlikely to be that many of you!".

There is NO better man to play an officer with a conscience than Ed Harris. Period. Contrary to the awful Colonel Trautman Richard Crenna at his... well usual level I suppose Harris acting is flawless. Then there is Nicholas Cage who is always good in this sort of role the guy who is stronger than he thinks and shows courage when it really counts. Sean Connery is of course great as he always is but sad to say the scriptwriters gave him some really cheesy comments such as winners go home and fk the prom queen. I mean that's not the line you'd like an actor like Connery to deliver. Really. Just as we would not like to hear JeanClaude Van Damme read lines from some play of Shakespeare. Anyway I have to correct myself. A little. Along side with Ed Harris Michael Biehn is the perfect guy to play an officer. I mean do people think of him as ANYTHING else? No don't think so. Aliens The Abyss Terminator Navy SEALs the guy is a soldier! He plays the role really good as always. And the supporting roles of William Forsythe among others is also good. Well enough about the actors. The music gave me goose bumps. Perfect action movie music. In my mind only met by Alan Silvestri's music for Predator. I am from Sweden and like most of my countrymen we aren't to keen on flagwaving movies  of which The Rock is a great example along side with Armageddon and Independence Day. The Americans save the world! Sometimes we get the notion that you guys forget that there are other countries that are just as technologically advanced as you. Well I had to put in a little criticism in here! Other than that I give The Rock an 810.".

With great special effects and action great acting and a comicbook style story that is intriguing in all its aspects The Rock should be seen by all. Ed Harris plays an angry determined exGeneral from the U.S. military who fought in many wars and was respected by many people from high positions in the government. However he has radical views and believes that the U.S. government never supported American soldiers who fought overseas and returned home and received no rewards for their sacrifice. To prove his point Harris directs a group of former Marines who steal several chemical missiles from a weapons depot and plant them in an isolated spot that would be hard to invade Alcatraz Island! What better place for a base of operations than a deserted island with an unused prison? Harris and his thugs threaten to launch chemical missiles at San Francisco Bay which could kill hundreds of thousands instantly unless he and other former marines are paid 100 million by the U.S. government. Since when does our government bow to the demands of terrorists? Whether global jihadists or angry domestic troublemakers negotiation with the enemy is not an option...Nicholas Cage is a young FBI chemicalweapons expert who is sent along with a group of soldiers as well as Sean Connery a lifelong prisoner who is sent in with the soldiers because he knows the layout of Alcatraz having been the only prisoner there to ever escape. They plan to stop Harris from firing his missiles but they are met inside the prison by an ambush of heavy fire remember the terrorists here are welltrained decorated former U.S. soldiers and many are killed. Alone and planning to save many innocent lives Cage and Connery plot to fight until they win over the prison's occupiers and save America from bowing to terrorist demands.... This film was fantastic and was a great action film running along the ranks of Air Force One and FaceOff... Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...".

Enter Cage who must with a pack of government marines enter Alcatraz from underneath under water and take out HimmelHummel. That's where Sean Connery comes in as John Mason the only man to ever escape Alcatraz unscathed. Connery agrees' to help them enter the prison the same way he escaped.The Rock' is pure unadulterated fun. Nothing less nothing more. It delivers everything you want in an action film Explosions guns special effects and more explosions. If you can't have fun watching a movie like this you can't have fun watching a movie. Period.The acting in The Rock' is nothing to scoff at. Nicolas Cage is great in this role as in other action roles. The thing that is different here however is that Nic doesn't know how to use weapons much he is a chemical expert not a trained FBI agent. So it is more than humorous to see him running around defenseless especially seeing that it is Nicolas Cage who usually plays action roles where he is the master of the weapons.Sean Connery is perfect for the role of John Mason he blends wisecracks action andwellSean Connery.Ed Harris is also very good as Himmelhummelwhatever he seems a bit held back at times but overall his acting is as good as ever.The direction style in The Rock' reminds me very much of other Nicolas Cage films like John Woo's FaceOff' and such. It is gritty dark and exciting. It adapts to the characters' emotions.The first thirty minutes or so of The Rock' are nothing special I almost stopped watching at one point. But once they get to Alcatraz the action picks up and never slows down. Explosion after explosions after gunfight after stunts leading to an explosive ending literally that may be predictable to a certain degree but nevertheless lotsa' fun.All in all The Rock' is the kind of movie where you sit back turn off your brain for two hours and have some slambam fun.45 stars John Ulmer".

This scene is pulsating with potential action until the pivotal moment when all hell breaks loose.

The one moment that will forever make me love this movie is when the general says to the camera I did not want this...damn you for forcing me to make this decision.

The first and second movie are awesome scifi action flicks.I read so many negative reviews how the fans and critics dissed this film and how are disappointed with this flick. I love it. I am not gonna say is the best movie it is not but It' is a pretty good movie a worth of a watch an awesome underrated sequel. Blade Trinity rocks! I am a fan of all Blade movies. Before this movie come out I kept watching Blade I  II. It was been 7.years when I finally download and watch this movie today I watch it on Bluray and Blade third installment rocks. Blade Trinity is rated R! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR not PG13 It Is violent action gore adrenaline scifi flick not for kids. I can't believe how Robocop 2014 remake is praised from fans and critics but Blade get's dissed and bashed from critics it is just not fair!My Reply and answer to a negative reviewer I didn't pay to see Jessica Biel hottest body in Hollywood fake fight. Who cares about Whistler's daughter?........ Jessica Biel did a good job with weapons shooting bow and arrow and the fights she wasn't annoying and I honestly didn't see or noticed her hottest body I was following the story. I don't know what is your problem? The third installment of Blade is very decent movie! Why is Wesley Snipes sharing screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Who cares about Hannibal King? I paid to see Blade kick butt just like in Blade 1 and 2. I didn't pay to see Ryan Reynolds joke for half the film............. Why wouldn't he be? Wesley Snipes shared screen time with other actor and actress in Blade I  II and other his movies. So why wouldn't he shared screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Wesley Snipes Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel did a wonderful decent good job as a trio team that is why it is called Blade Trinity! Blade did kick butt!!!! In the beginning he kicked ass of the vampires and kill them he beat up the SWAT team he fought in a sword fight with Dracula well sorry Abigail helped him to kill Dracula so whatever! They don't make movies like this one today! I wish I would had scifi action movies like are this one today!! I really wish! I wanna see Blade again in action. Green Lantern get's hate and so does Blade Trinity. I like action movies I really do and I really wish I could get action movies like are this one. It is 2015 and I haven't see any good scifi action movie like is this one today!!! They don't make them like that anymore!!! Blade saved a baby and he also talked to the little girl.Dracula was played from Dominic Purcell who also started in my favorite TV Show of all time Prison Break. Patton Oswalt from King of Queens was also in it. Here we have a fights a little origins of Dracula the first and original vampire. Jessica Biel's fight Ryan Reynolds so muscular in here and he fights pretty well. Also I don't care about the jokes he is telling as long he acts they way he supposed to do. Jessica Beil was so much better with Bow and arrow shooting the Vampires like Sylvester Stallone did in 1985 Rambo First Blood Part II she was so much better shooter with bow and arrow than Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games is! She was so much better with using weapons than Jennifer Lawrence does! Blade shoots and kills and kick's the vampires. He use his particular hand guns and his other silver weapons. We have a great music themes and soundtracks! I know that while filming this movie there was a lot of problems between Wesley Snipes and David S. Goyer. That Wesley suffered from a mental breakdown and often would not come out of his trailer he would only respond to the name 'Blade' and if he communicated with anyone it would be via postit notes. 'Ryan Reynolds' corroborated this while promoting the film. Saying that Snipes would ignore the entire cast but once acknowledged Reynolds by saying Keep your mouth shut. You'll live longer. Still Blade Trinity is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one I love it very much. I love all three movies and I wish that there would be another sequel after this film. I don't get why people are bashing this movie so much? Underworld got three sequels and Blade only two but not three or four? I know Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson were disappointed with the script and with the movie. But honestly it was a pretty damn good entertainment I wasn't bored with it. Robocop 2 1990 SpiderMan 3 2007 Predator 2 1990 and KickAss 2 2013 are getting so much hate and bashed this days for it. I still love them all. My best Blade movie would honestly be Blade II I enjoyed the fights than is Blade I and Than Blade Trinity.Anyway  it's a good continuation of Blade's story.There is nothing new here  but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 810.".

What a way to end the series then to have Blade fight the first and the greatest of his kind but Dracula does basically nothing throughout the film. He doesn't pose any real threat to Blade or anyone else. He is just there and Blade has to kill him because that is what he does. The other vampires in the film seem to have no other purpose either than beating up Ryan Reynolds' Hannibal King while the latter cracks one liners. I didn't pay to see a comedy. Jessica Biel is hot but I didn't pay to see a Jessica Biel movie. I paid to see Wesley Snipes as Blade and yet it is like he is cast aside for younger models. Wesley Snipes is the star. He has charisma on screen and off. Jessica Biel does not and I don't care about Ryan Reynolds. I paid to see Blade. What happened to Blade?".

Cons Dracula talks of honor but threatens to kill a newborn baby earlier. Cons Dracula ran away from Blade. Why? Cons The vamps bite like reapers from Blade two and no explanation as to how. Cons HHH aside the rest of the evil vamps are like MTV rejects and are not menacing at all. Just annoying. Cons Blade is in no real danger throughout this movie. Cons A terrible way to end a good movie franchise. Ouch.The Last Word Poor Blade. This is indeed the stake driven though Blade's heart. This is easily one of the worst of the year or the decade. I'll stick with the latter. Skip it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was never a big fan of the original 'Blade' but I liked the sequel a lot. Doing away with the story building of the first one Blade II captured a nice balance between plot and action and it was an entertaining ride throughout. For this third instalment however that perfect balance has been interrupted and calling this film 'action heavy' would be an understatement. While the action in the movie is well done and entertaining to watch when you've seen 45th bad guy being smashed through a window it loses it's impact somewhat. The talking scenes in between the action are either small plot details that the film needs to string itself together or just another action sequence setup. The plot is messy to say the least and there's far too much going on for it to be streamlined into an engaging and satisfying story but nevertheless it follows the vampires as they resurrect legendary bloodsucker Dracula and get Blade into trouble with the cops. However Blade manages to team up with a ragtag bunch of vampire hunters and together they attempt to thwart Dracula and the rest of the vampires! Oh and the cops.David S. Goyer the man who wrote the first two Blade films has taken the director's chair this time round. He's obviously being watching too much Mtv too as he seems far too keen to not allow the audience to know what is going on. The quick style Mtv editing is abundant and it quickly becomes apparent that you will end up very dizzy by the end of the film. The directorwriter has dragged together an eclectic cast to compliment Wesley Snipes which includes the sizzling Jessica Biel along with two more experienced actresses who should know better Parker Posey and Natasha Lyonne and Kris Kristofferson returns also and WWF wrestler Triple H joins in the fun too. Wesley Snipes has made his name playing the humanvampire hybrid in this comic strip movie series and with this performance he seems like an actor bored with his work. Whether or not that's because of the extremely thin caricature that Snipes has been given to work with this time round or maybe it's because he's fed up of 'more of the same'. Anyway Blade Trinity is quality entertainment. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in coolness and action and if you liked the first two you might as well see this one as well.".

They were just plonked in the film to raise the ultimate bad guy from his crypt and provide someone for Blade's latest sidekicks to pulverisebadly.And then we have the ultimate bad guy Drake who isn't remotely imposing let alone terrifying. Big boots to fill and I really don't think this guy is up to it. I was looking forward to someone imposing sadistic gleefully evil in fact. I didn't get it. What this guy reminded me of was RamMan from HeMan but less frightening to his enemies.The only reason I gave this film 4 and not 1 is for Hannibal King Ryan Reynolds who steals the show from Blade the second he comes on screen. While Blade potters through the film not saying or doing much that I can remember apparently this is whats called brooding King manages to keep all eyes on him.King gets all the best camera shots AND lines. As far as I'm concerned this was his film and should have been a Blade spinoff and not another episode. Ryan Reynolds is far and away the star here.".

Goyer succeeds in amalgamating the visual style of the two previous Blade films by making Blade Trinity a sleek but raw actioner.The problem is Blade is not an action franchise. It's a vampire franchise. Both Guillermo del Toro and Stephen Norrington understood this. Vampires can be sexy scary enticing and downright brutal all at the same time. But the vampires in Blade Trinity are sissies. They're pissy corny spent and essentially useless. They're not sexy scary or smart. They're just boring. And thus there is no sense of horror or danger or urgency or mystery. You never wonder if Blade will come out on top. You know he will and you can pretty much guess how before it happens.Snipes' kungfumovieesque silent hero routine has grown tired. His character in this film lacks any real depth or complexity. Snipes is utterly boring unless he's kicking the crap out of someone or at least threatening to.Instead of developing the characters he already has Goyer keeps introducing new ones. Much like in the previous film Blade soon finds himself surrounded by a new group of allies to whom his disdains. But instead of vampires this time around it's a bunch of wise cracking teenagers. Each one more clichd and uninteresting than the next.And what should have been the highlight of the film Goyer also manages to ruin. Through some broad stroke of banality Goyer even succeeds in making Dracula the most favored and well known vampire in the history of literature and cinema completely dull.Goyer implements too many different and contradictory ideas into a single film. And the result is a film that's visually impressive but narratively clunky. Many of Goyer's ideas while contrived aren't that bad. I mean. A group of wise cracking teenage vampire hunters isn't a bad idea. It might work as it's own film but it simply doesn't work in the context of the Blade universe.Despite enthusiastic performances by much of the cast and Wesley Snipes' strong presence Blade Trinity fails due to underdeveloped characters and an unfocused plot. Lackluster writing and directing aside this film still looks really really good. Apparently the only people who really brought their Agame are cinematographer Gabriel Beristain the entire art department and visual effects team. Kudos to them all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately this movie didn't have the impact on me that the first two did. I've been a big fan of Vampire movies in general as well as the first two movies of the Blade series so I'm an avid fan of the subject. While this movie offered more in the comedy  comic book feel it lost the originality horror and suspense IMO.Pros  Cool new weapons  some plucky comedy. Cons  Lacked any kind of suspense  horror feeling wasn't serious at all more of a popcorn movie than the first two. Also a comic book cinematography feel that kind of bothered me.Throughout this movie I never felt a single hint of being in a horror movie but more so like a super hero movie like with all Marvel comic movies. Now granted I'd say that the Blade series lingers more on the SciFi  horror fence rather than just horror but this movie was more like a comedy action and lacked any kind of suspense  horror. The first movie was pretty original the 2nd was more darker and the mutated vampire strain definitely gave a good creepy  suspenseful element while building off the original storyline. However the third movie lacked any suspense at all as the main bad guy Dracula or rather his modern name 'Drake' seemed to lack any substance or omnipotence at all. You didn't fear him or see him as any real threat at all other than his ability to morph into other things which wasn't really used well hence the suspense went down the tubeThe acting was okay there was a much more comical feel to this one rather than the few one liners of the previous two movies and I guess that rubbed me the wrong way mainly instigated by Ryan Reynolds Mr. Van Wilder. While he was certainly physically fit for the part as seen in his torture scene his relief comedy ways totally change the tone of the movie. Interestingly you never see Wesley Snipes all stripped down wondering if he's been keeping up with his push ups Jessica Biel is okay at best. She certainly kicks ass in the movie but is not very believable in her character IMO and not very good eye candy either so kind of a dud there. The other thing that really bugged me was her 'listening to MP3's' while doing battling OMG this is so stupid and so Hollywood. You mean to tell me that she's willing and capable to give up her sense of hearing while fighting vampires just to appear cool? Give me a friggin break. So unrealistic Who ever thought up that idea should be shot hanged have there ears ripped off and never allowed to work in Vampire movies again Wesley Snipes played his role same as the first two kicking ass throughout and having a bad attitude to boot. I wasn't impressed by any of the fight scenes yeah some of the new weapons were semi cool but overall the action was nothing new and the cinematography was so quick and close up that you really couldn't make out the action very well. The end  climactic scene was also a dud quite befitting for the rest of the movie I reconI guess the other thing that bothered me about this movie was the fact that in the first two movies you get the impression that vampires are stronger quicker and more durable that humans hence the need for Blade however in the 3rd movie you have Jessica Biel who is human as well as Ryan Reynolds a previous vampire now cured  human kicking ass all over vampire city. If this were really the case then vampires wouldn't pose much of a threat to begin with. So this aspect really bothered me as the vampires in this 3rd movie came off really weak and ordinary. They didn't come of mystical or powerful at all even Drake wasn't impressive in the least. This had the net effect of stealing away some thunder from the Blade character as Blade actually gets rescued by his Nights stalker groupies rather than the other way around.Overall the movie was just okay and is much more light hearted than the first two movies for that reason it may appeal to a wider audience but in doing so it lost me as a hardcore vampire fan. I couldn't take this movie seriously as the comedy aspect kept pushing through. Unfortunately when you mix Vampires with too much comedy you get crap for a result. Vampires are better suited for horror  suspense movies rather than this 'Hollywood  Please all' crap. Kind of a bummer".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember the excitement my friends and I felt leaving the theatre after seeing Blade I in the theatre years ago for the 3rd time. I remember telling my brother that I haven't seen a hero kick this much ass in a film since the 80's. This film along with The Matrix and Jackie Chan helped bring martial arts back to Hollywood. I remember leaving Blade II being disgusted by the acting by the acting Leonor Varela but pleased to see Donnie Yen's fight choreography and to see Wesley Snipes' Blade kick even more ass this time around. Not as good a story as 1 but cool and violent nonetheless.But trinity...wow. I'm surprised that Blade didn't have nipples on his costume with the immediate decay of the quality of the franchise. The responsibility lies completely on David Goyer as he finally was given the chance to direct he series he has written since it's inception. This film felt like it should have been on SciFi channel or FX. Those good old days of Blade kicking ass are gone replaced by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds beating down brittle MTV vampires that couldn't hold a candle to Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost. I don't even remember seeing Blade fight Dracula with all the action geared towards his new sidekicks. That's like a Batman movie with Robin as the star.

	onyx:emotionText "I remember the excitement my friends and I felt leaving the theatre after seeing Blade I in the theatre years ago for the 3rd time. I remember telling my brother that I haven't seen a hero kick this much ass in a film since the 80's. This film along with The Matrix and Jackie Chan helped bring martial arts back to Hollywood. I remember leaving Blade II being disgusted by the acting by the acting Leonor Varela but pleased to see Donnie Yen's fight choreography and to see Wesley Snipes' Blade kick even more ass this time around. Not as good a story as 1 but cool and violent nonetheless.But trinity...wow. I'm surprised that Blade didn't have nipples on his costume with the immediate decay of the quality of the franchise. The responsibility lies completely on David Goyer as he finally was given the chance to direct he series he has written since it's inception. This film felt like it should have been on SciFi channel or FX. Those good old days of Blade kicking ass are gone replaced by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds beating down brittle MTV vampires that couldn't hold a candle to Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost. I don't even remember seeing Blade fight Dracula with all the action geared towards his new sidekicks. That's like a Batman movie with Robin as the star. David Goyer now says he'd like to direct Thor......comic fans around the world should now panic as to what he sets his sights on next.";

Every part of this movie was awful. It's almost as if a child wrote it. The whole back to the beginning thing has been done so many times and this time was the worst that I have ever seen. This part of the storyline was especially disappointing since I have always enjoyed the way the vampires existence was explained in the previous blade movies. Although the acting wasn't stellar I don't think they could be blamed for much. Seems like the majority of the blame falls on the writerdirector. Character development was atrocious. Seemed like far too much time was given to unimportant characters .. Triple H .. and far too little on those characters around which the movie should have been centered.".

	schema:headline " A disappointing conclusion";
	schema:reviewBody "Blade and Blade II were movies that were mostly visual masterpieces which thrived on the atmosphere Blade II more than I. Quick transitions scenes that mostly had only one predominant color. The Blue of the Ninja type fight the amber of the night scenes the red of the Moo Cow Factory where Blade and Whistler were finally reunited. Blade was to be a great modern vampire epic where they were no longer regarded as immortal undead beings that were warded by celestial tokens and pure substances like water but rather as a recessive niche of humans that is either blessed or cursed by genetic defects that cause severe allergies to garlic silver and sunlight. Blade II was a great second installment because it was dark it was moody the atmosphere was pressing the story was good and the concept artists really did their best at it.Honestly Blade III contains way too much sunlight tries to be overly funny with one character that tries to crack jokes around every corner of the film hopelessly tries to renew the legend that started the entire Vampire hype and in the process turns it to a story and an antagonist that are both too stupid to believe honestly. Okay I have to admit that Hannibal was funny now and then but that's not what I watched this movie for. Drake however was the worst thing that could happen to this movie. His acting was completely dead and the story of his insurrection was completely farfetched. And honestly who would believe a man that is supposed to be the first born of all vampires threatening to throw a baby off the side of a building yet later when the final duel arrives would speak of honor? His character almost seemed to be put together at the last stroke to form an inconsistent whole. Deacon Frost from the first movie on the other hand had no honor so he had no problem with throwing a young Chinese girl in front of a bus but then again he was exactly who he was supposed to be an atrocious power hungry little thug....In the first movie Blade was a Vigilante with nothing to lose a tainted soul with no way out other than killing or dying. In the second after he had overcome the obstruction of not knowing who bit his mother he learned to look further than his hate by secretly falling in love with one of his greatest enemies. In Blade Trinity he is no longer the stoic silent samurai he is supposed to be but he tries to be  or is asked to be  too many things at the same time. Even in the aftermath of his best friend's death he still tries to be too witty too much of a drill instructor and he can barely relate to the new appendage to the vampire slaying team.Speaking of whistler's death when he died in Blade I which I think to be an admirable scene full of gravity and persuasion in Blade III you would miss it if you'd blink. His abrupt death in Trinity does both Blade I and II injustice since they took all this trouble to get him back in the story only to let him die without any reverence.I have heard many things about this movie being extremely action packing however most of the time action and I mean real action is far away. In Blade II the introduction to the main character was an excellent opening scene Trinity's introduction was dull compared to that. I agree that on more than one occasion the soundtrack was better and I am glad that the old Dodge Charger got more moments in this third movie. Admitted that it barely ran in Blade II this little fact does not vouch for the conclusion. Trinity's ending battle between protagonist Blade and antagonist Drake was also extremely lacking to say the least. All the fighting scenes in Blade II were superior than those in Blade III except one or two that I really like better.The styling of Blade Trinity was atrocious in many ways. I cannot overlook how they have ruined blade's armor and gave him a pansy vest. Some of the new toys were interesting but at the same time some were far fetched and completely obsolete and I dearly missed the UV detonators from Blade II. There were little moments that incorporated special effects but most of those were very disappointing.Guillermo del Toro said in his DVD commentary that he was very optimistic about what David S. Goyer would do when he gets his hands on Trinity but my conclusion is that when del Toro declined to do number three he condemned it to a horrid fate. I'm actually surprised that it showed in TheatersI do not recommend this movie to anyone but the die hard MarvelVampire aficionado. out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say that going into seeing Blade Trinity I was not expecting a masterpiece I merely wanted to be entertained by this movie. With that said it did a pretty decent job. People can criticize this film with having a thin plot being corny at points heck I know I will but I don't think the makers were going for a great plot and great acting more along the lines of actioncomedy and lots of fightingexplosions.The plot is this a group of vampires bring back Dracula to help combat Blade while they also get Blade to the top of the FBI's most wanted now Blade needs help of his own this comes from a group of new young vampire stalkers. These are not spoilers by the way everything I say is included in the trailers. I must say that many times I was saying in this film yeah right but most of the time I was having a ball. I will say that one thing I found is that Blade Trinity was less dark than the other two Blade movies it just had a lighter feel to it. More comedy involved than before which was nice because it was indeed funny but I liked the atmosphere set by the other films that this one did not take.The newest additions Ryan Renolds and Jessica Beil do their jobs pretty well. I must say that Renolds had me laughing almost any time he was on screen. Beil was very nice to look at she is just incredibly beautiful and she does well considering the lines she is given. Paul Levesque better known as Triple H makes a decent debut I guess. He had some funny parts but really I can't see how his job was that hard considering his role was to beat people up and that's what he gets paid to do for the WWE so it's not a real stretch. Well overall the supporting cast did a good job and kept me entertained.On to the meat and potatoes of this movie the fights. Much of the work was very well done in this film Snipes is his usual acrobatic self and disposes of vampires in interesting ways while showing off his martial arts skills. Here is a part I didn't like the fighting involving Ryan Renolds at times he tries to be like Snipes and it just doesn't work. I always say if the actor doesn't know martial arts don't make him try to pretend it's just not the same. Beil did some nice fight scenes to. Triple H well his fights were good but I see it too much in the ring to really enjoy it the whole time I was thinking in my head now when's he going to break out a pedigree ? well that moment never came. The gun fights were really well done and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Overall Blade Trinity had awesome fight scenes.So that pretty much sums up my feelings of this film. It was a fun movie to watch just for the action and comedy of Renolds but not much else did I mention Jessica Beil was very beautiful. I will say that out of the three Blade movies this is my least favorite but I still like it and recommend it to anybody looking for a good action movie diehard fans of the series will probably be conflicted with it. My rating is 810.".

To even consider this movie to be a bomb would be giving it more praise than it's worth since bomb can be used in a positive meaning i.e. it's da bomb. This film truly is a total pile of trash a pile so trashy not even the most desolate bum would eat from it. The main problem here with this cinematic nightmare is the storyline is just plain goofy at times too goofy. After twenty minutes or we find that Blade must again don his cool leather jacket and dark shades and face off against the evil forces once again. Let me take this sentence to say this I think that Snipes is a total bad ass in all three Blade films the final battle he has against Deacon Frost in the first Blade movie is one of my favorite fight scenes of all time. This film fails to carry such excitement and instead we are left with fight after fight of basically the same redundant fighting moves stake through the heart burn up the vampire etc. Snipes does his best to carry this movie but its just the writing is so bad. The greatest problem with this film is the ensemble cast composed primarily of American Pie and Van Wilder rejects. Here's the rundown of their performances Jessica Biel is hot yet she can't act to save her life. Ryan Reynolds sheesh boy what a mistake givin this guy a shot at fame he basically ruins this movie with his smartass or actually dumbass antics. Parker Posey does pretty good as the main villain even though as the movie goes on you see less and less of her which isn't a bad thing. Finally Triple H who basically brings his wrestling persona to his role as well as some of his wrestling moves does OK as the tough bad guy although he would be better as say a tough evil Bond henchmen. Anyway the storyline revolves around the vampires bringing back Dracula Bram Stoker is turning in his grave I'm sure and once they do Dracula will try and take over the world. Eventually Blade and the rest of the gang track down the evil vampires and a huge climactic battle ensues which pales in comparison to the final battle from the original Blade movie. So there you have it if you're the biggest Blade fan of all time I recommend you still pass on this movie and instead watch the first Blade movie on DVD or whenever TNT reruns it.".

I am getting sick and tired of spending my valuable time and money on going to the cinema only to be continually disappointed by poorly written low budget garbage.I had hoped that following a long year of terrible terrible films Blade Trinity would save the day in December how wrong I was.Hannibal was played by Chandler from friends Blade seems to be more Eddie MurphyChris Rock not the best of either think Vampire in Brooklyn and Down to Earth Abigail Whistler looked very uncomfortable in the role think Anthony Hopkins in Bad Company The blind woman has a monitor for her PC as well as a braille Keypad... why?? Blade really does say couchie coo to a baby. Drake... no comment.Not to mention the disgusting Apple product placement.... Whistler likes to hunt vampires listening to her IPod... How cheap is that. She is seen downloading from itunes not once but twice!! Cheap and nasty Hollywood.I could not believe that they also tried to introduce Matrix themes and comedy into this film. It is so so bad. Blade one was dark sexy and eerie. Blade two had fantastic characters a great story and good effects. Blade Trinity has no redeeming features... at all. If anyone has bothered to see it this film is on a par with Resident Evil Apocalypse. It really is that bad.Steer well well clear. If you go and see it and get that feeling in the pit of your stomach about ten mins in... when you are still waiting for the mind blowing entrance scene and martial arts... and it hasn't happened. Go home... just leave.. go and spend you time watching films that deserve to be supported and encouraged by our money.".

Never before have I seen such distasteful amateur pointless nonsense reach the screen with perhaps the exception of Son of the Mask. How on earth David Goyer can write the original Blade a fairly good film and then write this is beyond me. Perhaps the film would have had a saving grace if a Director with some talent had taken the helm but I fail to find one decent reason why this film was ever released  surely there must have been people to see what a disaster this was before they gave away the money for it to be made.In terms of Story it's uninventive at best and awfully clichd at worst character's fates are of no emotional involvement Blade himself is offscreen most of the time which perhaps is a good thing the dialogue is cringeworthy and the Plot in general is unbelievably dire. Signs of Goyer's utter laziness lie all over this mess the stereotypical Antagonists the stagnant exposition the pointless voice over the clichd twists and to add insult to injury there is an unashamed product placement which now I feel even the manufacturers are regretting.Things get worse with the Direction of the film  the brief but painful slowmotion sequences introduction of characters the overall design the chief Antagonist. The consequences of these errors not only produces a film which is unforgivable literally I see no reason to expect any better from the people involved but also make me doubtful of Goyer's other script Batman Begins.David Goyer has destroyed what was a fresh take on a decent character it has been reduced to a commercial machine adding to the poisoning of today's clichridden catalogue of films. He has shown blatant contempt for the franchise with his laziness and disrespect  my only hope is that Christopher Nolan can save Batman Begins from the same grotesque fate.".

I wasn't really a massive fan of the Blade films and all that but the first 2 were entertaining enough. But all that has changed now I am now a proud rabid Bladehead! Went to see Blade Trinity last night. It's succeeds in being almost as good as AvP another one of the films of the year.It's amazing  like Blade meets Dawsons Creek meets Baywatch meets WWF. Think I am going to go back and see it again.It's really great to see that they decided to go with young inexperienced actors for this one and that the main bad guy decides to act really badly  this helps to make the other actors stand out. He has to be one of the top screen badguys of all time  an unforgettable understated performance by the magnificent Dominic Purcell as Dracula... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?Some notthat funny one liners by the young male vampire hunter detract from the plot and the action and the explosions and the cool CGI and stuff but some beautifully shameless plugs for ipod are worth the admission price aloneWhat's she doing? Making up a playlist. She likes to listen to mp3s whilst she kicks a55.I also liked that bit where Blade said coochie coo to a baby it was soooo funny  i nearly fell out my seat.Since they had all the cool explosions and fights and stuff they must've reckoned they didn't need to worry about a script much  it's a bold move and it pays off. And anyway it is really hard to concentrate on people speaking for long without explosions and stuff. The beauty of it was cos of all the action and fire and explosions and stuff you don't really need to think about the storyline or pay attention much  the sign of a great director and script writer.I really liked the bit where the blind woman died it was really scary and moving. She was a really great character and it is a shame when she dies. I wish that she appeared in the film more  one of the great performances of recent cinematic history.... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....? Some people in the cinema thought it was funny when she died but they are just sick. It is good how she has a daughter that gets kidnapped and then Blade and the team have to go and get her back it brings the human element into the film and I couldn't believe it that they rescued her OK  totally unexpected! Somebody sitting next to me in the cinema wanted her to get killed off but i think they may have psychological problems.The only bad thing about this film is when it ends. With half an hour to go I was sitting in the cinema thinking I hope this goes on forever! What a film... did I hear someone say Oscar nomination....?I won't say too much about the little twist at the end but there is a little twist at the end.In conclusion run out to see this film as soon as you can!".

After having endured the first two movies and the subsequent years of self therapy to erase the memory it took a lot of persuasion to guilt trip me into seeing this one as well.Needless to say I entered the movie theatre mentally preparing myself for two hours of torture. Frankly Eclipse was just as bad as I had expected despite reassurances from female coworkers that It is much better than the last one... honest. I've never read the books nor do I plan to. I know nothing of the author however I'm guessing she started writing this stuff when she was a twelve year old girl with delusions of what love should be.This entire movie is nothing more than a very poorly written romantic dilemma wrapped in a weak premise of vampire and werewolves in an attempt to lure extra interest. So far as stories go this one has no vigour or power whatsoever. Depth? I've stepped in deeper puddles.Approximately 80 of this movie is dedicated to examining the lead female's conflicting emotions. Does she want the vampire or the werewolf? Does she understand the lifestyle choice that comes with that decision? Is she willing to accept the risks? Does she understand the impact it will have on those around her? And finally... does anyone at all actually care? Yup for two whole hours. Six if you include the first two.So surely this movie has some redeeming features? Perhaps the acting? Wrong. Stewart's Bella emotions range from mildly irritated to slightly concerned whilst trying to maintain an air of vulnerability that irritates instead of earning sympathy. For Pattinson Edward it's all about just looking pretty and his acting skills are reduced to nothing more bowing his head slightly so that he always appears to be gazing upwards in an attempt at looking intense. As for Lautner Jabob well we all know he can't act so he is reduced to a shameless and topless eyecandy prop.In summary? Women are from Venus and men are from Mars. If you're a guy you'll hate this. If you're a woman... you might like it. I'm not trying to belittle the sexes it's just that type of movie.Anyway the wife can beg all she wants... there ain't no way I'm taking her to see the fourth one!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah great I can't believe I'm writing this kind of a review. I have never been so disappointed in my life I went into Eclipse expecting a really bad movie like New Moon and it turned out to be much better than I expected. It's the best of the trilogy even though that's not saying too much. New Moon was very possibly one of the worst movies I had ever seen it was very poorly written and had God awful characters that are not likable in any way. Twilight the first film was so small for what it was trying to do and just wasn't very strong. However working with a much better director like David Slade who did Hard Candy and 30 Days of Night he knew not to take the film so seriously and it actually matured quite a bit.As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching Bella has so many decisions to make if she will marry Edward if she will become apart of the vampire clan if she will choose Jacob instead if she will abandon her family and life. As this is happening Victoria is still seeking her revenge on Bella by creating an army of new born vampires who crave nothing more in the world than blood and will do anything for it. Having to decide if Bella's life is worth it Jacob and Edward must come to peace with each other if they want to save Bella's life.The actions sequences are a lot better and actually makes the film a lot more entertaining. As we see in the first two films when the vampires run it's a long shot so it looks very CGI and in this one we have more close up's making it look a lot more realistic. Even the werewolves looked a lot better than in New Moon. I'm betting David Slade called the computer company that did New Moon and said OK you guys have got to be kidding with what you gave me work on the image!. Also the characters even go a little more in depth Edward and Jacob are a little more interesting in this story. Honestly if it were not for Bella this would have been a much better movie.See this is where the downfall is with this series besides the story our main character Bella. She is very possibly one of the most flat characters ever written she's so beyond boring. I can't honestly feel anything for her because she's just honestly a horrible person she pits these guys against each other who are fighting for her and I can't even understand why they would fight for her. She's not that pretty she's one tracked in thinking and she's a manipulator. When we finally are getting a little more interested in Jacob and Edward Bella interrupts it. She's going from kissing Edward to kissing Jacob to kissing Edward and not even apologizing for it. I'm also convinced that Edward is gay I'm not saying this as an insult but there's a scene that reminded me of Will and Grace. Bella wants to sleep with Edward but he wants to wait until they're married he gets nervous when he kisses her and doesn't even want her undressed in Will and Grace when we find out how they met that's the exact same situation only Will tells Grace after he proposes to her that he's gay. It's not insulting the character I'm just having a very hard time believing that he loves her as he tells Jacob when asked him if Bella chose him instead Edward says I'd let her what is that? Are you kidding me? That's Bella's great love? Wow.With better direction though this film does a lot better that I expected even if it's not saying too much. It's just the story that is really bad the dialog and characters. David Slade did the best he could and he even made it enjoyable when Edward and Jacob actually talked Jacob even says when he has to warm up Bella in a blizzard I'm hotter than you I couldn't stop laughing at that. I think that line was added last minute also same with when Edward sees Jacob and asks does this guy have any shirts? they actually had fun with the script and that's what picked up the film as well as better action scenes. But to sum this up Eclipse is better than I expected but it's a rental for me but I'm sure the fans will like this one a lot better.610".

	schema:headline " I have never craved a bullet in my head so much in my life";
	schema:reviewBody "OK my experience in seeing this movie was particularly excruciating because I was stuck in a theatre of people who kept either groaning cooing or yelling advice to the characters on screen at the top of their lungs. But even with that aside what few other people will be likely to say still deserves to be said this movie sucked big hairy werewolf balls. Unfortunately trying to explain why would take up a lot more words than I've managed to cram in so I can only focus on the main issues. For starters Bella has become increasingly unlikeable since we saw her last and as she's the central protagonist around whom all the ensuing events revolve that's going to be a problem. Originally a great character in the first two films her appeal here takes such a massive nosedive that no joke it actually becomes hard to fathom why exactly everybody around her is risking their lives for her safety. Her constant lack of consideration for certain people particularly her longsuffering dad is getting exceedingly grating. There were a number of moments in which I wanted to bite her neck myself just to shut her up. The scene spoiler in which she punches Jacob because he kissed her was the last straw for me  I hardly think that that warrants a punch considering that he can't help being in love with her especially since deep down she loves him as well. The little trout deserved to get her hand sprained. But no he still apologises and not just for the kiss but for the fact that punching him sprained her hand. How predictable and how pathetic.Bella's love affair with Edward  previously of the I would die for you calibre  is now peppered with so many inconsistencies that it's losing its enjoyment value. For example as we've learned in movies 1 and 2 Bella is so in love with Edward that she's a willing to overlook the fact that he's not human b willing to overlook the fact that he's killed people and c give her own life to save his as she did at the end of New Moon but when he finally proposes marriage to her she's hesitant? And the reason? Well apparently because she's still young being only 18. Funny 'cause I would've thought that 18 is also a young age to contemplate relinquishing your mortality in favour of becoming a vampire for all eternity. But it's OK because another spoiler she eventually accepts and in doing so says I will bind myself to you in every way humanly possible  but when he addresses her as Mrs. Cullen she suddenly tells him that she wants to keep her own name? She'll sacrifice life and limb for him but not do THAT?The cheesiness of this film was also a step up  everything is cheapened to the level of a corny soap opera. They ALL deserve Razzis.

My sister actually turned to me at one point during the movie and said Shades of Wuthering Heights because everything about this plot is so exasperating. Why doesn't Edward stay mad at Bella after she kisses Jacob? They have ONE discussion about it actually it's not even a discussion just a series of comments and then by the end of the movie they're happily reunited without a single cross word. I would think that kissing Jacob would put Edward's nose out of joint just a LITTLE considering that she's supposed to be his reason for living and future bride!You should also be prepared for the fact that as is typical in most of these cases they try to shove far too much into the storyline. Simplify guys if you're going to take a few minutes to explain Rosalie's backstory to us to give us some more insight as to why she is the way that she is then leave James' backstory until the next movie. The need to stop every once in a while to explain another supporting character's history is exceedingly disruptive and doesn't really bring anything integral to the plot anyway for example I found that I still didn't give a rat's ass about Rosalie even after finding out what happened to her. It just makes it longer more tedious and prone to losing your attention.Maybe I'm just not this movie's core demographic. It IS for tweenies after all. But there's another problem considering that this film is supposed to be for tweenies the violence is sometimes surprisingly fullon. There's a scene involving a decapitation which I won't go into the gruesome details of but let's just say that it could easily qualify as the Holey st! moment of the year. So even the movie itself seems to forget who it's for. The special effects are impressive of course the visuals are creative and the direction is fine but scratch beneath this glossy surface and there's just too much frustration at the hands of the script the characters and their actions to make this movie tolerable to sit through. And because the characters and their actions are the primary crux of this story you never get a minute's peace.Quite simply I am so OVER Twilight man. I'm done. That's it. Up until this point I'd actually been quite enjoying the franchise but the abomination of this third installment has soured my interest so much that...you know what? I'm going to go watch Little Ashes because the sight of Robert Pattinson making out with a guy is just what I need to shoot dead anything that reminds me of this idiotic movie. Awful.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK my experience in seeing this movie was particularly excruciating because I was stuck in a theatre of people who kept either groaning cooing or yelling advice to the characters on screen at the top of their lungs. But even with that aside what few other people will be likely to say still deserves to be said this movie sucked big hairy werewolf balls. Unfortunately trying to explain why would take up a lot more words than I've managed to cram in so I can only focus on the main issues. For starters Bella has become increasingly unlikeable since we saw her last and as she's the central protagonist around whom all the ensuing events revolve that's going to be a problem. Originally a great character in the first two films her appeal here takes such a massive nosedive that no joke it actually becomes hard to fathom why exactly everybody around her is risking their lives for her safety. Her constant lack of consideration for certain people particularly her longsuffering dad is getting exceedingly grating. There were a number of moments in which I wanted to bite her neck myself just to shut her up. The scene spoiler in which she punches Jacob because he kissed her was the last straw for me  I hardly think that that warrants a punch considering that he can't help being in love with her especially since deep down she loves him as well. The little trout deserved to get her hand sprained. But no he still apologises and not just for the kiss but for the fact that punching him sprained her hand. How predictable and how pathetic.Bella's love affair with Edward  previously of the I would die for you calibre  is now peppered with so many inconsistencies that it's losing its enjoyment value. For example as we've learned in movies 1 and 2 Bella is so in love with Edward that she's a willing to overlook the fact that he's not human b willing to overlook the fact that he's killed people and c give her own life to save his as she did at the end of New Moon but when he finally proposes marriage to her she's hesitant? And the reason? Well apparently because she's still young being only 18. Funny 'cause I would've thought that 18 is also a young age to contemplate relinquishing your mortality in favour of becoming a vampire for all eternity. But it's OK because another spoiler she eventually accepts and in doing so says I will bind myself to you in every way humanly possible  but when he addresses her as Mrs. Cullen she suddenly tells him that she wants to keep her own name? She'll sacrifice life and limb for him but not do THAT?The cheesiness of this film was also a step up  everything is cheapened to the level of a corny soap opera. They ALL deserve Razzis.

	schema:headline " Twilight Eclipse An Improvement";
	schema:reviewBody "When Twilight came out back in 2008 I became immensely curious in the franchise even though I'd never read the books due to the overwhelming hype from the fans. After the viewing I felt that the film was left very hollow and weighed down by the substandard acting iffy directing sloppy editing and overall adolescent melodrama. It felt incomplete but as though it wanted its creators to try harder and become a developed rendition of the books. Regardless I saw the possibility of potential and found myself interested in seeing where the series would go in the future. New Moon was released last year and I had actually bubbled up a sense of excitement from watching the trailers. It came off as a new and improved version of the original with a much more interesting story I couldn't have hit further from the mark if I tried. Completely immersed underneath terrible acting absolutely sloppy editing gutwrenching writing mediocre directing god awful story development empty CGI and a gonowhereatall story only meant to tug at the heart strings of preteens New Moon was instantly put on the list of worst films I had ever seen in my life. I had become completely turned off by the idea of seeing this franchise grow any further. Alas my OCD personality refuses to let me start a film series and walk away from it so it was inevitable that I hesitantly saw The Twilight Saga Eclipse.Almost immediately I realized that this film's atmosphere is a barricaded roundabout of rehashed dialogue and onetrack character directory. Nothing intellectual or invitingly new is dropped into this pot of love triangles cardboard characters and afterthought plot development. It's one of the largest problems with the film nothing is unique. The seemingly main story is introduced slowly over the course of almost two hours through five to ten minute segments that feel like nothing more than meaningless bursts to keep people on their toes. These sporadic bursts of story come at you in between the same drivel we've heard in New Moon. Bella Kirsten Stewart to Edward Robert Pattinson to Jacob Taylor Lautner back to Bella and Edward and Edward to Jacob and Jacob to Bella and Edward and Jacob and Bella to Edward. Continuously talking about fighting for their love and no sex before marriage and preparing for battle but really doing nothing and She loves me but she's too afraid to admit it and She loves me more but I'm not sure about myself. It's this childlike empty conversation between characters with similarly empty childlike personalities that makes the entire movie feel like a giant fantasy advertisement an enormous over dramatic preteen wet dream.The characters are the second biggest issue with this film and even though in second place it's by far the most irritating problem. I cannot recall the last time I cared for characters so little in a series of any sort. This movie has a running time of an hour and fiftyfive minutes minus the credits and not once do any of the characters deviate from the onetone personalities that are painted for them. The same over the top emotions that cause the same loopdeloop interactions that actually get so bad that you feel as though you're watching the same scene over and over and over and over again. It's cursed by a formula that should have been dropped after the first film because there was potential to create characters an audience would be interested in but that ship sailed and crashed no survivors.Alongside cookie cutter personalities and what tries to pass off as an indepth story of revenge love and redemption is a near beautiful but one dimensional environment. I was really confused by this film's physical appearance and the tone it was attempting to create. The scenery is something to behold but is masked by too much use of blue tones bloom lights and green washing. The werewolves have got some excellent CGI going for them and at first glance you wouldn't be able to guess that they aren't real. As the film progresses though you begin to lose the feeling of reality with these creatures. It's almost as if they aren't there and there's no physical depth or strength to them. This weightlessness become very apparent during the overwhelmingly dull clich and emotionless fight scenes. Everything about the atmosphere contradicts itself and this became very frustrating to watch. I do have to give credit to the film makers for putting enough effort into making the environment look much more attractive than the previous installments.Overall most of what made New Moon a total catastrophe has been worked on in Eclipse and it is indeed a better film than its predecessors. The problem with this analysis is you're comparing one personal experience with a train wreck to another in the end it's still covered in smoke fire dismay and you're hoping to get out alive. The acting has improved but the delivery of almost the entirety of the film's dialogue is rubbish or cringe worthy. The editing has gotten better and the pacing feels more cinematic but the story itself completely veils this upgrade making it nearly unnoticeable. Changing the directors was possibly the best choice made here because the film feels much more professional and mature again though we're talking train wrecks here. If you're a fan of the series thus far I'm sure you'll enjoy this installment. If you're a fan of the books maybe you will too. If you're anybody else I would highly suggest at this point steering clear of this series entirely and maybe picking up the books.".

New Moon was extremely boring. Both were so flat bad direction bad acting REALLY bad dialog. Along comes New Moon with slightly better acting slightly better action but still unbelievably bad dialog. I guess that's impossible to avoid though considering the abominable cheesy books. Oh yes Stephenie Meyer cannot write! Every single clich expression is there.So  Eclipse. It all revolves around the girl's choice which is about the most common situation teenagers find themselves in. The difference is that your average girl will not encounter the choice werewolf vs. vampire too often... Bella STILL can't make her mind up whether she loves E or J so she messes with their minds a little more. Which in teenage speak means keep 'em in suspense 'cause they'll both love you more.Actually the entire saga has Bella at its center which is artificial to say the least. Two amazing creatures competing for the affection of a dull teenage girl  but it doesn't stop here every single awesome creature jumps in to save her life while the bad guys form an entire army of vampires to get vengeance for something She the beautiful swan triggered. Wow talk about your implausible plot  even in the world of mythological creatures. Oh and she helps in the fight by cutting her finger.The army of newborn vampires is disappointing they're supposed to be very strong but they can't take a hit. They can't smell the wolves either which contradicts the whole strategy of carry Bella so that your stench covers her scent. However the scenes in the city when they attack and destroy are almost cool.Bella and Edward's conversations in the meadow are so boring. There's no chemistry no voice modulation no face expressions which are usually more than necessary in the heart felt scenes.The acting! yes the actingIt seems like everybody in the movies has a fair performance  Dakota Fanning is stunning Charlie is nice and funny papa Cullen and newborn Riley hope I got the names right are actually likable. Everybody except the main characters!!Edward is supposed to be this unbelievably sexy can'tkeepyourhandsoffhim perfect hunk. Instead Pattinson really looks terrible  and speaking of terrible let's not forget his acting. He should be intriguing and mysterious but he just looks awkward and stiff which leaves you wondering what you should find so irresistible about him. The makeup does not help especially the lipstick which is redder than Bella's.Bella. Now no matter how hard I try I cannot like Kristen Stewart. In the immortal ha words of Lisa Simpson  she's wooden and unpleasant. That 'puzzled' look she keeps giving defines her as an actress which is not a good sign. Also she never closes her mouth. Who ever thought she could hold a leading role was probably drunk.Jacob. His purpose in the movie is to keep his shirt off period. Nothing else matters here  the bust the pecks and the attempts to kiss Bella.So what's so captivating about the Twilight series? The fact that any girl can think she's the center of the world that she can have everyone at her feet complying with her every whim  yeah that's pretty appealing. It also raises egocentric and unbelievably exigent women. Let us not forget the kids who want to become vampires which of course implies their believing such beings actually exist.Yes Eclipse was bad but not as bad as the previous two. I wonder whether I'll have the patience to see the other two coming our way...".

Teen supernatural romances with love triangles aren't for everyone so why people who went to see it who don't like that sort of movie and then decide to give it a crappy review I don't know. After reading all the book I'll admit I was worried for the movies in my opinion Twilight was OK New Moon was a disappointment so I was apprehensive about Eclipse.The irony of this situation is a horror film director David Slade got it right. From the beginning one of the first things I noticed was the fact that the acting had drastically improved. Jacob's lines were much less cheesy or at least Taylor delivered them in such a way that they didn't come across that way. Bella's maturity also was apparent in this film. The darker parts of the movie were as dark as they could be while keeping the PG13 rating. Charlie was the comic relief and always has been that way but this time I was legitimately in stitches.As far as some reviewers who are annoyed by the love triangle and say nothing changed with that in the movie are clearly missing a few marbles. Bella even explains why she hadn't chosen up until the end of movie to Edward. She was choosing between who she should be and who she is. Jacob obviously who she should be and what she should do and Edward is who she is and where she feels most herself. Plus Jacob and Edward have a moment of understanding in this film which never happened in Twilight or New Moon and I don't understand how some people on here didn't notice that. Also I can tell you that things really change in Breaking Dawn.Yes there is a lot of dialog in the film but I don't really think that's a bad thing unless you wanted an interpretive dance. You're dealing with a very large and detailed book that's being squeezed into a two hour movie something has to give and dialog is a huge part of keeping the viewer aware of what's going on and moving the story along and I really don't think there is too much of it.Also the movie flew by for me and as always leaves it's own cliffhanger to be addressed in the next film.The main point is you either love like or hate the Twilight Saga if you hate it don't see the movie if you love it I can tell you you'll like probably love Eclipse.".

The vampires and ware wolves also team up to defeat the new born vampires which ends up being a relatively easy task.

Bella gets to live with Edward forever in the end and no matter how much a couple is in love they will never love only each other for ETERNITY. Human minds don't work that way especially when you're young. We get sick of our partners easily and cheat on each other at least once in our lives because there are plenty of men and women out there other than our partners. It's not good to be madly in love because you create unbalance in all your other life styles. If all the girls and twihard thought that the relationship between bella and edward has any depth reality or is in any way healthy then your understanding of the basics of human nature are truly at a low. It's very unhealthy to depend your life on someone else entirely because you lose your own identity expression and thought and that is a terrible price.

Bella was made into a strong character Edward was made into a wimp Jake was more of a jerk. You totally edited the scenes with Rosalie which are very important to the next part of the series. You failed to show how ALL of the Cullens feel about Bella which is also important to the next part of the story. In the past you have stated you wouldn't touch this series...so I guess your change in opinion was really a ruse. You decided to sabotage the story instead. Thank God you are not going to be given the chance to ruin Breaking Dawn.".

I didn't buy it. Kristen Stewart was way better in the first Twilight. In Eclipse she's is way bland. It's totally forgettable performance. The books had her personality better done. My girlfriend liked it more than me. However even she liked the first two far better. I hope the next ones will be an improvement. Maybe die hard fans will say it's okay but overall it didn't match the first one or even the second. It sucked. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been billed as the biggest film of the year and perhaps it will be but it has some stiff competition from the likes of Harry Potter coming this winter so let's see if Eclipse really deserves that prestigious title.The vampire and werewolf love saga has been bitterly disappointing so far with a dull first instalment and a hideously depressing second. Add to this some excruciatingly painful running times of over two hours and you have death by celluloid.But perhaps I'm being a little unfair this third instalment has been based on perhaps the most exciting book of the four in the series so it already has a good starting point and some convincing performances from the actors really do make this film a huge leap ahead of what preceded it.The storyline to this film is pretty much nonexistent but director David Slade does a good job of turning zilch into another depressing but well made two hour love fest. Robert Pattinson Edward Cullen Kristen Stewart Bella Swan and Taylor Lautner Jacob return as the three main leads and their love triangle becomes even more confusing this time around with frowning faces and awkward kisses galore. Add to this an army of newborn vampires ready to rip the very flesh of Bella Swan's bones and it's getting pretty tense down in Forks.Sadly even with a whole army of vampires and werewolves fighting in the finale this small increase in action doesn't take away from the fact that the film drags in more than one place with blocks of dialogue that feel as if they're going to last a lifetime. It's unfortunate as the action pieces look excellent and the CGI especially in the werewolves has improved leaps and bounds between New Moon and Eclipse. This shamefully vain dialogue with unnecessary closeups of Robert Pattinson's face Kristen Stewart's eyelashes and Taylor Lautner's chest are surely there just to appeal to the female fans and do nothing to progress the story.It is these main three characters that hinder the film their stilted dialogue and mediocre acting overshadow the rest of the cast who are all superb. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard playing red head vampire Victoria is seriously underused along with the whole Cullen flock who are not given enough room to breathe between the heavy central dialogue. Their acting is fantastic why not use them more? Thankfully it isn't all tears before bedtime with some welltimed comic humour from Bella's dad Charlie. Played by Billy Burke he is the only character of the used variety that leaps off the screen and he does so well playing to his strengths as an actor.Overall Eclipse moves the game on but only very slowly. David Slade has crafted a beautifully shot movie with some excellent action pieces but it still remains dull as ditch water because of bland performances from the lead cast and chunky dialogue. It's bound to please fans but biggest film of the year? I think we'll be seeing a certain boy wizard holding that honour for 2010.".

	schema:headline " The best movie out of all three Twilight movies";
	schema:reviewBody "I know there is a broad range of people that watched Eclipse already but having read the books and having watched the two previous movies I believe this is the best out of all of them. A movie is never going to be as good as reading the original book so if that is what you're looking for than don't watch the movie! David Slade did an excellent job of making the movie more dramatic and less cheesy compared to the previous two films that made me want to gag in certain scenes.I believe his technique of meeting with each actor individually before scenes to discuss lines and what he was looking for in each scene really helped each main character and improved their overall performance in Eclipse. We all have to remember that these are young actors and most of them have found fame through the Twilight movies but this movie has really shown a lot of growth both in their acting abilities and how they've added more depth to their characters. Actors are only as great as the directors that direct them and I think David Slade has worked wonders with this cast and has shown us that a teenage love story can be turned into a movie where the characters will be praised and loved for not just their looks but for their talents to capture an audience and to walk away wanting more.This movie played more on the serious side of young vampires werewolves and The Cullens than the cheesy love story and over dramatic lines in the previous movies. Moviegoers get more insight into Jasper and Rosalie even though I have to admit that Jasper was a little cheesy in this film but his hair looked a lot more natural than the second film. There is so much going on in this book but David Slade directed this movie in such a way that we are able to see the different aspects of what this book has to offer.. Vengeance and deceit through the eyes of Victoria and her young vampire army a love triangle between Bella Edward and Jacob and the more human side of the vampires and werewolves through scenes that touch on the past. All these theatrical elements bring the book to life and allow viewers to relive this most important book in the series on the big screen.I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and I believe if you go into the movie theater and not expect that it should be just like the book you will be pleasantly surprised that the screenwriter and the director have produced a very well made film that takes the most important parts of one of the most compelling books in the series and creates a film that is both dramatic with a little humor. You will walk out of the theater knowing that this third film has done the franchise justice and will get you pumped up for Breaking Dawn!".

Well well the sceptics say you hate this movie because you hate the Twilightphenomenon in general. No I don't. I don't hate Twilight just because it is cool to do so I hate it because it is so mindnumbingly bad! I can't for the love of God understand why anybody would find the love drama contained in this sclockfest interesting and captivating. The first movie Twilight and the second New Moon was pure crap but THIS this takes the  cake! The poor characters or talking cardboard cutouts pukes out one melodramatic line after another never giving any reason for the audience to relate to them in any way. The development of the characters are nonexistent they are as uninteresting when the movie begins as they are when it ends Edward is an emocreep Jacob is his usual stiff self and Bella still uses her eternally open mouth as an insect catcher. Just close your damned mouth will ya?!The story is basically the same as the previous movies only with new dull characters thrown in and some small changes made to the script. Not only is the writing bad but the execution and buildup to the final climactic fight scenes in the movie is constructed in the completely wrong way! There is never any suspense and the viewer is never uncertain over what will happen to the characters because the viewer already knows which side will win due to the fact that the vampires forges an alliance with the monster dogs and says something like We will win this easily and outnumbers their enemies twotoone. Hurrah for crappy script! It is a bit more suspenseful when Edward and that red haired chick fights but seriously who cares about any of the characters at this point?In my mind the Twilight movies are fantasy movies containing magic and supernatural stuff you know but unlike other fantasy movies for teens Harry Potter comes to mind Twilight doesn't really give the impression of containing any MAGIC ADVENTURE and SUSPENSE that STIRS THE IMAGINATION. Instead the series are more like the realworldequivalent of cleaning toilets for a living a highschool drama with toothless vampires and shabby monster dogs that probably smells like that dead bird your cat dragged in last week. It is that bad. Vampires are really oversaturated in the entertainment business right now can't we just dump them all in a giant mouldy coffin and send them back to Transylvania?".

	schema:headline " The Mighty Thor God of Thunder must be worthy decent superhero film ";
	schema:reviewBody "The origin story of The Mighty Thor is revealed of how Thor become a superhero and a team member of Avengers he was a stripped of his powers and banished to earth. I like the film it is a good film but is not my favorite MCU or my favorite origin film. It is a dark scifi fantasy about good VS evil and how arrogant and cruel god of Thunder becomes a good heart person.Thor banished to Earth from Asgard stripped of his powers and his hammer Mjlnir after reigniting a dormant war. As his brother Loki plots to take the Asgardian throne Thor must prove himself worthy. His brother Loki betrayed Thor lied to Thor that he's dad is dead while he was alive in a coma at sleep. Loki took the thron of Asgard and make sure that Thor never returns home. Now is up too Thor to get his power back and returning home to Asgard to stop Loki with help from his friends. Directed by Kenneth Branagh and the script was witten by Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz Don Payne. Thor is a good origin movie decent solid movie good performance from Chris Hemsworth Natalie Portman Tom Hiddleston Stellan Skarsgrd Kat Dennings Jaimie Alexander and Clark Gregg. Music was by Patrick Doyle. I like Superman The Movie more Captain America The First Avenger Iron Man and AntMan which are all origin story's that I enjoy it more. My favorite Marvel hero is Captain America. So I prefer Captain America The First Avenger Captain America The Winter Soldier Captain America Civil War Iron Man 1 and 3 The Avengers Avengers Age of Ultron AntMan SpiderMan Homecoming The Punisher 2004 movie those are my favorite MARVEL films. Clark Gregg is in this movie and he reprises his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson from the Iron Man movies and his performance in the movie is excellent. Here we first time see Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton Hawkeye with bow and arrow I wish we would have see more Renner's Clint Barton in the movie. Chris Hemsworth is good and excellent as Thor the mighty god of thunder. I love Natalie Portman as Jane Foster a scientist who becomes love interest of Thor and she helps him out trough harsh times. Jane Foster is a sexy babe man Natalie Portman was so hot that time I am in love with her. Stellan Skarsgrd is great as Erik Selvig. Kat Dennings as Dracy Lewis is a babe and I love her so much. Jaimie Alexander as Sif is an excellent warrior great performance from the actress. I always enjoy Tom Hiddleston as Loki in The Avengers and in the sequel Thor The Dark World. Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins are also In this movie. I like how Thor comes to earth and he is strapped off his powers from his father Odin Anthony Hopkins and banished from his home Asgard. Thor has to get back his powers by getting his hammer back. I like the sequence in which Thor fights off 20 agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in which Thor jumps with his legs in a wrestling match and kicks the guard to the ground. I love the scene and the music in which Thor try's to lift his hammer but can't. I love that Jane asks Erik to bail Thor out. The fight scene in New Mexico Thor fights off Destroyer in the town and get's his power back excellent badass scene. I like that Thor tried to get back things from Jane Foster that Phil Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D. stole all Jane researches. I enjoy the romance and the love between Thor and Jane.A good decent solid superhero flick I enjoy it and I like it not a bad one for the first movie in the trilogy I like it a lot. 710 not bad not bad at all good MCU superhero movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "The origin story of The Mighty Thor is revealed of how Thor become a superhero and a team member of Avengers he was a stripped of his powers and banished to earth. I like the film it is a good film but is not my favorite MCU or my favorite origin film. It is a dark scifi fantasy about good VS evil and how arrogant and cruel god of Thunder becomes a good heart person.Thor banished to Earth from Asgard stripped of his powers and his hammer Mjlnir after reigniting a dormant war. As his brother Loki plots to take the Asgardian throne Thor must prove himself worthy. His brother Loki betrayed Thor lied to Thor that he's dad is dead while he was alive in a coma at sleep. Loki took the thron of Asgard and make sure that Thor never returns home. Now is up too Thor to get his power back and returning home to Asgard to stop Loki with help from his friends. Directed by Kenneth Branagh and the script was witten by Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz Don Payne.

	schema:headline " A very pleasant surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "The idea of a classic director like Kenneth Branagh making a superhero film might initially sound strange but in the case of Thor that ended up being very appropriate because the comic always used Shakespearean drama and archaic language to tell the story of the God of Thunder the politicalfamily conflicts in the Asgard kingdom and its interaction with the universe of Marvel Comics. And Branagh's competent direction the excellent performances and the solid screenplay make Thor to be a very entertaining movie.I honestly had always preferred the character of Thor in small doses or as part of an ensemble like he was on the beginnings of the comic The Avengers and in its modern reinterpretation The Ultimates. So I did not have big expectations on a movie exclusively focused in that character however Chris Hemsworth brings a brilliant performance in that role because he could perfectly combine the pompous and operatic classic Thor with the dynamic and unstable modern Thor. I do not know how the purist fans of the KirbyLee era will take that mashup but I think it was a very good decision specially because Thor does not only work as an origin of that superhero but also as an efficient preamble of the highly anticipated film The Avengers which will be an unification point of Marvel's film universe.For example we also have the character of Agent Coulson conducting scientific investigations from S.H.I.E.L.D. with his accustomed astuteness and efficiency we also have a cameo of one of my favorite Avengers even though without his traditional uniform and a postcredits scene where a few concepts we are surely going to see in that future movie are established. But well...it would not be fair to only consider Thor as an extralarge trailer of The Avengers. As I previously said it is a very entertaining movie with various positive elements like Branagh's efficient direction which drives the movie at a perfect rhythm. As for the cast besides of the previously mentioned Hemsworth I think that the rest of the actors is also worthy of applause starting by Natalie Portman who can perfectly express her character's emotions. I also liked the work from Stellan Skarsgrd his participation is relatively short and it would seem irrelevant if it was not for the dramatic weight this actor brings to the character with his mere presence. And Kat Dennings is quite funny and credible as the comic relief.As for the screenplay it is very well written the only thing I would say against it is that it makes a few traps which feel a bit forced. As for the action scenes I found them to be well filmed with the exception of a few excessive closeups which made them occasionally confusing I think that is the only thing I can say against Branagh's direction.In conclusion I took a very pleasant surprise with Thor and I can recommend it as a very good reinvention of a difficult to handle superhero. It might not be a great film but it definitely made me have a good time.".

Even amongst nonobsessive comic aficionados such as myself Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as SpiderMan Batman Superman etc. have. However that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios the filmmaking wing of the company feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character titled simply Thor is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years mixing a good sense of fun strong acting and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds such as Earth via the BiFrost bridge and the conflict centric Frost Giants whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin Anthony Hopkins ruler of the Asgardians is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son Thor Chris Hemsworth but on the eve of Thor's inauguration agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants he takes matters into his own hands traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki Tom Hiddleston and compatriots Sif Jaimie Alexander Volstagg Ray Stevenson Hogun Tadanobu Asano and Fandral Josh Dallas in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions reignited between the two factions Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people and exiles Thor sans his powers to Earth.When he arrives on Earth he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster Natalie Portman and her associates Professor Selvig Stellan Skarsgaard and Darcy Lewis Kat Dennings who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer Mjolnir from the government agents that have captured it and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However he finds that without his superhuman abilities and surrounded by humans perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile Loki who turns out to have some ulterior motives seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor much like Iron Man before it proves that in the right hands a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure Thor has elements that on the face of it may lead a bit to some audience snickers Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times but the creatives behind Thor including director Kenneth Branagh manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy pathos selflessness and perhaps even more surprisingly involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core again akin to Iron Man than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the largerthanlife origins of the Thor comic involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain and more of a misguided soul trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor first as the brash actingbefore thinking hero and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston working with the somewhat subdued at first Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber.".

I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become megamarquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these longtime Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comicbook popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare.".

Four years ago they did this with John Favreau who previously filmed family comedies and yet surprised many with his Iron Man. Now the honored actor and director of the dramatic cinema and theater Kenneth Brana demonstrated miracles by taking off a largescale fantasy comics epic.ActorsChris HamsworthTaking advantage of the tested scheme to take on the role of the protagonist of a littleknown actor and surround him with loud names Brana did not lose. Chris Hamsworth is the perfect Thor! Possessing not only impressive physical training and memorable appearance Hamsworth was able to convey the power and emotions of this character. In some places it is threatening in places it's funny when it's necessary to be gallant. Yes and in general throughout the whole movie you penetrate to the Torah sympathy and you empathize with it.Natalie PortmanAs always she is charming and charming. The first falls on the Torah and runs after him all the remaining time Anthony HopkinsWorthy performance of a worthy role. The first experience of Hopkins in the film kinomics was a success.Tom HiddlestonSly a jealous manipulator. Another one hundred percent hit in the role!Jamie Alexander Ray Stevenson Joshua Dallos Tadanobu Asana and Idris ElbaWellwritten characters which should still be given a little more time because each is interesting in its own way.ActionIt is many it is diverse largescale beautiful impressive and fascinating. The best episode is the battle of the top five warriors with the Ice Giants and a huge monster.Special EffectsLooking at the trailers it seemed that the Thor would not be particularly pleased with the special effects for both the monster's drawing and the Torah's hammer in action were not so impressive. But fortunately the effects brought to shine and you can with full confidence to say that the Torah is the most grandiose special effects from all the films Marvel.LocationsAh this Asgard! He is beautiful! Incredibly beautiful and the viewer is not satisfied with the monotonous views of the city. In each of Asgard's places shown there is something unusual and unique. And the more interesting are the transitions from the deserted quiet town of New Mexico to the majestic palaces and structures of Asgard throughout the film.MusicPatrick Doyle has proved since the time of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that he is an excellent composer skillfully combining different musical styles. The Torah is mostly dominated by pathos and heroic music but in times of dramatic moments sad compositions play.HumorHumor in the film is not as much as we would like. But he is funny and in no way slips into jokes below the belt. True it would have been more ridiculous to beat the scenes of God Tor in the modern world among ordinary people.PlotEnough fun and interesting without obvious stupidities and sagging. Although Torah's rebirth was worth paying more attention.SurprisesIn the film a lot of Easter eggs for fans and attentive viewers. Starting from the most obvious mentioning the Hulk and the Iron Man ending with the hidden ones Falcon eye. And at the end of the final credits the audience expects another bridge to the upcoming Avengers.Undoubtedly the most beautiful and grandiose film Marvel. Excellent entertaining summer movie. Satisfied should remain both the audience and the fans. I want to wish the studio to continue making films about my superheroes with the same love and warmth.".

And the more interesting are the transitions from the deserted quiet town of New Mexico to the majestic palaces and structures of Asgard throughout the film.MusicPatrick Doyle has proved since the time of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that he is an excellent composer skillfully combining different musical styles. The Torah is mostly dominated by pathos and heroic music but in times of dramatic moments sad compositions play.HumorHumor in the film is not as much as we would like. But he is funny and in no way slips into jokes below the belt. True it would have been more ridiculous to beat the scenes of God Tor in the modern world among ordinary people.PlotEnough fun and interesting without obvious stupidities and sagging. Although Torah's rebirth was worth paying more attention.SurprisesIn the film a lot of Easter eggs for fans and attentive viewers. Starting from the most obvious mentioning the Hulk and the Iron Man ending with the hidden ones Falcon eye. And at the end of the final credits the audience expects another bridge to the upcoming Avengers.Undoubtedly the most beautiful and grandiose film Marvel. Excellent entertaining summer movie. Satisfied should remain both the audience and the fans. I want to wish the studio to continue making films about my superheroes with the same love and warmth.";

	schema:headline " An immensely enjoyable Marvel entry that complements the tone of Iron Man films";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this last night at a preview screening in London.I prayed that Kenneth Branagh would learn from his mistakes with handling a big budget movie namely his Frankeinstein. Thankfully I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course this is no Henry V this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a reassuring aura about them.The visuals were quite spectacular mainly the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.There is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a putoff way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable it was still a riveting one.For those like me who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God a man who transforms into a giant green beast and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.And make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before I urge you to go back to the previous films Iron Man 1  2 Incredible Hulk and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand  And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing the film I saw was in 3d and once again it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker.".

They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular the rainbow bridge the weaponry and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority.

There is love there but also a lack of understanding envy and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain in that we see all in one package  a fighter who protects his allies an honest counselor a liar a cautious thinker a smooth tongue and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was especially when put in the middle of some otherwiseuninspiring hero pablem.So in summary this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well and forget the whole comicbook hero thing since that's been done far better.Thanks for reading.".

He spends 5 minutes yes 5 ! not understanding anything that's going on or how society works despite him and his people being deified for at least 2000 years and then gets sucked back to his own realm there's little in the way of good dialogue the special effects are Dr Who'esq and the 3D is forgettable.There's no menace from any of the baddies his bad half  non brother seems so nice that you think ah it's all an act and something terrible is going to happen... but no he is quite a nice guy only really dabbles with naughtiness.....This film was supposed to be in 3D yet I completely forgot that it was after the first 5 minutes and only at the end when I realised that I was wearing the stupid glasses did I remember!!In a time where we have transformers XMen and the like the special effects were weak and pretty poor.

	schema:headline " Distracting spectacle but disappointingly empty of ideas and full of franchise stuff mild SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "I had heard a lot of good things about this film before I eventually saw it. I had decided that I wasn't going to go and pay loads of money to sit in noisy cinemas and be bombarded with disappointing blockbusters this summer but I figured that this had enough good word of mouth to be worth seeing. After watching it I browsed through the user comments here of writers I generally trust and found that most of them had loved it too so why did I find it to be all a lot of fuss and nonsense that ultimately amounts to very little?I came to Thor with some worries despite the good word of mouth I never cared for the character generally and he always seemed a little silly to me with the Nordic god dialogue just making it worse. As a result I guess the script could have been worse because it would have been bogged down in this stuff but it never was however this is not to say that it worked well. What it does is take us from point A to point B without ever really doing a huge amount of interest. It has enough humour in to stop it being too serious but not enough to actually be light and fun. It has enough character in it to avoid it feeling wooden but not enough to make one care. It has enough drama in it to set up the action but not enough to provide actual tension or a sense of danger. To me it didn't seem to do anything in particular. I was looking for more sport to be made of this silly God once he was on earth but it didn't happen. In particular I was looking for Loki to be a more interesting baddie since he could have been a tragic haunted character  but we don't see this outside of his actions.This all came together for me to limit my interest in what was going on. The stuff in the heavens was all too full of mock Shakespearean shouting but without dramatic substance while the stuff on Earth was too fleeting and lacking fun and entertainment value. For sure the film provides spectacle but again I just found it to be rather hollow as I watched it enjoying it for the noise but not much else. The cast are varied. Although limited Hemsworth is wellcast because he has the body and big voice to fill the character. He needed a good opposite number though and in Hiddleston he doesn't have it  he doesn't have the presence needed or the depth of character. Portman has almost nothing to do and it shows in her performance she is here for the sake of it and you could have digitally removed her from this film and made no difference to it. Ditto Skarsgrd at least Dennings provided some light relief. Hopkins adds a bit of gravitas to proceedings while Elba has the frame and voice for his character. Like everyone else it surprises me still to think this was directed by Kenneth Branagh but it is a smart career move for him to show he can do big budget effects movies  if it does nothing else it shows that.Thor feels like a film that had to be made rather than one that was created on its own merits. Of course as part of The Avengers this is true but it is irritating that you feel that way while watching it. It has noise and spectacle for those looking for that but it lacks too much in the way of character danger humour and good old fashioned entertainment. You know when you buy a new product and the first few days it is shiny and great but then in using it you spot lots of gaps and think why didn't they do this? and why did they not expand this function?  well Thor is that product shiny and noisy but ultimately one is left wondering why the makers didn't do a lot more in some regards and a lot less in others. Not an awful film  but just a bogstandard one with a massive effects budget.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had heard a lot of good things about this film before I eventually saw it. I had decided that I wasn't going to go and pay loads of money to sit in noisy cinemas and be bombarded with disappointing blockbusters this summer but I figured that this had enough good word of mouth to be worth seeing. After watching it I browsed through the user comments here of writers I generally trust and found that most of them had loved it too so why did I find it to be all a lot of fuss and nonsense that ultimately amounts to very little?I came to Thor with some worries despite the good word of mouth I never cared for the character generally and he always seemed a little silly to me with the Nordic god dialogue just making it worse. As a result I guess the script could have been worse because it would have been bogged down in this stuff but it never was however this is not to say that it worked well. What it does is take us from point A to point B without ever really doing a huge amount of interest. It has enough humour in to stop it being too serious but not enough to actually be light and fun. It has enough character in it to avoid it feeling wooden but not enough to make one care. It has enough drama in it to set up the action but not enough to provide actual tension or a sense of danger.

Without revealing anything regarding the plot I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot and would rate it above both Iron Man films but not by too much. If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general? Very good in all areas without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design solid acting all around and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully looking absolutely gorgeous and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also side note I personally dislike 3D with a great burning passion thank you Clash of the Titans but it is relatively well done here never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!".

Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toetotoe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mindbending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations. This was by far the adventure movie I've seen in years. Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart.".

Thor is a good movie plenty of action a lovely heroine Natalie Portman and some interesting sidekicks.

Thor is a good movie plenty of action a lovely heroine Natalie Portman and some interesting sidekicks. Costumes rock not to mention the obligatory Marvel characters making significant cameos not just the extra scene after the credits but within the film itself. I was a little over superhero movies recently but this is not to be missed.";

So I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing too because if I had any they wouldn't have been met. First I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.Other problems include Fight scenes that played out like video game ads with actors trying to strike the right badass pose for the cool action shots. Annoyingly silly humor that wore thin quickly. Conflicts that were onedimensional and built no real suspense. A forced love story. And I understand that even a god of thunder must have a character arc and Thor's was a common one that I could have overlooked had it been better acted and yes better directed.The whole movie lacked gravitas. Plain and simple.There are some that have said it's nothing more than a twohour preview for the upcoming Avengers movie and I can't totally disagree with that. But it is not the worst superhero movie ever made far from it it is simply the weakest Avengers prequel movie made to date and yes I'm including Iron Man 2 in that category.Who knows? Check your brain at the door and you might just enjoy this special episode of Donald's Creek.".

When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a superhero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable. Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy slimy be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool superhero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.The effect's that I was expecting to be substandard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have. This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film. With any luck we'll see some of the other nine realms such as Muspelheim Alfheim or even Vanaheim.This is definitely a MUST SEE film".

It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kickbutt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen in years.The director's background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a superstrong god and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers  sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I've seen in years.".

The brave and often odd visuals never overwhelm the story and the audience never feels like they are not quite in on the joke like in The Life Aquatic. The tone does tend to become a bit erratic especially in the last third of the film when Anderson seems to want to pack so much into every frame that the film becomes a bit cartoonish at times hence the notperfect score from me. All in all though the plot is very balanced and the pacing is great. The two young leads are superb and the brave move by Anderson to place unknown actors front and centre pays off beautifully. The rest of the cast is on paper even more starstudded than The Royal Tenenbaums and yet Anderson never steers into unnecessary character development just to accommodate his stars. A touch here and a touch there are more than enough to paint a picture of a group of people who are eerily similar in their dissatisfaction with their lives and yet react quite differently to the two young lovers' dash literally for happiness. In conclusion a mustsee for Anderson fans and highly recommended for everyone else.".

	schema:headline " Possibly Anderson's best film in terms of style.";
	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1965 and a remote North Eastern coastal community is plunged into confusion when it discovers that two kids have run away. Sam a discontented Khaki Scout and Suzy a putupon older sister and forgotten daughter abscond into the forest to escape their dissatisfying existences. The responsible adults  Sam's Scout Master Ward Edward Norton and Suzy's parents Bill Murray and Frances McDormand  and the entire town set out on a frenzied search which gets wild when the largest storm in recorded history touches down and puts everyone's life into question. What ensues is a battle between youth and age hope and disillusionment faith and cynicism.In terms of story and character Wes Anderson's previous films especially The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited are superior. Even in the most compelling relationship in the film between Captain Sharp Bruce Willis and Sam doesn't embody Anderson's ability to take his characters into deep emotional places of hurt and healing without melodrama. However the newest addition to the Anderson canon is a cinematic experience.Moonrise Kingdom's story cowritten with Roman Coppola takes a definite backseat to style as Anderson saturates the entire film with a Norman Rockwelltype of Americana. Stylistically it may be Anderson's most masterful work as the costumes sets and settings transport the viewer to an alternate universe a place of wonder and adventure. The soundtrack is especially effective as it recalls a time when things were simpler Hank Williams was on the radio and children listened to records instead of playing video games. However Anderson isn't content with reminiscing about the year 1965. He takes this nostalgia and twists it infusing the film with a twinge of sadness through the reality of life's disappointments. He doesn't reject the Rockwellian view of America but argues that it doesn't tell the whole story.Moonrise Kingdom is that place of beauty and passion that we all have been in at least once in our lives  the one place on earth where we believe that anything is possible. It has since been lost but it persists in our memories in moments of nostalgia.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the dreadful title Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. Since his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss The Darjeeling Limited was too twee and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.Moonrise Kingdom doesn't repeat that error. Despite covering ground Anderson's already visited to an extent in Rushmore MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward who looks as if he's having the time of his life in shorts and woggles in charge of a troop described as 'beige lunatics'.Bruce Willis Frances McDormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though they're elbowing for the spotlight which keeps the mood kind befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout Sam and his penpal Suzy. Visually it's a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design but  as with the best of Wes Anderson  the devil's always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories keep an eye on the scouts' badges! and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable. Anderson flirts with surrealism but never gets Burtonesque controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre but the people in them are always painfully wonderfully human. It's also a rare film  one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered and no real violence or swearing.There is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.I loved it from the opening frames and it only got better from there.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the past Anderson has whirled us from melancholy dreamscapes set deep below the Pacific to tales of intergeneration betrayals in the name of love from doomed romances in Paris hotels to deliriously bizarre animal revolutions in the English countryside. But for all the retrostylings his films so proudly wear Moonrise Kingdom is Anderson's first period piece  a tender love story set in the sepiasoaked sixties of Anderson's youth that have worked their influence into every one of his movies. It is fitting that this film is his most childlike  not in any way any simpler than his other films as anyone with an accurate memory of childhood will remember all it's complexities the way each trivial thing became a nest of thorns but an accurate and deeply heartfelt depiction of childhood. It is not aiming to be as crushingly dramatic as Life Aquatic or as deeply tragic as Hotel Chevalier because that wouldn't be appropriate for the story it's trying to tell. Instead while still bearing Anderson's still surprising streak of black humour some acts of violence really catch you offguard then again children are violent so hats off Wes it is largely concerned with the dramas and tragedies of youth. Yes it is less ambitious than say The Life Aquatic but it also has none of the flaws that that film does and believe me I am a massive Steve Zissou fan. Instead it is perfectly executed wonderfully acted poignant beauty with fantastic performances across the board especially from newcomers Gilman and Hayward. This while not his most ambitious is certainly Anderson's most perfect work so far. You owe it to yourself to see this movie.".

	schema:headline " Might be my favourite Wes Anderson film";
	schema:reviewBody "The thing that I enjoy most about Wes Anderson films is that they each feel like a great adventure and in this sense I think Moonrise Kingdom is his best yet. It tells that tale of Sam an orphan on scout camp and Suzy a misunderstood girl as they run away together. At first I found the two actors playing the kids to be kind of limp but after a few minutes I warmed to them and I actually think they were both pretty good overall particularly Jared Gilman who plays Sam and even more so knowing that it's the first acting he's ever done. The rest of the cast are all pursuing or helping them in some way and there a couple of subplots with the island's policeman played by Bruce Willis and the parents of Suzy Bill Murray and Frances McDormand.I thought that the rest of the cast was great. In fairness I am a bit biased because I love Bill Murray Edward Norton Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand but even so I have to say that they were all really good especially Edward Norton who plays the scout master and Bill Murray. There are also a couple of minor roles for Jason Schwartzman Harvey Keital and Tilda Swinton who were also a lot of fun. Everyone in the cast fits into their role really well which is obviously exactly what you want but not only is that the case for the main roles but also for the less important ones like the scout troupe especially Sam's 'enemy' Suzy's three brothers or the oddball narrator.Cinematography wise I didn't think this movie was particularly spectacular especially in comparison to other Wes Anderson movies like 'The Life Aquatic' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. There were a couple of shots that were cool though some really long zoom outs which sounds clichd but it worked and the doll house type ones that I love and think are awesome.I wouldn't expect to wet your pants laughing at any moment in 'Moonrise Kingdom' but it is funny. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments and as a whole the jokes are pretty sharp and intelligently done. The reason I like the humour in this movie is that it's a part of the ambiance and feel of it it won't make you crack up but it will make you have a smile on your face for pretty much the whole thing and leave you feeling strangely happy.That kind of ambiance is really why the movie is so good and is possibly Wes Anderson's best movie. The whole story is this fantastic blend of reality and childlike dreaming and it's wonderful. At times I felt kind of nostalgic and sad that I'm not a kid anymore. On the other hand it feels like a tribute to those myths and dreams of being a child and it works so well. This is the kind of film that I feel I could watch over and over again each time spotting something new but also feeling good and enjoying the overall purpose.Definitely go and see it!".

Any fears of mine finding a sappy or saccharine story were vanquished and replaced with wonderment following the journey of the two main characters.

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1965 and pre teen pen pals Sam Jared Gilman and Suzy Kara  Heywood agree to run away from home and meet up a year after meeting  for the first time. While the two of them head off into the wilderness  of Suzy's twelve mile long home island a search party that includes  Island Policeman Bruce Willis Scout leader Edward Norton Suzy's  parents Bill Murray and Frances McDormand and Sam's fellow Scouts set  about trying to hunt the eloping children down in the days preceding a  huge storm.  I should say from the outset that I am a huge Wes Anderson fan and have  absolutely loved all of his films with the exception of Fantastic Mr  Fox so I went in expecting great things. My expectations were matched  and even perhaps exceeded. I loved this film. Anderson sets up Suzy's  home life in a fantastic opening sequence which features some exquisite  tracking shots through the family home. Before anything is said it is  already obvious to the audience that Suzy is a loner who longs for  something bigger something more. Her parents do not get on and are  never even seen in the same room let alone talking to each other. She  has three younger brothers who appear to get along very well. Her house  is large and well furnished indicating wealth if not happiness. All of  this is established in one long sequence of beautiful camera movements  which last no longer than a couple of minutes. Sam's life with his  Scout troupe is shown in a similar manner although it soon becomes  apparent that he has already escaped in search of his love Suzy.  One of the things I love about all of Anderson's films is that you  could turn on the TV at pretty much any moment during any of his films  and within a few moments be sure that you are watching a Wes Anderson  film. His style is very distinctive and it's all over his latest work.  The shots are framed to perfection and each camera movement feels  measured but not forced. There is a vague pastel and brown tint to  everything which matches the film's period setting. Everything from the  sets to the characters also feels slightly off centre and as though  they inhabit the same world as The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling  Limited. Anderson not only creates his own world for each film but his  films feel somehow connected and as though they too inhabit the same  slightly odd world.  The plot is absolutely delightful and sweet. It's such a touching and  loving story which also feels like a love letter to the children's  adventure books of which Suzy reads throughout the film. Though they  read these books the children long for an adventure of their own and  have finally embarked on one. The characters are equally enchanting.  Sam and Suzy are somehow both old beyond their years but also very much  still children. They have obvious intelligence and wisdom but convey it  through a child's eyes. They are on the cusp of adulthood but somewhere  in between. The acting of Hayward and Gilman is superb and again both  feel both older than they are but also very child like. They are great.  The adult characters are also great without exception. Bruce Willis is  a sad and lonely cop who patrols a quiet island and although he has his  faults is very kind and caring. Edward Norton is an exemplary leader  who also has a big heart while Bill Murray and Frances McDormand both  lawyers talk to each other using mostly legal language and although  are not really in love with each other care a lot for their children  and want the best for them. There are also small cameos from Jason  Schwartzman Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton all three of which were  welcome and provided something. The adult cast on the whole was  fantastic.  The score goes perfectly with the on screen action and features a  mixture of militaristic marching music classical and 60s pop. They  somehow all work together and help to push the story on to it's  frenetic final act.  This is a film with a big heart lovely story and plenty of laughs.  Although I only just saw it I already can't wait to see it again. It's  everything you'd expect from a Wes Anderson film but as well as being  unusual wacky and nice to look at also has a sweet story about  adolescence growing up and first love.".

They are on the cusp of adulthood but somewhere  in between. The acting of Hayward and Gilman is superb and again both  feel both older than they are but also very child like. They are great.  The adult characters are also great without exception. Bruce Willis is  a sad and lonely cop who patrols a quiet island and although he has his  faults is very kind and caring. Edward Norton is an exemplary leader  who also has a big heart while Bill Murray and Frances McDormand both  lawyers talk to each other using mostly legal language and although  are not really in love with each other care a lot for their children  and want the best for them. There are also small cameos from Jason  Schwartzman Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton all three of which were  welcome and provided something. The adult cast on the whole was  fantastic.  The score goes perfectly with the on screen action and features a  mixture of militaristic marching music classical and 60s pop. They  somehow all work together and help to push the story on to it's  frenetic final act.  This is a film with a big heart lovely story and plenty of laughs.  Although I only just saw it I already can't wait to see it again. It's  everything you'd expect from a Wes Anderson film but as well as being  unusual wacky and nice to look at also has a sweet story about  adolescence growing up and first love.";

	schema:reviewBody "Moonrise Kingdom is charming quirky cute affable wellcomposed sentimental nostalgic and pragmatic and I HATED IT. When it comes to Wes Anderson films there are three guarantees children will act like adults girls will carry around suitcases and parents will not understand  Moonrise Kingdom cashes in on the Anderson promises with much aplomb. If you have never seen a Wes Anderson film you might find Moonrise Kingdom to be magical and unique. If you have seen Bottle Rocket Rushmore The Royal Tennenbaums Life Aquatic and Darjeeling Limited you will find Moonrise Kingdom to be a tired regurgitation of a onetrickpony director who will forever try to recreate the popular and artistic success of The Royal Tennenbaums his truly benchmark work. Anderson is a very creative artist who freely steals from French New Wave and Italian Neosurrealism to craft highly choreographed and visually intricate films that specifically show the audience exactly what Anderson likes and how he likes to show these things he is an artist who works exclusively in a personal space and so far hasn't compromised his personal artistic vision. And there is also the rub! Anderson is incapable of working outside his space where he once filmed outside the box...he now is trapped in this box and ironically appears no longer able to think outside that box  he is a hostage of the aesthetics and style that define him. A tale set in the 1965 about two preteens who fall in love and escape into a boyscout fantasy of an adventure Moonrise Kingdom while displaying the very artistic template that made him a favorite of cinematophiles is also incredibly lifeless pretentious contrived and frankly poorly written. A standout cast featuring Edward Norton Bill Murray Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand are wasted on underwritten cardboard cutout characters that are weighed down by hackneyed clichs and insipid dialog. I do give kudos to the main two leads  the children  they give the film its only signs of life Kara Hayward would not look out of place in a Goddard or Fellini piece. While the story is mainly about unhappiness disenfranchisement and the ubiquitousness of love vs. duty it also provides no real substance regarding these themes meandering along until its trite conclusion. Moonrise Kingdom is a film that suffers the failure of style over substance  in so much as Wes Anderson's signature moves such as tracking from perfectly composed room to perfectly composed room are now too obvious and no longer meld in the wholeness of the cinematic aesthetic but instead point out too glaringly that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. There is a difference between suddenly seeing a Stanley Kubrick image and saying oh yeah this must be a Kubrick film to watching a Wes Anderson film and throughout the entire film you are drubbed to oblivion with the fact that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. Within 10 minutes of the opening I was tired of seeing what I was watching  it was so contrived and such a shameless display of idiosyncrasy that the film became a quest to find something new and fresh in it and unfortunately there is none to be found. With a script that is full of humor but none of it funny full of quirky characters but none of them interesting and full of pretty visuals that add nothing to the story Moonrise Kingdom seems like the death knell of the prototypical Wes Anderson film. But I doubt this will ever stop him  I applaud his artistic integrity and refusal to compromise with mainstream Hollywood but ultimately he is becoming Quentin Tarantino  a onenote carnivalist forever trying to recreate the success of his early work Reservoir Dogs is still by far Tarantino's best work and all subsequent films are the recyclage of Pulp Fiction the film where QT blew his entire artistic wad just like Anderson did with The Tennenbaums by insisting on a personal style that is adored by many but offers nothing new to the medium through which the artist tries to communicate. Like Bill Murray's character when told to stop feeling sorry for himself I ask... why?".

However these charms are wrapped in circumstances somewhat over engineered to be offbeat. The feeling of being manipulated limits the audience from fully enjoying the film although given the story can't fully sustain interest over its full length limits how much there is to enjoy. Also limiting the enjoyment are some highly uncomfortable scenes involving a twelve year old character being felt up in her underwear. People who find this discomforting and everyone should feel uncomfortable with it should avoid the film. In short if M.

But oh my God it was terrible the person I saw the movie with thought so too.The dialogue was witless and dull and hard to understand because all the characters speak in low monotones. They all seem quite depressed and dulled. There was not one single likable interesting character in the film with the possible exception of Ed Norton's besieged scoutmaster. Even the children are unlikeable especially the two 12 year olds in love. Suzie and Sam are not what you'd call a sympathetic pair of protagonists they're both as the film makes clear very mentally disturbed children and are so remorseless expressionless and lacking in affect as to appear nearly sociopathic. It doesn't seem like their relationship is based on anything resembling love love brings happiness and contentment and even when they're together they seem listless and depressed and rarely even smile. Maybe they're drawn to each other simply because they are both such strange damaged children. The scene where they tentatively engage in sex play is supposed to be amusing I suppose. But I found it cringeworthy these two are still CHILDREN and to watch them french kiss and hear that the boy got hard is grotesque not funny.The other children in the film don't come across much better they all have the curiously flat toneless voices that seem more suited to a jaded adult than a child the children in this movie ALL seem more like adults than children and none of them exhibits much in the way of personality except for the bad he might as well have THE BAD KID stamped on his forehead scout that gets seriously injured he's stabbed near the kidney by Suzie. The heroine of the film stabs another child with a pair of scissors...what a sweet girl! And then there are the things that make no sense at all. Why does Suzy immediately want an odd unprepossessing boy that she doesn't know at at all to write to her? How did the bicycle get up in the tree? Why do the scouts who previously had no liking for Sam at all abruptly feel compassion for him just because he's an orphan? these scouts don't strike me as a particularly sensitive and filled with empathy bunch and band together to help him run away with Suzie again? How can Sam get struck by lightning and pop up with no ill effects at all? How is it possible that Sam Suzie and Captain Sharp all survive intact after the church steeple they are on is completely demolished? Why is it so easy for Sam and Suzie to continue to see each other all Sam does is sneak in and out of a window with the help of his now foster father why does Sharp suddenly want to be a foster parent to a disturbed child? Captain Sharp? Wouldn't Suzie's parents be very vigilant about her not having any more contact with Sam? It all makes no sense.I thought about walking out on this movie which is something I rarely do. I wish I had this movie made me literally SICK! I left the theater with a pounding headache and a queasy stomach. Really it was THAT bad.Some people adore this film. All I have to say is that people who like this movie must like bad movies.

	schema:headline " I get Wes Anderson but still think it's a poor film!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was genuinely looking forward to seeing this especially as I hadn't previously seen a Wes Anderson film which appeared a major gap in my experience. I have to say that I found it the most dull unengaging film I have seen for some time but I acknowledge the difficulty of being critical of a film that so many consider exceptionally good. It's interesting though to see that there are a relatively small number of comments here that articulate the same reservations that I had.In case I was missing something fundamental I have since read up on Anderson's career and approach and I can see that he has his own distinctive trademark. But is that really such a positive thing? Some of the greatest directors manage to put their own stamp on a film by using their expertise to draw you in and thereby make you forget who the director is rather than via an obsessive need to make practically every frame indicative of their style. OK Anderson likes e.g. particular colours and very precise compositions within the frame  and perhaps his fans enjoy spotting such elements  but why should that increase the enjoyment of the viewer? I was intrigued by the potential of the story but I felt all the dramatic potential was lost due to it being secondary to Anderson's quirky and unreal world. E.g. Why does it enhance the film for the characters to display so little emotion and never smile? Why is there a need for distorting lenses? I'm amazed that so many consider the film romantic. Even considering that the kids are supposed to be somewhat disturbed it's notable that they display so little affection for each other even when saying I love you with absolutely no warmth. Like others here I was also uneasy about a film especially a comedy having scenes with two 12 year olds in their underwear kissing with the girl inviting the boy to touch her breasts and commenting on his erection. I wonder if all those praising the film for being cute and for its depiction of innocence would be equally relaxed about their children of similar ages if they have them having a similar relationship? Doesn't this send the wrong message to adults watching? Those emphasising the innocence also seem to have overlooked the boy using a fish hook to pierce the girl's ears the other boy that was stabbed and the dog that was killed or is all that OK because it's 'A Wes Anderson Film' and the fans are in on the joke? I accept that this review will have no impact on the fans that love the film but I'm still inclined to assume that so many like Anderson's style  and the unreal world he creates  that they are prepared to gloss over the lack of substance. But if you haven't seen the film yet and intend to do so I would urge you to genuinely watch it with an open mind and not be swept along into thinking that if you don't like an Anderson film you lack an appreciation for subtlety and 'indie' cinema. You may instead have noticed the unlikeable characters the irritatingly theatrical staging the not particularly funny injokes etc etc.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was genuinely looking forward to seeing this especially as I hadn't previously seen a Wes Anderson film which appeared a major gap in my experience. I have to say that I found it the most dull unengaging film I have seen for some time but I acknowledge the difficulty of being critical of a film that so many consider exceptionally good. It's interesting though to see that there are a relatively small number of comments here that articulate the same reservations that I had.In case I was missing something fundamental I have since read up on Anderson's career and approach and I can see that he has his own distinctive trademark. But is that really such a positive thing? Some of the greatest directors manage to put their own stamp on a film by using their expertise to draw you in and thereby make you forget who the director is rather than via an obsessive need to make practically every frame indicative of their style. OK Anderson likes e.g. particular colours and very precise compositions within the frame  and perhaps his fans enjoy spotting such elements  but why should that increase the enjoyment of the viewer? I was intrigued by the potential of the story but I felt all the dramatic potential was lost due to it being secondary to Anderson's quirky and unreal world. E.g. Why does it enhance the film for the characters to display so little emotion and never smile? Why is there a need for distorting lenses? I'm amazed that so many consider the film romantic. Even considering that the kids are supposed to be somewhat disturbed it's notable that they display so little affection for each other even when saying I love you with absolutely no warmth. Like others here I was also uneasy about a film especially a comedy having scenes with two 12 year olds in their underwear kissing with the girl inviting the boy to touch her breasts and commenting on his erection. I wonder if all those praising the film for being cute and for its depiction of innocence would be equally relaxed about their children of similar ages if they have them having a similar relationship?

Also I didn't like this whole idea of kids delivering adult dialogue and ended up disliking the protagonists a lot. They didn't feel like kids in the slightest so how is this whole first love between kids angle going to work here then? They're just flat and emotionally detached. All of the characters are essentially missing a human core.I also didn't buy the love story between Sam and Suzy and that makes everything else pointless. I'm supposed to think they're in love but it didn't even seem like they liked each other. Didn't care for the rest of the characters either despite there being some serious talent behind them.

It's quite fitting that he ventured into stop motion with The Fantastic Mr. Fox because the line between that and his live work is thinner than it seems. And never has that been more true than with his new effort Moonrise Kingdom.Without a doubt this movie has struck a nerve  in it's limitedrelease opening weekend it broke the alltime record for perscreen average at the box office albeit on only five screens. Even now it's only on 16 screens but averaged a massive 54000 per screen. By any measure this film is a hit. I loved Anderson's breakthrough film Rushmore but I've been somewhat indifferent to most of what he's done since. Moonrise is very successful at delivering what Wes Anderson delivers  an absurd surreal experience  a little precious maybe  but often quite funny and always interesting to look at. If he's your cup of tea I think you'll like this one  it might be his strongest movie since Rushmore.MoonriseKingdom007Briefly it's the story of 12 yearold Khaki Scout Sam Jared Gilman an orphan in New England in 1965 an emotionally disturbed kid whose foster parents have decided not to invite him back. At a church performance of Benjamin Britten's Noah's Flood he meets 12 yearold Suzy Kara Hayward likewise troubled  estranged from her parents Bill Murray Frances McDormand and sporting a violent streak she lived for her binoculars kitten and stolen library books. She and Sam hatch a plan to run away together as a hurricane bears down on tiny New Penzance Island where she lives and his scout troop is holding their summer jamboree. This sets the town in a desperate search for them including the affable police chief Bruce Willis and the wellmeaning scoutmaster Edward Norton.You should know what to expect here  lots of selfconscious Anderson charm and interesting visual tricks. The movie is a kind of moving storybook with lots of 360 pans narrowfield shots as if seen through Suzy's binoculars and pastel lighting. As all Anderson's films are it's a love letter to childhood and to social misfits. The adults are mostly wellmeaning but hopelessly lost in relating to the kids. Childhood isn't romanticized so much as fetishized  Sam and Suzy are hilariously frank with each other including on the subject of sex It feels hard. Does it bother you? and Sam's fellow scouts can be cruel but also hold a reserve of Us vs. Them loyalty. Authority is despised the social services lady refers to herself as Social Services and only interested in destroying Sam's uniqueness and forcing him to conform. Obviously Anderson isn't going for reality any more than The Brothers Grimm were  but he is trying to shed some light on childhood using fantastical means. And he largely succeeds thanks in part to Gilman and Hayward's straightforward charm. I suspect that many of the folks paying to see this movie don't realize that they're the ones Anderson is making fun of but that's part of the fun in watching an Anderson film. Bruno Wang says This is escapist entertainment and how much you care to read meaning into it is entirely up to you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hope hipstery is a word because that would be the perfect adjective to describe this film. I will say that the cinematography acting and the overall look of the film were nice but that doesn't make it worth watching. Now I'm not going to pull out that stupid argument that the audience is made up of pedophiles because I know some decent people who like this film. First of all this film does not take place in any sort of reality that is relatable because the people take several things way more seriously than any sane person would in real life all of the characters do and say things that no human being does or says no they are not just being quirky and apparently shock therapy is considered acceptable in this world. Also this film isn't funny. Wes Anderson was clearly going for that awkward sort of humor but it doesn't work because that sort of humor has to be relatable and this film takes place on some other planet. A great example of this kind of humor working is in the series Chobits. Yes Wes Anderson could not making a film as relatable as a show about a horny college kid who finds a sexy humanoid computer on the side of the road. The characters are boring. Seriously name one character with more than one personality trait. The whole thing just felt like a test to see if anyone would be brave enough to stand up to the majority and call this thing out for the pretentious waste of time that it is.".

The girl is your typical angsty teenager the boy has some drama added to his character through heavyhanded he is an orphan and his foster parents don't want him twist that is halfassed at best. The movie never explains why everyone hateshated him and why his foster parents don't want him. It reminds me of one of those stories your grandma tries to tell you about the back in the days when there was hay and she walked to school for an hour each way. It is colorful boring plastic that no matter how hard you chew stays plastic and no matter how hard you try you can never explain why you don't like it. But the explanation is simple  it's tasteless blah plastic and so is this movie. I guess the only audience for it is some nostalgic 60 70 yearolds that were in the scouts. 90 minutes of my life wasted.".

I think because I could relate to Edward no I don't have scissors for hands but what I mean is that this is a fairytale story but this is a simple story of a man who just wants to fit into a society of norms. This is completely Tim Burton's creation and story he's a very criticized director he's either loved or hated. Some consider his stories to be too dark and strange but when you get inside his head you realize this is a man who is pure genius. He thinks completely outside the box and doesn't just resort to what Hollywood wants he knows his audience and doesn't insult their intelligence he brings us a charming story about Edward Scissorhands.An elderly woman tells a story to her granddaughter of a man with scissors for hands named Edward the creation of an inventor. He raised Edward as his son and tutored him in various subjects but died while in the act of offering a pair of hands to Edward. Many years later local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs after failing to make profits in her suburban neighborhood visits a Gothic mansion on a hill. There she finds Edward and convinces him to have her take him in. Edward befriends Peg's young son Kevin and her teenage daughter Kim. Peg's neighbors become curious and thrilled at Edward's masterful skills at hedge clipping and haircutting. However Kim's jock boyfriend Jim dislikes Edward immediately. Edward's innocence becomes an easy target for everyone to take advantage of him as often as they can. Wither it's destroying his reputation or putting him in danger Edward was never prepared for this harsh world when he was given the kindest heart.From the acting Johnny Depp's first real leading role in a movie he's so young and so incredibly talented. He plays Edward with perfect sympathy not over or under acting it to be honest I'm a little surprised he wasn't nominated for an Oscar but it's such a bizarre role I think it was very over looked. He makes Edward into a charming beautiful character that you fall in love with. Dianne Wiest one of my favorite actress as the Avon lady Peg who takes Edward home with her the reason I love her so much is she brings so much class into whatever role she is playing. She seems like the most lovely woman you could meet and makes Peg into a delightful woman who just wanted to help this man and didn't realize the world she brought him into. Winona Ryder who was dating Depp at the time had great chemistry and was absolutely beautiful. To the sets which this world was just bizarre and stands out against so many other movies like a strange Leave it to Beaver nightmare all the houses in the suburbia are different pastel colors to this one hill with a dark castle. To the outstanding make up effects can only imagine the pain it took to get in and out of that costume for Edward. Edward Scissorhands is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion will always remain a treasured classic because all in all this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton should have won an academy award for this film. It is truelly a masterpiece. Never have I felt more sympathetic for a character before in my life. Edward Scissorhands...a creation...an unfinished product made by an inventor his father. When his father dies he is left alone in the mansion to fend for himself and discover things on his own without any guidance. Next an avon lady comes in and detaches him from his isolation and throws him into a society where everything is pastel everything is precise and everyone is stiff. Edward Scissorhands gets thrown into a world comPLETELY unlike the one he was used to. Now he is the outsider.Johnny Depp should have also won an Academy Award for his performance in this film. Although he had very few lines in this film less than 100 his facial expressions and actions spoke loudly. Every detail he gave his character was so perfect and precise. When Edward examines the water bed and takes his first sip of what I'm guessing is scotch or in the beginning when he takes his first ride ever in a car into town. Just the look on his face when he finally gets to see what the outside world looks like was pure genius.I hold this movie very deeply to my heart. In my opinion it encompasses every human emotion and nature. When Edward first arrives the locals accepted him and he became a famed hairbush stylist. In the end they turn on him and see him for what he looks like a monster. My rating for this film 1010".

Edward Scissorhands gets thrown into a world comPLETELY unlike the one he was used to. Now he is the outsider.Johnny Depp should have also won an Academy Award for his performance in this film. Although he had very few lines in this film less than 100 his facial expressions and actions spoke loudly. Every detail he gave his character was so perfect and precise. When Edward examines the water bed and takes his first sip of what I'm guessing is scotch or in the beginning when he takes his first ride ever in a car into town. Just the look on his face when he finally gets to see what the outside world looks like was pure genius.I hold this movie very deeply to my heart. In my opinion it encompasses every human emotion and nature. When Edward first arrives the locals accepted him and he became a famed hairbush stylist. In the end they turn on him and see him for what he looks like a monster. My rating for this film 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Scissorhands is really an amazing movie.  The plethora of lush cinematography beautiful musical score and great characters are extremely entertaining.  The storyline is simple yet very moving.  I still get mistyeyed at the end even though I watched it many times already.  The musical scores by the amazing Danny Elfman in Edward Scissorhands are one of his best work.  It is achingly beautiful.  Everytime Tim Burton and Danny Elfman worked together in a movie magic happens.  Burton's gothic style and Elfman's halloweenlike scores always blends perfectly.The story surrounds an unfinished creation named Edward played brilliantly by Johnny Depp.  The talented actor managed to make Edward a simple being that radiates vulnerability as well as restrained passion suggesting the real imperfect humanity within.  Edward's intimidating scissorhands and strange black  white physical appearance looked out of place amongst the pastelcolored suburban surroundings.  He is unique we both laugh and sympathize when we see Edward having a hard time trying to eat a single green pea with his scissorhands but then we become slackjawed to see that his expression of artistry in sculpting are effortless masterful imaginative and passionate.The movie ends rather sadly yet beautifully at the same time.  The tragic incident at the end over Jim Anthony Michael Hall is a single act of both unvented frustrations over the injustices done by Jim as well as to protect Kim Boggs Winona Ryder the love of his life.  This shows that although uncompleted the fearsome scissorhands merely masks our eyes to his feelings conflicts and the imperfections of that of a real human being. His body is not completed but his heart is.".

	schema:reviewBody "You could have thought that Tim Burton would rest on his laurels following Batman's huge commercial success. Well not at all. Edward Scissorhands appears like a more serious more mature and even touching movie. This modern fairy tale links skilfully elements from the basic fairy tale the castle and elements from the social life Peg's job as representative for a cosmetics firm and it can be divided into two parts the first one that epitomizes Edward's rise thanks to his scissorhands that give him gifts as a hairdresser and a gardener he becomes the idol of the town. The second one that shows Edward's fall following a burglary in which he was inconveniently involved in he becomes the town's bte noire and the movie becomes painful Tim Burton tells this modern fairy tale by introducing a lot of poetry and during his movie he tries to create an aesthetic beauty and he succeeds in especially with the gardens of the castle Edward's sculptures and Edward himself is goodlooking in spite of his scissorhands. But Edward Scissorhands is also a movie of contrasts. There's an obvious contrast between the brightly coloured town and the dark rooms of the castle but also one between the bright town and its inhabitants who are scornful or mocking. Besides they're the object of a satire of the actual society and Burton tries to underline its weaknesses. Of course the inhabitants appreciate Edward but only for his gifts. Otherwise they're mistrustful towards him because in their eyes he's different and eccentric you could be one of the inhabitants! and the single mistake the burglary can lead to unexpected consequences... Whereas Johnny Depp he's simply extraordinary and finds here one of his best roles. He provides to his character a lot of tenderness affection and above all a deep sensitivity. At last Tim Burton knew skilfully how to blend several cinematographic styles in just one film. In Edward Scissorhands you find everything comedy fantastic horror and drama. Moreover Danny Elfman's gothic music is widely gorgeous to create an intense emotion. It's sometimes difficult to hold his tears... All in all a movie which is both tender cruel and Tim Burton's best movie after Ed Wood.".

Like eveything I've seen by Tim Burton this film is at one and the same time warm and frightening tender and heartwrenchingly evil uplifting and dark.  The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see.  But in the final analysis the most important message the film has to offer is this Love truly does make the world go 'round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.  There will always be bullies just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts.  The most important thing is to be true to yourself treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win we all loseincluding the bad guys.  Excellent cast fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed.  One of Vincent Price's last performances if not the last.  I love this film!  Most highly recommended.".

When we see Edward in this pastel paradise for the first time it is apparent that he doesn't belong his wild dark and frightening appearance contrasting against the immaculate sweetly colored people and homes of the suburbs. It's an ironic contrast too as both of these 'worlds' reflect feelings and thoughts that should not associated with them  as Edward is a goodhearted person whereas the people of the suburbs are unkind and intolerant.When Edward arrives there he is welcomed and loved due to the way in which he can sculpt hedges dogs and hair into amazing works of art. But eventually due to human trickery and greed and Edward's want of acceptance and love Edward is painted by the townspeople as a monster when he is told to rob a house by the boyfriend of Peg's daughter Kim WINONA RYDER and he is ostracized by the town. Throughout the course of the movie Edward falls in love with Kim. Originally treating him as an outcast she falls in love with him too realizing what a kind and remarkable being he is.

Every expression on his face is full of raw emotion every cautious smile and every time of hurt and confusion. Johhny Depp is Edward Scissorhands. This is a wonderful fable from the brilliant imagination of Tim Burton. It's a twisted and sophisticated Gothic fairytale with a dose of comedy and a good helping of morality too. While a family movie it's not really for kids  some things in there even shocked me.This movie is amazing and I was entranced by it the very first time I watched it. I'm not usually one for ridiculous hyperbole about movies but there is very little wrong with this one. I love this movie. 1010".

Edward Johnny Depp is a lonely man with scissors for hands crafted by an eccentric inventor magnificently played by Vincent Price in flashbacks prior to his death. After Edward witnesses the death of his creator he stays locked away inside his mansion all day which is located atop the otherwise cheerfully pictureperfect local neighborhood community.Then one day a nosy neighbor decides to investigate and ends up bringing Edward to reality. He falls in love with a local girl Winona Ryder and is witness firsthand to the joys of life until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town. Soon everyone is out to get him for no good reason  the climax is beautifully done and because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much it's also very touching.The movie is decidedly odd but in a good way  the only problem is that it is occasionally quite thin when it comes to actual depth. Burton's never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical exciting fables see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example. Even Burton's Big Fish  arguably his most storyoriented film of his career  was somewhat shady. The mix of screwball dark comedy horror drama romance and elements and familiar happenings of other genres results in a very different combination. You can literally feel the vibe of this picture its heart pulsing black blood.The movie was a childhood project of Burton who drew sketches of Edward as a boy and used to alienate himself from his hostile surroundings by taking refuge in fictional stories involving the scissorhanded hero. As a result Burton's true affinity for the subject is evident  it's clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.The acting is marvelous  Depp's performance is one of his finest and arguably one of the most convincing and fun of alltime. Depp has formed a ScorseseDe Nirolike companionship with Burton over the years teaming up for various pictures including Sleepy Hollow and the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He's always had fun relishing his overthetop and absurdly dark roles such as Ichabod Crane in particular. In Scissorhands he gives the equivalent of a Travis Bickle  a man who feels shunned by society only to open his heart and have it feel crushed again. This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day. The tale does not grow old because the values are timeless.Edward Scissorhands despite its occasional flaws finally gave Burton the chance to unleash his talents as a visual filmmaker along with a pretty solid story mold  the result being a sublimely dark romcomdrama that never conforms to the typical genre clichs and becomes quite a unique film in its own little world.4.55".

	schema:reviewBody "I really cannot add too much more to the wealth of praise directed toward this film...much of it very deserved.  Tim Burton really shows us his ability to transcend mere comedic situationsPee Wee and Beetlejuice and tell a story of humour love pity conformity and so on in an eerie and entertaining way.  The way this film is constructed is amazing...the sets are wonderful as they depict something so real and yet so far away.  Burton takes us into a kind of fairy land of Suburbia...with a haunting empty castle at the end of the block that just happens to house a man with scissors for hands.  The music in this film helps create a great deal of atmosphere and really lends to character development  I particularly enjoyed his use of the music of Tom Jones.  The acting in the film is superb on all accounts.  Burton got a subtle and effective performance from Johhny Depp whose talents cease to amaze me.  A nice Burton touch was the use of Vincent Price in one of his final roles.  Although only in three scenes seeing Vincent again was a real joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Tim Burton's most powerful movies. Though the titlecharacter seems strange he represents the goodness in the world and what can happen when society just doesn't accept difference. The Gothic look of the castle combined with the glorious colour of suburbia creates a strong contrast and shows things may not be as they seem. Edward comes from the dark and scary castle but is gentle kind and loving the place he wants to be accepted into is the colourful suburbia which is backstabbing vicious and evil. This story shows the betrayal of a person who desperately wants to help and to love but does not realise he is being used. The only people that seem to understand him are the wonderful Peg Boggs played brilliantly by Dianne Wiest and the beautiful Kim played superbly by Winona Ryder. Tim Burton has created yet another beautiful fairy tale to captivate adults and children alike. Johnny Depp shows his great talent as an actor and Danny Elfman's music for the movie is some of the most beautiful you're ever likely to hear. A great movie for Christmas and all year round and while it is a classic story it also deals with the prejudices of society friendship family and love and I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to see it it is an experience well worth it and a movie you'll never forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first watched Edward Scissorhands my favorite movie of all time I was 13 and the only reason I saw it was because I was an avid Johnny Depp fan loving his looks and acting abilities. When I saw Edward Scissorhands I was deeply moved. I saw Edward as a sweet caring man a special individual a type of person I have only seen once. At the end of the movie I had come to love Edward and valued him as an unforgettable movie character. At the end I cried so hard. I was sobbing. It was horrible yet sad happy and beautiful all at the same time. Now every time I watch I swear I always cry. I'm just a romantic sensitive 14 year old. There are so many reasons though why this is my favorite movie. The least important one is that is has beautiful scenery. The pastel neighborhood looked like Easter colored candies. The house where Edward lives is hauntingly beautiful with the black decaying house yet the radiant garden of sculptured bushes and beds of flowers spread over the grounds. The scene with the Snow Angel. Oh. My. Goodness. That scene took my breath away. It was angelic exquisite magnificent poetry that captured the innocence of Edward and the beauty and creativity he possesses. The next one is the wonderful job of the cast crew music and director. I have to say that Tim Burton is my all time favorite director this was the piece that moved me the most. It is his greatest work the way he told the story. The cute beginning with the grandmother and her granddaughter the way he introduced the audience to Edward the way he tells the story throwing in the quirks and jokes without being dirty or crude like so many directors with no talent today. The way he told the ending the way he made us say  Oh that was so sad!! The next reason is probably a little foolish but . . . this was the very first movie to make me cry I mean sob. Until then at a sentimental part in a show play movie or song I was neutral showing no emotion. Now tears trickle down my cheeks when I hear Puff the Magic Dragon. The most important reason is this this movie made me appreciate the beauty kindness and sensitivity of the human heart those qualities that all humans possess but pretty much never reveal. More critical than that is it showed me the importance of love. The ending really made me realize that and not blush about it. Today I am one of the very few youth who realize the power of love compassion and kindness the beauty of the heart. Most people say that Edward was trying to fit in. Personally I think it is something else. I think he was looking for the feeling of being loved of knowing that someone cared about him of knowing that if he were alive someone would care. In reality is that not what we all want maybe deep down? We all want to know that someone cares for us more than anything. That someone would care if we were hurt lonely sad happy angry or whatever. In the end I cannot really fully explain why Edward Scissorhands is the epitome of film. I do know it's beautiful gorgeous touching cinematic poetry. Edward Scissorhands is not only great entertainment but it is a flawless piece of sentimental art that every person should appreciate. Edward was a sweet caring person with a heart of gold something so rare that of all the people I know there's only one person who is really comparable to him. That's sad really. All I can say as I begin to end this review is that Edward Scissorhands is probably the best cinema that has ever been created the best story that fully captures the depths of the heart touches you and makes you sad and happy at the same time. If you haven't seen it you should. I would give this movie infinity10 but it wasn't an option. Edward Scissorhands is cinematic gold.".

	schema:headline " Burton's Magnum Opus";
	schema:reviewBody "Here we go Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton himself has gone on record saying that this is the work he is most proud of for it captures the very nature of what his films are all about. Whatever his perspective is on the film this masterpiece is certainly my favorite of his filmography and for various reasons. For one it was the first collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp and this relationship still lasts to this very day. Depp has been the main player in many of Burton's flicks and it's hard to imagine some of the movies without him. Second it marked the swan song for one of my all time favorite actors the master of macabre Vincent Price who Tim Burton had idolized since youth. He even made a short film about Vincent Price in 1982 fittingly entitled Vincent. Third the film hearkens back to the 1931 Frankenstein film and makes the mad scientist's creation sympathetic and pitiful. Fourth the main character of Edward is such a whacky yet contemporary character that I can't help but relate to him at times. Then again I think we can all relate to Edward Scissorhands from time to time.The film constantly shifts atmospheres but it works greatly in this flick. One minute it can be a dark Gothic horror related atmosphere the next it's the bright sunny and upbeat suburban neighborhood. The film also has one of the all time greatest film scores performed brilliantly by Danny Elfman who's Ice Dance score fills me with butterflies every time I set my ears to it. One time when I was younger a saw snow falling outside on a cold winter's night but the darkness didn't stop me from seeing each individual snowflake. I immediately thought of the Ice Dance theme. It's the very epitome of a beautiful tune. In fact all the film's compositions are great especially the theme that plays in the opening credits of the movie where we see a montage of the old inventor's lab equipment. Perhaps my favorite scene out of the entire movie is the scene where Edward sees a can opener and has a flashback of the inventor's cookie making machine. The inventor played by Vincent Price walks in marvels at his contraption takes a heart shaped cookie and holds it up to the chest of the lettuce slicing robot that would later be transformed into Edward himself. It's a very touching moment and shows just how great ideas can be born from great minds. The acting in the film is also something worth writing a book or two about. Johnny Depp's debut in a Burton film is probably his best. Even if he has little dialogue Depp makes up his performance through his body language and movements. Depp based the movements of Edward off of Charlie Chaplin and it really shows for several scenes show Edward waddling about and making facial expressions the Tramp himself would make. My favorite line of his from the film is after the neighbor Joyce played by Kathy Baker tries to seduce him in the beauty salon and he meets up with the Boggs family in a nearby restaurant. When asked by the father played by Alan Arkin on how his day went at the beauty salon Edward tells him that Joyce lead him into the back room where she took all of her clothes off. The delivery and the way Depp says the line makes it not only the most humorous line out of the film but also the most perfectly time line out of the film. The other players are also grandiose with Anthony Michael Hall taking a break from playing the nerdy wise guy in John Hughes films and instead playing the dirtbag jock who torments Edward throughout most of the film. Winona Ryder straight from Burton's Beetlejuice is also the apple of Edward's eye and comes off as the pretty girl many boys her age would love to date. But one of the main reasons why I love this film to pieces is that it was Vincent Price's last and arguably his best performance in a motion picture. He plays the role of the inventor as a kind hearted noble fellow who was on the verge of creating a creation like no other. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein he's not an insane fellow obsessed with his work he's just a kind gentleman with a passion to build things and enjoy the very things he constructs. The scene where he passes is a heartbreaking scene for he was about to give Edward normal hands ridding him of the sharp scissorhands he was bound too for so long. Still Price is a child at heart in this film and his performance sums up his entire career in the Gothic horrormacabre genre. The scene in which he teaches etiquette to Edward is a memorable scene that will have you laughing and tearing up all at once.What more can I say about the movie it's magnificent. Sure some may question where Edward got the ice for the ice sculptures at the very end but that's a glaring issue. Edward Scissorhands brings us the best humor the best imaginative elements and the best performances out of any other Burton film. Some think of it as a retelling of Shelley's Frankenstein others say it's ET I consider it a collage of many things both from the horror and fantasy genres as well as the works of 19th century authors and their tales of weird beings and creatures of the night. And like I said earlier I relate a lot to Edward for he was a outcast like I am an outcast like we are all outcasts in certain times of our lives.".

He plays the role of the inventor as a kind hearted noble fellow who was on the verge of creating a creation like no other. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein he's not an insane fellow obsessed with his work he's just a kind gentleman with a passion to build things and enjoy the very things he constructs. The scene where he passes is a heartbreaking scene for he was about to give Edward normal hands ridding him of the sharp scissorhands he was bound too for so long. Still Price is a child at heart in this film and his performance sums up his entire career in the Gothic horrormacabre genre. The scene in which he teaches etiquette to Edward is a memorable scene that will have you laughing and tearing up all at once.What more can I say about the movie it's magnificent. Sure some may question where Edward got the ice for the ice sculptures at the very end but that's a glaring issue. Edward Scissorhands brings us the best humor the best imaginative elements and the best performances out of any other Burton film. Some think of it as a retelling of Shelley's Frankenstein others say it's ET I consider it a collage of many things both from the horror and fantasy genres as well as the works of 19th century authors and their tales of weird beings and creatures of the night. And like I said earlier I relate a lot to Edward for he was a outcast like I am an outcast like we are all outcasts in certain times of our lives.";

I often wonder if Burton's detractors have seen it I suppose they have or the thirteenyearold biggest fans who think that he directed The Nightmare Before Christmas.How can anyone not be touched by this movie? How can anyone not love Edward? How can anyone not think Kim is cute?By far the most touching of Burton's works his 2001 A Space Oddyssey if you will. And it is also his best film though Ed Wood does come close.The neighborhood Edward lives in represents everything wrong with society even if it is set in the 50s gossip alienating those that do not fit in etc.An example of this is a scene near the start were everybody in view of the camera does the exact same thing in almost the exact same order showing how mundane unimaginative and repetitive life is.Edward symbolizes the readiness with which we discriminate those who are different the gossiping ladies who instantly swing from one side of the spectrum to the other and who can't live without a juicy conversation are a little too close for comfort.A lot of Burton fans will tell you that Ed Wood is Burton's best film I disagree. This is for me my favorite Burton flick and I also consider it to be his best.Tim is always strongest when he works your emotions as opposed to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Mars Attacks etc. and this is his finest emotional film I cannot believe it isn't on the Top 250.Not to be missed.".

The snow scene is my favourite when Edward carves a figure of an angel with Kim's face from a block of ice while she dances in the snow below. However it is also capable of being very funny at times for example Edward's ignorance of words which mean something different from what you would think. Esmerelda Have you sheep strayed so far from the flock? Edward We're not sheep. Johnny Depp's acting is incredibly passionate. He was the perfect choice for the role. I honestly cannot think of anyone who could have played it better. The bitter sweet storyline is enough to touch anybody I still get misty eyed at the end and I think this may be the single most beautiful film ever. Watch it and who knows? Maybe you'll agree.".

The angellike look of Kim Jim's brutality and Peg's family's inability to see the problems as well as local housewives who are unable to use their own heads form a surreal reality so connected to Burton's creations. Burton shows our world in mirror.The scene where Kim dances in the snow is one of the most memorable love scenes in the history of cinema remarkable are also the giant sculpture of hand in front of the castle showing Edward's desires and the flashback that shows how dreams are sacrificed in the name of love.

I know they wanted to go for a fairytale style story but that doesn't mean the characters have to be 100 artificial. Couldn't they have done a bit more to minimize the feeling that we're watching mindless onedimensional caricatures simply existing for the sake of the movie? The characters have almost no depth at all. For example why did Kim ever fall in love with Scissorhands? She never had a reason to and the explanation given was not good enough. She went from almost being disgusted of him to... LOVING him? Not just being his friend not finally accepting him for who he is or even just his best friend but loving him...romantically. That's completely absurd. She was initially disgusted by him but it's after seeing him on TV and finding out that he would do anything for her that she begins loving him I feel silly just typing that. I'll tell you why she fell in love it's because the plot called for it.In the end when Ed saves the kid from being hit by the van that felt like a convenient scene to throw in to show Ed as a hero and to draw empathy but it makes no sense at all. Why would The Dead Zone's Anthony Michael Hall keep driving full speed after seeing the boy in the street? Even if he was drunk he would've made some attempt to swerve after seeing his girlfriend's brother about to be hit and you can't tell me he didn't see him. I honestly wanted to like this movie it's sweet and lighthearted but ultimately failed because there was too much in this movie that was contrived.".

This description sounds like a very serious philosophical and dour film and actually it is serious philosophical and dour but there is also a little warmth hope and humor maybe not for Antonius but for the viewer.When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess due to the plague Death is very busy he meets two actors Jof and Mia with their little son the most human characters of the film and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.Another reason for the impact this almost 50yearold film has still today is the acting Max von Sydow's face always seems to reflect what Antonius Blok is thinking Nils Poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and Bengt Ekerot's Death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs the best one being in Woody Allen's tremendously funny Love and Death. But the best performance is done by Gunnar Bjrnstrand as Antonios Blok's misogynist squire dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.The Seventh Seal is not subtle in raising it's questions that's for sure. But it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. It's disturbing and grim most of the time but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the magnificent 1957 classic The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman Antonius Block Max Von Sydow a knight returning home from the Crusades with his squire Jns Gunnar Bjnstrand meets Death Benkt Ekerot on a lonely beach and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins he lives. While the game goes on he gets a reprieve. It is the 14th century and suffering and pain abound. Penitents flog themselves seminarians rob the dead people go mad from fear and witches are burned at the stake. It is the time of the Black Plague and Death has his hands full. As in the Greek legend of Kronos and medieval folklore Bergman depicts Death as the Grim Reaper a man clothed from head to foot in a black habit and hood. In The Seventh Seal however Death is not frightening or sinister just an old man performing his job with a wry detachment.The film opens and closes with the passage from Revelation from which it takes its title When he broke open the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour' Rev 81. Bergman's message however is more about the silence of God on earth than in heaven. Block is tormented by the fact that God will not outwardly reveal himself. He says to a priest during confession I want God to stretch out his hand to me reveal himself and speak to me. But he remains silent I call out to Him in the dark but no one seems to be there. But Block still senses the God within him and is tormented. Why can't I kill God within me? he asks. Why does he live on inside me mocking and tormenting me till I have no rest even though I curse him and try to tear him from my heart' Block asks Death if he knows anything but he knows nothing. He even asks a woman being taken to the stake if he can see the Devil so that he can ask him about God but all she says is to look into her eyes. The Seventh Seal is not all heavy significance however. It has a good story with believable characters wonderful performances lots of comic relief and moves easily from drama to comedy as in the great Shakespearean plays. We meet an actor named Jof Nils Poppe his wife Mia Bibi Andersson and their infant son Mikael. Block looks with envy on the simple love of this family for their child. Both Jof and Block see visions of the spiritual world but Jof's visions are life affirming whereas Block sees only reflections of darkness. The film has unforgettable images such as a hawk floating in a cloudless sky two horses standing in the surf Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary caring for her child and a frightening procession of plagueinfected flagellants. Perhaps too melodramatic for modern viewers it has been parodied The Seventh Seal still touches a universal longing deep within us. Some view the film as a complete denial of God but it seems that God does show his face  only Block and his squire cannot see it. It is there in the wild strawberries the fun of watching a troupe of players perform the innocence of the little boy the eyes of the young lovers and the haunting visions of Jof. The film ends on a note of affirmation including one of the most memorable scenes in the history of cinema the Danse Macabre the Totentanz  a string of silhouetted figures dancing in a line with arms outstretched as they are about to enter the unknown. In the magnificence of his vision and the timeless beauty of his art Bergman has answered the question about God's existence simply in the act of posing it.".

Antonius Block  So I have noticed.The Seventh Seal considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement is the desperate prayer of a sensitive introspective and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep full of symbolism philosophy spirituality emotion and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning death with no understanding and faith with no validity Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.As the Black Plague ravages the world a Antonius Block and his squire Jons Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand respectively return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague their countrymen mad with fear and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death Bengt Ekerot. Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts knowing that Block cannot escape his fate and the two begin their game. As the story continues Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle but Death is always around the corner biding his time.Brilliantly conceived and stunningly executed Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breathtaking interpretation of the mortal struggle.A masterpiece!".

	schema:reviewBody "The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media including film.  And while many films question these mysteries they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown.  In Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL these mysteries are not only questioned they are dissected splayed and scrutinized.THE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism.  Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality.  The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy hooded figure Death.  Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it.  In the end however Death is a much better player than any of us and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage the end result is inevitable Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win we can never beat Death.In Antonius's search for answers he encounters a variety of very unique characters each with their own outlook on life death faith fear and love.  Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us.  For me the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film as it was extremely thoughtprovoking and carefully constructed throughout.  Almost every line spoken is in one way or another daunting and unforgettable.  Jns's description of love as the blackest of all plagues is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.THE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema.  It is a deep mesmerizing and darkly beautiful work of art.  More importantly THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn't just entertain but also has the power to change the way one thinks.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story of Antonius Block is the story of an agnostic who has begun to doubt. Is life really meaningless? Is the only true ethic of life to simply enjoy the moment? If God is there why does he not answer? Why does he leave men with kind hearts and noble aspirations to fumble in the dark dying of the plague with no answers? Perhaps Antonius reasons the answers only come from Death.No wonder then that as Death approaches him he cajoles the spirit to play a game with him. His intentions are to win but most importantly to find answers. The little I know of Bergman's youth the Paladin Antonius Block seems to symbolize Bergman's last struggles with his strict religious instruction as a child. Antonius' struggles Antonius' angst Antonius' withering agnosticism is a reflection of where Bergman was philosophically at this early stage in his life and career.The climax of the film is of course the final 'duel' with Death. Antonius attempts to cheat death and in the end death cheats him. This is an especially crushing defeat for Antonius because the answers Death gives him about the knowledge within Death itself is Antonius' worst fears come true.It struck me that in the final moments when each character faces there own mortality right in front of them that the strongest and purest reaction of them all is the one from the squire the atheist voice in the film. I think if you are an atheist this film is going to please you because clearly the sanest characters in this film are either indifferent or deny God's existence entirely.Whether it was intentional or not I think Seventh Seal is a very personal film. Bergman deconstructs his father's teachings to us openly. There's nothing sublime here this is a clear rejection of religion and the notion that death somehow provides 'answers'. The only answers according to this film lie in life and not death. A message Bergman delivers to us in striking fashion. A message Bergman knows directly contradicts what he was taught as a child.I think this is why later in life Bergman disowned this film. I think he saw too clearly how much of a very personal statement it was and how in some cases it was a vindictive film against his parents. It's why I believe Bergman couldn't stand to watch it later in life after he had reconciled with his parents.While Bergman disowned it for the rest of us we can admire it. For us the Seventh Seal is simple genius.  A dark but beautiful film that is pure and meaningful because it is so very personal. I confess I am a layman and I know little of Bergman's work and indeed have only seen this film once. But I loved this film. It struck a very personal reaction in me however uninformed that reaction might be. That reaction pure and simple is that this movie is a very personal statement about life God and death.".

In the Fourteenth Century a knight Antonius Block Max von Sydow and his squire Jons Gunnar Bjornstrand have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden and are beginning their journey home.  For Block it is a pensive time he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life as well as a resolution of faith which has deserted him.  Jons meanwhile is a study in jaded indifference who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden Death Bengt Ekerot comes for Block.  But Block strikes a bargain with him challenging him to a game of chess to be played as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails they will go on if he wins he will be released.  And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable.  By contrast Jons' strength seems born of his indifference he takes things as they come and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand a gifted eloquent actor and veteran of numerous Bergman films invests an earthy gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block.  It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech in the presence of Death is accorded to Jons for it elevates the character to a station equal to if not surpassing that of the protagonist Block. The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe Jof Bibi Andersson Mia Inga Gill Lisa Gunnel Lindblom Girl Anders Ek The Monk Ake Fridell Plog and Erik Strandmark Skat.  Written and directed by Bergman The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene in particular in which the players link hands and silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands as does this entire film as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.  I rate this one 1010.".

There are moments of sheer happiness and peace such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release being stunned by the quality of the photography and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Seventh Seal' is universally regarded as a masterpiece. It's one of those classics like 'Citizen Kane' 'Rear Window' or 'The Godfather' that has subtlety entered popular culture so even if you haven't actually seen it you recognize references to it in other movies TV magazines and everyday conversation. The thing is like the aforementioned and 'Rashomon' and 'Sunset Blvd' it isn't regarded as a masterpiece for nothing it really is one. I think anybody who loves movies will be totally knocked out by 'The Seventh Seal'. It's still one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Visually it's stunning the acting is first rate and the end result is mesmerizing. Once seen never forgotten is a cliche but it's the perfect description for this amazing film. Max von Sydow brilliantly plays Antonius Block a knight returning from the Crusades who challenges Death Bengt Ekerot to a chess match. He is accompanied on his journey home by his cynical squire Jons Gunnar Bjornstrand. Jons is my favourite character in the movie and as good as von Sydow is Bjornstrand's performance is even better. I also was very taken by the traveling actors who become part of Block's entourage Jof Nils Poppe and his wife Mia Bibi Andersson and confess to developing quite a crush on Mia. I cannot recommend 'The Seventh Seal' highly enough. Don't be put off by Bergman's highbrow reputation this is a movie that can be appreciated by anybody especially by old school horror fans. While it isn't strictly a horror movie itself anyone who admires the James Whale and Val Lewton classics of the 1930s and 1940s will find much to enjoy here.".

If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture and I probably never will that was so moving well shot written acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an alltime classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.A knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal one of the finest films ever made.If Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.My highest recommendation possible.".

	schema:headline " Intelligent and accessible with incredible imagery";
	schema:reviewBody "'I live now in a world of ghosts a prisoner in my dreams' a line spoken by Antonius Block Max Von Sydow in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman the film explores through an allegorical fashion human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home encountering several different characters but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding and I still a month after seeing the film for the first time see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony the film while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances.

	onyx:emotionText "'I live now in a world of ghosts a prisoner in my dreams' a line spoken by Antonius Block Max Von Sydow in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman the film explores through an allegorical fashion human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home encountering several different characters but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding and I still a month after seeing the film for the first time see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony the film while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances. It is truly unfortunate that the powerful image of man playing chess with Death has become such a clich and oft repeated in some ridiculous manner or another. Bergman directed a thoughtprovoking and beautiful film with 'The Seventh Seal' and I personally look forward to seeing it again this time not to grasp the story but to marvel at the incredible images.

I liked the symbolism of a man interacting with Death and the excellent scene of the plagued people and their march through the town but the majority of the film was simply dull dreary and boring.

	schema:reviewBody "I find it strange that The seventh Seal has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes it's very good especially for its time but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like Wild Strawberries Through a Glass darkly Persona Winter light and Fanny and Alexander it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much much better developed in the famous Faith Trilogy especially Through a glass darkly and Winter light. The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many comic relief moments.  Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very very good excellent at times but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischerwho worked on this movie and Wild Strawberries with Sven Nykvist. Watch Through a glass darkly or Persona if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even Wild Strawberries made shortly after The Seventh seal and looking visually quite similar is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course there were quite a few memorable images especially the start with Death on the beach the dance with Death at the end the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the villageetc. But still something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong actingespecially from Max von Sydov amazing dark medieval atmosphere really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie no doubt and it established Bergman as one of the alltime greats which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still my advice is don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie watch his others many of them are even better. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this pretty excited. After all it's far and wide described as one of the best if not the best film ever made. Frankly I didn't see it.The first problem I had with The Seventh Seal was the acting. The knight Death and the squire were highlights but the rest of the cast had an almost pantomimelike quality that is very very distracting. In fact this may not simply be an acting problem  many of the setups of the film are pretty pantomime there is a scene with the actors playing out a song involving a cock crowing while behind the stage another actor tries to seduce a girl which is not only sonically grating but completely ludicrous. I tried to work out if it was intended to be satirical but it actually comes off more like the Benny Hill show. In another scene in which one of the actors is made to dance like a bear on the table in an inn the camera cuts to reaction shots of the crowd who burst into hysterical laughter in a completely nonspontaneous false and bizarre manner. It just doesn't work.The second problem I had was the contrived nature of the situations the knight finds himself in at one point selfflaggelists walk into the village in a long procession waving incense and everyone kneels and weeps. This has been set up in advance by an explanation of who these flaggelists are. And because of the set up it again doesn't work. Similarly when the troupe are in the woods towards the end of the film they are faced with a character who has previously been shown to be a not very nice man with the plague. Why other than to have the troupe look death in the face and make the terribly unsubtle point about whether forgiveness should be given to those about to die is he in the woods miles from anywhere? Once again it doesn't work.Every question the film is trying to pose is given its own scene so that the whole story plays like a series of distinct vignettes linked only by the knight character and two or three characters who are obviously set up to take a fall later in the film. However Bergman sets up the film as a linear progression between the knight's knowing he is going to die and his ultimate death. You can't have it both ways  you either go down the vignette route or you go the linear route. You can't have the scene in the bar the flaggelists the burning of the witch all supposedly happening in a linear fashion since they are all a little too random to gel together.And for me at least the result of all this is that this is not a film that could ever be described as subtle. You see every question coming even before Bergman gives it its tenminute moment of screen time. The only thought left in your mind is what weird contortion of the plot Bergman is going to put us through to get to that question. And as a result the film is very boring to watch. At times I found myself begging that Death would show up just to add a little spice. And that's without even mentioning how excrutiating the songs are....All in all I'd say The Seventh Seal is very disappointing and I couldn't really recommend it. That said though any film that is rated so highly by so many people is always going to deserve at least a glance. It's clearly not trash.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for. But do I think he achieved it? No...for the simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened on the subject with no new knowledge.Bergman really has no answers to the age old questions we all have about life and death and what happens in the hereafter. And giving Death a human face seems to me the wrong decision on Bergman's part. He should have kept him a hooded spectre and nothing morefaceless and unknown within the shadows of his hood. Humanizing him doesn't work at least not for me.A cruel streak runs through some of the more boisterous moments such as when one of the actors is put through some hazing by a sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance. Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.But there are so many good things about the richly photographed film that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols flagellation the cross the witch burning and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about. But no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too eventually. Death will consume all.But Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The BW cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film while bleak and disturbing is always riveting to watch.It's a very engrossing film but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it.".

Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.But there are so many good things about the richly photographed film that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols flagellation the cross the witch burning and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about. But no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too eventually. Death will consume all.But Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The BW cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film while bleak and disturbing is always riveting to watch.It's a very engrossing film but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it.";

This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life. Everything about The Seventh Seal is extraordinary including acting. I especially liked Jns Antonius Block's misogynist squire  the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Bjrnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it there would be some pleasure in love but you don't die of it. Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength morale... If everything is imperfect in this world love is perfect in its imperfection. I know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did Fanny and Alexander Persona Smiles of a Summer Night and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. Not as anything is wrong with that. Woody Allen obviously thought the same. ".

	schema:reviewBody "And the best performance from an Actor in history. George C. Scott is General Patton the greatest General of World War II and the most controversial. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton tough resilient fearless sarcastic angry witty cultured charming bullheaded uncompromising temperamental and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding.

	onyx:emotionText "And the best performance from an Actor in history. George C. Scott is General Patton the greatest General of World War II and the most controversial. Scott gives the performance of a lifetime if Patton watched this film he couldn't tell the difference himself. Scott portrays him the way he was not the way he should be or the way we would like him to be. Patton is Patton tough resilient fearless sarcastic angry witty cultured charming bullheaded uncompromising temperamental and more patriotic than Uncle Sam on the 4th of July. The speech at the beginning with him in front of the American flag sets the tone. It's his way or the highway. And Patton is driving. His antics tick off the high command and rankle his subordinates but they all can't argue with his success. Karl Malden is his good friend and at times adversary General Bradley who is as resourceful as Patton is eccentric and they make a great pair. Every time Patton has a victory he screws it up by way of his gargantuan mouth. But he keeps going. When disaster strikes he always manages to pull defeat out of his rear and strike a blow for the 2nd Corps or the 3rd Army or whatever army he's commanding. His soldiers love him his soldiers hate him but his soldiers fight for him regardless because they know he's the best. Patton's rise is like Patton's fall momentous. His last line is the most telling of all. They remind us that glory like everything else is fleeting. Glory may be fleeting but this movie won't be. Perhaps the best war movie in history.";

	schema:reviewBody ". . . and it's not even about the war.  There's no wall to wall action.  In fact World War II is merely the setting  a backdrop so to speak  and the battles are all downplayed in favor of giving the audience a glimpse into the brilliance or insanity of the historically significant character Patton.  From the script on up everything plays out wonderfully to bring the famous general to life on screen and after watching George C. Scott deliver his Oscarworthy performance I find it hard to believe there were a number of actors on the list above his name.George C. Scott's performance of Patton is one I consider the greatest given of any war film.  Patton is a champion for freedom while sometimes equally as much of a tyrant as the ones he's trying to put down he's a monster and a hero and neither he nor the filmmakers give a damn about political correctness.  I found the character to be an overly harsh prick myself but in some strange way very likeable and sympathetic and when watching the movie again I don't look at the screen and say Hey there's George C. Scott.'  Instead it's Hey there's Patton.'  Not very many film characters have a personality strong enough to overtake the actor playing them.  I appreciate that depth and that degree of realism this attention to detail on the parts of Scott and Schaffner.  Schaffner surprised me by somehow managing to capture my interest on a subject matter I'd ordinarily write off as too silly Planet of the Apes two years later he applied that same technical know how craft and intelligent storytelling towards a film whose subject appeals to me from the get go and once again I'm impressed.  There are some great war films out today however Schaffner's take pursued the most unique perspective in all realms and captured my imagination with such ease . . . I can't help but come back to it over other war films.And I have to comment on the score which is not only one of my favorite Goldsmith scores but also one of my favorite warfilm scores.  Jerry Goldsmith matched point for point the brilliance of Franklin Schaffner's vision the depth of George C. Scott's performance and somehow managed to captured the essence of both musically.  A good music score is one that tells the story of the film in its own unique voice.  Goldsmith's score has such a prominent voice in the experience of Patton that to remove it would be the equivalent of removing Schaffner's direction or George C. Scott.   Lastly how accurate is the film?  Not a clue and even if it is completely false I don't care.  I've never been about writing history papers based on cinema experiences.  All I know for certain is that Patton is a very entertaining and well balanced movie that holds up very well thirty years later and it's a film that can be admired for its craft.".

Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both he and Scott create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it...

His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...According to his theory of war Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily slicing the island in half...

	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago I had the pleasure of reading The Patton Papers a collection of Gen. Patton's diary entries and letters edited by Martin Blumenson.  Having seen the movie I think that no actor has ever better captured the spirit of a man better than George C. Scott nor has any movie better portrayed that spirit than PATTON.Patton was a man who lived for war.  World War II was the high point and culmination of his life.  He didn't fight for any principles he didn't fight to defend freedom or democracy or any abstract idea he fought because he loved fighting.  In his diaries you can read of his fear of flunking out of West Point the prospect terrified him because he was certain that he would never be good at anything except being a general or a leader of a country.  As a leader of men he was exceptional.  His speech at the beginning of the movie is vintage Patton an almost exact reproduction of a speech Patton actually gave to Third Army.  It's tough and nononsense Patton lets you know in no uncertain terms that he is here to win to destroy the enemy and by God you'd better be too.  I don't know if Patton actually directed traffic on the roads as he is shown doing in the movie but it was a very Pattonish thing to do.  Patton did on at least one occasion get out of his staff car and join a squad of G.I.'s in heaving a vehicle out of the mud. Try to imagine Montgomery doing that the very thought is hilarious!Patton's character explains his treatment of his men.  To those who had been wounded fighting for him he was always kind and considerate.  But to those whose minds could not stand the horrible strain that war imposed on them he was merciless he could not comprehend the fact that other people didn't share his love of violence for violence' sake.  PATTON shows this aspect of his character very well.Karl Malden's Omar Bradley is shown in an almost fatherlike role he sees and recognizes Patton's immense talents as a general and uses them in spite of Patton's natural ability to antagonize everybody around him.  Not shown in the movie is Patton's unloveable characteristic of turning on his subordinates once they surpassed him in their careers.  Patton had nothing but good to say about Bradley until Bradley was promoted over Patton's head whereupon Patton savaged Bradley in his diary.  Patton did the same to Eisenhower.A general can have no higher compliment than the fear and respect of his adversaries and as PATTON demonstrates Patton was more feared by the Germans than any other Allied general at least on the Western front.  As one German officer observes all too prophetically the absence of war will destroy him Patton.  And although mankind's single greatest stroke of good fortune in the 20th century was that Russia and America never came to blows it is still hard not to feel sorry for Patton as he desperately seeks his superiors' approval to carry the war on eastward into the Soviet Union  anything just to have a war to fight.  Patton is like an addict to a destructive drug.Hollywood has rarely given us such a textured and human portrait of a great man cruel often foolish in his relations with others rude and psychopathically attached to violence but brave dedicated and loyal. Certainly those who like myself have Jewish blood or who were otherwise marked for death by the Nazi state all owe him a great debt of gratitude for his pivotal role in destroying that state.  And yet had he been born German Patton would surely have fought just as devotedly for the Nazi side. I'm glad he wasn't.Rating  out of .".

	schema:headline " Scott Delivers Memorable Performance";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a long but interesting character study of a reallife person General George S. Patton who also was a real character. Gen. Patton was one of the most famous military men of World War II a super gungho leader who admittedly had an intense passion for battle. How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made  during the heyday of the antiwar Vietnam movement  I have my suspicions but for the sake of the review I will assume all of this is true.Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way thanks to the acting of George C. Scott who was astounding as Patton and gives one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.Not only is Scott's acting superb the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect in which they were filmed. I can't imagine viewing this on formattedtoTV images. I think much of this movie was filmed in Spain.I think the filmmakers also did a nice job of not overdoing the action scenes. When overdone violence can get boring. The explosions and machinegun fire was realistic especially for a film that is now 36 years old. Going back to what's true and what isn't if it was then Patton was a poor excuse for a Christian which he claims to be here. For one thing Christians don't believe in reincarnation at Patton claims he did in the film. There are other comments too which shed a poor light on his religion something Hollywood loves to point out.Nonetheless if you enjoy character studies this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That and the rest of his performance and this movie in general is one you won't forget.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a long but interesting character study of a reallife person General George S. Patton who also was a real character. Gen. Patton was one of the most famous military men of World War II a super gungho leader who admittedly had an intense passion for battle. How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made  during the heyday of the antiwar Vietnam movement  I have my suspicions but for the sake of the review I will assume all of this is true.Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way thanks to the acting of George C. Scott who was astounding as Patton and gives one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.Not only is Scott's acting superb the widescreen photography is also good.

Eisenhower unseen and the media are portrayed as unsympathetic to the maverick Patton who is so singleminded in his determination to defeat the Germans you have to root for him despite his boorish behavior.And that is why Patton works  you have an unambiguous war against and unambiguous evil  Nazi Germany. Whereas Vietnam might have been a tough conflict for even its supporters to explain World War Two was quite simple  we were the good guys and they WERE the bad guys. And so you COULD root for the US Army and Patton without feeling a tinge of guilt.Also superb in the film is everyman Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley providing the stable and workmanlike leader and one who rises quicker in the ranks due to it to Patton's egomaniac.And Yes George C. Scott delivers a careerdefining performance that is one for the books. Could Brando or Telly Savalas have pulled off the role as well? I don't think so  it was just tailor made for Scott.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a splendidly done movie. Scott's performance is powerful. He does everything but reach out grab you by the shirt and shout in your face. Karl Malden is likable and full of common sense but he is the only person in the movie whom we can grasp as a character  except for Scott himself. Scott is as good at his job as Patton was and in fact the quality of his performance is less volatile than Patton's own with virtually no weak spots.That's part of the problem. Patton himself. I suppose that like most people he had a good side  loving family played with his dog collected stamps and whatnot. But as good and aggressive a general as he was he wasn't a particularly likable guy. It's easy to demand that everyone in your command have shoes as shiny as yours  especially when you've got some black PFC doing your shining for you.The movie is noticeably slanted. Patton's weakness like Coriolanus's is ambition. Sometimes it's played for laughs. He carried the stars of a Lieutenant General around with him until word of his promotion comes down then immediately has them pinned on. But only three times is his meanness illustrated without tongue in cheek. 1 During a conversation with Bradley he reveals that he's disobeyed orders by sending his army on a mission to beat Montgomery in taking Sicily. He calls the attack a reconnaissance in force. He receives an order to get his troops back where they belong and tells his aide to send the message back because it's garbled. A simple old soldier Bradly comments disapprovingly. 2 He orders General Truscott to stage some amphibious landings which will help him take Messina before Montgomery. Truscott complains that they're not prepared to do that without heavy casualties. Patton lies down and threatens to fire Truscott and get someone else to do the job. 3 While visiting a hospital and presenting the wounded with decorations he comes across a soldier whose nerves are shot and who is weeping and Patton slaps him twice and sends him back to the front.His mean streak went beyond those incidents. He used to practice his arrogant threatening scowl in front of the mirror. Whether or not it improved the GI's morale to wear neckties in combat is at best arguable. What would Patton make of the Israeli army? But the simple historical fact is that the movie pitches even these mean incidents at the audience like softballs. He didn't just slap a soldier who was feeling sorry for himself which is the picture the film presents. He slapped two soldiers on separate occasions one suffering from combat fatigue which is no joke and the other from malaria and other illnesses. Patton also enjoyed an intimate relationship with his niece a Red Cross donut girl who accompanied him in England and France much to his wife's displeasure.Those slapping incidents cost Patton a bit in the way of professional esteem but it didn't cost any lives. And it didn't cause him any remorse. Even in his apology he claims he was trying to shame a coward. What DID cost lives was Patton's cobbling together a small task force to liberate a POW camp in Germany shortly before the war's end when such a dangerous move was no longer necessary. Task Force Baum was recognized by its leaders for the lost cause it was a plunge deep into enemy territory without any backup. There were 53 vehicles and 294 men. All the vehicles were destroyed or captured. Twentyfive of the men were killed 32 wounded and almost all the rest captured. The purpose of the mission it was tacitly agreed was to rescue Patton's soninlaw.His fitful harshness towards his troops is usually justified in the movie even if it looks excessive. The soldierslapping scene is preceded by one in which Patton kneels in the hospital whispers something to a soldier whose face is covered by bandages and lovingly places a medal on his chest. Next thing he encounters Tim Considine fully dressed sitting up and sobbing with self pity. Earlier when Patton asks a cook why he's not wearing sidearms the cook laughs genially and replies Sidearms? Why hell General I'm a cook! I missed the part where cooks learn to laugh in the face of orders from a general but it gives Patton a chance to tear everybody a new one.Everyone paid for Patton's ambition and vanity even those not under his command. The gasoline and other supplies he diverted to his own forces during the run through France helped him alright but they were also needed elsewhere.The movie's subtitle is Salute to a Rebel. Very stylish for 1970 audiences but the material is presented in such a way as to leave us with a lingering admiration for Patton's genius and bullheadedness. What kind of rebel was he? He was more of an authoritarian Arschloch than anybody else in his greater vicinity.What the writers the director and George C. Scott have given us to paraphrase someone else is not a wartsandall portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart.I gave the movie high marks because it's as well done as it is  disregarding its relationship to Patton himself. I didn't mind so much that the wrong tanks were used and that the production could only find two Heinkel 111s in flying condition. The location shooting is great the cinematography crisp and unimpeachable the score one of Goldsmith's best and Scott's performance deserved whatever awards it got.".

He fits the part as well as Paul Schofield fits Thomas Moore in 'A Man For All Seasons'.Scott's presentation of an ambitious singleminded overbearing man brimming with selfbelief is wonderfully realised. You cannot imagine that he is anything but the general he pretends to be. At times likable and loathsome we nevertheless care about him and his sometimes strange contradictions.. If not for his unpromising face and gravelcrusher voice GCS would surely have been one of the leading heroladiesmen of his day. Yet despite the punishedlooking expression and the Dalekwithasorethroat delivery every feature and vocal tone manages to carry some subtle nuance of emotion and thought. Scott is a real actor from a time when acting carried more weight than good looks. Ernest Borgnine cut a similar figure.This is a movie about a general. War takes second place. We get to know the kind of man responsible for the lives of thousands. We learn about his own personal and political wars his likes and dislikes and those who like and dislike him. There's a lot more of the latter. He shows us that heroes can sometimes be insufferable. They are often driven men who drive others just as hard and this excites resentment. Worse still it excites ingratitude. For however much we may despise them they are needful to the hour. Without them we would be lost.There is war and the action is perfectly adequate for the movie's vintage. But the real war is Patton's own. His victory is the victory of personal ambition.Other actors pale into insignificance. And maybe this was intended by the director. The only other instantly recognisable face is Karl Malden's which is scarcely more ornamental. The budget is big and deservedly so. locationwork is expansive filming lighting and editing all hit their targets.Warmongers like Patton may be discountenanced now in this politicallycorrect age of leftwing liberalism. But when the enemy begins banging at the gates  who ya gonna call? Very highly recommended.".

A few observations on the movie Even when I was a kid seeing Patton when it came out in 1970 I was suspicious of the tanks used in that battle scene in North Africa. Even then they didn't look like the classic German tanks...Patton's speech in the beginning of the movie was edited for content. If you ever read the original version of his speech it makes the movie version sound like a church sermon.I also wished that the movie had pointed out that in WW1 Patton commanded the first ever American tank battalion and was severely wounded in battle yet kept fighting until he just about passed out from  loss of blood. I thought this should have been brought out that he had practiced what he preached... Gen. Omar Bradley portrayed in the movie as Patton's buddy he was nothing of the sort. Jealous of Patton the real life Bradley would go to Eisenhower behind Patton's back to stymie George's success.Monty Sorry Monty fans but the movie points out one historical fact. Monty usurped needed gas and supplies from Patton in September of '44 for his disastrous Market Garden attack watch  Richard Attenborough's A Bridge Too Far as a companion movie to Patton. Thanks to Monty the war went on much longer than it probably would have if Patton had been allowed to drive into Germany. Patton's arrogance helped win battles. Monty's arrogance gave us the Battle of the Bulge the fire bombing of Dresden not to mention countless Jewish lives lost. Patton had the Germans reeling in the fall of 1944 and as the movie pointed out had the army in just the right place at the right time to end it.

	schema:reviewBody "Franklyn Shaffer's Patton opens with its most emblematic image General George S. Patton Jr. played by the coincidentally namesake George C. Scott standing in front of a giant American flag to deliver one of the greatest cinematic speeches. Yet the film is too 'intelligent' to be labeled as gratuitously patriotic. The Best Picture winner of 1971 is a thoughtprovoking exaltation of warfare through the portrayal of a man who loved his country but loved fighting even more and embraced victory with such passion he became its own incarnation. General De Gaulle began his Memoir by stating All my life I had a certain idea about France . In the same vein Patton's speech expresses a certain idea ideal of America a domineering and strong country crystallizing all the prestigious characteristics of the previous victorious nations. Halfmad halfgenius General Patton believed in reincarnation a faith driven by the passion in History that nourished his mind with the exploits of Caesar Hannibal Napoleon Frederick the Great and to a certain extent even an enemy like Rommel whom he read the book was respected for his war tactics. I was there loved to retort Patton referring to historical battles with a crazy smirk that no one ever dared to contradict. In his mind America was the Roman Empire's reincarnation that provided him the ultimate opportunity to finally fulfill his dreams of conquest victory and prestige. More than proAmerican he's supraAmerican his ideals indeed transcended the limited barriers of a nation as he repeated he's not a politician and certainly not a diplomat his job is to fight and to lead his Army to Victory victory or annihilation. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans which gets me back to the opening scene. There's so much to say about it this marvelous piece of inspirational brainwashing written by an Oscarwinning Francis Ford Coppola.I say 'brainwashing' because the words work there's something authoritarian in this unique raspy voice that resonates in the hearts of all the listeners. I'm sure it made many Americans proud to have had such a great leader and nonAmerican wish they could have such a leader. I'm sure many of us younger generation wished we could prove our value on the battlefield and as for the antiwar people there's still a possibility to admire a man who was faithful to his principles. Feared or respected I don't think there was a way not to admire the man even secretly. Hell even the enemy admired George Patton.And how couldn't they? Patton was a biggerthanlife foulmouthed idealist in other words a naturalborn leader. And the genius in Scott's performance relies on the way we never cease to doubt over Patton's capability to win the War and his unpopularity among his own peers make him all the more appealing. No General would have slapped a weeping officer victim of shellshock and whether Patton was right or wrong to do what he did in the second most emblematic scene of the film we feel that it's precisely the kind of behavior that only a great man would have done. A great nation needs a great army therefore great soldiers. Ego? Yes but indispensable to inculcate this very idea of America.They never know when you're acting and when you're not says an aide pointing out Patton's talent he's convincing and his convincing craziness is the expression of his ferocious attachment to his personal vision. Did all the great men believe in God? I don't know but I'm sure they did believe in Destiny therefore on a mysterious Godlike vision that wrote the course of events in the right way. Did all the great men believe in Destiny? It's precisely what made them great their ability to foreshadow the future to see what had to be done. Patton was a visionary. He had his opinion on the war in Europe on the conflict with the Russians and he knew that a man like him was born to meet his Destiny. Beyond George C. Scott's magnificent performance there's also Francis Ford Coppola's gripping script we can't help but feel that Lieutenant Kilgore from Apocalypse Now owes to Scott's portrayal and paralleling the War if one can't be lost given the right leader right artillery spirit weapons a movie with the right writing directing music who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's catchy tune and acting can't fail either. But although it had a fair deal of supporting performances apart from Karl Malden's depiction of Omar Bradley no one could hold a candle to Scott. He carried the film and embodied to the most infinite details Patton's charisma. Even when he defied the Academy by refusing his Award there was a sort of Pattonesque irreverence in Scott's attitude. And Scott indeed made me believe that one man can change the course of War. Ironically Scott was so omnipresent that the best scenes to give insights about his aura belonged to the German side starting by Rommel's decision to wipe out Patton's army before he did so you could tell in his eyes when he was told about Patton that he realized he met his match. In another scene a General expresses his disbelief that the American Army would ban Patton because of a vulgar slap and at the end you could clearly see a respect toward the pure warrior and living anachronism a Master of War who could only be destroyed by an absence of War.Anachronism yes  Patton also respected his enemies as they belonged to the same race fighters. With his vision of chivalry bravura he despised the bombs that could be dropped automatically wars without fights without heroes of cowards. I wonder what he would have thought about the two Hiroshima and Nagazaki bombs one thing for sure If Patton's state of mind didn't belong to his era his aura could appeal to any country ".

	schema:headline " Inaccurate history";
	schema:reviewBody "Scott's Patton was way too heavyhanded. Patton was nothing if not lighthearted and depended upon his staff far more than displayed in the film. Karl Malden needed more than his gimmick of chewing on a piece of straw for his Bradley portrayal  he does NOT resemble Omar Bradley. A total miscast the result of Hollywood's continual illusion that any good actor can portray any personality faithfully. Of course Hollywood script writers seldom are very familiar with the historical figures they create on film or what they did. The major problem with this film's script was its absurd portrayal of Patton as a tank expert. He certainly was not that. Innumerable examples from the war prove without any doubt that Patton completely misunderstood the purpose of armor in WWII. The most glaring and well known example was his rejection of the M26 Pershing tank in favor of the horrible Sherman they had used up until the Tidworth Downs conference in England prior to Normandy. His brainless decision based on obsolete Army theories of armored warfarewas vehemently opposed by every armor commander who had had experience with the Shermans in Sicily and North Africa. Everyone except Patton was well aware of the severe deficiencies of the Sherman tank but Patton's rank and obstinateness prevailed. That I rank as the most disastrous decision made by any US commander in WWII  it lengthened the war and killed many thousands of those unfortunate enough to be selected to be a member of a Sherman tank crew. After the invasion when it became readily apparent just how inferior the Sherman was a growing scandal was hushed up by the governments of both Britain and the US. Despite the fact that Patton's rejection of the vastly superior Pershing was easily the most significant and far reaching decision he ever made the film doesn't even mention the fact. This totally destroys the credibility of this film. Typical Hollywood history  things are portrayed the way some scriptwriter wishes they had happened. Buy hey that's Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this the same night I saw THE HURRICANE a movie that claims to be a biopic on Rubin Carter but which is nothing more than total fabrication . PATTON is an entirely different kettle of fish and while not being entirely accurate  I'll come to that later  does at least have many accurate points Undoubtedly the best aspect of the movie is George C Scott who is physically almost identical to George Patton . He captures the arrogant mannerisms of the American general very well and few and far between are movies where a performance like this dominates a movie . Ironically this is a case of where an Oscar for best actor was fully deserved and yet the recipient turned down the honour . There's also obviously a lot of thought gone into the screenplay as to where to begin and end the story . Do you start when Patton was a child and find out what motivated him to be a soldier ? Do you start when he fought in the American Expidionary force in France 191718 ? Do you finish the story with his death ? I think that writers Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H North have got the settings right with starting the story with the immediate aftermath of The Kasserine Pass and finishing the story while Patton was still alive . The screenplay itself is somewhat knowingly ironic as Patton spouts  America has never and will never lose a war  while it was becoming obvious in 1970 there was no way the US were going to be victors in Vietnam . It was a well known fact that Patton despised Monty and much of Patton's motives were of beating Montgomery as much as the Germans and this might have led to needless deaths of men under Patton's command . The screenplay while not exactly spelling this out does hint that his dislike of Monty led to Patton's reckless streak and the audience are left to make up their own mind on this issue . It was also well known that Patton wanted to throw back the Soviets from Eastern Europe  Monty also had a hatred of communism but was far less vocal about it  and there are conspiracy theories that the car accident that killed Patton wasn't an accident at all . Thankfully the screenwriters and producers have absolutely no time for any conspiracy theories of any kind While being a good movie PATTON fails to be great one simply because niggling little faults creep into the movie like historical inaccuracies . In the aftermath the Germans discuss the battle of Kasserine Pass where  The Americans were led by the British general Anderson  Who was Anderson ? The Americans who were badly defeated at the battle were led by American general Lloyd Fredendall without doubt the worst allied general of the war and it was this that led to Patton being appointed to his post . Rommel is portrayed as having the utmost respect for Patton and his American troops but in reality this wasn't actually the case . Throughout the war Erwin Rommel had contempt for American equipment  With good reason since German Panther and Tiger tanks were far superior to the American built Shermans and the same applied to preceding equipment  and servicemen and counted Monty as his arch nemesis not Patton . Also as with most American war movies made round about this time the tank battles fought between Americans and Germans seem to be composed of both sides using American tanks built in the 1950s All in all a biopic that while being better than many others isn't flawless but like I said if you want to see how NOT to make a biopic watch THE HURRICANE".

	schema:headline " My Retort to the Saturday Evening Post I Respectfully Disagree!!";
	schema:reviewBody "General George Patton was a natural born leader who thrived on victory and detested defeat!! His passion for military triumph put him in the category with the stellar generals in WWII comprising of himself Dwight D. Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur!! This triumvirate of generals was a select group of military leaders who were driven by emerging victorious in battle!! For them to be writhing with conviction and to be motivated by ultimate confrontation signified an irreplaceable exuberance which is a quality of an individual that belongs solely to the fortitude of a genuine leader!! The callous gratification of wartime victory involves a temperament of egomaniacal obsession and impervious obstinacy for purposes of adhering to the compulsory premise of all or nothing!! The contention issued by the Saturday Evening Post that Americans were complacent in their plight of embracing mediocrity which ran the gambit from fighting in a war to fornication was something that Patton vehemently disagreed with... It was Patton's theory as it is mine that Americans have an intensity to win to strive to be the best!! Our nation was built on the foundation that every American can epitomize his desired accomplishments because he is an American and Americans strive to be the best hence Americans love a winner!! The desire to win World War II with Americans was indeed pandemic!! When someone says they hate a winner the term hate serves as a malignant euphemism for wistfully resent to which a winner could just look at this person with star lighted eye contact and say REALLY!!. The stakes for victory in WWII severely differentiated themselves from winning a baseball game. While one is for purposes of giving the fan his money's worth the military success in World War II dealt with an end result being one of painstaking encroachment to the pinnacle of world conquest!! Patton once said  I don't want my soldiers to like me I want them to fight for me...The operative word in the phrase young men who are willing to die for their country is willing!! Patton did not wish his soldiers to die for their country he wanted other soldiers from other countries to die for theirs!! Patton's soldiers were American soldiers the best soldiers in the world and they had to survive which ultimately translated to America winning the war.. Patton was a born leader who had an inherent yearning for victory as well as crystal clear conception of the visceral elements of survival!! Patton's rigid and quasi tyrannical dictatorship was for purposes of ensuring the allied power's democracy.. This film Patton takes you through the laborious processes Patton engaged in to secure that the United States attain a resounding victory in WWII!! The eloquent spokespeople in the White House abhorred Patton's desultory decorum particularly with regard to his ostracizing the Soviet Union something which Patton did with an unmitigated disdain!! Patton's cannon of cogency pertaining to his military and political ethics was something that he carried around with a very unapologetic disposition. The part in the movie when Patton George C Scott said that the greatest part of his life was serving as a five star General in WWII became a dirge of candor which the movie audience could thoroughly believe!! This comprehensive account of Patton's life during WWII was a stunningly successful effort by directing great Francis Ford Coppola!! Best known for Godfather Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now. Coppola wrote the script to Patton in corroboration with director Frank J Schaffner Famous for Planet of the Apes. This film is an accurate historical review of the prevailing circumstances of the United States involvement in WWII .. History has perennially been a collaboration of stubborn facts which reflect our failures and triumphs during any given era andor event!! Whether writing or directing a movie Francis Ford Coppola has an acute knack for accurately pinpointing the bittersweet rewards and repercussions of our nation's military conflicts as he did so brilliantly with Patton. George C Scott does General Patton justice with this role as he provides a succinct portrayal of Patton as a man who was driven by fervent and coveted accomplishments!! AFI The American Film Institue ranks this film as one of the top 100 American Films ever made!! The film Patton won the academy award for best picture in 1970 and deservedly so!! The auspicious direction that this film perpetuated was an enlightening summation of history which enabled me to have a better understanding of what our primary purpose was in World War II!! I strongly recommend seeing this film!! It is definitely amongst the greatest films in the American cinema world!!".

Patton once said  I don't want my soldiers to like me I want them to fight for me...The operative word in the phrase young men who are willing to die for their country is willing!! Patton did not wish his soldiers to die for their country he wanted other soldiers from other countries to die for theirs!! Patton's soldiers were American soldiers the best soldiers in the world and they had to survive which ultimately translated to America winning the war.. Patton was a born leader who had an inherent yearning for victory as well as crystal clear conception of the visceral elements of survival!! Patton's rigid and quasi tyrannical dictatorship was for purposes of ensuring the allied power's democracy.. This film Patton takes you through the laborious processes Patton engaged in to secure that the United States attain a resounding victory in WWII!! The eloquent spokespeople in the White House abhorred Patton's desultory decorum particularly with regard to his ostracizing the Soviet Union something which Patton did with an unmitigated disdain!! Patton's cannon of cogency pertaining to his military and political ethics was something that he carried around with a very unapologetic disposition. The part in the movie when Patton George C Scott said that the greatest part of his life was serving as a five star General in WWII became a dirge of candor which the movie audience could thoroughly believe!! This comprehensive account of Patton's life during WWII was a stunningly successful effort by directing great Francis Ford Coppola!! Best known for Godfather Godfather Part II and Apocalypse Now. Coppola wrote the script to Patton in corroboration with director Frank J Schaffner Famous for Planet of the Apes. This film is an accurate historical review of the prevailing circumstances of the United States involvement in WWII .. History has perennially been a collaboration of stubborn facts which reflect our failures and triumphs during any given era andor event!! Whether writing or directing a movie Francis Ford Coppola has an acute knack for accurately pinpointing the bittersweet rewards and repercussions of our nation's military conflicts as he did so brilliantly with Patton. George C Scott does General Patton justice with this role as he provides a succinct portrayal of Patton as a man who was driven by fervent and coveted accomplishments!! AFI The American Film Institue ranks this film as one of the top 100 American Films ever made!! The film Patton won the academy award for best picture in 1970 and deservedly so!! The auspicious direction that this film perpetuated was an enlightening summation of history which enabled me to have a better understanding of what our primary purpose was in World War II!! I strongly recommend seeing this film!! It is definitely amongst the greatest films in the American cinema world!!";

They were able to capture the atmosphere of war better back then..This movie is free of the propaganda that is in many war movies that depict the Nazis as barbarians and the allies as liberators. Patton is correctly depicted as a man of the military. He even admits it during the movie unlike MontgomeryBradley or Eisenhower who have different attitudes.Patton is seen more like an officer of the Afrika Korp than an Allied General. This movie does a great job in being true to form in portraying him and showing the viewer the mind set of the General who is clearly not a fan of ceremonial military forces but a force that can repel attack and launch daring Napoleonic warfare against enemy forces.This movie is well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "24 Hour Party People is the story of Factory Records a defiantly eccentric independent record label based in Manchester England which discovered acts as influential and diverse as Joy Division and the Happy Mondays.The film is shot in mockdocumentary style and narrated by Tony Wilson Steve Coogan the founder of Factory. Coogan portrays Wilson's double life as music svengali and cheesy local TV reporter to brilliant comic effect. Although Brits will draw the inevitable parallels between Coogan's Wilson and his ultranaff TV persona Alan Partridge Coogan actually has Wilson off to a tee. Arrogant and pompous Cambridgeeducated Wilson is master of the  pseudish sound bite when he realises they have no tickets for a concert in his nightclub he retorts Did they have tickets for the Sermon on the Mount? Of course they didn't people just turned up because they knew it would be a great gig'. But he also has a perceptive eye for the zeitgeist and his vision to create the Hacienda club transformed Manchester into Madchester for a brief time the music capital of the world.The story really starts with an early Sex Pistols gig in Manchester attended by only 42 people most of whom went on to have an influence on the Manchester music scene of the next 10 years. Wilson was in the audience together with members of the band who went on to form the brilliant postpunk pioneers Joy Division. The first part of the film is really focussed on them and their manager the aggressive and cantankerous Rob Gretton  played by Paddy Considine and their producer the irascible acidcasualty Martin Hannett another superb cameo by Andy Serkis  both of whom are no longer alive. Joy Division's lead singer Ian Curtis  is portrayed so accurately by Sean Harris that it's positively eerie and the scenes of the band playing in rundown venues seem remarkably true to life and capture effectively the rawness and intensity of their live performances. The film also deals rather insensitively with the death of Curtis who's feet we see swinging after he has strung himself up on a rope in his house. This segues uncomfortably into a town crier announcing his death to the world and ends with scenes showing Curtis's body in a coffin at the crematorium.From then on the story continues with Joy Division's reincarnation as New Order and the building of the Hacienda nightclub and the sometimes disastrous business decisions made by Wilson and Factory. When New Order released Blue Monday the record sleeve was so expensive to produce they lost money on every copy sold. The single went on to become the biggestselling 12' of all time paradoxically crippling Factory in the process. The first nights at the Hacienda were also calamitous with bands playing in front of singlefigure audiences. Eventually however the druggy indie dance kings Happy Mondays arrived on the scene and acid house was born. Suddenly the Hacienda was the place to be and the Madchester rave scene became famous all over the world. The scenes of drugsandsexexcess on the Monday's tour bus and the recreation of the Hacienda club nights are superbly portrayed.The final part of the film tells how gang violence led to the closure of the club and the drugriddled misadventures of the Mondays especially their singer Shaun Ryder led to their downfall and had severe financial implications for Factory Records Wilson had inexplicably sent them to Barbados to record their last Factory album.  Eventually Factory was sold lock stock and barrel to another label who were  perturbed to find Wilson had not signed any contracts with any of the Factory bands effectively giving the artists total creative freedom.24 Hour Party People is a real rollercoaster ride. There are some brilliant acting performances punctuated by cameos from real members of the Manchester music scene such as Howard Devoto and Mark E. Smith. The merging of legend and reality may make it difficult for people unfamiliar with events to work out what actually happened. But this is no accurate austere documentary but a touching sometimes surreal and often very very funny anarchic portrayal of a time and a place and it's music. Oh and of course the soundtrack is fantastic.".

That's probably true for people who don't know Joy Division New Order or the Happy Mondays but I think it's totally unfair to discredit this film on a basis of a lack of prior knowledge. Many great films and novels aren't great because you get them on the first try and I think that this movie follows the same path. If you didn't like it the first time take a look at an old Tony Wilson interview or a concert tape of Joy Division and you will instantly see the quality production and acting that went into this film. Ian CurtisJoy Division are portrayed with an eerily haunting accuracy down to the instruments they play which are rumoured to be the originals from the late 1970s  and you can tell that the cast really did their homework. The concert scenes are spectacularly energetic the sets especially the Hacienda are ripped right out of the time period. Comic relief isn't overlooked as the dry humour of Steve Coogan and the rest of the cast  is pursued to the dime. The unscripted dialogue is also quite good which is another indication of the actors' homework. This movie is worth the time it details a very important time and place in pop music history that is often overlooked in the wake of much larger more commercialized scenes. Rave and postpunk may be fading today but one need only take a look at the charts to see its influence. Go out and get this movie learn a little about it and you will be impressed.".

Well done wry and entertaining. My only quibbles are that the filmmakers seem to be preaching to the converted. Except for the tragic Ian Curtis JOY DIVISION little attempt is made to inform the uninitiated as to why these bands mattered NEW ORDER in particular is just tossed around almost as a brand name rather than a living breathing artistic unit. Also we are constantly told how wonderful Manchester is as a city but we are never really shown why. Steve Coogan's portrayal of Wilson really makes the film flow and live.

A joyous love letter to the music magic and madmen of Manchester 24 Hour Party People is utterly utterly exhilarating.  Even if you don't know your New Order from your Durutti Column you'll be hardpressed not to get a kick out of Michael Winterbottom and Frank Cottrel Boyce's freewheeling depiction of a great time in pop culture.In a nutshell this is the story of a scene a scene that grew out of the british punk explosion of the mid seventies.  Inspired by the rising vibe in his home town television presenter Tony Wilson with the aid of colleagues Rob Gretton and Alan Erasmus created Factory Records.  Factory is as described in the film an experiment in human nature with no written contracts barring one written on a napkin in Wilson's own blood and total creative freedom for its acts.  From the mid seventies to the early nineties Factory launched a barrage of fresh and exciting talent on an unsuspecting world ranging from punk Joy Division later to become New Order to house A Guy Called Gerald and dance Happy Mondays.  At the centre of it all was Wilson all the while balancing his empire building with a steady day job with Granada Television.  Winterbottom's film crams sixteen years of music history into under two hours using and appropriately chaotic mix of storytelling techniques to rocket the story along.  It's by no means an accurate account just listen to the commentary by Wilson on the DVD but encapsulates the spirit of the Manchester Movement beautifully.  The plot itself is split into two halves. Firstly the early punk days spearheaded by a promising quartet called Joy Division.   Joy Division were the first notable artistic success of the label but were hindered by controversy the name was derived from the Nazi division of women who were used in an attempt to create the master race gigs that often degenerated into brawls and most crucially a talented but troubled severely epileptic lead singer one Ian Curtis.  The rapid rise and even faster fall of Joy Division anchors the first half.The second half sees us bear witness to the birth of rave culture aided along by one of Wilson's acts the Happy Mondays.  Formed by brothers Shaun and Paul Ryder they blazed through Manchester in a blizzard of coke and heroin and shaped dance music in no small way.  Oh and they pretty much helped to run Factory into the ground.Bouncing from hilarious comedy a great deal of it improvisedto genuine poignancy the decline of Curtis is heartbreaking stuff the film is an utter triumph of wit wonderment and technique.  As Wilson comedian Steve Coogan is nothing short of dynamic.  Teetering on the right side caricature and injecting a great deal of his Alan Partridge persona in to the mix Coogan is the lynchpin for an otherwise wildly chaotic narrative.  The entire cast do sterling work impersonating the Manchester luminaries of old and by old I mean young before the drugs and booze.  From Danny Cunningham's uninhibited Shaun Ryder to John Simm's gentle Bernard Sumner and Andy Serkis's fearsome Martin Hannet an arguably more fearsome character than Gollum if you ask me.... they're all great.  But best of all is Sean Harris who is simply unforgettable as Ian Curtis.  He's so deadon accurate its almost scary from the haunted eyes and cheeky humor witness his first meeting with Wilson to the eccentric dance moves its a performance that deserves every award in the book.Oh and the music.  Well if you're already a fan I sure as hell don't need to say it do I?  As it was so it goes and so do I.  See this movie before you die.  Go on rent it tonight rent it now buy it if you have to or if you're really desperate just steal a copy.  But please see this movie you won't regret it.".

Making matters still more difficult is the variety of extremely thick accents  to a point of entire sections of dialogue or monologue occasionally flying by with only a single word or two actually registering with me. While it added to film's authenticity that got to be more than a bit annoying after a while. Where's that closed captioned TV set when you desperately need it?As far as the treatment of the subjects themselves goes the movie does an adequate job. I mean when it gets right down to it the only structure such a film can moreorless follow is the basic listing of a series of real events and in this particular case most of them already well documented. Naturally as such it doesn't allow for a whole lot of substantial artistic freedom so the director employs many little asides winks and nudges by our narrator Tony Wilson often through the 'fourth wall' as well as visual tricks and obviously music to make this different from say something you might see on VH1's 'Behind the Music'. In addition to being one of the major driving forces behind the whole scene Tony also held a fulltime job at Granada TV all throughout this period which the movie uses skillfully for comic relief.Predictably not that I'm complaining things like Ian Curtis' suicide the opening of the Haienda club ascent and demise of Factory Records Shaun Ryder's famously outofcontrol  self destructive shenanigans all receive special treatment. Through Steve Coogan's excellent performance Tony Wilson our guide through this zoo comes off as a pretty fascinating fellow. Director Michael Winterbottom makes a wise choice in leaving out many details from his private life in favour of the music itself and the people who created it. Wilson's second wife and kids for example are barely mentioned  with a cheeky remark about Tony being a minor character in his own life story as an explanation for the lack of onscreen time devoted to them.In the end whether or not you enjoy '24 Hour Party People' will largely if not entirely depend on your level of familiarity or appreciation of the bands like Joy Division New Order The Happy Mondays and to a lesser extent of their punk inspirations and predecessors like The Stranglers The Jam Buzzcocks Sex Pistols Iggy Pop Siouxsie and the Banshees who are also depicted in the film.Personally even though I was always aware of the British new wave most of its music  'shtick' pretty much slipped under my radar so I recently started discovering it retroactively. Therefore it was a blast to see a welldone interesting film celebrating that era in popular music. These blokes created  performed honest fullblooded passionate tunes which is the single most important thing that comes through the movie.P.S The Smiths another famous and influential Manchester band are notably absent from much of the film. This is probably due to the fact that back in 1983 both Tony and New Order producermanager Rob Gretton agreed their demo was crap so instead to Factory they went to Rough Trade Records based in London. They're mentioned briefly at the end though when Tony speaks to God himself who among other things tells him it's a pity you didn't sign The Smiths.  Brilliant!".

This is probably due to the fact that back in 1983 both Tony and New Order producermanager Rob Gretton agreed their demo was crap so instead to Factory they went to Rough Trade Records based in London. They're mentioned briefly at the end though when Tony speaks to God himself who among other things tells him it's a pity you didn't sign The Smiths.  Brilliant!";

	schema:reviewBody "24 Hour Party People is just one of those movies that has that click with the subject matter. The actual style of the film corresponds with the music the irreverence and the energy of it all. But there's more than just the unconventionality of the script and direction the film has that sort of streamofthought wry distinct British humor to it and a sincerity beneath the absurdist parts. It follows its main character down the line in a surreal way like a documentary if that makes sense we move between Tony Wilson addressing the audience played by Steve Coogan who is so on target with the honesty of the portrayal you can't picture anyone else in the role an almost behindthescenes filming of it I think and a dramatization shot on pure digital independent vibes.Wilson who sees the Sex Pistols play in Manchester his hometown and the main base and heart in the location of this film is also a journalist on television. He gets so enamored with what he sees as an extremely important part of history the viewer will get a good idea of this he gets involved with the bands the locals and goes from just bands to maintaining the Hacienda a club. Some parts of the film one might expect if considering it includes the rise and fall of fame or rather in this film a lot of times in the mind and the drug scene coinciding with the music. One knows that Tony Wilson is the main character the protagonist basically in every scene but somehow he does not become the only important part of the film's success. The music too is a huge factor and the speed it sets for a movie like this.As much biography as musical 24 Hour Party People brings to light the scene of Manchester as a history lesson but an entertaining one to boot. Bands like New Order the form after Joy Division split will be known to most who follow music but unless if you're not really steeped in the newwavedance scene of the 80's and 90's some of the bands may sound totally unfamiliar. Still this is not an automatic deterrent the music is what it is and most who will want to see the film will know what they're getting in truth the ratio of British punk and newwave vs. electronica is fairly balanced. But even when some of the music doesn't stand the test of time it serves the story all the same some of the more interesting and darkly funny scenes are when no one comes to the club the sort of 'mixway' between the two musical eras.And all through this Coogan plays it like a pro. The Coogan Wilson of course is far from the real Tony Wilson one of the DVD interviews says he's a 'Jerry Springer'looking type so it becomes more of being a character in this whole environment that springs up around and by him. In a way he's kind of like a British Andy Warhol with the idealistic serious journalist instead of the painterfilmmaker. There's a sort of checked insanity that underlays some of his performance and yet for most of the time like a lot of the better British actors he doesn't play it more for laughs than he needs and when serious dramatragedy comes up it's still kept to this reality. So along with him and the music and the strange form of putting together a dramatized documentarymusicalblack comedy by director Michael Winterbottom and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce it all gels. This is one of the finest sleepers I've seen in a while.".

However it's something different something better. Though many have compared it to the likes of 'Studio 54' Lord knows why '24 Hour Party People' is a far better made and more effective film. Based on a true story it takes place during the time when punk rock was subsiding and new kinds of music were born in England. Shot with a digital camera in documentary style with some use of live footage and narrated by Tony Wilson who leads a double life as a TV reporter and music producer Michael Winterbottom takes us into the rave culture in Manchester that of sex drugs and rock and roll. We see it all from Wilson's point of view and we are amused by the layers of his character. Coogan breathes life into Tony Wilson and brings an excellent humour in his portrayal. Paddy Considine and Shirley Henderson stand out too. Pretty much all the performances appear authentic. Watch out for cameos by Andy Serkis Simon Pegg and Marsha Thomason and by real bandmembers. The portrayal of the Manchester culture the scenes inside the club and the bands look very real. Winterbottom infuses loads of energy and craze to 'seduce' the viewer. He cleverly injects dry humour which only supports that this is more than just a documentarylike movie. The soundtrack is a musthave and for those who love movies about music this is a must see.".

	schema:headline " I wish I could love this movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "As I am a big fan of the bands who secured the glory of Factory Records especially Joy Division and Durutti Column I was quite impatient to discover 24 Hour Party People. I watched it last night and the first thing i will say will be the following one how disappointed I was! The scriptwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce and especially the director Michael Winterbottom did a really bad work and I will try to explain why.For me 24 Hour Party People is an enjoyable movie to listen to mainly thanks to the music. Someone has written on this site that you had to be British to appreciate the music. Not necessarily. I am myself French and I love most of the bands who signed for Factory Records. Obviously you have to like this time English independent music of the eighties this culture. That said these bands aren't very known in France where they remain at the stage of cultbands. Michael Winterbottom's flick was apparently successful in GreatBritain but in France it was belatedly launched on the 4th June 2003 and it went unnoticed. But the main problem is that 24 Hour Party People is visually an exhausting movie to watch. I must say that I don't appreciate very much the making adopted by Winterbottom. There's an amateurish side reinforced by a granular and quite dirty photography in his way of filming that I highly disapprove. It seems that his camera can't stand still even in the quietest moments. On another hand when the movie arrives at the end of the eighties the golden age for Manchester as if he wanted to recreate the crazy atmosphere of the town in 19891990 he didn't skimp on the flashy effects which ends up annoying the spectator. Then Winterbottom must have been influenced by Trainspotting 1996 because in his directing we can sometimes detect a video clip side.To go on the authors of the movie seem to have forgotten one important thing. Factory Records wasn't only limited to Joy Division and the Happy Mondays. There was also Durutti Column and New Order. All right the movie doesn't forget them but you can only see them for a few minutes. Given that the film nearly skips the mideighties and quite obviously Joy Division and the Happy Mondays's careers especially interested the authors. Due to this you can easily separate the movie in two parts. The first one mainly focuses on Joy Division while the second involves mostly the Happy Mondays. This characteristic is confirmed with the cover of the original soundtrack which depicts Tony Wilson of course but also Ian Curtis and Shaun Ryder. By way of consolation we can object that Winterbottom had intuition for the cast because the actors he hired to play the musicians are very true to life especially the ones in the roles of Ian Curtis and Bernard Sumner. Furthermore the actor who acts Martin Hannett is very convincing in the shameless personality of this extraordinary producer.Tony Wilson's voiceoff is necessary to guide us through the most important stages. So as to give the spectator interest in the film it can also be a good thing to make Wilson directly speak to the camera to make us share his feelings his thoughts on Manchester the music. So long as this idea doesn't overload the movie and I have unfortunately this impression. Winterbottom and Boyce should have restrained these too frequent apparitions.The screenplay retained the most outstanding moments in the history of Tony Wilson and Factory Records but it doesn't stop it from having neglecting important stages as well. For example I am sure that the fans of Joy Division would have liked to see the band recording their great disembodied album Closer 1980. Then in the first part of the work the punk and newwave spirit are well rendered in one sequence we see one character taking off from the wall a poster depicting Pink Floyd's album Dark Side Of The Moon no Pink Floyd in 1977! as well as the festive one in the second part through the Hacienda and ecstasy. But because the director wanted to dazzle the spectator at a visual level it is difficult to fully enjoy this exhausting film. So you are never touched by a movie that is meant to take a nostalgic look at a past time.This is my opinion about 24 Hour Party People excellent music but an average movie. If a director wishes to make a film about Alan McGee the former boss of Creation Records Oasis and Primal Scream's former record company I hope he won't do the same mistakes as Michael Winterbottom with this flick.".

The scriptwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce and especially the director Michael Winterbottom did a really bad work and I will try to explain why.For me 24 Hour Party People is an enjoyable movie to listen to mainly thanks to the music. Someone has written on this site that you had to be British to appreciate the music. Not necessarily. I am myself French and I love most of the bands who signed for Factory Records. Obviously you have to like this time English independent music of the eighties this culture. That said these bands aren't very known in France where they remain at the stage of cultbands. Michael Winterbottom's flick was apparently successful in GreatBritain but in France it was belatedly launched on the 4th June 2003 and it went unnoticed. But the main problem is that 24 Hour Party People is visually an exhausting movie to watch. I must say that I don't appreciate very much the making adopted by Winterbottom. There's an amateurish side reinforced by a granular and quite dirty photography in his way of filming that I highly disapprove. It seems that his camera can't stand still even in the quietest moments. On another hand when the movie arrives at the end of the eighties the golden age for Manchester as if he wanted to recreate the crazy atmosphere of the town in 19891990 he didn't skimp on the flashy effects which ends up annoying the spectator. Then Winterbottom must have been influenced by Trainspotting 1996 because in his directing we can sometimes detect a video clip side.To go on the authors of the movie seem to have forgotten one important thing. Factory Records wasn't only limited to Joy Division and the Happy Mondays. There was also Durutti Column and New Order. All right the movie doesn't forget them but you can only see them for a few minutes. Given that the film nearly skips the mideighties and quite obviously Joy Division and the Happy Mondays's careers especially interested the authors. Due to this you can easily separate the movie in two parts. The first one mainly focuses on Joy Division while the second involves mostly the Happy Mondays. This characteristic is confirmed with the cover of the original soundtrack which depicts Tony Wilson of course but also Ian Curtis and Shaun Ryder. By way of consolation we can object that Winterbottom had intuition for the cast because the actors he hired to play the musicians are very true to life especially the ones in the roles of Ian Curtis and Bernard Sumner. Furthermore the actor who acts Martin Hannett is very convincing in the shameless personality of this extraordinary producer.Tony Wilson's voiceoff is necessary to guide us through the most important stages. So as to give the spectator interest in the film it can also be a good thing to make Wilson directly speak to the camera to make us share his feelings his thoughts on Manchester the music. So long as this idea doesn't overload the movie and I have unfortunately this impression. Winterbottom and Boyce should have restrained these too frequent apparitions.The screenplay retained the most outstanding moments in the history of Tony Wilson and Factory Records but it doesn't stop it from having neglecting important stages as well. For example I am sure that the fans of Joy Division would have liked to see the band recording their great disembodied album Closer 1980. Then in the first part of the work the punk and newwave spirit are well rendered in one sequence we see one character taking off from the wall a poster depicting Pink Floyd's album Dark Side Of The Moon no Pink Floyd in 1977! as well as the festive one in the second part through the Hacienda and ecstasy. But because the director wanted to dazzle the spectator at a visual level it is difficult to fully enjoy this exhausting film. So you are never touched by a movie that is meant to take a nostalgic look at a past time.This is my opinion about 24 Hour Party People excellent music but an average movie. If a director wishes to make a film about Alan McGee the former boss of Creation Records Oasis and Primal Scream's former record company I hope he won't do the same mistakes as Michael Winterbottom with this flick.";

Come to think of it Wilson's body language and hand gestures remind me far more of Tony Blair than anyone else . I digress 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is a highly self indulgent mockumentary film centered on the creation of Manchester based Factory Records . Highly self indulgent in the way it brings to the narrative things that only the real life characters know or give a toss about . Things like the real life Howard DeVoto  It's okay I've never heard of him either  addressing the camera and saying  I can't remember that bit  . That's nice to know Howard because Western Civilisation was resting on this part of the plot  If not the entire movie . I'm sure we can all rest easy in our beds knowing the truth and I look forward to the sequel PEOPLE TONY Wilson KNOWS AND THEIR HOME MOVIES Two things make the movie worth watching for me ...1  The eclectic cast featuring people as diverse as Andy Serkis  Christopher Ecclestone  Peter Kay and Jack Duckworth's son 2  The soundtrack . Most especially Joy Division  a band that was infamous for its bleak  nihilistic tones and the bizarre on stage antics of Ian Curtis and praise too for Sean Harris who captures Curtis's mannerism perfectly But unless you've enjoyed the music of at least one Manchester band be it Joy Division  New Order or The Happy Mondays you might not want to join this party".

I needn't have worried  the two are not at all comparable.The movie tells the true story of Tony Wilson Steve Coogan owner of Manchester's Factory Records signing up the new innovative bands that catches Wilson's talented eye as well as creating a club for groups to play in. Two of these bands  Joy Division and The Happy Mondays  are the main focus for the movie seeing as how these bands with their eclectic leads and band members  caused enough of a ruckus to have a decent story told about them.The film is shot in a borderline mockumentary style with Wilson making often very funny humorous asides to the camera. This style by director Michael Winterbottom  is itself a tribute to the lowkey cheap but energetic music of the time which spans from the mid 70s to early 90s. The movie is interspersed with clips from other media including concert footage of the bands. It gives an almost TVproduction feel to the movie but that doesn't detract from the story.Unfortunately if you are unfamiliar with the subject material and the bands you will be possibly lost as the film seems to assume a certain familiarity with everything. As the film covers a span of years it tends to dip in at certain moments  the idea isn't so much as to be a documentary as a homage to the era giving the viewer a flavour of the times which is grand if only you know what you are tasting. 24 Hour Party People' will best be enjoyed by people familiar with the movie's subject matter. Coogan is on fine form here his Wilson somewhat reminiscent of his earlier TV work which brought him to fame. The mixture of humour and tragedy plus some fine imitations of real bands makes for an entertaining movie that is one of the best of the British movies to come out in recent times. 7.510.".

It takes you to a different point of view. Right I normally  might don't care about a band like Joy Division but through the eyes of Tony Wilson I do. I was taken back to a different time space and lifestyle more or less to an other universe and I very much like it though I have no idea if the thing experienced with the movie has anything to do with what it really was like. Beside this the movie is a fine piece of filmmaking and there fore just a pleasure to watch. Good acting well done pseudo documentary style approach loads of dry humor. Sometimes it gets a bit sentimental but this you have to stand through which is not this hard because thankfully the film doesn't take it self to serious. This doesn't mean it would not be totally devoted to it's subject but it just takes it with a twinkle in it's eye. The most important point of course is the music. Even being no fan of it and having no clue about the bands the music alone is worth seeing this movie All in all it's of course not a masterpiece or a work of genius but it's highly enjoyable for anyone who will allow to be take with to a place where supposedly history was made.".

This doesn't mean it would not be totally devoted to it's subject but it just takes it with a twinkle in it's eye. The most important point of course is the music. Even being no fan of it and having no clue about the bands the music alone is worth seeing this movie All in all it's of course not a masterpiece or a work of genius but it's highly enjoyable for anyone who will allow to be take with to a place where supposedly history was made.";

It also plays like a Greek tragedy albeit substantially more fun but there is no shortage of darkness and tragedy in the film. The shifts in tone are particularly remarkable as the film veers from its usual dry sardonic tone into real pathos and examination of the dark side of almost any phenomenal success.I'm not completely nuts. I'm not going to claim that 24 Hour Party People is a visual masterpiece or a film which achieves more with its characters than most accepted 'masterpieces' of cinema when it comes to depth. I'm not going to argue that it feels as complete an artistic achievement as one of the better films by a cinematic 'master'. Wait what am I talking about? That's exactly what I'm going to argue. 24 Hour Party People is as perfect as a film can get not because it achieves the visual perfection of one of Kubrick's finer films not because it marks a turning point in cinema history but because it sets out to be exactly what it ends up being a hilarious darkly satirical and yet affectionate look at one of the biggest 'scenes' in music history some of the best bands and the man behind it all Tony Wilson. A minor player in his own life story. This is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever made. It all unfolds with a sort of inspired madness. The very first scene shows the charismatic arrogant and somewhat selfimportant Tony Wilson hanggliding for a television report then turning to the camera after that's over with and saying You're going to see a lot more of that sort of thing in the film. I don't want to say too much don't want to spoil it. I'll just say one word 'Icarus'. If you get it great. If you don't that's fine too. But you should probably read more. It's not only a terrific line indicative of the sort of dry wit much of the dialogue achieves but also telling of what the film is going to be like. J.R. Jones of the Chicago Reader was one of the less infatuated major critics with the film but still gave it a definitely positive review which should give you some indication of just how wellreceived this film was by critics and labeled Coogan's Wilson a a pedantic narrator describing his story as having little narrative momentum of its own. I like to think that's sort of the point and Wilson himself makes a point to mention in the film that it's not a film about him. The highlight of the film arguably even more than Frank Cottrell Boyce's screenplay is Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson. As everyone reading this probably knows Coogan based his famed Alan Partridge character on Tony Wilson's career as a television reporter so he's really playing a variation on Alan Partridge here. What's amazing about Coogan's performance is that he manages to draw even this Partridge fan into Tony Wilson's world so much that I didn't care about any similarity. It's still a stunning comic performance and excellent during the darker more serious scenes in the film as well. I'd go as far as saying that it's one of the best male performances of the decade. The rest of the cast is too large to go through one by one but everyone is excellent here some going for a sort of slightly altered impersonation of the reallife person they're playing some creating their own version. A point of criticism often aimed at 24 Hour Party People is inaccuracy. The film is gleefully inaccurate and I fail to see how that's a problem. We didn't need a pedantic touchonallbases film about Factory Records because Factory Records would never have made such a movie had they ventured into film production. This is exactly the sort of looseknit and yet tightlywritten film that is needed to capture the energy of the music and the movement. Boyce's screenplay goes through dozens of characters none of which don't feel real it's got enough pompous and arrogant philosophizing to turn off even the worst pseudointellectual but it makes it work simply because it's got a sort of selfmocking sense of humor. The points Wilson makes by referencing history and philosophy are valid but it would be at odds with the sort of film this is if they weren't written with the wry wit the rest of the film is and if they weren't delivered so wonderfully by Coogan. The film is shot on video and uses a handheld style which far from inhibiting the film as it arguably does with some other Winterbottom films just suits it perfectly. That doesn't mean there aren't some scenes which are explosively extravagant visually because there are and they are beautiful. 24 Hour Party People feels like a complete artistic achievement. It captures the energy of the music the feel of it the basis for the movement so well but also succeeds at providing a welltold summary of the story of Factory Records the Hacienda and Tony Wilson. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made and one of the most consistently successful. I don't think there's anything here that falls flat it's all quite brilliant from the first scene to the final shot. 1010".

The best soap opera set in Manchester... What I read were legends the truth hidden behind the ink. Having watched it brought to life I'm still not certain what really happened. As Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson quotes in the film 'if I have the choice between the truth and the legend print the legend'. Here the legend has been filmed.And largely they've played if for laughs. The reallife Tony Wilson is someone is often laughed at true but when he speaks there's a hard edge a confidence and edge maybe even a whiff of intellectual brutishness that Steve Coogan's portrayal doesn't have. The Tony Wilson in the film reminds me most of other Steve Coogan roles such as Alan Partridge. Unfortunate that the central role is lacking as all the many other roles revolving round this centre of levity are wonderful. Most especially good are Andy Serkis as Martin Hannett and Sean Harris as Ian Curtis.This film's brilliance is in showing the life of a large amorphous group of people brought together for the purpose of making music. There is an illdefined boundary round the edge of Factory Record through which people slip quietly. From within all is energy and life. Relationships fizzing off one another bringing tragedy and comedy art and manure in equal measure. Lives lived brightly with a heart that still beats today even though the body has been scattered to the major labels around the world. This thing really did exist here is the testament.Help I'm beginning to sound like Tony Wilson.There are other successes and failures. The Hacienda is resurrected to the smallest detail. The claim to show the real Manchester of the time rings hollow. This maybe their Manchester but it isn't the real one. The inflight narrative by Coogan as Wilson is simple yet doesn't work. The cameos by many of the 'real' people is great if you know who they are. If you don't 'get' Factory you'll probably not 'get' this film.As an attempt to bottle the Factory spirit this is a roaring success and for that it gets high marks.

Which means that some freshness is virtually guaranteed and Witnerbottom tells this story in an irreverent selfknowing fashion that is at least lively although it does sometimes give the film the feel of lowbudget sitcom. This feeling is also enhanced by the casting of comedian Steve Coogan an actor of little depth as Factory Records boss Tony Wilson. Like Coogan's famous alterego Alan Partridge Wilson was a TV presenter but it is hard to tell whether he was quite as similar to Partridge as this film suggests or if Coogan simply isn't up to the job of playing a different character. And the decision to tell the story of Wilson also seems strange he was not a kid whose life was transformed or a singer whose songs were sung the world over he even kept his day job and there's little underlying character development in his story. Rationally this isn't a very good film although it's actually quite watchable and all the more so if you have lived through this era and listened to the music as it was new. But there are lots of potentially interesting stories like the death of Ian Curtis or the wave of idealism that briefly flourished with the coming of Ecstasy which could have been covered with a bit more feeling. This movie is fun but perhaps also a wasted opportunity others who revisit this era will surely have more to say.".

Director Luis Mandoki knows how to pile on the tension to this chilling premise delivering genuine suspense and thrills every minute without losing momentum. The story even holds a few decent surprises that caught me slightly offguard if not necessarily shocked.As welltuned as the direction was what impressed me the most were the performances. The central story focuses on Theron and Bacon and both make for one of the more effective protagonistantagonist duos in recent memory. Dakota Fanning also shines as the kidnapped daughter this is one of the best performances from a child actor all year the other is from Fanning herself in the miniseries Taken. Stuart Townsend and Courtney Love aren't as effective as Theron and Bacon but come through with solid performances.Trapped is still a very flawed movie considering the script is hardly original and the subject matter itself is a little unsavory and disturbing. The titfortat matches between kidnapper and hostage can get a little repetitive but the fact that it revolves around three pairings does add more tension to the proceedings. Still the movie nicely builds to its thrilling conclusion a climactic sequence that is a bit overdone but nonetheless exciting. It's a pity Trapped was ignored at the box office since it's easily far superior to recent similarly plotted kidnapped thrillers such as Don't Say a Word or Along Came a Spider.".

This sort of starts off as a typical Hollywood blockbuster and it certainly ends like one but the story and the way it unfolds is very good.This was a strong script with beautiful cinematography again in Vancouver great acting. Theron proves here once more that she is a strong actress with much skill and much more potential. To boot this has a really great action sequence near the end. A good entertaining movie this is a definite watch.810".

Some good setups and payoffs as well though one involving the waggling of a plane's wings is kinda corny but it worked.  My only criticism is that some of the dialogue is predictable the bad guys says exactly what we expect him to say in certain scenes. Courtney Love plays a white trash wench pretty well but that's not surprising given her vagabond background.BOTTOMLINE  If you like thrillers go see this on a matinee  worth seeing on the big screen for some beautiful cinematography of the Pacific Northwest and the climax.  IMHO a big step above ALONG CAME A SPIDER and HIGH CRIMES. I haven't seen Mandoki's other flicks but I plan to rent them now.  I just hope Charlize Theron chooses some more challenging dramatic roles or her career will probably suffer for it.".

	schema:headline " Trapped is the perfect word for it";
	schema:reviewBody "I sometimes wonder if the actors who agree to appear in movies featuring Kevin Bacon do so because they have a secret desire to become a primary link in that everpopular parlor game known as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon a move destined to assure them of at least some chance at screenland immortality. The actors costarring with him in Trapped'  an aptly named film that is little more than a 99minute wallow in pointless unadulterated sadism  include Charlize Theron Courtney Love and Stuart Townsend not exactly noname nobodies but not quite Hollywood Alist players either.  But selling your soul for eternal fame often comes with a hefty price tag and I have the rather sneaking suspicion that these latterday Mephistopheles' would be just as happy if we forgot that they were ever associated with this perfectly dreadful wouldbe thriller  Kevin Bacon and all.  Even a chance at cinematic immortality can't be worth appearing in a movie this awful.Is there a more sensitive subject these days than child endangerment and kidnapping?  And can any filmmaker daring or foolish enough to take it on really do so without calling into question his own personal aims and motives?  Do we really want to see traumatized children torn away from their parents or threatened with strangulation all in the guise of popular entertainment'?   It has been done successfully in the past of course. One of the greatest thrillers of all time  the 1964 British film Sance on a Wet Afternoon'  used the subject of child abduction as the source for its drama but that film was a work of art a poignant psychologically compelling study of a woman on the verge of insanity.   It takes a fine sensibility and a steady hand to keep a touchy issue like child endangerment from turning into an exercise in cheap exploitation and I'm sorry to say neither of these qualities appears with much abundance in Trapped' the latest variation on the theme.  Indeed Trapped' is about as far from being a work of art as it is possible for a film to get.Bacon plays the leader of a trio of child kidnappers whose modus operandi is to target wealthy couples hold their children for ransom then release them when the parents have coughed up the demanded sums of money.  The threesome claims to have successfully' pulled off this little trick four times already  in each case ending with the parents being reunited with their children no questions asked.  The fifth and current abduction involves little Abby Jennings the young daughter of Will and Karen Jennings he a highpriced seemingly worldrenowned anesthesiologist and she a doting mother with a few selfdefense tricks up her sleeve or in her panties to be more exact.  And as if being forced to watch this poor little girl being threatened by a bunch of thirdrate bullies weren't bad enough we also have to witness her gasping for breath in any number of asthma attacks brought on by the stress of the experience.   Well what with Signs' earlier and now this film I guess asthma has become the childhood ailment of choice this movie season.All throughout the film we keep being told how brilliant these kidnappers are supposed to be  yet they seem to do everything in their power to afford their victims ample opportunity to turn the tables on them.  One Bacon's wife conveniently falls asleep so that the good doctor can casually remove all the bullets from her gun another Bacon's dullwitted oafish cousin akidnapperwithaheartofgold goes into the kitchen to warm up some soup so that the unrestrained little girl can walk out the front door cell phone in hand to look for help even Bacon the brains' of the outfit allows Mrs. Jennings to go unaccompanied into the bathroom where she proceeds to rummage through the medicine cabinet for what seems like ten minutes until she finds a scalpel which she then proceeds to hold to his private parts after he has made himself thoroughly vulnerable by completely disrobing in anticipation of getting a little nooky on the side.  One wonders how these worldclass bumblers ever managed to pull off even one successful kidnapping let alone four.  The film even includes that oldest of all kidnapscenario clichs  the obligatory nosey neighbor who drops by at the most inopportune moment and has to be fobbed off by the desperate victim without arousing suspicion.  And of course we must have Ms. Theron strip down to her undies and Mr. Bacon strip down to his birthday suit just to up the sleaze quotient a bit.The film is not only ugly on a moral level but on a visual level as well. The cinematography by Frederick Elmes and Piotr Sobocinski is drab mundane and colorless and director Luis Mandoki's style' consists mainly of having the camera jump up and down wildly whenever a character gets excited or the story threatens to undermine the audience's attention span.  The finale involves a massive multivehicle pile up on an Oregon freeway that is as ludicrous as it is unconvincing.Trapped' pretty much says it all  for the actors the filmmakers and above all the audience.".

	schema:headline " In the hands of Charlize Theron";
	schema:reviewBody "Nowadays everyone talks about Charlize Theron. Her new movie North Country claims she'll be nominated for the Oscar next year and who knows maybe win it again. The thing is I've known her as an actress for a long time and have watched most of her films but after what Monster was and after who she is now I feel like going back and analyzing if she's just having luck or if she's always been a good actress.With no intention of adulating her I can declare she's always played interesting roles. Take Mighty Joe Young Disney's film for example. She played the heroine an easy role and I was a kid but she didn't look like the everyday heroine she had managed to achieve a different approach. Next came joining Johnny Depp in the difficult acting journey that was The Astronaut's wife a movie that sucked in content but delivered in performances.Besides being dimmed by stronger people that same year in The Cider House Rules 2000 was her strong year where she left me breathless with her portrayals in Men of honor and The legend of Bagger Bance and showed me her dark and betraying side in The Yards and Reindeer Games with the great Gary Sinise. So in my quest of rediscovery I found Trapped one of her last movies before her Oscarfilm.The movie is very good and so is her performance. The traumatized look she obtains in some occasions is horrifying. How her whole body moves quietly and alert because her character knows the danger she's in but tries hard to be strong and intelligently fight what awaits her. Never has a woman looked so beautiful in underwear but at the same time so disgusting because there's no pleasure in her position.There's no pleasure at all in this movie. Karen's Theron daughter is kidnapped data she's played by Dakota Fanning two years before she was kidnapped again in Man on Fire if she keeps getting kidnapped in movies she might disappear some day and no secrets are held. We meet the man who planned the kidnapping Joe Kevin Bacon his partners Marvin Pruitt Taylor Vince in disturbing mode and Cheryl secondbilled and unfitted Courtney Love and their plans including where they keep the kids and how and when they take them back to their families.The group has done the same kidnapping strategy four times succeeding without being caught Joe always makes boast of it. What the movie announces is that this time will not be perfect because Karen is not like the other moms her husband Will Stuart Townsend looking as always is not like the other dads and more importantly their daughter Abby is not like the other kids. After the group realizes about this miscalculation writer Greg Iles' character development starts functioning.I don't know if Iles ever lived it but the environment seems so real. How do you pick the families? Karen asks Joe. Well they have to be rich the children need to have a permitted age and the mother has to be beautiful. Eventually Karen tries to find out why they do it and as I said there's no pleasure because they don't have fun doing it.During these scenes a tense relationship between Karen and Joe emerges and in terms of performance they are nothing but moments to make clear the risky actor Kevin Bacon is and the dedication he gives to his characters. The way he talks to her the way he resolves the problems with a look later you need to pay close attention the way he moves his hand when he drives because he hasn't slept and can't control his pulse The story hidden behind the why is very strong but when the movie decides we should learn it there's no intention of an emotional impact which is another remarkable screenplay detail. It is discovered so unexpectedly that there's no time to mediate about it it wouldn't feel real. Mexican director Luis Mandoki accompanies the environment with a first scene shot in blurry blue and then creating lots of empty shots of places that are instantly occupied by the charactersVery original.What is probably not original or mistaken is the resolution. I'm not saying it couldn't end like that I'm just saying that because of the movie's progress I was expecting something else. Anyway the typical wins but that doesn't diminish the quality of a film.".

The  casting for the Father character was badly done as the actor was not believable in ANY form.

	schema:reviewBody "As far as I know Trapped changed its title from the title of the book it was based on 24 Hours for one reason alone. Columbia didn't want people to get it confused with such classy things like the movie The Hours and the TV show 24. So they gave it the general overused title of Trapped which says absolutely nothing about the plot or the situation they're in. Instead you feel trapped because you desperately do not want to finish watching the movie but you're hoping for something good and hopefully a sex scene that would make this movie an R it has sexual content' in its MPAA rating. What we get is a horribly clichd basic plot with horribly clichd basic characters doing horribly clichd basic things.All throughout the movie there was a certain feel to it almost like a directtovideo fare like Gale Force. It had a very cheesy feel to it almost as if they didn't care about how it looked. Then however I saw in the beginning how much director Luis Mandoki whose other efforts include Angel Eyes and Message in a Bottle relied on doing what could be considered trendy' filmmaking. The opening scene which was utterly pointless was filmed in some odd bluish tint that made everything hard to see. A gimmick that would have worked would have been to put it into real time. That would have been something rarely used in movies. The camera also seemed rather amateurish at times to show that it was one take maybe to show how great these actors were the camera whipped from one actor to the next. And people thought The Blair Witch Project was nauseating.Of course where would stupid junk like this be without its stupid coincidences? The father Stuart Townsend drives an airplane to a convention he can drive to no less once and then right when he needs one to escape he finds one and flies it perfectly! If he's supposed to be a young father how could he have gone through all of medical school settled down and gotten married AND gotten his pilot's license? It also forgot important plot points such as one of the kidnappers needed to call another every half hour although he didn't for what would be a few hours.The actingwell I'll go one at a time. Charlize Theron seemed to think she was something special for her role while anyone who could a cry for an entire movie and b be able to fit a scalpel into her derriere. Kevin Bacon must have needed a paycheck more than he needed one at the time of Planes Trains and Automobiles for he isn't really trying here. Courtney Love is really the only one that works amazingly enough even Dakota Fanning was off cue and just saying lines with her typical I'm young cute and I cry in every movie!' shtick.The only and ONLY redeeming value of Trapped is that occasionally it had some tense moments but they were few and far between due to the lack of characterization. It's sad when we not only know more about the bad guys than the good guys but we're rooting for Bacon and Love. I was almost ready to jump up and yell to the TV which looked like it had a lot cut off for a fullscreen version of it to just have Bacon murder Theron and then the movie be done with. However I had to endure it and it didn't get any better.My rating 310Rated R for violence language and sexual content.".

This has been well stated at length by other reviews. I'm going to the larger position of saying this subgenre should be abandoned.As far as my world and I'd say 98 of the rest of the world the uberbeautiful uberrich ultrahappy family in peril just doesnt garner my sympathy and therefor fails. How can the protagonist be someone or group of someones that people just can't relate to? As much as I dislike the idea of kidnapping I just cant be lured into feeling bad for these people who are faced with almost no adversity any other time in their lives. Well there was that time when they had to wait almost 10 minutes for their double latte's at that bistro on Wilshire blvd.OK the kid had asthma but hey... so do normal peoples kids.I submit that you can really only get behind this if you were say... a rich actor or an elite greenlighter. I think thats how this subgenre keeps creeping back. It sounds great to the 2'rs that make and act in them.You know I'd go one step further and say that most authors that enter into writing these stories begin from the position of how to get over on the rich man I'll let you guess why it ends up looking the opposite.Yeah I know this sounds jaded and cynical but for those that have seen the movie just think about how you felt throughout most of the movie you were digging Kevin Bacon weren't you?The only one in the movie that I felt sympathy for was the little girl and if you look at this movie as a whole it becomes obvious that most of the pain she went thru was because of her parents. They were determined to catch or atleast thwart these horrible people at any cost. Well screw that I'm a parent and I'd get it over with as painlessly and quickly for the child as possible. They wanted 250000 for god sakes the father spends that much on a painting as stated in the movie thats the equivelent of a television set in our world. Would you crash a plane and the truck your daughter is traveling in OR would you hand over your television? I mean COME ON!!OK I'm starting to rant about plot points so I'll end this.If your looking to this because you want to rentbuy a good thriller try some Da Palma Dressed To Kill Blow Out or The Wickerman or even Memento anything that doesnt run along these flawed plotlines.".

My big complaint is the dad decides to land his plane on the road not seeming to care how many people he might kill from causing car wrecks. Well there are a bunch of wrecks but apparently no one gets killed. But that was just too out of character since he is supposed to be a doctor and all. The ending also fails any a way because it reverts to the old the bad guy must be killed multiple times to actually die".

All pretence to subtlety is discarded at the film's halfway point around the time Theron gains the upper hand on Bacon by holding an open razor to his genitals and the movie climaxes with a final showdown between kidnappers and family on a crowded highway leading to a series of stunts and explosions which operate on a purely visceral level regardless of logic or reason. Luis Mandoki directs the material with commendable sobriety and production values are excellent. Expect to find this one in quite a few 'Worst Movie' lists which makes it a mustsee for trash fans.".

Mimi Rodgers is wooden even during emotionally intense scenes Shawnee Smith is distraught before the home invaders show up and Lindsay Crouse is both wooden and overthetop at the same time.Kelly Lynch is the only actor who turns in even an appropriate performance evoking a sense of hopelessness and panic from the start that makes you feel for her character even if she has dug her own grave. This doesn't help a bewildering early scene in which her blouse spontaneously pops open to reveal her bare breasts make any more sense however.There are a lot of interesting plot and characterization ideas floating around the proceedings but none of them are ever fully developed.

And she is supposed to be one of the smarter characters but then again you took what Lindsay Crouse's character said about her too seriously. The film has a most curious tone and just when you think it's going to turn into an art film we get a shootemup or some other plot contrivance to bring it back to earth. The soundtrack is a moody pastiche of 50's style orchestrations no rock music! and recalls moody postnoir thrillers of the late 50'searly 60's.And what a fascinating lineup of players performances and characters. Kelly Lynch's acting directions must have been look snappy especially topless act like you just ingested a gram of cocaine and all will go well. One of these first years Cimino will put together all the pieces and come up with a really good coherent film. For a really good obtuse film reference Walter Hill's The Driver with Ryan O'Neal. Oh and if you ever thought you could mess with Lindsay Crouse this film should dispel that notion. She's much badder than Mickey Rourke  and that's the biggest surprise of the whole picture! And with a lot less screen time too. And by golly I guess Mickey Rourke's character is just an obsessive lover of the enigmatic Lynch. That explains a lot.

	schema:reviewBody "Horrible remake of a Humphrey Bogart film. Mickey Rourke plays a criminal who escapes from jail with help from his lawyer Kelly Lynch. He decides to hide out in the house of a heavily dysfunctional family played by Mimi Rogers Anthony Hopkins and Shawnee Smith. Lindsay Crouse pops up as a police chief trying to capture him.I caught this in a theatre back in 1990 and try as I might I can't forget how TERRIBLE this film was! Director Michael Cimino frankly can't direct. The Deer Hunter was a fluke. After that he did Heaven's Gate Year of the Dragon The Sicilian and thisall box office bombs. The direction in this is beyond belief. Badly lit terribly staged and weird camera angles. He singlehandedly destroys any visual quality the film might have had. The plot is badfull of loopholes and bad dialogue. The acting couldn't be worse. You have talented actors like Lynch Rogers and especially Hopkins giving their all time worst performances. Rourke and Crouse never could act so their bad acting is expected. Worst of all was Smith. She is so incredibly annoying you'll be rooting for Rourke to shoot her dead! This was quickly forgotten and thankfully has stayed that way. Avoid.".

The original slowly built up it's story and every bit of the action was well timed and gave you that sense of urgency and fear for the family in question. In this oneit's was quite obvious that they were going for more focus on action and a slick lookthan they were for acting. Even a great actor like Anthony Hopkinshas his performance diluted by all of this mayhem. His role is okay but really doesn't get interesting until the last 30 minutes or so. The rest of the family pales in comparison to the 1950's version. In that onethey all took a shot at outwitting the bad guys. Norathe momwifewhen first confronted by the gang of three is told by one of themI found someone's bikini by the pool. She stupidly tells themThat's my daughter's.

Rourke's acting does not evoke a sense of fear and urgency like Bogart's did. I realize two different actorstwo different styles but Rourke's doesn't even have a style. All he does is act a little smugor very angry and even his anger made me laugh. The female lawyer he supposedly loves is a pretty thin character but even thinner and worse than that is the female FBI agent. Her performance is without a doubt the worst acting from a female I've ever seen. She spouts her lines like a female auditioning to be The Terminator or maybe making it obvious she's a member of the Jack Webb fan club! ...but her lines are so hollow and virtually emotionless she'd make Webb sound like Sir Laurence Olivier. The only thing that kept me watching this film was to see the differences between the two films and to get to the anticipated climax. I knew how it would end but I had to see it through.3 stars and I'm being kind here for a few good scenes of action and the ending. The end of 2 desperate hours. END".

He subsequently made the overwrought YEAR OF THE DRAGON THE SICILIAN and a remake of DESPERATE HOURS in the 1980s. All of those films bombed at the B.O. and his credibility never really recovered. Of all three films he directed in the 80s DESPERATE HOURS is by far the worst. The movie is bad bad bad. The movie actually reflects its title. It's truly desperate.Like the director the film wants to be taken seriously and yet it's woefully misguided with overwrought acting leaden direction that rarely makes any sense and a script that's totally outdated and is divorced from logic. As I've said the movie wants to be taken seriously but every attempt of seriousness is quickly shot down with remarkably ludicrous details. For instance when David Morse is alone in the wilderness and he's running away from the police the whole moment is oddly directed with reverence but then as Morse is heading towards a gas station he meets two buxom bimbos who are dressed in such ridiculous clothes they look like they just stepped out of a Playboy spread that the director's attempt at reverence is destroyed by the unexpected sight of those two women who just didn't belong in the movie. I'm sure someone got laid from hiring those two women. Arf!And then there's the whole way Kelly Lynch is treated in the movie. What an embarrassing role. She didn't deserve to be treated like that. I love Leonard Maltin's description of what is done to her character kamikaze disrobing. But topping everything even the dreadful music or scenery chewing from Mickey Rourke or Anthony Hopkins is Lindsay Crouse's performance which can only be described as being out of this world. The way she talks enunciates her dialogue the way her character is directed well the whole thing is totally perplexing. I've tried to come up with a way to describe her actingrole but I can't. Remember Dolores Fuller's acting in GLEN OR GLENDA? Well Lindsay Crouse must have taken some lessons from Dolores because her acting is identical. Personally speaking Lindsay Crouse's acting in DH ranks up there as one of the weirdest performances ever put on screen.I haven't seen the original version of DESPERATE HOURS but I can't imagine it's remotely close to being as dreadful as Michael Cimino's version.".

Seeing 'Sin City' brought me back great role great acting great film! so I picked up 'Desperate Hours' and watched it last night. While the supporting characters could have been better written Kelly Lynch  Mimi Rogers' characters fell flat the scenes between Rourke  Anthony Hopkins were wonderful! Elias Koteas as Rourke's brother was forgettable but David Morse's character of Albert was very interesting. Somewhat like a big dumb 'Lenny' to Rourke's 'George'. Like another reviewer I was reminded of Humphrey Bogart's 'Duke Mantee' in the 1936 film 'Petrified Forest' but Rourke's 'Michael Bosworth' was a little more homicidal and more of a loose cannon.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Cimino was heralded for The Deer Hunter which was an inspired powerful film the complete opposite of the disastrous Heaven's Gate. Now Cimino breaks new ground with The Desperate Hours. The whole movie is a mess. I'll list just a few examplesThe head of the FBI unit was of course a woman. She had the most ridiculous 80's blonde curly big hair imaginable. It was always blowing in her face. She spoke with the most phony southern accent I ever heard. She always was yelling and giving orders. We get it she's in charge.The scene where one of the criminals covered in blood came across two college girls who were standing by their truck at a gas station. These girls had bodies so hot that they were xrated. One of them had the most outlandish denim shorts on. No woman could ever have worn them in public. 99 of her buttocks poured out of them.In another scene the girlfriend of one of the criminals was being fitted with a hidden microphone.

She was talking to the woman FBI leader like this was an everyday occurrence as the FBI man carefully taped the mike on her skin. I'm not making this up.

The cops tell him to drop his gun from 100 yards away. He holds the pistol in the air and they shoot him at least 100 times with automatic weapons.Mickey Rourke runs out of bullets so Anthony Hopkins who is 20 years older than Rourke out of shape and covered in blood from a chest wound holds a pistol in one hand and drags and tosses Rourke around like a rag doll. Not once did Rourke think of grabbing the gun from Hopkins' hand. As Hopkins throws Rourke down the stairs with one hand the entire banister rail which runs the length of the stairs breaks off. Now this is a grand staircase in an upper class mansion. So much for craftsmanship.That's just the tip of the iceberg. This movie is just as bad as anything Ed Wood put out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michael Cimino was heralded for The Deer Hunter which was an inspired powerful film the complete opposite of the disastrous Heaven's Gate. Now Cimino breaks new ground with The Desperate Hours. The whole movie is a mess. I'll list just a few examplesThe head of the FBI unit was of course a woman. She had the most ridiculous 80's blonde curly big hair imaginable. It was always blowing in her face. She spoke with the most phony southern accent I ever heard. She always was yelling and giving orders. We get it she's in charge.The scene where one of the criminals covered in blood came across two college girls who were standing by their truck at a gas station. These girls had bodies so hot that they were xrated. One of them had the most outlandish denim shorts on. No woman could ever have worn them in public. 99 of her buttocks poured out of them.In another scene the girlfriend of one of the criminals was being fitted with a hidden microphone. So there she is in a room full of people completely topless as a man tapes a microphone between her breasts.

	schema:reviewBody "Desperate Hours is a 1990 remake of William Wyler's psycho drama of the same name from 1955 featuring Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March as original cast. Michael Cimino directed this story of a bloodthirsty gang raiding an upper class suburb house on their run from the police after a series of ambitious big projects like Heaven's Gate Year of the Dragon and The Sicilian in the eighties.In this remake it is Mickey Rourke's turn to play Bogart's leading role and he turned Bogart's coolness into a portrait of a psychopathic gentleman gangster whose violent dominance is about to erupt like a volcano every second. His counterpart is lawyer Anthony Hopkins an upperclass citizen and head of a broken family. Both men are fighting against each other in every possible way starting with psycho duels and witty conversations to hard fights and pure wars of nerves.Most of the plot takes place in Hopkins' house and as soon as the story is settled out of this apparent suburb paradise hell breaks out starting from Rourke's violent escape from a courthouse prison in the beginning of the film to the final showdown when the police arrives.Cimino's direction works well with his whole ensemble often placed in the living room like actors on a static theater stage and the camera views the psychological warfare often from a very distant ankle like in a documentary. The great cast of all actors featuring Mimi Rodgers Kelly Lynch Elias Koteas and David Morse and the minimal and seducing sound track score by David Mansfield add much tension to this welldome remake of a great fifties crime drama.".

There are few auteurist directors who have this ability to impose themselves on an audience with the 'look' of their film stock within the first few minutes. Kubrick Bergman and Tarkovsky come to mind of course. Sadly we are yet again left trapped between a conscientious artist trying to feed us caviar while the studio chew up some cardboard and spit it out'According to some official sources Michael Cimino's original cut of Desperate Hours was mutilated by the film's producers resulting in a very badly edited film filled with plot holes. The only known proof of any deleted scenes are some stills which seemingly show a few of them.'It's sad to think Cimino didn't have the chance to recut this film like with Heaven's Gate. Still the acting is fantastic Mickey Rourke was at the height of his powers here. There is humour thrown between the tension some of the more subtle exchanges and glances between the characters are masterful. Like in the 1955 version there is subtext referring to class and references to the changing nature of American society. Cimino also references the influence of advertising although the theme is never developed thanks again to youknowwho! As Rourke's Bosworth spews out'That's why America is becoming a second rate country!'The editing by Chris RousePeter Hunt is a mess. Choppy and careless. The ending sees the most obvious intervention by the bean counters. I could almost hear the argument between director and producers during the closing scenes'Give me more time. This doesn't make sense. There must be at least some character resolution!''No Michael You've spent our budget. Don't mess with us we're not United Artists. We'll tell the press!'For years I had avoided watching Desperate Hours based on the reviews but if you are a fan of Cimino it is easy to see past the choppy edits and plot holes. The cinematography is often a joy as is the direction of the fantastic cast costumeset designs and cars. At times I felt like shouting out 'Michael you spoil us!' because you don't see many filmmakers today who are allowed to treat their audience as adults. Thank you Michael. RIP".

There is humour thrown between the tension some of the more subtle exchanges and glances between the characters are masterful. Like in the 1955 version there is subtext referring to class and references to the changing nature of American society. Cimino also references the influence of advertising although the theme is never developed thanks again to youknowwho! As Rourke's Bosworth spews out'That's why America is becoming a second rate country!'The editing by Chris RousePeter Hunt is a mess. Choppy and careless. The ending sees the most obvious intervention by the bean counters. I could almost hear the argument between director and producers during the closing scenes'Give me more time. This doesn't make sense. There must be at least some character resolution!''No Michael You've spent our budget. Don't mess with us we're not United Artists. We'll tell the press!'For years I had avoided watching Desperate Hours based on the reviews but if you are a fan of Cimino it is easy to see past the choppy edits and plot holes. The cinematography is often a joy as is the direction of the fantastic cast costumeset designs and cars. At times I felt like shouting out 'Michael you spoil us!' because you don't see many filmmakers today who are allowed to treat their audience as adults. Thank you Michael. RIP";

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Cimino's remake of William Wyler's The Desperate Hours 1955 is given the 1990 treatment by increasing the amounts of violence nudity and strong language and adding colour and a number of beautifullyshot outdoor sequences. The gang leader's character has been significantly changed and as a reflection of the period in which this movie was made the husband and wife whose home is invaded have become estranged because of the husband's infidelity. The action starts off impressively and its lively pace is maintained throughout the entire film.Michael Bosworth Mickey Rourke is a convict who escapes from a courthouse with the help of his defence lawyer and lover Nancy Breyers Kelly Lynch who'd smuggled a gun into the building for him. After killing one of the guards whilst making his getaway Bosworth is picked up by his brother Wally Elias Koteas and his friend Albert David Morse and together they drive off to a prearranged location to switch to a different car which had been left there by Nancy.Nancy's participation in the escape is made to look enforced and Bosworth and his gang decide to hide out in a rich suburban neighbourhood until she can join them. The house they pick is occupied by Nora Cornell Mimi Rogers and her two children 15yearold May Shawnee Smith and 8yearold Zack Danny Gerard. Bosworth conducts himself with a combination of politeness and threatening behaviour and when Nora's cheating husband Tim Anthony Hopkins calls by to attempt a reconciliation with his wife he also becomes a hostage.FBI agent Brenda Chandler Lindsay Crouse who's in charge of the manhunt doesn't buy Nancy's story for a minute and has her watched around the clock in the certain belief that she'll eventually lead them to Bosworth. At the Cornell's house Albert becomes overwhelmed with anxiety and decides to leave but is soon found and killed by the FBI. When Nancy finally decides to cooperate with the FBI so that she can be given a reduced sentence the authorities are quickly able to close in on Bosworth and bring their mission to its violent conclusion.The most disappointing feature of this movie for anyone who's seen the 1955 version is that the tension claustrophobia and intensity of threat that the family are under in the original are all so heavily diluted in this version. Bosworth's character is also a problem because as a man with an exceptionally high I.Q. he never does or says anything that's even remotely intelligent let alone brilliant.Mickey Rourke provides the movie's best performance as he conveys his character's unusual combination of charm and volatility so well and although it is generally entertaining Desperate Hours never achieves the intensity or impact of the 1955 original.".

I don't remember every detail of every relationship and back story so I'm not a huge Xmen expert. I LOVED the original XMen movie and X2.I was so excited when I heard they were making a Wolverine movie. He and Gambit were my two favorite characters from the comics and Wolverine was by far the best written and one of the best acted characters in the XMen franchise. I thought This should be good! I counted down the days until it came out. And I went to the theatre and came out not disappointed but not excited either. It was a middleoftheroad movie which seemed to not know what it wanted to be. But I would say go see it if you're an XMen or Hugh Jackman fan.The main crime committed in Wolverine is in the writing. I always say writers don't get enough credit on a good movie. But no amount of good acting pretty much everyone in Wolverine does well with what they're given and okay directing can cover up crappy writing like this. The script was all over the place. It didn't have any of the jaunty yet edgy feel of the first two XMen movies. Wolverine's wisecracks and smart wit were all but forgotten. That would've maybe been okay if they had chosen to make Wolverine the dark nearly evil character that he was supposed to have been before he lost his memory. But they didn't. He was neither good nor evil. This was ambivalent Wolverine. Kind of Emo Wolverine. Not above doing bad but not really into it because it made him Feel Bad. No really interesting lines or plot points either way. The writers didn't seem to even know how to develop the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. And was the love story put in by the studio just to satisfy us chicks who wouldn't go a see a comicbook movie without it? If so the studio did us a great disservice because if you wanted to make a story about Wolverine the lover which hey I would go see this movie wasn't that either. And when I saw in the trailer that Gambit was in the movie too I was thrilled! Gambit in a movie at last! But here he is the underdeveloped and kind of confusing Gambit. Couldn't he at least have had his New Orleans accent? The cards were cool but he was mostly underutilized and didn't feel like Gambit that much.The movie does have some good moments in it where you actually say Yes! I'm not putting spoilers so I won't tell you what they are but for me they made the movie worth seeing. While I wouldn't put it anywhere on my worstmovie list I wouldn't rank it with XMen and X2 on my favorites list either.".

Couldn't he at least have had his New Orleans accent? The cards were cool but he was mostly underutilized and didn't feel like Gambit that much.The movie does have some good moments in it where you actually say Yes! I'm not putting spoilers so I won't tell you what they are but for me they made the movie worth seeing. While I wouldn't put it anywhere on my worstmovie list I wouldn't rank it with XMen and X2 on my favorites list either.";

	schema:reviewBody "XMen Origins Wolverine joins a whole host of films that's become a genre all its own in the last few years. An established film series taking a character back to its roots to reboot the series. Casino Royale Batman Begins and the upcoming Star Trek are to name but a few examples. If you were going to choose an XMan to frame an origin story around there is no one better than Wolverine. He's always been the most interesting character in XMen. Perhaps because while all the others in the team use their mutant powers for the betterment of mankind Logan's bad attitude makes him something of a wild card. One never to be entirely trusted.I thought the idea of Wolverine getting his own movie was immensely exciting. Especially when Hugh Jackman agreed to reprise the role. And I'm pleased to say it was worth the wait. Quite a few have been quick to poke holes in the film's script but I didn't feel disappointed with it at all. I felt it did Wolverine justice. Its a worthy addition to the series.To side with a few nitpickers 20th Century Fox and director Gavin Hood have taken a few liberties. Not just with the backstory but also by breaking continuity with the other films in the series. For one Logan's metal skeleton has always been the result of an experiment done to him against his will. But in Wolverine here he willingly goes through with it to get revenge on Sabretooth for killing his lover.Also we get to meet a young Cyclops who runs into Logan. But no mention is made of that in the first film. They act like they've never met. Still in spite of rewriting some of what we already know Wolverine does a quite excellent job of bringing a lot of Logan's past into focus. All through a combination of Gavin Hood's involving kinetic direction David Benioff and Skip Woods' screenplay and another excellent performance from the great Hugh Jackman.The opening credit sequence stayed with me more than anything else in the film. We watch as Logan and Sabretooth halfbrothers in this version grow up and go to war. The Civil War. Both World Wars. Vietnam. And then finally they go to war on each other. They're both recruited by William Stryker who you may remember from X2 to work in a special covert operations team. But while Logan and Sabretooth may seem similar they are quite different.They may be part animal but Sabretooth likes it a lot more than Logan does. Nor does Logan share Sabretooth's love of killing. So when he strikes out on his own how much are you willing to bet that it isn't long before Logan's past comes back to haunt him?It didn't take me long at all to become enthralled in Wolverine's life history. Some people have criticised the idea of Logan and Sabretooth becoming brothers but I felt it added an additional level of gravitas. It made Sabretooth's betrayal that much more potent. And I quite liked the way David Benioff and Skip Woods attempt to humanise Wolverine.Some of the best scenes in the film have nothing to do with large scale action sequences or revved up pyrotechnics. Some of the most touching and most moving moments is watching Wolverine trying to fit into a normal life. Away from wars and mortal enemies. And ultimately failing. His relationship with Kayla nicely played by Lynn Collins a seemingly ordinary human woman is quite affecting. Watching her take on the near impossible task of taming Logan's primal side is involving. Both Jackman and Collins shine in these scenes. Or the scene when Logan befriends an elderly couple. Who pay a terrible price for taking him in.But Hood doesn't disappoint on the action front either. Wolverine has some breathtaking action scenes. Logan being chased by helicopter while on a bike is a real adrenaline pumper. And as it moves towards its climax in a thrilling fight on top of a cooling tower the film becomes something that makes you want to cry out for joy. This film really needs to be seen on a cinema screen. The photography of the Canadian Rockies provides a dazzling backdrop for the final fight. One suspects the film will lose a lot in the transfer when it goes to DVD.The acting is all superb. Hugh Jackman is expectedly excellent. He dives into Logan's animal nature with pure undiluted relish. But more importantly he always knows the need to dial it down too giving us that even more crucial chance to see inside the soul of Wolverine. I was a little wary to begin with when I learned Liev Schrieber would play Sabretooth. I just couldn't envision him in the role but he's a revelation. He brings a real meanness to the part. Something Tyler Mane never had in XMen. You can see in his performance why it is that Logan hates him so much. The two have marvellous sparkage whenever they're paired together.There are times when the film lapses perhaps too much into the realm of the comic book I'm thinking of The Blob as I write this but for the most part Gavin Hood treats the material with the utmost respect. It ends on a shocking downer that also manages to tie in neatly with the first XMen film. The script has many surprises that leaves you as jolted and embittered as poor Logan. A highly enjoyable film that exceeds all expectations and the best XMen adventure since X2.".

As a huge comicfanreader I feel he never fails at portraying one of my favorite characters. Leiv Schreiber as Sabretooth was much better then I'd ever expected.

But his excellent portrayal of the character definitely countered the looks for me. I wouldn't change anything about Leiv's performance.As for DeadpoolWade I understand some peoples dislike for how he was different from the comics. But even with these changes Deadpool was still an amazing character welldone by Ryan Reynolds. The secret ending with himShhh! makes me very excited because if Reynolds plays Deadpool in a spinoff of the movie I'll be very eager to watch.Finally Gambit. Gambit has always been my favorite xmen so I had extremely high expectations of the character. This being said I found Kitsch did very well with Gambit the only problems I had with the character were his accent and his lack of screen time. Though his accent wasn't horrible it definitely wasn't cajun.I'll admit the storyline jumps around and there are some minor plot holes. But a major thing to have in mind when watching this movie is to just think of it as a MOVIE. Some changes were made from the comics and some characters may not be what you expected. But if you go into this movie strictly looking at it as entertainment and a good summer movie you will not be disappointed.Even myself as a major xmen fan I was not disappointed. Overall this movie lived up to my expectations and in my opinion it doesn't deserve the negative comments being made about it.I definitely recommend it to everyone.".

None. Not even the continuity. It doesn't respect Weapon X project or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies Revenge for the death of a loved one.Oh. What I was expecting the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 in the school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces but hey this is Fox this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero.Besides I had a feeling of constant dej v with this movie because Wolverine's Origins are already explained in X2 we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid backstory because mystery is the nature of the character.

	schema:headline " Wolverine 's journey is more about the visuals than the character";
	schema:reviewBody "The superhero genre reached a higher echelon in 2008 with Iron Man and The Dark Knight and considering the success of 23 of the XMen franchise so far XMen Origins Wolverine can certainly be held to those standards especially a movie whose title alone suggests getting right down to its hero's adamantium core.But Wolverine plays more like a spinoff defining origins as the back story and not the psychological workings of the character. It's weak on themes but loaded on more new mutants with new powers explosions and plenty of subplots. Basically it fails where XMen 3 did trying to do too much at once rushing the plot along and sacrificing the deeper reason audiences are drawn to Hugh Jackman's character other than he's cool and has a crude sarcastic sense of humor. However it succeeds much of the same way X3 did and beyond more explosive action and creative use of an immense visual effects budget. Although director Gavin Hood doesn't bring more insight into the film with his work he certainly has as good of an eye for the stylish as anyone.The first sign that you know this movie isn't going to be top tier for superhero flicks is the number of mutantsvillains. For a story about one singular Xman there are way too many other characters to follow Col. Stryker is their ringleader but Sabretooth Schriber Wade WilsonDeadpool Reynolds Bolt Monaghan Gambit Kitsch Wraith will.i.am Agent Zero the Blob and young Cyclops not to mention a slough of extras make the film dizzying. Especially at the beginning we need to see more Wolverine  it's his movie.To the film's credit its quick movement makes it easy to watch and entertaining and there's some surprisingly good comedic timing on Jackman's part for an action movie. Seriously though it must have been a blast no pun intended on the set during action sequences because they actually destroyed everything they possibly could CGI real and both. This film is the beginning of what will surely be mindblowing visual effects at the movies this summer. Hood gives new visual strength to the franchise and provides a much more epic feel to this film  it's clearly about this grand journey for Wolverine even if it's more spectacle than introspective.Surprisingly the ending was the most satisfying part of the film. All the subplots converge it makes sense and the loose ends that fans of the first three films will notice get tied up fittingly at the end. For the whole first hour of the film you're juggling Wolverine and Sabretooth's rivalry Stryker's team of guys with powers Wolverine's romance with Kayla out in the wilderness what's happening to the team of guys with powers ... why the heck kid Cyclops is in the movie ... it's not overwhelming it's just not as enjoyable when you can't focus on one thing or character as much as you'd like. Still the ending justifies the strange means at least in terms of the epic battle that ensues.Wolverine is not a travesty for the genre but it certainly doesn't meet the expectations for a thorough superhero movie experience. You get amped up action and style over meaning and that makes it entertainment more than catharsis. Expect to be entertained and little else and Wolverine will satisfy your itch for the summer movie season. Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com".

Basically it fails where XMen 3 did trying to do too much at once rushing the plot along and sacrificing the deeper reason audiences are drawn to Hugh Jackman's character other than he's cool and has a crude sarcastic sense of humor. However it succeeds much of the same way X3 did and beyond more explosive action and creative use of an immense visual effects budget. Although director Gavin Hood doesn't bring more insight into the film with his work he certainly has as good of an eye for the stylish as anyone.The first sign that you know this movie isn't going to be top tier for superhero flicks is the number of mutantsvillains. For a story about one singular Xman there are way too many other characters to follow Col. Stryker is their ringleader but Sabretooth Schriber Wade WilsonDeadpool Reynolds Bolt Monaghan Gambit Kitsch Wraith will.i.am Agent Zero the Blob and young Cyclops not to mention a slough of extras make the film dizzying. Especially at the beginning we need to see more Wolverine  it's his movie.To the film's credit its quick movement makes it easy to watch and entertaining and there's some surprisingly good comedic timing on Jackman's part for an action movie. Seriously though it must have been a blast no pun intended on the set during action sequences because they actually destroyed everything they possibly could CGI real and both. This film is the beginning of what will surely be mindblowing visual effects at the movies this summer. Hood gives new visual strength to the franchise and provides a much more epic feel to this film  it's clearly about this grand journey for Wolverine even if it's more spectacle than introspective.Surprisingly the ending was the most satisfying part of the film. All the subplots converge it makes sense and the loose ends that fans of the first three films will notice get tied up fittingly at the end. For the whole first hour of the film you're juggling Wolverine and Sabretooth's rivalry Stryker's team of guys with powers Wolverine's romance with Kayla out in the wilderness what's happening to the team of guys with powers ... why the heck kid Cyclops is in the movie ... it's not overwhelming it's just not as enjoyable when you can't focus on one thing or character as much as you'd like. Still the ending justifies the strange means at least in terms of the epic battle that ensues.Wolverine is not a travesty for the genre but it certainly doesn't meet the expectations for a thorough superhero movie experience. You get amped up action and style over meaning and that makes it entertainment more than catharsis. Expect to be entertained and little else and Wolverine will satisfy your itch for the summer movie season. Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site at httpmoviemusereviews.com";

	schema:reviewBody "Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However unlike Watchmen which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable Wolverine's inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and rewrites the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist hacking one of the most genuinely compelling subversive and horrifying superhero backstories into the worst kind of safe familiar PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fightchaseexplosion scenes complexity for eyerolling cheese and broad humour and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story. While further focus on the WolverineSabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger the film continually broadens its scope seemingly attempting to bank on the injokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But while their fan nods were tasteful and enjoyable Wolverine's attempts at matching them appear to be building up to an almost sinister bid for Fox's superhero franchises to compete. Recognizable XMen characters are continually shoehorned into minuscule parts fans of Deadpool Blob Gambit or groan Cyclops don't go in expecting much but disappointment for seemingly the sole purpose of leapfrogging off Wolverine's story into their own spinoffs. However such an overflowing mass of secondary characters only serves the dual purpose of both derailing Wolverine's story and not even serving to satisfy comic fans clamouring to see their favourite characters on screen as the fleeting shallow depictions hardly prove satisfying character development by any stretch of the imagination. If the filmmakers choose to tackle established characters to appease fan expectations doing nothing with the characters let alone doing them far from 'properly' hardly seems a suitable way to satisfy a demanding audience. Director Gavin Hood known for excellent African drama Tsotsi of all things has been vocal about his clashes with the studio over the film and one can only assume given his excellent credentials that most of his proposed changes would have been for the better. As it is Hood demonstrates a shaky directorial presence at best masking his action scenes in whirling cameras making it near impossible to see and complimenting most tense or dramatic scenes with a cascade of Harry GregsonWilliams' tiresomely banal and clichd musical score. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes a promising African raid plot point and an undeniably gripping if underexplored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program. But like the irritatingly freezeframe beset but otherwise clever opening montage showcasing Wolverine's progression through numerous world wars such quality is often overshadowed by cringeworthy prevailing flaws making it all the more difficult to appreciate. Ironically for the film situating him most justifiably in the lead role Hugh Jackman gives his weakest performance in his foundational role as Wolverine. While Jackman's natural charisma and steely credibility still make him a far more sturdy enough lead than his film deserved his underexploring of Wolverine's feral ferocity and darkness still leaves an ultimately unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Despite initial skepticism of miscasting Liev Schreiber proves far more resonant as Wolverine's animalistic adversary Sabretooth providing a savagely threatening yet controlled performance which despite falling short of the true animalistic frenzy Sabretooth should have been proves one of the more successful attributes of the film. Similarly Danny Huston provides a welcome dash of class as Machiavellian military official William Stryker managing to overcome the shortcomings of an underwritten character with an impressively realized wonderful presence. Ryan Reynolds also proves perfectly cast as twisted mercenary Deadpool thankfully managing to suppress star showiness in favour of suitably manic humour  nonetheless Reynolds is criminally wasted in a far too brief and insultingly warped butchering of his comics incarnation. Taylor Kitsch conversely gives a bland dopily flat take on fan favourite Gambit the character's legendary suave charisma as nonexistent as Kitsch's Cajun accent doing little to justify his character's near pointless addition. While it may function suitably as mindless summer entertainment the inherent complexity in Wolverine's backstory makes its reduction to such a near outright insult to fans of the comic source material. If left as a standalone film Wolverine might have been dismissible as a mostly harmless disappointment but with such blatant spin off begging it evolves into something far more objectionable. While the film has its moments as a cohesive unit it can be considered nothing less than a tragic waste of potential floundering any inherent quality in gaping plot holes and unnecessary obvious comedy or tearjerking scenes. Wolverine's adage of him being the best I am at what I do could hardly be farther than the truth when applied to his film. 410".

	schema:headline " Lots of action drama humor and... Wolverine";
	schema:reviewBody "Xmen Origins Wolverine is an enjoyable film. There's a bit of everything in this movie. Let me start with the characters.Most of the movie is about Wolverine and Sabretooth. Makes sense if you look at the title. How they grew up together what kind of life they lived and how in the end they became two men who couldn't go through the same door ever again. Rivals till the end of time.There isn't much room for the other characters in this movie compared to Wolverine. I was a bit disappointed that both Gambit and Deadpool didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped. The same can be said for the other wellknown xmen characters like the Blob or Emma Frost. They both have a minor role in this movie. Maybe that was done on purpose since this IS a movie about Wolverine but a little more screen time would have been nice of course.The villain in this movie is none other then general William Stryker. If you are a Xmen fan you know him very well. Danny Huston plays a VERY good Stryker. You are really going to hate this character if you haven't already by reading the comics playing the games or watching the previous movies. Action. TONS of it! A lot of cool stunts and daring moves. Motorcycles cars helicopters explosions gunfire and even a tank. This movie has spread the action nicely since there aren't very long pauses between the action scenes. So if you are a fan of action you will love this movie.There's also a nice amount of humor in here. Hugh Jackman plays a great Wolverine once again and it paves the way for a few obvious and less obvious jokes. Gambit and the Blob add some humor as well. This movie is not as humorous as the previous 3 xmen movies but it wasn't meant to be. This is the story about Wolverine's past which is very dark and dramatic. So I'm glad they didn't add too much humor. It would have killed the atmosphere of the movie.I found the acting quite good with the exception of Gambit maybe. But that's because I cling myself too much to the cartoon version of Gambit. I don't think anyone is ever gonna top that Gambit. He was okay in this film but it could have been much better. No complaints about the lead characters though. I already mentioned William Stryker and Wolverine but Liev Schreiber Sabretooth plays his character very well. You can almost feel the anger and somewhat sadistic aura whenever he shows himself on the screen. A job well done Liev.In conclusion I found this movie entertaining. It could have been better at some points but it's not horribly mutilated as I first thought it would be. One last warning for fan girls of Hugh Jackman... There's like 5 minutes in the movie where he is completely naked...".

However to enjoy the movie one must suspend knowledge of the comic book material. The movie was made for the average moviegoer and a little for the ultra hardcore XMen comic book reader. The story has everything anyone could want family a little romance love comedy revenge and plenty of action.I was pleased with most of the acting. I will admit that some dialogue seems forced from the minor cast but the main characters  Wolverine Sabretooth etc.  all work well together. The story did seem a little rushed and choppy at times however. The 145 time goes by quickly enough to feel like maybe the movie could have  and should have  been closer to 200.The movie is as good as the first XMen movie and better than XMen United and XMen The Last Stand. I am actually looking forward to seeing how they handle the Magneto origins movie that's being made. And I am really hoping that all of this work brings it together for a possible XMen 4. I know you agree with me because after all I know everyone is dying to see Apocalypse as the bad guy.My only real complaint of the movie is that Gambit my favorite XMen character did not have as much screen time as I'd hoped. He better either get his own movie or make an appearance in a later Marvel movie.Ignore the syndicated critics and the negativity surrounding this movie. I'm glad I did. Go see it. Don't let people scare you away from spending your money on this movie. Form your own opinions. Oh and if you go stay after the credits.".

	schema:headline " Epic Fail the Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin with this one. Problems are numerous including spotty acting effects and cinematography. I'm going to focus on the script for this review as it really looks like the writers wrote up a bunch of plot points characters and trailerready fight sequences and then tried to write a movie around them. The result is nothing short of disastrous.For a movie that is supposed to give the origins of Wolverine they did a good job of telling us exactly nothing about WHO Wolverine is. It's like they assume we know everything about the characters already so there's no need to develop anyone's character. A movie should stand on its own. Origins Wolverine is a onelegged dog.Liev Schreiber and Hugh Jackman both do well in their roles but the first 10 minutes of the movie are rushed and underdeveloped. It's too fastpaced and the result is painfully uninvolving. They spend about 3 minutes as kids in which we find out practically nothing about them. Then it literally cuts from them being kids running through the woods to them shooting people in the Civil War. The opening credits montage takes us through 150 years in about 3 minutes and suggests that Logan is tired of being in wars and Victor loves it. This is all the information we get about who they are. By the time they're recruited by Stryker they have interacted with each other approximately twice. Why do they join every single American war? Do they just like getting shot a lot? Why is Victor so bloodthirsty and Logan good? How did Logan and Kayla meet? How did Logan find out he was invincible? Does he feel anything about the fact that he killed his father? The filmmakers didn't care. This movie has all the depth of a piece of cardboard.Victor's motivations are beyond murky throughout the whole film. He basically goes around killing characters for no real reason at all. Logan's relationship with his girlfriend starts out very poorly developed and actually becomes LESS believable by the end of the movie. In the one scene that is supposed to develop Logan and Kayla's relationship she starts talking about some weird symbolic moon myths... its unintentionally hilarious. Oh and it turns out she's a mutant and is hypnotizing Logan in order to watch him for Stryker and fakes her death in order to make Logan to want revenge on Victor to force him into the Weapon X program so they could test the adamantium on him for the Deadpool project and then erase his memory in order to rescue her sister from Stryker. Seriously. But she really loves him! Uhhuh. They conveniently leave out how Logan and Kayla met which at first seems like just lousy character development but then you realizethat they skipped over this so that they wouldn't have to explain the exact circumstances of their meeting with her secretly spying on him. I suppose it was just too darn hard to for these guys to write. Lynn Collins is completely wooden and I didn't care one iota for her character.The lack of any believable characters leaves the movie plotdriven. But there's so many holes in the story that it's not even worth trying to find them all. This movie is basically a series of scenes with very little connecting each one except Hugh Jackman's best efforts. Wolverine gets his jacket. Check. Wolverine gets his dogtags. Check. Wolverines bone spikes somehow become giant knives when he gets his adamantium. The plot is not only convoluted and full of holes but it completely negates itself in the last 10 minutes. Since Kayla ends up being alive any tension created by the revenge scenario is totally wasted and suddenly Victor is a good guy!? Everything was apparently done to create the supermutant Deadpool who doesn't have one single element of the comics Deadpool except the name who lasts about 10 minutes before dying by Logan's claws. That's the plot. Even though I know hardly anything about the comics this is awful storytelling.All of Stryker's team are pointless Dominic Monaghan is totally wasted Ryan Reynolds disappears after the first 10 minutes and never returns and the team's individual powers are never explained at all. Kevin Durand can put his fist in a tank's main gun and stop a shell and then he becomes grotesquely fat. Will I Am what kind of name is this? whose character is apparently named Wraith is basically a ripoff of Nightcrawler. Gambit is just in this for the fanboys and doesn't even have the right accent. There's a guy who can do gunkata. Wow I didn't know shooting people like the guy in Equilibrium was a mutant ability! Cyclops shows up for very little reason but to give Deadpool cool eye beams. All of these characters are mere plot points moving Logan from place to place and then dying or disappearing. It would be predictable if it weren't so unbelievably bad.And the fights? Most are pretty short inconsequential and bloodless. That's right the savage Wolverine hardly doles out any real violence only to his brother and to Deadpool and since both have regeneration and we know Victor and Logan will live even the stabs have no stab. The cinematography and editing are pretty lousy. Remember the fight between Logan and Sabretooth from the first movie on top of the Statue of Liberty? Or the White House attack with Nightcrawler from the second? There's no great techniques like those here most of it is flat greenscreening or total CGI shots. Some of the sets looks pretty cheap. Even the teleportation effects got worse in this one. The CGI is passable but not very realistic. All in all decidedly average visuals.What's left at the end of all this is a movie with hardly any drive substance or value. I'm disappointed that this was the best they could do with such great potential.".

I thought XMen 1 and 2 came close to being masterpieces and that XMen 3 sucked big time. The Wolverine movie however is well made exciting and surprisingly effective. But that's an opinion from somebody who doesn't know anything about the comics. To me Wolverine is mainly a movie hero and maybe that can make a big difference. Two elements make this movie really work. Liev Schreiber  a very underestimated actor  does a great job as Wolverine's brother VictorSabretooth. It's their lovehate relationship that is the main subject in this story and that really keeps it interesting. In the first minutes of the movie this is well established. The opening credits are really beautiful.Second the story. I really love the story. It has romance betrayal vengeance action a touch of immortality... All the good elements are there in the right doses.Yes I really love this movie. I hope to see more of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the future because there are a lot more adventures he can and should have. Maybe director Gavin Hood can repair some of the damage that Brett Ratner did with a XMen 3. Because an XMen 4  with hopefully Josh Halloway as Gambit  would be a great spectacle indeed. There's only one big thing that really puzzled me. So the Liev Schreiber character is actually the same Sabretooth we see in XMen 1? Because the two characters really don't seem the same in the two movies. Everything they have experienced together in the past in the prequel seems forgotten in XMen 1 when they only fight each other.Anyway go see this!85  10".

Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.Many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine Victor Creed never called Sabertooth in the film and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eyecandy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30minutes as is Sabertooth though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.The final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.Very disappointing...".

Stick with me on the food analogy. I've seen some complain about subsidiary characters but when the main course is this good and this filling who cares? Whining about Gambit Wade Wilson and company is like whining that the mushrooms aren't as good as they should be when the steak is juicy and remarkably tasty. Great kickass action remarkable visuals a coherent plot this is definitely the highlight of the year so far. As I like to note a must see event film if there ever was one. Anyone that says otherwise isn't telling the truth. I can't think of a truly weak moment in the film because the pace is near perfect. It's strong from start to finish. The powerful moments resonate throughout the film both the tremendous action and the heartfelt moments. The confrontations are simply incredible best of the series.Wonderful film for fan and nonfan alike. Highly Recommended.".

Another disappointing Hollywood movie this has only reinforced the fact that Hollywood is all about the big bucks  exploiting anything  everything that already has an established fan base dumbing it down because they believe it makes the film more appealing to wider audience In their mind this means more . Whats next? 'The Crow' vs 'Watchmen' 'The Matrix' vs 'Star Wars' vs 'Star Trek' ? ? ?I was looking forward to seeing 'Wolverine'. I'll admit I was pumped I wanted to learn more about the character what makes him tick?  where he came from. What happened? I get a 2hour CGIFX smrgsbord a predictable plot that goes nowhere weaker than weak acting a Deadpool fiasco  I learn't nothing that I didn't already know about Wolverine. What a disaster. The visuals are meant to be the icing on the cake there is nothing holding this cake together. Why couldn't I get a proper dark serious R rated 'Wolverine' low budget gritty sex  violence real drama real characters. True to the source material Wolverine is a complex character  his origin isn't exactly 'Butterflies  Faires'. Is Hollywood morbidly afraid to release a film that actually makes people think? A film that lets the audience use a bit of imagination to fill in the gaps  let them have their own interpretation something that engages  stimulates them. Is it too much to ask for an interesting story  character development? All I know for sure is that I wont be seeing any new Marvel related films I can make a better movie in my film class.".

XMen 3 was free to let the holdovers from the first two films run amok even though the story felt a bit crowded. This film feels like a nice comp elation of all three. It gains an advantage because it's a welltempered introduction of new characters mixed with the perfect focus on the character of Wolverine. The action sequences do indeed warrant serious praise. Origins doesn't exactly complicate the conventional black and white tropes of a good vs. evil but it doesn't need to. What results is one extremely satisfying thrill ride!".

The first XMen was good XMen 2 was beyond that XMen 3 may have lost ground but Wolverine picked up that ground and then some. It's a sequel that not only surpassed X3 but is intriguing and well structured.I've used this colloquialism before but X marks the spot and there are plenty of big action scenes throughout this amazing movie that it has to be called spectacular. Wolverine goes ballistic in a good way and the introduction to newcomers Gambit Wraith and even Wade makes for an intriguing watch. It's action with a nice mix of smarts and fun. I don't understand how anyone can complain about that awesome ending. I guess I don't subscribe to the strict adherence to the source material as law. It more then works as a movie.".
