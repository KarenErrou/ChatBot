It seems they must have been hard up for cash because this film will not add anything to their careers.Let's just hope the joke is on us and the director cast and crew had a fabulous time while doing this movie and that perhaps they managed to have gone fishin' themselves while they were in the area.";

What amazes me the most is how the humor scenes are filled with original jokes like the scene in which they are in the first restaurant making their orders like a homosexual couple and not paying attention that everybody around them felt that way. It's funny how filmmakers portray them like two very innocent guys that end up succeeding in getting the prize in fact the smaller prize making you feel like there's no need to be a smart pants to be rewarded. I read some criticism towards the acting but in my point of view the whole cast is professional and the main actors are even a little above average. Besides the plot is fast paced never tiring the spectator. Also it's a BIG personal coincidence that they mention 1972's Deliverance given that I was just about to watch that movie but preferred catching what was on cable. All in all Gone Fishin' is surely a feel good movie that have been hidden from mainstream since it was released but it's hard for you to not enjoy it!".

They play straight faced a pair of extremely stupid friends to which infantile catastrophes happen. These are largely physical inasmuch as neither is bright enough for repartee. Historically the center of any physical comedy routine is an essential childlike innocence. Reference the films of Jerry Lewis or Jim Carrey. When Pesci and Glover as tired middle aged men try the same routines they simply look pathetic. Pesci has pulled off this role albeit playing a character who thought he was smarter than he was in Home Alone. However there he benefited from a much better script in terms of dialog and physical setups. However in Gone Fishin'  there is simply no good dialog and no surprises in the action. Only Gary Grubbs as a shifty boat dealer seems to generate any fun. The true pity of this film was that one of the stunt women Janet Wilder was killed in a boating accident while the film was being made.

Although Danny Glover often chooses Acting Lite in his roles he does have a fair degree of talent. Why these two paired up to make this movie I will never understand.If you have difficulty counting without the use of your fingers you might find a measure of humor here. Otherwise be prepared for 94 minutes of the most horrendous bad acting caught on film. I firmly believe there was not actually a script for this movie. How many times can you watch these two morons look at each other with their mouths agape saying Oh yeaaaah.?I saw this when it first opened hoping for some light funny comedy what I got was an hour and a half of me staring at my wife her staring back wondering if it was ever going to be funny. Needless to say our answer came with the credits. Gone Fishin' has become a catchphrase for anything that is truly horrible.As an aficionado of B movies in the Mystery Science Theater sense I thoroughly enjoy a bad movie. It is a wonderful thing to add dialogue with friends and jeer at the horrors of movies like Surf Nazis Must Die an actual title check it out but this doesn't even make it to that worthy category of So Bad You Have To See It. Spare your brain cells. If you want to see something stupid but funny there are an infinite number of choices. Too many choices for anyone to have a good reason to watch this.".

Somehow that was not taken into account when the transition from novel to screenplay was made.When you go to the movies you want to care about the people in it.

Based on the material he was given he made a fairly interesting movie which showcases his talent as an action director. At times excellent but not overwrought like most of the action movies are today. But apart form the scenery and the actionsequences the films weak point lies in its characters.They are neither very believable nor interesting enough to hold your attention. Even the star of the movie Michael Caine a seasoned heavyweight in the espionage genre seems out of sync in this one.If you don't expect too much  you'll be moderately entertained.

	schema:reviewBody "The Holcroft Covenant takes its cue from a bestseller by the prolific Robert Ludlum. I've read the book and it's pretty good with lots of globe trotting adventures and some startling twists and turns. It also takes upwards of 600 pages to tell its complex tale. The film version misses out most of the events from the book yet tries in vain to remain faithful to the key plot points.... however any film which tries to tell a 600 page story in less than two hours is doomed before it even begins. There's no surprise that this film is a muddled intractable poorly developed misfire. The story involves an inheritance in Nazi money which falls into the hands of several German descendants in the 1980s. The money is supposed to be a sort of compensation payment for the suffering and misery caused by WWII but some of the inheritors are evil people and intend to use the money for nefarious purposes. Michael Caine plays one of the inheritors Noel Holcroft hence the title and he sets out to ensure that it is used for good causes but he finds that various others will kill to keep him from getting his hands on his rightful share.The film is a terrible mess and it's only too apparent that those involved were in it for the money. Every single performance is lazy. Frankenheimer once made great movies like The Manchurian Cnadidate and The French Connection 2 but here he is guilty of directing a listless hodgepodge that bears no trace of originality or flair. Caine has made too many bad movies but this ranks amongst the very worst. No questions about it this is a surefire low point for just about everyone involved.".

The money is supposed to be a sort of compensation payment for the suffering and misery caused by WWII but some of the inheritors are evil people and intend to use the money for nefarious purposes. Michael Caine plays one of the inheritors Noel Holcroft hence the title and he sets out to ensure that it is used for good causes but he finds that various others will kill to keep him from getting his hands on his rightful share.The film is a terrible mess and it's only too apparent that those involved were in it for the money. Every single performance is lazy. Frankenheimer once made great movies like The Manchurian Cnadidate and The French Connection 2 but here he is guilty of directing a listless hodgepodge that bears no trace of originality or flair. Caine has made too many bad movies but this ranks amongst the very worst. No questions about it this is a surefire low point for just about everyone involved.";

The film was made and released about seven years after its source novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum had been first published in 1978. This is second ever feature film adaptation of a Robert Ludlum novel and the third Ludlum adaption overall for any filmed production as Clave omega had debuted in theaters in 1983 whilst Rhinemann exchange 1977 had been made for television in 1977. The picture was the second of three 1980s features based on Ludlum novels the decade ended with a telemovie titled The Bourne Identity . This was one of a number of actionthrillers of the 1980s which featured a neoNazi story twist element  others included Alistair MacLean's Bear Island 1979 and River of death 1989.

Michael Caine as a noisy simpleton? Give me a big fat Nazi break! Not even Michael Caine is that good of an actor. The idea that life in a Nazi thriller unfolds like a Pink Panther sequel without punchlines is too difficult to swallow. Some of the scenes actually seem to me as if they were outtakes or lighting checks that ended up in the final edit by accident. I don't think I would care so much except that it is my beloved Michael Caine I am talking about here. The screenwriter should have been shot instead of this movie. The whole thing would have been more successful and excusable as a light comedy starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Holcroft neatly missing numerous assassination attempts while managing to solve the entire mystery purely by accident. The queasy merger of bad 80's costumes and completely uninspired cinematography is the only conspiracy worth noting in this absurd waste of talent and money. I think the whole awful eighties cocaine craze was rampant on this movie set and that noone could tell a terrible script from a silver spoon by the time the whole thing got into production. I agree with the earlier reviewer  save this for a Worst Films Night with some good friends after a few stiff drinks are had by all and hope no friendships are ruined in the process.".

Eventually Caine discovers that not only can he not be sure of whom to trust but also that the money may not even have been intended for the purpose specified! Caine is of course miscast in a role intended for James Caan but he makes the best of it. He had played in many espionage and spy films during his career. One of his strongest scenes occurs at the very end as he is reacting to an occurrence. Tennant gives a typically bland and uninvolving performance with only an occasional kink in the storyline to keep her from practically vanishing. Andrews brings a welcome touch of flair to his haughty character. Palmer lends some dignity to her role her last though she has to contend with some big hair and some even bigger eyeglasses. Though there is a certain degree of interest in the premise and some of the action sequences are captivating overall this is a subpar film. It has a fairly tacky look to it despite the location shooting and it's overlaid with an overbearing and datedsounding synthesized score. Attempts to inject sex into the story only come off as desperate though the one big shocker was indeed contained in the novel albeit in a slightly different context than what's shown here. Beyond that the plot as distilled from the larger novel makes precious little sense and relies on contrivance and an unbelievable amount of convenient globetrotting. It's disheartening to hear director Frankenheimer the man behind The Birdman of Alcatraz The Manchurian Candidate and The Train among others singing the praises of this below average movie on the DVD commentary though it's understandable that he if anyone should like it. It's not completely uninteresting. It's just not particularly good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Caine as a GermanAmerican? Gimme a break! This whole project is so desperately flawed that even Lilli Palmer cannot save it though her performance as Caine's mother is the best in the film. You know something is wrong when you see the opening credits there are just too many screenwriters and even Edward Anhalt is in there. How many rewrites can a succession of people do to save a doomed script? Clearly not enough. This is an excellent yarn taken from a Robert Ludlum book which must have been a gripping story. But what a mess they have made of it. John Frankenheimer was an excellent director who was what one could call 'uneven'. In other words he did not always deliver an acceptable result and here he fails. He tries and tries but it is no use. Anthony Andrews gives a better than expected performance manages to avoid being arch and with his blonde appearance convinces us that he is a German with an Iron Cross for a heart. Victoria Tennant such an undervalued actress does a fine job. Michael Lonsdale is wholly convincing as a quietly dominant Swiss banker who never needs to raise his voice because money speaks for him. It all could have been so good but when you decide to cast a London cockney as an American architect whose father was a Nazi general well please ... Michael Caine has never been anything other than Michael Caine. You could call that being true to himself or you could call it lack of talent. Certainly when he is called upon in this film to cry you know it is glycerine drops and the idea of a barrow boy crying come on. The trouble was that in the 1970s Michael Caine was the only 'bankable' British star which certainly gave too much power to his agent Dennis Sellinger. And I guess this carried over into the eighties. But by then he was a shadow of the chirpy cricket of the East End that rode the wave of the revolution in class consciousness right to the top. Talk about perfect timing Caine became the icon of a social movement. But somebody forgot to tell him how to act. Later in life Caine finally picked up the skills along the way and dozens of movies were his RADA so he ended up a good actor in the end. But this was 1985 when he was still hopeless at being anyone but the same Michael Caine we saw last time and the time before and the time before. And that is a bore. Yes tis a pity.".

Editing and cinematography are reasonable and this does have a couple of sophisticated moments. The plot is interesting enough. This is wellpaced and there are exciting and tense scenes. The music helps to ensure that the mood is established and it arguably tries too hard at times revealing itself to be manipulative. Caine is impeccable as usual and the acting in general is quite good. The dialog holds numerous welldelivered lines that are marvelous memorable and worth quoting.

I am NOT saying that the quality of this film even approaches the quality of the older Hitchcock film...just noting the parallel.When the film begins there is a black and white prologue which is shocking to watch. Three Nazis are making some sort of a pack...after which the leader of the three kills the other two and then himself!! What IS this all about anyway? It was a wonderful way to pull in the viewer.Next the film jumps to the 1980s. Some schmuck Noel Holcroft Michael Caine is doing what any good 'ol American is doing working and enjoying life. However he's soon approached by some weird folks who tell him a weird tale about Noel's Nazi father. It seems he and two other Nazis were disenchanted by the party and felt horrible about the war crimes. So they siphoned off a few billion so that years later it could be used to pay for the damage done by the Nazis. It seems that Noel is now the executor of this agreement and the letter he's given indicates that he needs to find the sons of the other two dead men from the beginning of the movie in order to get to these funds which are locked in a Swiss bank account. But he needs to find them...and folks suddenly start dying all around them...and it seems highly unlikely Noel will live very long especially since he has no idea who to trust. He also has no idea if this convoluted story is even true.Because the story is MEANT to be confusing I cannot fault the film for leaving me baffled repeatedly. What I can fault the movie for is having Noel behave so strangely. You would think if you were told this weird tale and folks started dying all around you that you'd go to the police or FBI or the local embassy. Yet inexplicably Noel gets pulled deeper and deeper in and even kills someone...even though he's not 100 sure if he's killing the right person! His weird acceptance of what folks tell him is mighty strange and is a shortcoming in the plot though late in the film he FINALLY starts to think. Additionally I was totally confused by the casting of Michael Caine. After all he was supposedly born in Germany but came to America as a young child and yet speaks like a Brit! And finally in 1984 we are to buy into the idea of a new Fourth Reich!! This is a bit preposterous to say the least. So it sounds like I didn't love the film...and that certainly is the case. But did I like any of it or would I recommend you see it? Not really...but I didn't hate it either. I clearly see this as one of the great director John Frankenheimer's biggest disappointments and could say the same for Robert Ludlum since it's his story. Also while I love Michael Caine he was wrong for this film. Watchable but nothing more...and you definitely would have expected more from this film.".

The film itself is rather episodic and has hardly any action and thus not much in the way of life but the saving grace is the presence of director John Frankenheimer who directors with his customary skill and professionalism. He turns what could have been a farcical effort into something more than watchable with enough twists to keep the viewer engaged with the onscreen proceedings. It's nice to see Caine playing a more ordinary hero than most while the supporting cast includes Anthony Andrews who is very good playing against type alongside Euro stalwarts like Mario Adorf and Michael Lonsdale. Cheesy and dated at times and occasionally boring THE HOLCROFT COVENANT is one to enjoy if you're in a more forgiving mood.".

Usually in his Harry Palmer films or other similar spy movies he's a former or current British agent and expertly handles the bad guys. In this one he's caught unawares by everything and everyone it's quite endearing.In The Holcroft Covenant Michael has inherited 4.5 billion from his late father a secret Nazi. Along the way to receiving his inheritance and trying to do good with the money he's advised by Victoria Tennant Anthony Andrews Lilli Palmer and Mario Adorft but who can he really trust? The film is chalk full of exciting action sequences and as is sometimes unusual for action movies there's some pretty good acting in it as well. Michael Caine doesn't just run around and shoot people he puts himself in the moment of the character and lets the audience know he's scared hurt nervous or plotting.My favorite scene is when he's held at gunpoint in a room full of villains. He manages to distract the gunman and turns the tables by pointing the gun at them demanding that they do exactly what he says. Everyone's silent for a while looking at him expectantly until finally one woman asks What do you want us to do? The usual stuff he replies showing that even though he's holding a gun he's really not a bad guy at heart.DLM Warning If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells like my mom does this movie might not your friend. Several times throughout the film the camera is at a standstill and then tilts slightly with no warning and it might make you sick. In other words Don't Look Mom! Kiddy Warning Obviously you have control over your own children. However due to nudity I wouldn't let my kids watch it.".

It's another Nazi conspiracy thriller adapted from a Robert Ludlum novel by three of the best writers in the business George Axelrod Edward Anhalt and John Hopkins so what went wrong? Well for starters it could be a case of too many cooks for there isn't a believable line of dialogue in the entire film which zooms all over the place at great speed but goes absolutely nowhere the budget obviously allowed for some nifty location shooting and Gerry Fisher's cinematography is one of the film's few saving graces.It's also preposterously plotted and atrociously acted. Michael Caine dreadful is the lead and Anthony Andrews Victoria Tennant Michael Lonsdale and Lilli Palmer are among the others who are wasted in this rubbish. That fine British character actor Bernard Hepton manages to come out of it smelling of roses which is really something of a miracle. Of course perhaps it was meant to be a comedy but if it was it isn't a particularly funny one.".

Having no working papers Arben must really scrounge to make even a small amount of money. He eventually is forced to turn to crime to get what he needs in order to return to his girl. During the film we see this character go through changes from naive country boy who can barely figure out how to use a computer then becoming slowly disillusioned with the world he thought he understood. In the end he develops a hard edge when things begin to go wrong and he becomes desperate. When he finally returns to his homeland things do not go as expected.Of course this is hardly the first time this kind of tale has been told but it is important to see and understand what people go through when coming to a new country to make a life for themselves. The world can be so cold and unforgiving for those without money or status. We learn from films like these how basically good people resort to questionable means to survive because survival is human instinct and life IS survival. Great movie and a powerful drama.".

It has a lovely heart to it and although certainly naive and simple for todays standards it possesses a warmth that is so often missing from other mostly american films of it's Genre and time period.Certainly there are some strange aspects to it. The setting  which is either Spain or Mexico clashes with the Russian language and the Greek Spanish and French character names. Perhaps this is done to give a sense of internationalism to the film.But the thing I loved most about this film is it's social rather than political subtext. While many of this 1960's SCIFI Genre concentrate on Nuclear accidents fear of technology etc Amphibian Man is instead concerned with the world that is created by simple human greed and cruelty. There is no BIG threat here only trying to exist in a world that is made by men who are greedy and selfish. It is interesting to see that while US cinema was hysterical about the threat of nuclear technology and specifically the threat of Communist Russia This Russian Film was more concerned with working within the world as it stood and looking at the problems that do exist rather than scaring people with over the top nuclear threats. The Amphibian Man is not created by accident  but by scientific technology and the purpose is not as a weapon but as a social advance. Even the evil Don Pedro  never thinks of using the sea Devil as a weapon but only to collect pearls and increase Pedro's personal fortune.It is a truly interesting movie allowing me to see another mind set of that era that is not the American one. And the bittersweet ending is far from unsatisfying.".

It was a recordbreaking film when it came out in the cinema houses all over the USSR in the early 60's. Even though the beautiful star of the Soviet film era young Anastasia Vertinskaya Gutierrez was known to the audiences from her previous works theater actor Vladimir Korenev  handsome Ixtiander wokeup famous and instantly became a desire of almost every woman in the country. The title song about a SEA DEVIL was on everybody's lips ever since.In order to closest resemble the scenery of a beautiful Latin country the movie was shot in sunny Baku Azerbajan.The idea of a seadevil lurking in the waters near the shores and scaring people sets up the mood of the movie. However the devil turns out to be a handsome young man with an inhuman trait he is an amphibian. A romantic story starts to unfold when he falls in love with a gorgeous girl. Matters become complicated as the girl is about to get married to somebody else...It is a beautiful movie which is a pleasure to watch even today. If some parts of the film seem poor compared to today's filmmaking standards they are easily forgiven due to the beauty of the scenery interesting plot strikinglooking actors and their sincere acting approach to their characters. If you appreciate good international cinema and want to familiarize yourself with Soviet pop culture and the work of one of the world's best scifi writers I highly recommend this film. It is full of mythical mood great scientific fantasy mixed with true portrayal of human emotions.I recommend this film to every romantic at heart!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Amphibian Man' is one of the oddest movies I've ever seen. From the title and the initial premise  poor fishman and their families are frightened by an unknown monster they nickname the sea devil  you might think you're in for a 'Creature From The Black Lagoon' style monster movie but this movie is a completely different thing. What kind of thing it is exactly is difficult to summarize because I can't honestly think of any other movie I've seen which is quite like it. Technically SF but more of a fantasy romance in execution. It is a very unusual but charming movie. The monster turns out to be the son of a local benevolent scientist who has had shark gills transplanted into his body and has a secret underwater life. He falls in love with the beautiful daughter of a local fisherman who has been betrothed to an ambitious cad she doesn't love. It is a marriage borne of economic necessity. Pretty soon Amphibian Man and Ambitious Cad clash and our hero finds himself persecuted and eventually kidnapped. I really enjoyed this film it has quite a unique eccentric feel to it and has some genuinely touching moments and even a song or two. The production values are quite impressive for the era the premise is interestingly handled and the acting is generally above average. I was fortunate enough to watch the Russian print with English subtitles. I believe there are some badly dubbed versions of this movie around so try and avoid those if you can and see the original to fully appreciate this little gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps this is one of the best SciFiction film ever produced in the history of cinema for its content. Its presentation may not be the best due to color problems and very much evident make up of the actors and actresses. I assume that the story was going on in a territory of any Latin American country probably Mexico. The plot is about a young man able also to live normally in the sea. His father a scientist and physician built up a laboratory in the depth of the ocean where his son passes part of his life. Being a rare organism his father always warned him not to visit nearby city but love came over when he met a nice lady sinking in the sea and with this all problems started. The film showed that early 60s the Soviet directors and producers were not very much aware of the music in Latin America. Dancing was Spanishlike and not Latin American as such. Names chosen for the heroes of the film were also rare. The lady is called Gutiere when Gutirrez is a common surname in Spanish then Ichtiandros is the name of the main actor of the film again an invention. In any case it is nice to see several shots made in the sea in a really beautiful environment and also to see nice diving and swimming of various actors. Excitement is also assured in this material. However it does not have the HollywoodHappy End. It is more realistic in its end. The film has also its morale showing the miseries of people trying to make money no matter if it is playing with the life of a human being.".

	schema:headline " Visually impressive Soviet scifi";
	schema:reviewBody "Based upon the novel of the same name by Soviet sciencefiction writer Alexander Beliaev Amphibian Man tells the somewhat tragic tale of Ichtyander Vladimir Korenev a young handsome man that has been given the use of gills by his father Nikolai Simonov. Various sightings have led to him being dubbed a seadevil a monster of the sea who has attacked various boats. Rich fisherman Pedro Mikhail Kozakov is trying to win the affections of the beautiful Gutiere Anastasiya Vertinskaya but when she is attacked by a shark in the sea Ichtyander rescues her and falls in love with her. She mistakenly thinks it was Pedro who saved her and so Ichtyander must come onto land in search of his new love.What is really on the surface a rather silly scifi movie that evokes the traditions of the U.S.'s Bmovie output of the 1950's it is actually a welltold fairytale lovestory giving most of its attentions to the doomed affair between Ichtyander and Gutiere. The loathsome Pedro is always on hand to scupper their attempts with Gutiere trapped in a betrothal arranged by her father Anatoliy Smiranin who would rather see her marry into money than for true love. Themes of greed are ever present throughout the film reflecting the socialist realist attitudes of the time  a biting social commentary that the Soviet's were so good at Soviet giants such as Eisenstein and Dovzhenko made their careers on propaganda and helps add a gravitas to what might have been a straight forward Bmovie.Amphibian Man is also technically impressive. Directors Vladimir Chebotayrov and Gennadi Kazansky used a seaside community in Azerbaijan to film and this results in some nice photography. One of the standout scenes follows the POV of Ichtyander as he searches the streets for Gutiere with the handheld photography adding a desperation to his quest. There are also moments that evoke the techniques of the silent greats using tilted closeup photography that heightens the psychological torment of the character more prominently used in the climactic scenes with Pedro as his lust for power and his alphamale dominance over Gutiere reaches breaking point. I was surprised to learn after watching the film that it was a massive commercial success in 1962 as the film has since faded into obscurity. Although it's hardly a great film there is enough in Amphibian Man to justify a rediscovery of the wealth of Societ scifi's from this era.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

This was during a time when there was not that many remotes so what they looked at as the little sister I had to look at too. Which is why I remember this film and haven't seen it since I was seven years old. By that time we got cable my brothers were older and I got the tv! And let me add one more thing many IMDb poster have written about films ripe for remakes for Hollywood Directors and Producers other than the ones they are doing. If I was one of those folks I'd put this on my list to consider. This is a Speilbergesque family scifi film just waiting to be remade. Then again I like it just fine the way it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was quite an enjoyable film overall and has a fairly unusual tone due to the collision of several different genreassociated elements. The concept taken from a novel that I have not had the chance to read is straight science fiction. It's a nice one and it is pleasant to see and follow the implications of the prototypical scary seamonster turning out to be not only a slightlymodified human but also the male love interest. I was a little puzzled by the logical the science fiction though Ichthyander has been kept under the sea because unlike most humans he has fish gills as well as lungs. But he must remain out of the water to exercise his lungs or they will atrophy and he's been kept away from human society... because it will create a great underwater society sometime in the future?So we have a futuristiclooking home setting for our old scientist who is nonetheless dressed in a high collar and frock coat that looks like it could have come from the 1860s. Then we have the main setting which is an undefined Spanishspeaking country by the sea which mostly looks like it could have been the same a hundred years previously as well with the exception of the automobiles and the motorboats next to the piratestyle boats of the pearlhunters. Slightly puzzling as it may be though the setting look gorgeous and is a joy to watch. I read in another comment here that the film was actually shot in Azerbaijan which makes the creation of the rich and beautiful setting all the more impressive. The numerous underwater scenes are impressive as well though I kept wondering why the human Amphibian Man kept putting on his scaly fishcostume to go into the water. Though despite the exotic setting and the scientific trappings it is really a tragic romantic melodrama and an adventure film. Fortunately it does these pretty well and the drama of the romance between the woman trapped in the wrong marriage and her Amphibian lover whose unfamiliarity with shore life is nicely displayed in the stroke of a couple scenes ends up being nicely effective. It might not always make sense but Amphibian Man is a pleasant escapist film that deserves no ill will.".

	schema:headline " A hodgepodge of science fiction fantasy teen romance and action";
	schema:reviewBody "An unusual science fiction  fantasy  romance of a doomed love affair combined with a love triangle and a bit of clumsy anticapitalist commentary this film was a hit with Soviet audiences in the early 1960s on first release. It still looks good for its age half a century later the very fauxMexican setting looks quaintly historic as though the events of the film took place in a peri0d much earlier than 1962 when it was filmed. The cinematography is very good with a number of shots throughout the movie taken at unusual angles or from characters' points of view and there is an emphasis on displaying underwater scenes as brightblue beautiful and benign even when there is a shark lurking about. The young lead actors are stunning to look at and the camera often focuses on their beautiful features even the villain is extraordinarily handsome in a moody way. The acting is at least natural if not particularly outstanding and even a bit wooden and amateurish.All characters are very much stock stereotypes and the actors deviate little from those stereotypes. Medical scientist Dr Salvatore Nikolai Simonov the idealistic mad scientist of the piece has a son who once suffered an incurable lung disease so the father implanted gills in the child's body somewhere to save his life. The boy Ichtyander the monster naif can breathe and live underwater as well as on land but the father keeps him isolated from other people as he has a vague plan for the boy to lead an oceanic republic free of class and other social divisions and exploitation. In the movie Ichtyander Vladimir Korenev is a teenager and he falls in love with a girl Gutiere Anastasia Vertinskaya after rescuing her from a shark attack he desires to follow and be with her and he leaves his waterworld to go to the city where she lives. Unfortunately Gutiere's father the pearldiver Baltazar Anatoly Smiranin is heavily in debt and has promised the girl's hand in marriage to local rich playboy Pedro Zurita Mikhail Kozakov who has promised to pay the old man's debts.The plot is a hodgepodge of action romance and scifi fantasy easy enough to follow but with gaping holes that make it shaky in parts. It seems overeager to advance to the climax to the extent that characters must have inbuilt GPS systems in their brains to find significant people. The busy pace and the plot's complications don't permit much character development which is unfortunate because Ichtyander's infatuation with Gutiere leads him out of his isolation and his father's control and forces him to confront the best and worst of human behaviour and social interactions. Young viewers might identify with Ichtyander's confusion at adult ways of behaving and doing things. There's a point made about how money divides people into social classes and how society judges people on the basis of their wealth or poverty. By the end of the film Ichtyander still seems very childlike and his future without his father is uncertain. Other characters who also need to escape from their onedimensional plane of existence include Gutiere who could have railed against a system that forces her to marry because of economic necessity and Baltazar who is not shown in the movie to have a guilty conscience over horsetrading Gutiere he must have had one though because he ends up saving Gutiere from a lifetime of misery with Pedro. A support character Olsen Vladlen Davydov is very underused as a potential aid and mentor to Ichtyander.Criticism of capitalism comes in the person of Pedro who desires to exploit Ichtyander's fishing and diving skills and tries to convince Dr Salvatore to massproduce thousands of Ichtyanders for profit demonstrating that the evil exploitive capitalist mindset is always on permanent autopilot in the brains of stock villains. By contrast Dr Salvatore's desire for an egalitarian socialist underwater utopia is demonstrated as unrealistic in the context of an impoverished Latin American country where corruption or what the viewer sees of it is rife. Everyone in this country seems to be in debt and people constantly haggle for more money Gutiere gives her necklace to Olsen so he can pawn it for money to keep his newspaper business going and Baltazar is desperate enough to sell off Gutiere to keep his pearldiving business above water.A highlight of the film is Andrei Petrov's musical soundtrack which includes the use of electronic instruments as well as conventional orchestral music and some Spanishinfluenced flourishes. Dramatic sweeps of violins and other strings mix with beautiful belllike tones and some odd spacey tunes. A couple of songs appear early in the film as though the directors had ambitions for it to be a musical before realising the idea wouldn't mesh too well with a plot filled with twists.A chase scene a kidnap scene and an escapefromjail scene complete with gunshots enliven the plot which concludes in freedom but not happiness ever after or a better understanding of the corrupt world around them for the young wouldbe lovers. Overall Amphibian Man is a visually striking film with beautifully shot locations that are picturesque and quaint and which features goodlooking young actors who run and swim around a lot. The premise and the plot are interesting though at times the directors seemed unsure whether they were making a musical a comedy or an action film the film dithers in one genre then another before settling into the action genre. The film could have been much stronger with better characterisation and fewer twists in the plot.".

The other is the man that he is not any longer or the one that he is never going to be other professions other backgrounds.Life death and time. The film is simple in appearance Juan takes a bus and walks along the streets meets different people changes his name etc. but it invites you to feel and understand his experience that is human experience. Juan is very well performed by Julio Chvez and the characters look like people in a dream. In fact I think that if it would have been a dream it wouldn't make any difference. i do not recommend this film to very young people of those who like action and a clear argument. It is a film for people in the forties who like to think and discuss about important things in life.".

Then on a bus ride a man who looks very much like Juan sits down beside him and dies somewhere along the way. Obviously disturbed he goes on to his work appointment where he hears the story of a couple who has just died leaving their substantial property to the bank they were heavily in debt to. Examining their house which is still full of their possessions is too much for Juan. He checks into a hotel instead of returning home and proceeds to take on various identities he creates a new one for practically everyone he meets for the couple of days he sticks around.This is a subtle carefully observed film full of long still shots that tend to be very nicely composed. It's not a particularly dramatic film but it does succeed in drawing the viewer into the world of a normal man on the cusp of middle age. Basically this is the type of film in which the protagonist has one last adventure on his own before settling into the next stage of his life. As such this is an arthouse version of a familiar type of film but it's executed well enough to make it worthwhile.".

Mr. Rotter's admiration for Michaelangelo Antonioni is obvious without falling into a parody. He has given us a man that appears to be at a crossroad in his life. On the one hand his older father weak and infirm weighs heavily on his life on the other his acceptance of fatherhood is questioned by the way he acts throughout the story. This is an almost silent film since Mr. Rotter simply concentrate on the tale at hand without embellishments like a musical score.In Julio Chavez the director found a great actor that does a tremendous job in bringing Juan DeSouza to life. Mr. Chavez does not have the good looks that other of his contemporaries have. What he brings to the film is his integrity in portraying this tormented man and gives him a life of its own. Mr. Chavez is a wonderful presence in anything he does being on the legitimate stage or in films and even television series.The supporting cast is excellent especially Maria Ucedo who does wonders with her character.

	schema:reviewBody "El otro The Other is an Argentine film made in 2007 directed by Ariel Rotter. It's a small film about a middleaged man who suddenly becomes a father when his own father is dying. It is a movie about a man's identity crisis.A middleaged man Julio Chvez who is taking care of his old father finds out that his wife is pregnant. In result of this he leaves his home and goes for a businesstrip. He walks down the vacant streets of Argentina and tries to find his place. In every situation where he has to introduce himself he uses a different name a different identity.The Other is a very quiet film. There's not much of dialog and not much happen in it. It's very minimalistic. But this makes the visual narrative even more important. The director let's us observe on our own and make our own interpretations. Ten minutes in and you will notice something unusual about the camerawork. The camera isn't moving it doesn't follow the characters. This can be interpreted philosophically. The camera stays still it takes distance to the main character. It just shows him walking down the streets movement but the camera itself doesn't move. So what we see is a man walking but not really moving forward. His life stays still. He is a prisoner of this stable situation that he cannot detach from. It's quite interesting to see if he'll find a solution? Will he be able to detach from his stable life?So who is The Other? Is it the man's other identity or is it the other father? Is it the man he never came? The shots of The Other are very beautiful. The man walking the empty streets filling an empty chair. Beautiful film I must say. I will probably remember The Other from its minimalism It doesn't have music at all the dialog is marginal and it doesn't have a certain climax. I will also remember the good cinematography which let the viewer to observe think and get satisfied by the solutions.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm thinking maybe Cordero de Dios and La mujer sin cabeza two of the most important Argentinean films of last year may have taken a bit of inspiration from El otro writerdirector Ariel Rotter's tale of desperation and loneliness. The visual search with accentuated and well framed still cameras the apparent nothingness of the events that take place usually confused with the term 'boring' speak well of Rotterin terms of a filmmaker with something to say and recall the movies previously mentioned.But the visual search here is clearer than in Cordero de Dios and the situation that leads to the 'journey' of the protagonist Juan Juio Chvez is less specified than in La mujer sin cabeza. In both aspects El otro seems to be a riskier picture a picture that is less willing to help the viewer solve its mysteries. And when I say 'journey' I mean not only the journey we see Juan experience on screen but also the one he's living inside and don't forget a journey of the senses for the viewerA journey where the viewer is obliged to think.Suddenly Juan an apparently calm lawyer seems to run away from the comfort of his daily life. He finds out his wife's pregnant he arrives home and we see him staring at her feet an image that's recurrent throughout the film then he visits his sick father Osvaldo Bonet and tells him he'll not be with him the next day because of a business trip. When we see Juan on the bus before leaving he looks sweaty and tired. If you pay attention you may conclude he's scared.And the journey begins. Why? How is it possible? Is there something more than the sudden news? With the car crash suffered by Vero Mara Onetto who also plays a small role here Lucrecia Martel made it easier for the viewer delivering somethingsomewhere precise to depart from and showing us her inner circle of people. About Juan we know nothing and it's to Rotter's credit that we follow the actions of this boringand maybe boredman with a lot of interest for more than an hour.I was never quite sure where Juan went for his business trip but the movie doesn't want us to know about that particular place and its people. The only thing the movie wants from that place is that it appears as virtually deserted and has something appealing enough so Juan decides to stay for more than one day. The rest is improvisation or it may all be a dream. Sudden convenient deaths beautiful improbable women two or more hotels also virtually deserted Juan walking in the dark night with his black suit his fear our fear. The morning peace.With this title role Julio Chavz completes the 'silence' trilogy started with Extrao and El custodio. Far away from the pretentious objectives of the first film and with a lot of more room to talk than in the second one Chvez finds in Juan a natural balance and exploits it achieving the best performance of the three. Some elements are the same we are never sure of who the man is what his intentions are and of course the silence but the director's concept is more wellrounded than in the previous pieces and it comes to light in the actor's work.Let's never forget that cinema is many things and making us think can't be something to underestimate. When Juan is all by himself at a funeral without knowing exactly why he's there when he's standing watching the coffin in his black suit I thought about a chapter in Albert Camus' L'Etranger. There the main character expressed his inside thoughts of how he felt in a similar situation.I think Juan was saying those same things or maybe not. What do you think?".

This is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a lick of inspiration I felt nothing for the story or its characters.El Otro was made only for the sake of making a film... making it forgetful. I would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good Argentinian films look for films by Sorin.".

Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit.

Second some of you may be used to fast reactions to conflicts and the sometimes violent retribution many movies contain. Third you may be young. I am old and have had friends who had affairs some who wanted to and didn't. I have seen many happy marriages and many lonely sad marriages. I found the movie honest and extremely well acted. The husband had all the rage anger and desire to kill the lover until he got to know him. The lover at first glance is smug a playboy easy to hate. But in the end the husband sees the lover for the deeply sincere but flawed man he is. He finally sees himself as his dead wife had seen him more than the boring software engineer. He is better than that. The lover is much less than a rival but they deeply loved the same woman. The husband realizes how really devastated the lover is and how his wife had loved and deserved both men in her life. As life usually is there was poetic justice. She died a painful death after hurting her husband. He finally forgave and found peace. The lover was forgiven often a reason for shame his secrets open to those around him. He lost the woman he loved and a women who loved him for what was inside not the phony outward role he played. You know he will never find that again. There is a lot going on in this movie all under the surface. I kept wondering if it would revert to the standard murder scenario that was the suspense for me. The outcome was real not Hollywood.".

That is what you get from the trailer however the trailer is incredibly misleading the story doesn't pan out like that. Not even close. But what really ruined this movie for me was the direction. Most of the scenes seemed glued together. You're watching a scene and all of a sudden you're watching something completely different and you're left wondering if you missed the last 10 minutes of the film. The reason why the film is like that is because the director introduced a twist near the end but until that moment nothing makes sense and when the reveal finally comes it's a terrible letdown. This premise and cast on someone's else hands could have been something great. Unfortunately all Richard Eyre's was able to do was a boring and poorly executed movie.510".

The scenes where the two men pay chess and the dialog over the board are revealing and the torment subtly played by Neeson is masterful. Banderas and Neeson are superb in this movie which is both a mystery and a psychological thriller all filmed with exquisite attention to light and atmosphere in Italy and England.

The acting's good and both Liam Neeson and Laura Linney carry the plot well. Antonio Banderas plays a less rounded role but still does so enjoyably.Definitely a film worth watching.";

You are taken on a journey focusing on Peter his wife being the essential background to the story with his wife's lover the foil on which they both tread.If you're looking for a stereotypical Hollywood scorned husband movie move along you'll find no joy here. This is real life in content pace and dialogue. It's not boring its not slow and it is captivating. I dare any man who has been cheated on by the love of their life not to be deeply moved by this film. The same probably goes for women. As the story unfolds there's another group of people that will be moved and that's for you to discover.The ending is how it should be given the subject matter  some level of completion. And there's plenty to talk about afterwards. I'd love to say more but that would be giving away too much.Great acting by all though Liam Neeson has and holds firmly the centre stage.I give this a low end of 910 if that's possible. Enjoy!".

There is a similarity with TAKEN in that Neeson is a pursuer on the European continent relentless and determined although this time he had the female head of security at his work to help him go on the trail of Banderas in Milan. Terrific shots of Milan especially when Ralph walks across the Piazza to the Chess Cafe. Don't think the story jumps too much or too fast just enough for us to work things out. The ending got me stumped though not sure how a man he was going to kill ended up pushing the hospital bed of the wife and being present at the wake but I liked the creation of the character played by Banderas who we might have thought to be a business executive but was in fact a nobody opportunist. Fascinating analysis of emotion between Peter and Ralph in the dialogue exchanges. Reminded me of another similar love triangle which NeesonBanderas made a couple of years ago am I mistaken? cos I cant remember the title and in a way Neeson kind of played a pursuer also in Five Minutes of Heaven another glorious film showing Neesons talents. Must agree with earlier comment that the scene at the office going a bit crazy and asking for the gun was overplayed but it didn't spoil the film. thanks for the comment pointing out some of the filming was done in Ely. A very watchable thriller and not at all predictable. Plenty of talking points.".

And not only that how little it makes sense as well.I got the film because of Liam Neeson and Antonio Banderas whom I thought would be a good combination. The blurbs on the DVD box mentioned plot twists aplenty so I settled down for what I thought would be a great film.Well after an hour I was wondering when and where those plot twists were going to happen. And when the story would finally get into high gear. After 90 minutes I kept thinking the same thing. But then the movie had been over for like 5 minutes.Many scenes in the film made no sense like Banderas being discovered as a janitor in the apartment building by Neeson. Then Banderas character's deception in showing Neeson on a later visit a very luxurious apartment in the building and saying that this is really where he lives when he is in town. This makes no sense !!! Those 2 scenes seem to be from 2 different movies. The jig is up with the first discovery and Banderas' character can't be stupid enough to not realize that Neeson knows he is just the janitor as he discovered when he entered his basement apartment.The movie seems filled with these moments of pure nonsense to stretch the running time if not the credibility of the film.Like the party scene at the end. Why did all the other characters from the film show up there ? Anyone with an ounce of decency would have said sorry I am not getting involved here.And the daughter showing up in Milan right next to Neeson in one scene is ludicrous beyond belief. How did she manage to get there the exact second Neeson does ??? The movie is incredibly slow moving as if to make you think about what is going on but it only leaves one puzzled as to why nothing is going on in the first place.I will grant one thing of the movie and that is that it looks very nice. it did make me want to visit Milan.But a 90minute commercial is not what I wanted to watch. Actually a 81minute film as this is a very very short film. It just looks and feels like it lasts forever.In the bonus features on the DVD neeson mentions he thought he was wrong for the part. I dunno if he usually follows his first instinct but after watching this I hope next time he doesn't get talked into doing something if he thinks he is not right for it.This dreadful film is going back to the DVD store first thing in the morning.M.".

Needless to say this is a movie that proves once more that I tend to enjoy movies that critics seem to tear apart. I was absolutely fascinated by Liam Neeson's growing obsession of getting revenge on Banderas for having an affair with his widowed wife it was intense and quite thrilling. But what I loved even more was the face to face sequences that Neeson and Banders had they were heartfelt and emotional. This movie goes to show us how dangerous and hurtful affairs can be and how the hurt one receives from it can lead you into an obsession of darkness.Performances. Liam Neeson is utterly brilliant here. He was a man on a mission and his intense performance had me on the edge of my seat it's one of my favorite performances of his. Antonio Banderas is equally as good as the slick yet caring character who wants Neeson's wife's heart his charisma and charm is hard to beat. Laura Linney is great in her screen time as the widowed wife I felt for her even if she was wrong.Bottom line. The Other Man will stay with you for a while when it's all over. Don't be fooled by the somewhat lowish rating this is an excellent movie on all accounts and I classify it as a must watch!.8 12 10".

No nothing uncomfortable in here. There will be a bombshell almost near the end. Deal with it. We all had to.To have Liam Neeson and Antonio Banderas in a movie together is pure gold and the performances by the rest of the cast are extremely well done. It's kind of hard to talk about the story without giving the bombshell away. Many will say it was predictable and that's a copout as yes there is nothing new under the sun. But it's all in the telling and that is why we watch. We know the outcomes of most stories but again it's in the telling that counts. And this one is good in the telling. And also there is some suspense and tension and those are needed for a good story. At times you really are not sure where this is going and you may find yourself holding your breath. The only complaint I have are the flashbacks. Until we really get to know the characters we are not sure if we are in the present or are taken back in time. But we catch on we usually do. But a different color filter could be used for flashbacks and we would quickly know we are in a flashback. Hey I'm just saying. This probably went straight to DVD because there were no explosions shootings unbelievable stunts or the almost everpresent CGI. Hey it's a love story. Violence No. Sex No but you see positions for. Nudity Yes. Language Yes briefly in the beginning".

	schema:reviewBody "Liam Neeson tries to find out about Antonio Banderas the man who was having an affair with his wife played by Laura Linney. Good small scale film from Richard Eyre that is more the cinematic equivalent of a meaty short story. Based on a short story this is a film that mimics the the feel and texture of the short narrative that seems to have fallen out of favor these days. Personally I was initially put off by the film because it didn't behave as I thought it should. I wasn't willing to give myself over to the rhythms of the film which was a mistake since the film moves and behaves in its own literary way. What you think is going on is not what is going on and everything isn't revealed until the end. It wasn't until some time around the hour mark that the film suddenly clicked with me and not only did I start to enjoy it but I also realized that my fighting it had kind of lessened the experience since I had missed so man little bits that I will now have to go back and rewatch the film to fully get the full effect. If you want an intelligent film and decry the lack of smart films this is it just don't be like me and fail to embrace it when you see it. I have to say that this is extremely well acted I don't know when Banderas was last this great. Neeson is just as good as is the rest of the cast but its Banderas who truly shines here and its quite possible that you have to go all the way back to his days in Spain to find a film role that allows him to really shine and expose his acting chops. I really liked this a great deal and recommend it to anyone wanting a meaty small film that is intelligently made. Though I will be honest and say that it is possible that I admire this more than I like it. We'll see how I feel when I see it again".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking at the cast of The Other Man you could consider in buying this film Liam Nesson Antonio Banderas Laura Linney and Romola Garai. The movie delivers? Yes. All that much? No. And if you consider that this was directed by Richard Eyre who directed great ensemble casts in Iris and Notes on a Scandal there are things that makes of The Other Man an inferior film than this two examples.Neeson plays Peter a man married with a beautiful wife Linney that discover that she hides from him a long affair with Ralph pronunced Rafe played by Banderas. What Peter does? Tracks down this man in Italy and tries to see who he really is and what his wife saw in that men. His first idea is to kill this guy but he's always reluctant so he keeps on playing games with his guy who seems to love Peter's wife very much.The whole drama pretending to be a thriller goes well it makes the story interesting until the ending which is quite disappointing and a little bit unexpected. But if you think I can buy the idea that these two guys reveal part of their lives to each other during chess games matches well I did not buy it. And if they were drunk maybe but that was not the case. Two unknown figures sharing their romantic passages of their lives with the same woman is something unbelievable or perhaps it's just me who likes to play the mysterious guy in front of other people so it's very difficult to make me really share something of this kind of nature. This scenes were great interesting dialog except for some angered reaction of Neeson throwing the pieces away after losing a match.It's a very psychological work about how one can deal with adultery different reactions might come from the audience it's very interesting the way Peter does that changing his persona all the way through this chase after his wife's lover. It's a great material for passionate people who can't forget a betrayal and feel a need to do something about it. This film will make that kind of people think again just like Peter changed his mind in the course of the story. The acting is decent the cast is at their best considering the material they were giving. More complexity more realism and more thrilling moments instead of some bits here and there would make this film better. 710".

A suspense film should keep the viewer in the dark or thinking in one direction until a little twist changes the story that has been unfolding on a different level. That is what THE OTHER MAN does and it is a pleasure to be surprised in this way. Peter Liam Neeson is a successful business man whose wife Lisa Laura Linney is a successful and high profile shoe designer. He spends much of his life in her shadow but the marriage works for them both and they obviously love each other and their young rambunctious daughter Abigail Romola Garai who is attached to the somewhat hippie strange George Craig Parkinson. Lisa's office comrades  Ralph Patterson Joseph and Vera Pam Ferris  are supportive of both Peter and Lisa and the world seems balanced. Very early in the film Lisa departs for Milan for another showing of her shoes but she doesn't return. Peter grows suspicious when he discovers insinuating email messages from a man named Ralph and once he discovers this Ralph is not her office comrade he sets out on a mission to find the source of his wife' surprise infidelity. He discovers pictures taken in a special hotel in Milan pictures that reveal photos of 'Ralph' Antonio Banderas in intimate situations with Lisa. Peter travels to Milan with the intent to kill Ralph stalks him and discovers his pastime of playing chess in a little Milanese caf. And this is where Schlink and Eyre change the twist of the story and Ralph is not at all whom he appears to be nor is the direction of Peter's vengeance as focused as we expected. It is this crucial turn of storyline that make this film so endearing and to suggest even slightly the final moments of this film would destroy the suspense so well written and directed and acted. Neeson Linney Banderas and Garai are all splendid in these difficult roles  Linney continues to mature as an actress while becoming ever more beautiful in countenance. This is a tightly drawn suspense tale and well worth the attention of the public unafraid to think along with the development of the story. Grady Harp".

I mean I didn't think it would be the kind of flick to win an Academy Award or anything but I thought it would at least be a solidly written story but it wasn't...and it shows! I have been a little disappointed in what I've been seeing from Liam Neeson lately...I didn't like this movie and I didn't like Unknown either. I hope he starts picking scripts a little bit better before I start having seconds thoughts about seeing his movies.He's a great actor but he's just not been picking the best scripts lately which is weird because normally his movies are pretty damn good! Anyway in conclusion I'd say avoid this movie. It's a real letdown. Liam's usually an effective actor but this script just holds him back from really being able to do anything.".

I guess the only reason I did was because I hoped it would get better but it never did.I would highly recommend avoiding this movie. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was in it. I mean I didn't think it would be the kind of flick to win an Academy Award or anything but I thought it would at least be a solidly written story but it wasn't...and it shows! I have been a little disappointed in what I've been seeing from Liam Neeson lately...I didn't like this movie and I didn't like Unknown either. I hope he starts picking scripts a little bit better before I start having seconds thoughts about seeing his movies.He's a great actor but he's just not been picking the best scripts lately which is weird because normally his movies are pretty damn good! Anyway in conclusion I'd say avoid this movie. It's a real letdown. Liam's usually an effective actor but this script just holds him back from really being able to do anything.";

After seeing this I was reminded of his recent role in the Stepford Wives remake and had to wonder why he's resorting to such trash because he's just as talented almost anyway as De Niro and Pacino and the difference is he wasted a lot of this during the '80s and '90s by taking on small bits in horrible films. I mean in 2003 he starred in KANGAROO JACK. C'mon!Overall THE ANDERSON TAPES is a tense and unique crime thriller that although very 70sish is entertaining if a bit outdated in terms of technology. I'm sure it will be remade some day there's a lot of potential however I doubt it'll ever come close to the original.45".

Duke however doesn't realize that he and just about everyone else involved in the plan are under surveillance by a multitude of government agencies who are following their every move. 'The Anderson Tapes' is an entertaining and tough little thriller full of humour and originality and with an almost 'Conversation'like feel to it  a movie it predated by three years incidentally.

The beauty of the tapes is that in the end because Anderson goes through with this elaborate robbery all of the agencies have to erase these tapes flushing all of the evidence against Anderson that would sink him big time.  In the end therefore all of Anderson's helpers are dead and he's the only one who gets to tell a story.  He wore a mask during the caper so in order to convict him of doing anything the law is going to have a difficult time.  If only they had all of those tapes videos and pictures!  A twist is that there still seem to be tapes made by Dyan's boyfriend but he already said that he doesn't care if Anderson robs the joint.  But the cops saw the recorded and listened via it to hear Anderson panting in the room.  But they have no idea that Anderson was living there or that the boyfriend has tapes of the entire caper planning by Anderson.  So the cops miss these tapes too.

Most of it is shot in a realistic style. But there is more to it the absurdity of it all is pushed much further and converts realism into surrealism. This is the story of Anderson a guy who gets out of prison after having served a long spell behind bars. Before he leaves he makes a short speech in which he declaims his philosophy. The essence of it Everybody steals and therefore everybody has a right to steal. He steps into freedom gets directly to his former lover's elegant apartment house off Central Park looks around a bit and instantly makes the big decision concerning his future life He will burglarise all apartments in this house in one big sweep and live on what the fence will pay him for the loot for the rest of his life. Anderson seems to be a direct descendant of the Coen Brother's Ed Crane in The Man Who Wasn't There. And Sean Connery gives a performance as convincing as Billy Bob Thornton. Anderson made a decision  period. He will bear all the consequences however bloody they will get. And funny enough there are people who think the idiotic scheme might be a success. Anderson has authority and leader qualities he gets financial backing from an oddball son of a big time mobster and can form a team of more oddballs for the burglary including a very young Christopher Walken. So eventually Anderson drives up to the apartment house with a huge removal truck remember this is not filmed in the style of a comedy!.I do not want to give away the whole story. Only this much The viewer sees people on both sides of the law engaged in heavy duty physical exertion. You can laugh and at the same time feel sorry for the poor fellows. The whole enterprise ends in utter disaster for the burglars. Towards the end of the story there is much police present on the street around the apartment house. You can observe ambulance personnel relaxedly unfolding bed linen for their stretchers in front of the Guggenheim. Then some of the gangsters try to make a getaway in a car. The engine roars and the car crashes and overturns after a few yards. This is all filmed very undramatically from a distance in a matter of fact way without musical soundtrack. It could almost be a documentary.The low key style of the movie heightens the absurdity of the story strengthens the message and make The Anderson Tapes a memorable experience. There is a very good electronic musical score by Quincy Jones which to my ears still sounds modern funky and futuristic.".

There is a very good electronic musical score by Quincy Jones which to my ears still sounds modern funky and futuristic.";

And with good reason it was the first film for which he both drew good reviews and clicked with the public not playing James Bond. Connery could finally be taken seriously as an actor not just an international sex symbol.The film itself draws from elements found in The Asphalt Jungle and The Desperate Hours. There's no planner character in this film Connery himself is both the planner and enforcer in the crew he's put together for a job. But he does need a backer and that's where organized crime boss Alan King comes in.Connery is a Duke Anderson a con just recently released from prison and he's got some attitudes similar to that other Connery character from Family Business has Jesse McMullen. Not surprising since both films were directed by Sidney Lumet. Like McMullen he feels that stealing is the most honorable profession going if you're not a hypocrite since all successful people engage in some kind of crookedness. And since he's done the full ten year bit with no parole and no strings attached to him there isn't anything that the criminal justice system can do to him.When he sees how well former girl friend Dyan Cannon is doing as someone's kept woman in a very ritzy apartment on New York's Upper East Side Connery conceives a plan to take down the whole building. And bit by bit he assembles his crew.Young Christopher Walken gets his first big screen role of notice as a young convict released with Connery from the joint. Another con released at the same time is Stan Gottlieb who's spent most of his life in stir and is thoroughly institutionalized. With his character Lumet makes a powerful statement about institutional acclamation in Gottlieb's case it's an act of cruelty almost to let him out in society he knows no other way of life.Since there's a lot of merchandise to move from these rich folk's apartments Connery needs someone along who knows the value and how to get the best value when fencing. Martin Balsam who's an antique dealer and fence on the side gets brought in on the job itself. Balsam has one of the earliest post Stonewall portrayals of a gay man and while sadly he does conform to stereotype still it's a fine piece of work. And he's crushing out on Connery big time.Alan King makes an unusual condition on Connery. He wants the crew to take along mob hood Val Avery on the job and arrange for his demise on same. Avery is something of a loose cannon the powers that be want him eliminated without their fingerprints on it. When Avery arrives you can see why he's such a liability. He's an out and out racist and drivers Garrett Morris and Dick Williams would gladly do it for nothing.Connery and his crew take the entire exclusive apartment building hostage just like the family in The Desperate Hours. And the film itself has an Asphalt Jungle feel to it both in the planning stage and in how it all turns out.The title comes from the fact that several government agencies are actually taping this whole proceeding from many different angles the FBI the IRS Immigration etc. But since it's all quite illegal none of them can really step in to put a halt to the criminal enterprise. It's a nice touch but quite superfluous the film works beautifully as a straight out caper film.Sean Connery and the rest of the cast play this thing to perfection. Two of the best performances are from a pair of little old ladies the shocked Margaret Hamilton and feisty Judith Lowry who just loves being taken hostage and robbed it's the most excitement she's had in years.As for Connery he could finally put James Bond to rest after just one more film. His next role 007 in Diamonds Are Forever.".

It was directed by Sidney Lumet who has done some fine New York City stories  Serpico The Pawnbroker  and the cast includes people like Sean Connery Martin Balsam and Christopher Walken. How could it go wrong? Well it doesn't go wrong  exactly. The first half though looks a lot like an ordinary caper movie. Connery is just out of jail and assembles and finances a handful of experts to rob an entire highend apartment house of every valuable in every flat.Lumet and his writers have even inserted a bit of humor largely based on Martin Balsam's gay interior decorator and Balsam is great in the role. He's given a couple of witty lines and moues that never quite go over the top though they approach it. Ralph Meeker as Delaney the police captain in charge really DOES go over the top with his machineprocessed workingclass New York accent. There's ironic humor too in the incremental revelation that three of the conspirators are being covertly watched by three independent lawenforcement agencies none of whom know about the others Walken because the Narcs are interested in him the black driver because he's a Black Panther and the mobster who is providing the money because he's  well he's Italian. Not that the records play any part in the story which is all the more reason for a talented guy like Quincy Jones to have avoided all those screeching electronic noises on the sound track.But Lumet is a tragedian at heart. He ends few of his movies happily a tendency he shares with some other directors and writers like Roman Polanski and Stephen King. The last half of the film has the robbery crew hurrying about their business in the apartment house not realizing the crime has already been detected the street sealed off by police and a Special Tactical Police Unit or whatever it's called is already rappelling down the side of the edifice. There is a climactic shoot out in which people are realistically killed.Lumet has directed this uncertain story with noticeable skill. He intercuts long scenes of the preparation and execution of the robbery with briefer scenes of witnesses describing that happened to them. There are also cuts to the postcrime events involving police on the street. At first we're unsure of what's going on in the background except that we notice a lot of bustle. With each cut it becomes increasingly clear that what's going on is that dead bodies are being removed and put into an ambulance so the audience only gradually becomes aware of the fact that the ending is going to be melancholy.But in asking the viewer to make the leap from the assembly of a comic caper crew into tragedy Lumet is asking a lot. Let me put it this way Sean Connery is not the kind of actor who should be shot in the back and die.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walken's 1971 debut film role was a major part that hooked me as a lifelong fan immediately as The Kid directed by Sidney Lumet in a gem adapted for the film from a great book of the same name by author Lawrence Sanders  The Anderson Tapes. I'm not an avid reader but I did read most of Sander's mystery novels and would rate this as one of his best. It's worth mentioning that the only memorable quote from this movie on this web site is a Christopher Walken line! He brought an electrifying presence to the role with his trademark edginess akin to a cocked revolver.The movie stars Sean Connery Dyan Cannon Alan King and Martin Balsam in a beautifully restrained role as a lightintheloafers antiques dealer. I'm sure viewers of this film following its release must have considered the addition to the cast by The Kid as a wonderful bonus. The locale of the film is NYC's Central Park perimeter namely the highpriced real estate at the park's border.Besides being a prePC in both contexts of PC satire of technology and man's inability to control its sometimes obvious sinister applications it is also an ironic precursor to the authorities' myopic interpretation of gathered intelligence data specifically the current federal administration's inability to connect the dots after receiving Richard Clark's distribution of the pre9112001 FBI memo detailing the intercepted intention of Arab terrorists to fly jumbo jets into skyscrapers and other federal buildings. Who would have or should have thought they might try to complete their failed 1993 attempt to bring down one of the WTC towers? On a lighter note Garrett Morris acted in this film with Walken a full 4 years before his SNL run site of some of Christopher Walken's most memorable gigs.".

Using clever plot twists and a heavy dose of irony there is a subtly comedic quality to what might otherwise be just another violent cops and robbers flick.

The mobster played superbly by Alan King combines sheer brutality with hilarious selfmockery  a real antidote to the ponderous kind of viciousness one sees in the contemporary Godfather pictures.  Indeed the sense of humor later seen in The Freshman 1990 and in the recent TV series The Sopranos offers many examples of this now popular genre.Much more could be said in support of this excellent film which in my book is a 9 on a scale of ten.".

The gimmick to the story as is made abundantly clear from the outset is that released felon Connery's every move and utterance is being taped not only by the authorities but also by the jealous sugar daddy of his callgirl lover Dyan Cannon in the end thwarting his bigidea plan to clean out every flat in a luxury complex of their occupants' rich pickings.The improbability of the story is its biggest stumbling block. Despite having mob connections you don't comprehend just why Connery merits such official attention which added to the coincidence of Cannon's surveillance too stretches credulity way too far. In other ways a determinedly adultoriented film especially the scenes between Connery and Cannon in bed and the casual violence of the heist itself it wants to be gritty and grown up at the same time attempting to be modern and clever with various showy directorial techniques assorted flashbacks stopstart sequencing but in the end it all fails to gel and underachieves with too many inconsequential scenes and thinlydrawn characterisations at its heart. The robbery itself attempts to impose some forced and unwelcome humour by highlighting the individual quirks of the intended victims which include a disabled computer whizzkid an ancient but feisty old woman and a warring couple but this just comes across as distasteful and glosses over the real horror and violation I'm sure any ordinary citizen would feel at the situation they endure.The acting is mixed Connery seemingly miscast as the Limey he'd hate that leader of the motley crew he gathers around him for the job amongst whom only Martin Balsam as a waytoofar overthetop homosexual and a young Christopher Walken as a savvy newkidontheblock shine. Dyan Cannon is wasted in an underwritten role and is mainly required it seems to be something for Connery to nuzzle up to.No not the greatest of caper films and not the strongest item in the careers of Messrs Lumet and Connery.

Once you become engaged with the film you'll find it's a surprisingly good movie.Technology despite the lowtech portrayal here plays a central role in Anderson's undoing. He puts together a team that does things 'the old fashioned way'  masks blowtorches con men  and he's undone by tape recorders and a child with a ham radio.Lots of reasons for people who are interested in films to see this one and it won't disappoint them.";

	schema:reviewBody "Along the same lines as but not quite as good as The Thomas Crown Affair and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three this quirky heist drama manages to hold the attention and entertain despite some slow points and the unavoidable datedness of its trappings.  Connery revealing his natural pate after having donned toupees for his role as James Bond and other films is a recently released convict who is barely out the door before he's planning his next caper.  First stop is exgirlfriend Cannon's luxury apartment where she is all too willing to give him everything she's got both physical and material even at the risk of losing her sugar daddyjohn Shull.  He decides to clean out the whole building of it's valuables with the assistance of various crime characters.  He calls upon fellow excons Walken in his screen debut and Gottlieb along with feminine antique dealer Balsam in a outrageous uncharacteristic performance! and a couple of others. After careful preparation and the aide of gangster King in a showy part the men go about stripping the building clean with varied resistance from it's motley band of tenants several of whom were noted TV performers at the time andor afterwards.  From the opening of the film Connery is taped by all sorts of surveillance cameras and is revealed to be in the state of being recorded by any and all varieties of agencies and individuals for one reason or another.  This gives the film an eerie Big Brother feel at times even if the concept isn't always completely followed through upon. Many of these moments are punctuated by the innovative but occasionally irritating musical sounds of composer Quincy Jones.  This is a film that has more lurking beneath the surface than one expects from a heist thriller. It's filled with unexpected moments and irony and invites closer inspection of it's themes.  However it's also a rather downbeat affair and will likely not suit everyone's tastes.  The biggest surprise is Balsam.  A reliably normal character actor in multitudinous films here he is a flaming lascivious queen with a riotous wig borrowed from the Diamonds Are Forever set? and heavily mascaraed eyelashes.  He provides the bulk of the film's humor through his committed yet outre performance.  It takes some getting used to but in the end he has truly created a memorable persona.  Cannon exists mainly to slough around in flimsy outfits and bed down with Connery.  Meeker shows up near the end to give a bizarre yet strangely entertaining performance as a police chief though his approach doesn't always gel with the material.  Saturday Night Live fans will be stunned to find Morris in a straight part as a SWAT member.  It's interesting to see where technology was in 1971 and to see the attitudes and preconceptions of what people thought gays were Balsam is not the only one in the movie.  The film does make effective use of flashback and nonlinear storytelling.  It's just lacking that one little spark to make it a classic in the same league as several others from this genre.".

The first half delivers exactly what a crime drama needs smooth dialogues colorful characters and a fair amount of tension. Then we get the actual heist which suffers a bit from flat direction and is just plain overlong. These guys sure love to take their sweet time for everything I know they don't want to cause panic but seriously take everything and run. The plan makes little sense anyway. The subplot with the government spying on everyone seems a bit redundant and could have been left out altogether. It's pretty irrelevant and it has no effect on the story developments. This movie is still fun to watch though mainly because of the actors. Sean Connery delivers a particularly charismatic performance as the bad guy with the heart of gold and an amazingly young Christopher Walken only sweetens the deal. I also enjoy the visual style of this movie then again I enjoy the visual style of every 70s crime movie. The heist genre has better things to offer but this is a pretty enjoyable piece of work.".

I can understand why Connery would want to reimage himself especially since his time as James Bond was approaching its end. What I have a hard time understanding is why he would choose such a poor movie to do it with. Here he plays Duke Anderson  a career criminal who has just been released from prison and immediately begins plotting his next job  robbing the six wealthy residents of the apartment house in which his prostitute girlfriend played by Dyan Cannon in a role that accomplished little except to give a sort of logical reason why this place would be targeted lives. He puts together a team made up partly of guys he knew on the inside partly of old cronies from the outside and one guy from the local mob. Throughout the movie it seems as though everyone's being taped thus the title  but to no end since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever. And in the end I wondered about the police  it looked like half the NYPD was on this job!I thought this movie was poorly written poorly acted and poorly paced. It's hopelessly dated reeking of the 70's and with an absolutely dreadful musical score. It lost me right from the beginning with the silly scene of Anderson's last group therapy session in prison. It was dull throughout  a total waste of time. 110".

A young Christopher Walken struts around in his film debut. I am not a big fan of Dyan Cannon. So the film could have used a sexier heroine. The film is also about the increasing use of surveillance in American society during the 60s and the 70s. Though the dark ending which seems to emphasize surveillance as one of the film's major themes was not that convincing. Quincy Jones catchy title score gets the film off to a great start. The editing deserves special mention  the way they cut from the heist scenes to the hostages talking to the police was special. I think Spike Lee might have been inspired by The Anderson Tapes when he edited The Inside Man. This film is cruelly underrated at 6.4. My 9 rating should help it on its way up.".

The Dutch word for dice is 'dobbelsteen' or dicingstone so that the simile of dice and chance can be extended to stones and chance. This explains the significance of Anton meeting his first wife while visiting the Stone of Scones.The book more strongly than the film is also constructed as a Greek tragedy with a prologue five acts and then an epilogue.Anton Steenwijk is also interesting himself he represses the events of the assault but it keeps coming back at him. But he is an anaesthetist in more than one way  he puts his memories to sleep. Even in the final stages when the story is already quite clear to him he uses drugs at his house in Tuscany and seeks to ease a toothache in Amsterdam before going to the Ban the Bomb demonstration.Personally I think the book was translated into a film in brilliant fashion.

I suppose they were clearing out the warehouse and a copy of THE ASSAULT got tossed into my order as a freebie.It sat around ignored for a few months and then one afternoon I got bored and needed something to read.Wow. Straight through in one sitting.Some time later with no advertising or promotion of any kind THE ASSAULT showed up in a local theater.Because of the total lack of promotion this film is probably the greatest sleeper of the decade. It probably only played in the US at Art houses and a very small number of other theaters. Anyone who has encountered the work of Satre or Camus will find themselves right at home with this film. It's deep involved and engrossing... it shows that no one no matter how close they are to an event knows EVERYTHING about it.Young Anton Steenwjik is the sole survivor of the brutal murder of his entire family by German troops and the burning of his home in Occupied Holland. The troops did it as retribution for a killing of a collaborator carried out by the local Dutch Underground Resistance cell in front of the Steenwjik home. Anton was there and he saw it all... but it takes a 20 year odyssey that stretches across most of Northern Europe for him to learn the WHOLE truth about that night and it's horrendous events. Therein lies the tale. And it's a tale that's well worth watching.Even tho I promised spoilers in this I will NOT give you the BIG one... the most unexpected and ironic Gotcha I've ever seen in a movie.A VERY HIGHLY recommended film! If you get the chance SEE IT!I'm updating my comments after the fact.I recently saw the videotape version of the movie and found myself somewhat disappointed... nay OUTRAGED... by it.In an attempt to trim the film to fit on standard length tape stock I suppose the VHS videotape version makes a cut which for me is FATAL... they cut the entire end of Anton's chance meeting with Fake Ploog's son. That 30 second or so edit completely changes the feeling and meaning of the entire sequence completely destroying the delicate balance that the director put into the theatrical release version.If anyone reads this who is involved with a possible future DVD release of THE ASSAULT... I beg of you... PLEASE... NO EDITING!!!This film is carefully put together like a fine watch. If you remove ANYTHING it's not going to work right!!! ".

De Aanslag is a movie like this.De Aanslag isn't necessarily about WW II but more about the effects of it on a persons life and why things happen the way they do and how little things can effect a persons life for ever. Most of the movie's story is set in the years after WW II and uses flashbacks of things that happened in WW II to make more things clear and to show things from a different perspective from different individuals that were involved in the incident were the movie is about. It becomes more and more clear what happened at the night that collaborator Ploeg was killed but the Dutch resistance and more importantly why things happened the way it happened. The story also shows a detailed view of the Netherlands and their citizens the years and decades after WW II and how it still affected many.There are many great returning characters in the story and the acting is for especially Dutch standards pretty high. Derek de Lint who now is better know world wide for his role as Derek Rayne in Poltergeist The Legacy is a great leading man that really carries the movie.The cinematography from Theo van de Sande who later did the cinematography for the movie hit Blade is great and sets a nice mood. The directing by Fons Rademakers is done wonderfully and it never makes the movie hard to follow even though at times it gets a bit complicated.Great Dutch Oscar winning drama with some memorable moments and a fantastic ending were everything comes together and gets clear.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The film has of course certain things which are better than the book for instance it is more exciting but then again the film also has it's downsides for sometimes the acting is not that great. But overall the better and worse things level each other out so my verdicts for book and film are the same pretty good.If you like Mulisch's books and are interested in World War 2 read De Zaak 4061.7 out of 10".

The film has of course certain things which are better than the book for instance it is more exciting but then again the film also has it's downsides for sometimes the acting is not that great. But overall the better and worse things level each other out so my verdicts for book and film are the same pretty good.If you like Mulisch's books and are interested in World War 2 read De Zaak 4061.7 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "Der Architekt is a German movie from 2008 so this one will have its 10th anniversary next year. It is the only full feature written and directed by prolific actress Ina Weisse and looking at what I saw in here I cannot really be too mad that the did not make more of these except the short films from early in her career. I do believe that she had a pretty solid cast in here that easily could have turned the film into something more memorable but the script of this 90minute movie just comes too short on many occasions. The film is mostly a drama but there is a moment here and there when the filmmaker goes for subtle and sometimes relatively dark comedy maybe to make it all a lighter watch. But these are the moments when the film is probably at its weakest as it really just feels for the sake of it. IOne example would be a scene about a character's leg that they made look like a sex scene for the laughs and giggles. And as for the drama it is hardly any better. It feels pretty disappointing to see an actor like Bierbichler who I think is quite talented wasted in scenes like him standing naked in a snow landscape. The scenery and setting is still among the better aspects of the film here as it adds a decent atmosphere at times but the cinematography is eventually also not good enough on its own to make up for all the other flaws here. Hller I usually also like more than in this one and we saw in Toni Erdmann what she is capable of a true powerhouse performance compared to this one. Schweighfer is one of the most if not the most overrated German actors and even if it's nice for once to see him play an entirely different character than in all his stupid romantic comedy dramas it also becomes painfully obvious how he is miscast for everything that requires dramatic depth and range and this includes this film here too. Nothing about Rois here is worthy of winning a German Film Award.This is a film about a father who needs to reflect on his life profession and relationships especially with his children. This is a subject that has been done many times and I dare say most times it was handled more interestingly and realistically than here. A missed opportunity really and if Weisse ever decides to make another film then I hope she has considerably stepped up since a decade ago. Don't watch.".

Why anyone insisted on him being an architect and then going that far to even name the film after his profession is way beyond me.Now I regret resisting the urge to switch it off after the first 20 minutes or so because I honestly believed that it would somehow begin to make some sense until the end. Instead I irreversibly wasted a good hour and a half of my life I could have spent way more productively like staring at en empty wall per instance.To sum it up this film has absolutely nothing to do with architecture. It could be classified as a family drama but the purpose of its existence escapes me.

This is especially sad because for various reasons it would have had a lot of potential  the book was a bestseller the author Reinhold Bilgeri himself directed the film and it is based on one of the worst avalanche catastrophes in the Alps.The film however never succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the book  or any atmosphere at all. Instead of focusing on the avalanche incident itself the plot concentrates entirely on the main character Erna and how she copes to integrate in an Austrian mountain village's society.The way this is presented makes it appear like it was directly taken out of a Rosamunde Pilcher novel or a film based on her novels. The stereotype characters engage in flat and meaningless dialogues. In combination with the superficial acting especially from the main characters the film often appears more like a German TV soap opera.This holds true for almost the entire runtime of the film an incredible 128 minutes. The avalanche incident itself is only portrayed in the last fifteen minutes and is yet again overshadowed by banal dialogue and drama.All in all a very unexciting film especially for its runtime. Most definitely not a runner for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.".

A drama about a woman that flees from her past into a mountain village to find love and encounter a horrible avalanche disaster in VorarlbergAustria.I saw this when it premiered on the Festspielbhne in Bregenz and I was quite impressed.Reinhold Bilgeri is an ambitious man and filmmaker. He wouldn t let go of this project he believed in it. And you can see that he put his heart and his family in it.From the very first scene the atmosphere of the book was on the screen. The pictures I had in mind when I read the lines were almost identical with what I saw there. Sure some of the actors were more talented than other but I think this didn't hurt the overall experience. Some of the people in the film were actually from the region and farmers in real life. Whats more believable than that? From technical aspects is Der Atem des Himmels comparable to big German productions despite the lowbudget. In the film the focus is more on the drama less on the avalanche. The story's between the people what Erna von Gaderthurn experiences. Titanic in the mountains with less water and more snow.I did especially like the performance of Reinholds daughter Laura Bilgeri. She s an upcoming star for sure.Overall I think you should give the film a shot and see it. It's the perfect example what man with a vision can achieve. And thats a lot!".

Along the way Dr. Bronowski stops to examine some of humanity's greatest accomplishments  and lowest depths. One outstanding quality of this remarkable series is that he speaks to the viewer directly and very personally through the lens of the camera the book of the same name is a virtual transcript of his remarks.Not simply lectures nor read from a script these extemporaneous essays offer Bronowski's personal view on a wide range of human scientific and technological history presented in both a dramatic and memorable fashion. For example the episodes are sprinkled with delightful and sometimes moving anecdotes of various people some of whom Bronowski knew and worked with  such as Leo Szilard who first conceived the concept of sustained nuclear fission  even coining the term chain reaction  and who subsequently wrote the letter which Einstein signed that was sent to FDR bringing about the Manhattan Project and John von Neumann one of the great mathematicians of the twentieth century and the Father of Electronic Computing.Anyone with even a passing interest in the history of our species and its place amongst the stars or of science in general will be astonished delighted deeply moved and profoundly affected by The Ascent of Man. The production value is of the highest order throughout and now in its second DVD incarnation the sound which was always somewhat problematic has been greatly improved matching the often stunning visuals.NOTE Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy both the sevenpart BBC miniseries Oppenheimer 1980 and their production of Michael Frayen's play Copenhagen 2002 both available on DVD.Highest possible recommendation.".

Jacob Bronowski does a fantastic job narrating Man's history through the ages.  Bronowski was a Jew who found refuge in England after the Nazis invaded his native Poland.  Indeed the most poignant movement in The Ascent of Man is when Bronowski visits a former concentration camp where many of relatives were done to death.  I had tears in my eyes when I watched that episode. Bronowski's friendship with great nuclear physicists like Leo Szilard enabled him to present a unique perspective on the nuclear age.  For example Bronowski reveals that Szilard conceived the atom bomb when he stopped his car at a stop light and says that is the only part he could not believe  Szilard always ran red lights!  Bronowski's account of Darwin and evolution and of Mendel and genetics are the best I have ever seen.The Ascent of Man paints on a huge canvas.  What else is suitable for depicting the history of Man?  The only criticism I have is that The Ascent of Man is rather Eurocentric.  It neglects the role of China and India in Man's progress though it acknowledges the Islamic influence on Europe.The program was made in 1973 yet it is not outdated.  In the last episode Bronowski prophetically hinted at the coming of the computer age  an age he would not live to see.  It is a pity that The Ascent of Man is not available on video.  Luckily the book version is still obtainable. Having read it I strongly recommend it.Reviewed by Sundar Narayan".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Sagan's Cosmos and before James Burke's Connections Jacob Bronowski brought us a thoughtful examination of the history of mankind and his achievements. The angle here was to look at how those achievements effected events and shaped society as a whole.I saw the series when it first aired and was fascinated by it but the series seemed nonlinear and I supposed to a young mind would seem disjointed. I still get some of that feeling when I rewatch episodes of this very good TV documentary.I'll also add that a lot of factual history is correct but I think Bronowski as a social scientist perhaps social psychologist draws some of the wrong conclusions. Then again social science like all sciences is a field of research branching from the major hard sciences so in this regard everyone is entitled to an opinion. The only way to nod or shake your head at Bronowski is to double check your own facts to see if he's right or not.Bronowski takes us from man's humble beginnings in Africa and shows us our primate ancestor's migratory pattern and how we populated the world today. But the real genius of the program is him showing us how our advances in understanding formed our civilization.I applaud the program but disagree with some of Bronowski's conclusions though for the supermajority of the series he does have things aright. If you've seen Sagan or Burke do their thing with their TV series then have a look at Bronowski's version from the early 70s. Definitely one to see for the scientist history buff in all of us.Enjoy.".

Its host is Jacob Bronowski a Polish born British based Jewish mathematician. Clearly an influence on Carl Sagan's Cosmos this was a sort of an answer to Kenneth Clark's great series Civilization which despite its title did not cover science but only art and only Western European art at that.The short brilliant Bronowski reminisces about his personal anecdotes with some of the greatest scientists and intellectuals of the 20th century like Enrico Fermi John Von Neumann Leo Szilard and Aldous Huxley. As did Sagan in Cosmos he puts himself ideologically in the humanist pro science center left though he is not as strident an atheist as Sagan. Bronowski would die a year later after this was released from a heart attack. At times during the series he looks worn and tired he was in his mid sixties when he filmed this. The shooting of this series in several countries including places quite remote in the 1970s such as Easter Island and Machu Picchu or as emotionally moving as Auschwitz where a large portion of his family died must have been quite strenuous on him.In 40 years some of it has dated naturally the computer graphics look very crude now and some of the scientific information has been surpassed by more recent knowledge but this is still a very worthwhile informative TV series to watch.".

It reminded me of nothing as much as a really interesting illustrated college lecture series. The series is in 13 parts each covering a different key step in the development of civilization. A few of Brononski's theories seem a bit stretched or even wrong headed the visual style is dated and the effects less than impressive but that doesn't mean the show isn't interesting thought provoking and occasionally quite moving  especially as the series goes on. I don't feel I need to ever resee the earliest 4 or 5 episodes again. They feel pretty pedantic and straightforward and there wasn't much I didn't find familiar. But the the last 4 or 5 episodes are incredibly clear explanations of the often complex and confusing world of 19th and 20th century science mixed with quite touching observations about the role of science in a bigger society its poetry and the way it feeds humanity' soul. A strange series  it starts out as fine but nothing special and ends up somewhere quite powerful.".

It takes a short while to establish the central cast of characters but the premise is made clear right away. The leading man seduces women who are about to marry the wrong guy. He then steps out of the way leaving the woman high and dry. Both the wrong engagement and his own new involvement are on ice.This is more hilarious than such a formula film should be. It's a kind of escapist comedy but with such good pedigree and filmmaking chops you really get swept away. Duris can be really a charmer and his two sidekicks are hilarious as well as heartwarming.The fact it's mostly set in Monte Carlo gives it a compact glitzy charm far more glitzy than Bahrain for my money speaking of money. The plot goes as planned at first of course. But inevitably things go very wrong. After some last minute swerves and laughs things seem to go right until the final ending which I'll leave to you. It really is like Hitch or Failure to Launch which set up a kind of protocol for how everyone should behave and within that set of rules people misbehave. It's the latest kind of screwball comedy formula and a dependable one especially this well made. Most of it is in French but a bit is in English too for the subtitle averse. And all the music is in English interestingly but typically. But never mind too much. You could almost get it all without words. Funny warm witty well made fluff stuff.".

As has already been written in a US review this is exactly the kind of thing Hollywood loves to copy but never manages to do with the required Gallic lightness and elegance. Actually there's a slight overload of added slapstick and violence this time still the action movies on such wellgreased wheels and the actors perform with such dash the movie never ceases to entertain. The premise Duris and his sister Julie Ferrier and her husband Franois Damiens run an outfit specializing in breaking up impending weddings by showing the bride that her fianc isn't as desirable a match as Duris. Duris AKA Alex withdraws with a touching story about how he's too heartbroken to be the one. Usually a rich father employs the team to perform this scam. Such is the case when Vanessa Paridis is about to marry Jonathan a wealthy young Englishman Andrew Lincoln. The job goes against Duris' basic rule never to break up a match when the couple is genuinely in love with each other  as these two are. Also the deadline to stop the wedding is impossibly short. But the team takes it on nonetheless because of a major debt. Gangsters are threatening to do huge damage to Duris if he doesn't pay up very quickly. Two gaps in the writing it's not entirely clear why Paridis' father is so keen on destroying this match and the team's elaborate hightech methods are impossibly clever and complicated. However none of this is meant to be taken seriously. Much of the fun is in the ingenious tricks the team uses to follow Paradis' movements and give Duris opportunities to seduce her  an outcome which she stubbornly resists till the very last moment. And then when she gives in of course he breaks another of his cardinal rules and falls in love with her but it's all resolved in a lighthearted fashion. A fun watch with definite US release potential and in fact a US release is coming. Seen in Paris in April 2010 and again in a preview in NYC when it seemed a little longer than it needed to be there is a lot of repetition. But Duris' deftness as a comic actor his physicality in the dancing bits Paridis' charm and elegance and Franois Damiens' sympathetic personality hold up and indeed inspire awe and admiration on repeat viewings.".

And from this perspective I found it to be a perfectly pleasant way to spend an hourandahalf of my time. While the story's trajectory did seem a little predictable the mixture of the romantic comedy with the 'heartbreaker' team seemed to be coming from a new angle. It allowed the film to mix in some action gadgets and spy tactics into the romantic formula. And really it works quite well allinall.I found the characters to be likable and amusing. I enjoyed the Monaco scenery. And I was interested enough with the various methods the heartbreaker team employed to pull off their scam. While the film doesn't really explain very well why Vanessa Paradis's father does not want her to marry her fianc and her subsequent romance with her bodyguard isn't really very believable it doesn't ultimately matter very much as the film's tone is playful and a bit silly so lack of believability isn't exactly a dealbreaker here. Overall Heartbreaker has most probably been so successful as it's a romcom that guys and girls can both enjoy.".

There are 'quotes' from certain films and songs that mix the two main characters together and add to the meringue of the farce. Based on a light story by Laurent Zeitoun Jeremy Doner and Yhan Gromb and directed with a fine sense of comic timing by Pascal Chaumeil this is one of those examples of the farces the French do so well. Alex Lipp Romain Duris his sister Mlanie Julie Ferrier and her husband Marc Franois Damiens run a little business they coordinate efforts to breakup undesired relationships for pay. After a few examples of how the trio works its magic an assignment takes them to Monaco where they are hired to stop the marriage between Juliette Van Der Becq Vanessa Paradis and her wealthy humanitarian fianc Jonathan Alcott Andrew Lincoln  in 10 days time! Alex is avoiding previous client debts represented by a bodyguard Goran JeanMarie Paris but plunges into the formula courtship destruction mode with Juliette the difference this time is that Juliette seems happily ensconced in the marriage plans and has little time for Alex's plans. But of course through the period of time allotted Juliette finds qualities in Alex that are missing from her 'perfect' fianc and Alex breaks his cardinal rule and falls in love with his marked client Juliette. The manner in which the story is resolved is clever and entertaining and heartwarming. This may not be a great movie but it is a wellacted refreshing little romp to cleanse the palette!

	schema:reviewBody "At first I was really enjoying this for what it was. The premise of being hired to get girls to break up with their fianc's was really fun for a romcom and there were some genuine laughs. But the film was severely lacking in character development and I don't think I've ever seen a romcom where the leading man was so much more unlikeable than the other guy. I would have been okay with all this if the girl ended up with her original boyfriend but of course they force the predicable choice on you which ends up being so unsatisfying because there was nothing throughout the movie to really justify it. It brought the film from maybe 6 or 7 stars down to 3 for me it was that bad because it just showed the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing.1 They oversold the girls original relationship way too much... It was flat out said they had never seen a couple more in love and that he was the perfect boyfriend and the heartbreak team were only breaking them up because they needed money. Not a great start but at least at this time time there was still room to fix it by revealing actual flaws in the boyfriend or actually having her end up with him neither of which happened unfortunately.2 They didn't give the other guy ANY flaws. His only problem were his pretentious parents for making the girl feel like crap when they were eating but I felt just as bad for him in that scene because he was clearly embarrassed by them and if anything he ended up having the most noble moment of the film by standing up for his fianc to their faces. The whole he was safe and the other guy is exciting argument really wasn't established either... I mean he was willing to hop on a jet and get married in Vegas until the main guy interfered by spewing lies.3 The only background we get of the girl is she was once a groupie that caused her to miss her mom's funeral... Umm I think the writers were confused. This had the opposite effect of what it should have had. They should have had her say that the time was the most fun she had in her life but she ended up getting hurt or something and was too afraid to ever go back so she settled for her new boyfriend because he was safe or whatever... Don't tell me she was an irresponsible bitch that skipped her mom's funeral because she was too busy being a whore. That just makes me think going for the exciting guy will lead her back down a path of similarly poor and selfish decisions.4 If the girl didn't seem like a bitch yet by the runaway scene it should be clear. She doesn't say I'm sorry? She doesn't explain to her fianc why she's going to leave him at the altar? Hell she didn't even look at him she gave this creepy smirk and bolted while he was left standing there alone for his cruel parents to just stare at him with judgment... I couldn't have felt sorrier for him.5 And to add insult to injury they try to plug in a budding relationship for this great but now abandoned guy by pairing him with the girl's best friend that has been established as a crazy nympho that will marry him for his money and cheat on him as soon as she can. What were the writers thinking? Is there some cute irony there I am missing? Was it just supposed to be funny to kick a man when he's down? Well it wasn't.Really such an unsatisfying that exposed all of the movie's flaws and ruined what could have been a charming romantic comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you see a romantic comedy especially when it is a farce you have to be able to suspend your expectation for realism and just enjoy the film. One of us was able to do that right away and the other took a little longer to give into the premise. Romain Duris is Alex the young suave bearded Frenchman  the film is in French with subtitles  who works with his sister and her husband in a unique business. A client who believes that a particular woman should not be romantically involved with her boyfriend or fiance hires them. This team will research this woman and determine her special likes and dislikes. They will then arrange a scenario where Alex will happen to meet her charm her and when she falls in love with him he will not be emotionally available but she will realize that she should not be with her current boyfriend. The job is completed and the con team gets paid. They often use high tech to set up their ruses. It should be noted that Alex has scruples in that he will never accept a job unless he really believes the girl shouldn't be with her current lover. It is an interesting premise and the trio of screenwriters and the direction of Pascal Chaumeil creates some very clever and funny scenes. Needless to say things don't go according to schedule on one of these capers when Juliette played by Vanessa Paradis is the target of their latest job. The conclusion is a little reminiscent of the ending of The Graduate You will have to decide if you believe that she is now falling in love with the perfect man for her that Alex has created or does she now see his true love for her which she believes she also has for him? One of the screenwriters of the movie is a Harvard educated AFI graduate Jeremy Doner who obviously has a good feel for the French sensibilities of love and humor. He was a guest at the screening we attended and told us that this film was one of the most financially successful films to be shown in France in the last several years but there usually can only be limited expectations for a foreign movie with subtitles in the United States. Perhaps for this reason he is currently working on an American English version of this story which has been set for production in the near future. A romantic comedy even one that is a farce usually ends with a warm feel good sense about the ultimate relationship of the lovers.  Think Tracy and Hepburn . The fact that Juliette's feelings for Alex were based on the con job pulled off by Alex may take away a bit from the audience's feeling good about the lovers as the movie concludes. Perhaps they can fine tune the ending of the English version so there is no doubt that they are right for each other.".

	schema:headline " An agency specialized in breaking couples is hired by a rich businessman to prevent his daughter to marry a man he dislikes.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I loved the actors. Romain Duris is one of my favorite. He manages to conceal some of the weaknesses of a plot if there is any in every film he stars in. His best parts so far have been in L'auberge espagnole Le poupes russes De battre mon coeur s'est arrt Le pril jeune. In this new film you can see also the brilliant acting of Vanessa Paradis. You certainly know her as the wife of the actor Johnny Depp  you will find out she is also a very good actress.The plot is the main thing that bothered me. There is no explanation in the film as to the reason this rich businessman hires the heartbreaking team. After all I doubt many women would turn down the proposal of the handsome and generous man the main woman character is supposed to marry. To give you a picture  He owns a plane he gets food to beggars in the street he is involved in humanitarian aid to Africa. His only real flaw is that he's not there !

	onyx:emotionText "First of all I loved the actors. Romain Duris is one of my favorite. He manages to conceal some of the weaknesses of a plot if there is any in every film he stars in. His best parts so far have been in L'auberge espagnole Le poupes russes De battre mon coeur s'est arrt Le pril jeune. In this new film you can see also the brilliant acting of Vanessa Paradis. You certainly know her as the wife of the actor Johnny Depp  you will find out she is also a very good actress.The plot is the main thing that bothered me. There is no explanation in the film as to the reason this rich businessman hires the heartbreaking team. After all I doubt many women would turn down the proposal of the handsome and generous man the main woman character is supposed to marry. To give you a picture  He owns a plane he gets food to beggars in the street he is involved in humanitarian aid to Africa. His only real flaw is that he's not there !

On paper  and even on first impressions  it's hard to find Alex likable and yet that's exactly what he and the film achieves. It helps that he's something of a 'little' guy he's broke and genuinely loves his job and the likes of Juliette look down their noses at people like him. He exudes a brilliant physical energy throughout the film it's this  and his passion and determination never doing anything by halves  that's crucial to his ultimately winning the audience and his 'victim' over.Of course the reserved poised Juliette might also appear at least at first somewhat unlikeable with her very expensive lifestyle and her perfect fianc. But her secret lowbrow tastes her playfulness and her seeing the good that we see in Alex win us over too. It helps that Paradis the actress is a bit of an icon a bit edgy even slightly odd looking sorry is that me? That doesn't mean I think she isn't beautiful!. He's slightly odd looking too.The film goes at a cracking pace and features bedroom farce classic French meringuelight comedy visual gags slapstick crime punishment an English stooge pleasing background music knowing references  you name it.

Alex's new mission involves Juliette Vanessa Paradis who is about to marry a rich British man and her father just doesn't think her's right for her. With days to go before the wedding Alex heads to Monte Carlo to woo Juliette only to discover she's a bit of a tough cookie but also a babe. Can he manage to break this relationship up or is he going to actually going to fall for her? This light romantic French comedy is a lot of fun. Duris and Paradis are great together with Paradis being more cute and teeny tiny than you could imagine she gets to strut around in some wonderful clothes and the film plays out in a gorgeous looking sun bathed Monte Carlo all of which makes this a wonderful looking film.The story is a bit silly but it's quite fun with Alex pretending to like all the things Juliette likes which means he has to sing along to Wham! eat Roquefort cheese for breakfast and learn the dance moves from Dirty Dancing. These are some of the more funnier moments in the film and whilst the film isn't laugh a minute it is charming and easy pleasing throughout that has that certain French element to it that doesn't translate in American remakes. There are some downsides such as the arrival of Juliette's old friend who is just annoying and there is little screen time for Andrew Lincoln who plays the soon to be husband. However as a light rom com this does a very good job even if it does leave you with 'Wake me up before you gogo' in your head.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com".

Not only for the fact that it sounds like a spot treatment for idiots but that it also describes simply a contradiction in terms for example friendly fire or sweet sorrow. Some might argue that romantic comedy is also an oxymoron yet movies over the years have successfully made light of one of life's most serious subjects. What has become the case over more recent years is that most makers of romantic comedies should probably be prosecuted under the Trade Descriptions Act  even in the last three years I've accompanied my wife to too many films with that description that were neither funny nor truly romantic.So what a pleasure it is to find that the romantic comedy isn't a lost art after all. And who better to do romance than the French? This though is a very Anglicised French take on the modern romcom  rights have already been snapped up and it's easy to guess who might fill roles in the English version. Much of the English perspective comes from the main female character Juliette  she likes Wham records and Dirty Dancing and has even shackled herself to Egg off of This Life Andrew Lincoln. a model of British decorum and class and maybe a sly comment on how the French see the British as lacking passion.So Romain Duris' Alex is tasked with bringing this relationship to an end and there's a convenient ticking clock of a wedding at the end of the week. There are other stumbling blocks as well including the reasons Alex has to take the job and Juliette's mysterious friend who turns up and throws several large spanners into the works. What this serves to do is to keep things moving along at a fair old rate and also to keep the laughs coming. All the while a believable relationship develops between Alex and Juliette striking just the right balance between the comedic and romantic elements.There's bits of physical comedy bits of slapstick and farce Julie Ferrier as Alex's sister gets about 100 costume changes and through all that there's a clear line of sight to the objective of getting the two leads together. All in all this is as light as a small souffl and about as deep but it fulfills its remit admirably and should be recommended for those who like their romances with a dash of the funnies. Now to sit back and wait for that remake to be horribly ruined Why see it at the cinema Lots of good laughs here that are better shared and also lots of wonderful French scenery that you can take in at the same time.The Score 810".

	schema:reviewBody "HeartBreaker is a wonderful film to watch to spend an afternoon in a darkened theatre with a companion you love one who is familiar with the beautiful places visited as backdrops to this engaging film. The people involved are all actors of effortless grace regarding their seemingly effortless immmersion in the modestly complex plot. This plot is something that would need to be worked out in a nonEnglish culture a culture for which the old tenants of behaviour still hold some sway. I cannot imagine any of what happened on the screen taking place in an English speaking country but perhaps that speaks more of my nativity than anything about the script. The two main actors Romain Duris and Vanessa Paradis play their roles consummately as does everybody else in this delightful film.

	onyx:emotionText "HeartBreaker is a wonderful film to watch to spend an afternoon in a darkened theatre with a companion you love one who is familiar with the beautiful places visited as backdrops to this engaging film. The people involved are all actors of effortless grace regarding their seemingly effortless immmersion in the modestly complex plot. This plot is something that would need to be worked out in a nonEnglish culture a culture for which the old tenants of behaviour still hold some sway. I cannot imagine any of what happened on the screen taking place in an English speaking country but perhaps that speaks more of my nativity than anything about the script. The two main actors Romain Duris and Vanessa Paradis play their roles consummately as does everybody else in this delightful film. The Set Director did a wonderful job by bringing the viewer virtually into the film because the sets and locations were so phenomenal. You owe it to yourself to see this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is a French film  some things UK and US audiences won't like because of the new PC stereotypes demanded by socalled 'feminists' who spend hours devouring the latest about Jen Cheryl and Kerry etc. So this film shows an arrogant stubbled big nosed French guy rather than white toothed air brushed airhead taking on jobs where he has to break up couples although he has some scruples about breaking up real lovers! with his sister and brotherinlaw. His impossible target is the gap toothed Vanessa Paradisalbeit Mrs Depp who is in love with the stereotypical English stiff that will be in the US version no doubt!. He tries all he can pretending to love Wham! and 'Dirty Dancing' good impression of Swayze on the dance floor but she holds off forcing ever more complicated plays by the 'hero.' So the story rolls on with the girl not suspecting anything the US version will have to have a much feistier and knowing heroine of course. Her best friend cannot walk along without flashing a breast cut from US version along with the description of her as a nympho! and is knocked out twice by the brotherinlaw with a frying pan senseless violence against women certainly not!. You get the picture different culture different mores on screen but quite amusing as a farce and romcom. The leads do not really spark enough but hey after limp efforts over many years by the likes of Aniston and Lopez in absolute rubbish they have something going on screen! The secondary characters get a chance without overacting and it is fun. Yes a screwball comedy that Hollywood used to be able to make but cannot anymore except through louche rubbish from Carell et al. Let's all give a cheer for the French for showing UK how to make a comedy without too much postmodernist ironic baggage hanging on to it!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's just too bad that the reviewer for this romantic comedy isn't of the female species. It's also just too bad that this male reviewer isn't half as good looking as the movie's male lead Romain Duris. Of course it doesn't help that this reviewer isn't exactly a die hard romantic which is why an impossible premise like that doesn't exactly excite him.Sure marketing collaterals also tell him that this movie is a hit at the France box office but it only means that there's something in most of us or at least the French that wishes for a fairy tale like that to happen in real life.The movie's protagonist is Alex who operates a business with his sister and his sister in law to break couples up. The only moralistic part about this business? The woman has to be unknowingly unhappy before the charming Alex makes his move. His latest assignment is to break up a rich man's daughter and her British fianc. How will our suave hero accomplish his task in one week and when the couple seems to be blissfully in love with each other seven days away from their wedding?When you are heavily in debt you better make the impossible possible. Or at least you can be sure everything will turn out well in a crowd pleasing movie like this.In 105 minutes you will be transported to a world where there is little to worry about love because everything seems to fall nicely into place at the end of the day. It sure helps that the movie moves along at a breezy pace which makes the otherwise predictable plot easy to sit through. It is sprinkled with good natured humour which all romantic comedies are obliged to contain. While the setups aren't anything refreshing they do make for an enjoyable evening out at the movies with your other half.Besides who doesn't enjoy picturesque backdrops with equally beautiful people in the foreground?Duris The Beat That My Heart Skipped Moliere plays the titular heartbreaker with so much charm and charisma that one can only imagine that if there is really such a person in real life it would be a sin for any female not to fall in love with him. And as for the female protagonist Vanessa Paradis you may want to know her as Johnny Depp's partner  the lucky girl portrays a girl who is torn about what she really wants in life at the altar. While this personality isn't exactly a breath of fresh air by today's cinema standards Paradis does a decent job in delivering an empathetic performance which conveys loss and confusion. The supporting cast does a fine job too from the comedic pairing of Julie Ferrier and Francois Damiens to the menacing Jacques Frantz. There is much chemistry among the cast members and the movie sparkles because of this.Being a French production there is lots you can expect from it. The elegance and style from the French easily gives it a chic feel which you won't find in Hollywood equivalents. But knowing the Americans they have already bought the US remake rights to produce the Hollywood version thanks to its phenomenal box office success at home. So who would we be seeing in the role of the deliciously appealing male protagonist?

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Heartbreaker";
	schema:reviewBody "Alex Lippi Romain Duris is the antiHitch. He doesn't stay behind the scenes to impact knowledge on seduction to guys clueless on getting the girl of their dreams. Rather he's leading the charge himself in a family business designed to break couples up. But he's not the cad he's made out to be nor their business model immoral because he follows a philosophy of how he reads women  those who are happy unhappy and those who won't admit they are unhappy. His business focuses on the last group where concerned family members and friends can engage Alex's seduction expertise to ruin the relationship between a woman and man but drawing the line against grounds that are religiously motivated or to break up genuinely happy couples.And that in itself is quite the unique selling point of the film making this a remarkably fresh injection into the romantic comedy genre. As with most field experts there won't be a story if they stick by their own rules and hence with growing money problems Alex accepts a job that has to see him break off the impending marriage of a flower tycoon's daughter Vanessa Paradis Juliette to rich English scion Jonathan Alcott Andrew Lincoln where research sees him and his team gathering all kinds of facts figures and trivia about his mark and a race against time to fulfill his objective in 10 days. An idea crops up and he poses as her newly assigned bodyguard who come courtesy from her dad.Now his is quite the dream job getting to romance countless of women if only for a brief moment having absolutely no strings attached and strictly no sex and being in a position to positively influence their decisions to quit being engaged with jerks out there. I think it's noble to a certain degree even being the heartbreaker and opening the eyes and minds of impressionable ladies and having to be a fine actor in order to pull such a stunt off. Romain Duris shines in the role of Alex having to employ his acting range in a variety of situations designed to challenge his skillset given a number of staged and unexpected situations his character has to handle including that involving his own heart. While having his usual repertoire of staged lines and techniques used to impress new skills have to be employed if he's going to make an impression.But the film won't be as fun as it was without the involvement of the comedic duo Julier Ferrier and Francois Damiens who play Alex's sister Melanie and brotherinlaw Marc respectively in this family business the former being his pointperson and the latter adding that technological edge in welloiled operations on par as seen in heist movies. The trio provide excellent banter with one another while going about their mission and their believable chemistry is one of many reasons why this film is delightful to sit through. They rely on impersonation lies and trickery and the fun comes when things don't go exactly as planned especially when Juliette doesn't seem to fall prey to Alex's usual bag of tricks made complicated with the arrival of Juliette's best friend Sophie Helena Noguerra.I wonder how much of that in the film is applicable in real life since there are those who think that opposites attract yet others who deem having shared interests is key to sustain a relationship. This film presents both sides yet curiously made it seem that lies being told are acceptable as well so long as the guy is suave in his delivery. To enjoy this film would also mean to temporarily suspend disbelief or to subscribe to the notion that soul mates do exist and come into your life at the very last minute prior to getting married. After all one can never deem it too suspicious when someone actually shares every single one of your interests from favourite movie singer and even breakfast food.In some ways Heartbreaker toes the line of girls who fall easily for bad boys who show them a good time rather than for the boring stable ones. Learning Juliette's missing year from college and what that would unfold just reinforces the point that girls just wanna have fun. Being a romantic comedy will also mean the usual expectation that you don't expect any treading of new ground when the finale rolls along although I was halfrooting for that to happen. If you're tired from what Hollywood produces as romanticcomedies then this French film will give new vigour to the genre that is starving from ideas like this one. Highly recommended and it goes into my shortlist as one of the best this year!".

	schema:reviewBody "Shashilal Nair's 'One 2 Ka 4' was a very enjoyable movie for me. It is an actionpacked comedydrama and somehow reminded me of the 1993 movie 'Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke'. Here too Juhi Chawla is the governess of children who are under the hero's custody though they are not his children. The movie was mainly watchable because of the leading stars Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla. They really rock together as was evidenced in previous projects like 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman' 'Darr' and 'Yes Boss'. They are very comfortable working together and it is very obvious. Shahrukh Khan is fantastic here. He is a great action star though he is better known for his romantic roles. Here he is completely restrained and serious as the tough policeman a role we don't see him playing that often. But the one who completely blew me away is Juhi. A gifted comedienne she is absolutely charming and hilarious in a comic role which seems to be tailormade for her. This is one of her most entertaining performances. The kids are quite good. Jackie Shroff is there for something like halfanhour and he's okay. Towards the end the story gets a bit confusing and it is very easy to lose interest in the film mainly due to its lack of focus. However there are some things to be said in its favour unlike most Hindi films we use to watch and like this one is neither melodramatic nor overly emotional. The narrative style which is surprisingly a bit dark and dim is very effective and special and A.R. Rahman's music is nice as well. 'One 2 Ka 4' is not a great film but it is a good entertainer and you definitely can watch it for the rather interesting story and particularly for the actors.".

Juhi was so funny throughout the entire movie especially in the beginning like when she accidentally sticks a fork into Shahrukh's hand it left me laughing like crazy! Juhi did an excellent job playing her role. It amazed me how she transformed from an over talkative Punjabi girl to club dancer to an undercover cop! Even Shahrukh shined throughout the film!As for the songs I'd have to say One 2 Ka 4 has a very interesting soundtrack. This film offers a wide variety of music ranging from a romantic number like Sona Nahi Na Sahi to a catchy dance number like Osaka Muraiya. One 2 Ka 4's soundtrack is beyond amazing!I really wonder why critics considered One 2 Ka 4 a flop and put it down so much? I think One 2 Ka 4 is a totally cool movie and far from being boring!Overall One 2 Ka 4 deserves a 1010!!!".

I paid 8 to watch this movie and never during the 3 hour span of the film was I ever bored.  It entertained me for every second of those 3 hours that I watched it.  It should be obvious that this is not meant to be some serious thoughtprovoking classic.  It is meant solely to entertain.  And as part of Indian cinema extensive hybridization of a film is absolutely necessary to entertain an undifferentiated audience which this film has the capability of doing.  It has action when needed although the scenes are flicked right out of John Woo's Face Off it has some great comedy through a fabulous performance by Juhi Chawla and some wonderful music and a kickass background score by A.R. Rahman.  Shahrukh and Jackie are very competent in their roles.  The movie is pure escapism and to provide that the director Shashilal Nair does a decent job.  It is extremely surprising why this film flopped and why critics took the film so seriously and denounced it completely.  I mean come on cut the entertainers some slack and enjoy the movie.  Not every movie you critics watch absolutely HAS to be a work of art.  Just take it in as what it is.  Free your mind a little.".

Juhi Chawla was believable as the bubbly fun loving girlnext door but fails to leave a mark as an intelligent undercover cop. This is one of her many films where she gets to display her comic skills and she does it surprisingly well. The story of One 2 Ka Four resembles the story of One Good Cop. And this is quite sad that an intelligent filmmaker like Nair would resort to ripping out a B grade Hollywood thriller. Jackie Shroff in a small role looks jaded and is quickly forgotten after the intermission. Nirmal Pandey cannot act that is quite apparent. Raj Zutsi looks bland. Overall it's a below average flick!".

Often when an action star attempts comedy it fails miserably. I rate this movie 8 out of 10 stars and my daughters all loved it as well. We talked and laughed about it all the way home. I am certain that a few of the catch phrases will be with us for a while. This movie was a blast. Disney did a great job with this one.";

It isn't trying to win awards or stun the audience with special effects. You sit down watch it laugh a little think about how cute the kids are then go on with the rest of your day. A lot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image Stallone and Arnold S. to name a couple so Vin Diesel is in good company there. I think it is a decent light movie worth at least a matine viewing. The kids are charmers Vin Diesel doesn't seem to mind being the but of jokes and most of the acting is good. And ladies he spends most of the movie in tight tshirts and according to my wife has a nice posterior region. Guys you have to settle for Lauren Graham's sweet smile.".

	schema:reviewBody "In brief A bit more cutesy than Kindergarten Cop but more familyfriendly and Vin Diesel shows his versatility.I don't usually attend screenings for kids' movies but when I first found out about this film I was very curious to see how Vin Diesel would do in a kid's film. I've liked Vin Diesel ever since Pitch Black and while some may dismiss him as a musclebound action workhorse I've long thought that there was more to him lurking behind that facade and remembering the skepticism that greeted Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempts at comedyskepticism that was greeted with what I thought were successful turns in Twins and Kindergarten Cop I was curious to see how successfully Diesel would play against type.The result is a family film more cutesy and farcical than Kindergarten Cop the model my mind kept going back to for comparison with an unfortunately greater focus on infant waste products but greater conflict between Diesel and his young charges which lends itself to more heartwarming moments of rapportbuilding. Diesel plays Lt. Shane Wolfe a Navy SEAL assigned to protect the five children of a top scientist Tate Donovan and find a hidden computer program that may be secreted in his house while their mother Faith Ford and Wolfe's C.O. journey to Zurich to try and find the right code word for the scientist's safety deposit box. A simple assignment it seems except these kids have issues. Eldest son Seth is defiant suffers bullying from fellow students and the school's V.P. and is negligent in his wrestling team responsibilities. Oldest daughter Zoe American Dreams's Brittany Snow is truant in her Driver's Ed class and willfully disobedient. The problems of the youngest three Lulu Peter and Tyler seem simpler but are no less mountainous for Wolfe who first tries addressing these problems with the roughshod military discipline he's accustomed to but soon finds himself changing tactics by listening to these kids' problems and helping them out more as a parent than a military bodyguard. Whereas Schwarzenegger's character was instantly ingratiated with the object of his protection in Kindergarten Cop by becoming friends and eventually boyfriend to his mom and merely had to win his class' attention here Wolfe has the more difficult task of cutting through the layers of resentment in a pair of teenagers taking care of an infant and two young children and protecting them from assassins that come crashing through windows which lends itself to both some genuinely warm moments when he opens up to Seth and Zoe and some surprisingly interesting but funny action sequences that seem evocative of Jackie Chan with a really nice setupandpayoff when Wolfe realizes the secret to getting to the computer program.This is obviously a film geared more for the kids as evidenced by the kooky overacting the silly Swiss stereotypes which I didn't even realized existed and the goofy actions on the part of the bad guys such as the revelation for example that squirting a juice box into a bad guy's face is akin to spraying it with acid and somehow keeps the bad guy from falling backward in response but while that may be a letdown to the older folk the parents will probably be pleased since I recall some parents being upset with the more adult scenes in Kindergarten Cop. The bottom line is bring the kids to see it but if unless you're a diehard Diesel fan and want to see anything he does it probably won't be your cup of tea if you're past grade school.".

	schema:headline " The Pacifier Suits Diesel Just Fine";
	schema:reviewBody "I did not really know what to expect from Director Adam Shankman's The Pacifier starring very serious action star Vin Diesel. Shankman had done well with Bringing Down the House with Queen Latifa and Steve Martin. So having Vin Diesel as a no nonsense Navy SEAL protecting a family of 5 kids in the middle of suburbia in a Disney release no less seemed like an artistic stretch. To The Pacifier's credit it works. The Pacifier is predictable and shamelessly sentimental at times which is expected. Through it's charm family message invariably centered around discipline and likable characters The Pacifier becomes one of those rare commodities great family entertainment. I am a fan of Vin Diesel. In The Pacifier he proves to be a deft straight man. Props for Diesel. He is going out on a limb with his action hero persona particularly in a hilarious bit with the Panda Dance. Diesel is still a commanding physical presence though this outing as a kinder gentler Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe may hold promise for his longevity. He really displays a flair for light comedy. He has the kind of charm where he is never over shadowed by the cute kids that is no small feat.Outwardly Diesel's Navy SEAL Lt. Shane Wolfe is the powerful leader of men whose team is sent to rescue scientist Howard Plummer Tate Donovan from Bosnian terrorists. In the thrilling operation Shane is able to rescue Plummer. However in an apparent betrayal Plummer is murdered and Shane is left for dead. Shane recovers and is assigned by his commander Capt. Bill Fawcett a good Chris Potter to safe guard the Plummer family. Turns out that Howard Plummer invented a strategic warning system called GHOST. Fawcett and Plummer's widow the charming and beautiful Faith Ford are off to Zurich to retrieve the contents of Howard's deposit box. Both the software and hardware for GHOST are missing and their location unknown. Things don't go as planned in Zurich really shocking well not really. So what was supposed to be a weekend of babysitting turns in to an extended assignment for Shane and the Plummer kids.Shane can run a complex and dangerous operation behind enemy lines in his sleep. Dealing with teenagers being a Girl Scout Den Mother and changing a baby's diaper now that is really tough for this combat veteran SEAL. Zoe Brittany Snow the oldest daughter has boys on her mind as well as getting her driver's license. Zoe has taken the loss of her father to heart and puts on the teenage bravado to reassure her siblings. Seth Max Theriot ditches wrestling practice because his passion is theater and playing a lead in The Sound of Music. Lulu Morgan York is the not so confident Girl Scout being bullied by some Boy Scouts at the local Costco. York steals the movie. Peter Kegan and Logan Hoover is not toilet trained. Tyler Bo and Luke Vink is the baby with the digestion issues. These are all good touches.Predictably Shane Diesel reveals his big heart when it comes to the Plummer kids. What is well done is that Shane's demand for discipline is unwaivering in the process. Discipline is like breathing for Shane but it is tempered by respect honor and compassion. No one will be harmed under Shane's watch. The screenplay by Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant provides the atmosphere for this apparent evolution of Shane. Lennon and Garant allow Shane's methods to remain unchanged while he really gets to know what is important to the Plummer kids and ultimately shares himself. Diesel has a nice scene where he tells Zoe about his father. There is a great comic touch when Shane takes over as Director of The Sound of Music seeing how important it is for Seth. When he schools Seth's wrestling coach Murney good goofy Brad Garrett in the art of handtohand combat it is hilarious. Shane's scenes with Lulu York are priceless and pulls at the harp strings. They are allowed. Ultimately The Pacifier is about family and making someone part of your family. This may sound corny and it worked for me.Shankman has made a surprisingly satisfying and entertaining movie in The Pacifier. This is one for the whole family. Vin Diesel's venture into a kinder and gentler persona was a risk that paid off. This action star has other gifts. The Pacifier is well worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I did not really know what to expect from Director Adam Shankman's The Pacifier starring very serious action star Vin Diesel. Shankman had done well with Bringing Down the House with Queen Latifa and Steve Martin. So having Vin Diesel as a no nonsense Navy SEAL protecting a family of 5 kids in the middle of suburbia in a Disney release no less seemed like an artistic stretch. To The Pacifier's credit it works. The Pacifier is predictable and shamelessly sentimental at times which is expected. Through it's charm family message invariably centered around discipline and likable characters The Pacifier becomes one of those rare commodities great family entertainment. I am a fan of Vin Diesel. In The Pacifier he proves to be a deft straight man. Props for Diesel. He is going out on a limb with his action hero persona particularly in a hilarious bit with the Panda Dance. Diesel is still a commanding physical presence though this outing as a kinder gentler Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe may hold promise for his longevity. He really displays a flair for light comedy. He has the kind of charm where he is never over shadowed by the cute kids that is no small feat.Outwardly Diesel's Navy SEAL Lt. Shane Wolfe is the powerful leader of men whose team is sent to rescue scientist Howard Plummer Tate Donovan from Bosnian terrorists. In the thrilling operation Shane is able to rescue Plummer. However in an apparent betrayal Plummer is murdered and Shane is left for dead. Shane recovers and is assigned by his commander Capt. Bill Fawcett a good Chris Potter to safe guard the Plummer family. Turns out that Howard Plummer invented a strategic warning system called GHOST. Fawcett and Plummer's widow the charming and beautiful Faith Ford are off to Zurich to retrieve the contents of Howard's deposit box. Both the software and hardware for GHOST are missing and their location unknown. Things don't go as planned in Zurich really shocking well not really.

	schema:reviewBody "Vin Diesel plays Shane Wolfe a disgraced Navy SEAL assigned to protect the five children of a scientist who was murdered while working on government secrets. He quickly learns that taking care of kids is going to be the hardest assignment he's ever taken.The premise isn't very original but I was still expecting this to be a fun movie. However The Pacifier is a lazy family film that only the kids will like. The screenwriters could have attempted to expand the audience but they didn't. They pretty much leave everyone over the age of 15 out of the fun. The movie only had one goal and that was to entertain the kids. For the most part they succeeded even if they used cheap gags and annoying characters to get the job done. Well I'm not too surprised the script is really weak since it was written by the same people who brought us Taxi. I know the Pacifier is supposed to be a fun harmless movie but it was quite tortuous at times and I blame it on the lazy screenwriters.Vin Diesel is an okay actor. I can't see him winning an Oscar anytime soon but he's better than Paul Walker. His performance here wasn't very good though. It was rather dull and it wasn't very funny either. It's not really his fault since he was probably told to play his character seriously so that in awkward situations he would seem to be funny but it backfired and made the film more unbearable. Morgan York gave the best performance and she has the most memorable lines. Brittany Snow was okay nothing special. Max Thieriot also gave an okay performance though I really didn't like his character. Faith Ford appears in the movie for about 15 minutes so it would be kind of pointless to see this film because of her. Lauren Graham gave an okay performance I prefer her on Gilmore Girls though. Brad Garret was terrible since he tried way too hard to be funny and it just failed completely.Adam Shankman directs and he does a decent job. I wouldn't say he did a good job because the movie is kind of bland and inoffensive. He really put no element of surprise and he shot the film right down the middle. I'm kind of surprised he didn't make the film better since he also directed Bringing Down the House and that film was pretty funny. Since this is strictly a kid's movie I thought the film was very dull and not very funny. They seemed to try too hard and it didn't work out at all. They were some funny moments but not enough to sustain the running time. In the end The Pacifier is a harmless film for kids but everyone else should skip it. Rating 410".

There must have been a good trailer before it or perhaps there was a generation of people that missed the film when it was originally called Kindergarten Cop. Either way for an hour an a half we were duped into watching nothing more than scene after scene of diaper humor a comically unbalanced Diesel wading through the supposed funny moments a duck scenes where the baby of the family is left unattended sloppy and I mean sloppy editing and quick resolutions that will leave the avid film watcher confused and disoriented. Coupled with clich after clich Diesel proves that he is better left in the action genre the leaving the humor to anyone else in the world except for him.There are several people that I am extremely upset with in the world of film today. Tim Burton is currently at the top of my list but right below him is Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon. I grew up with the humor of these guys by watching the decently funny Reno 911 and the hysterically funny MTV show The State. When I saw that they had written this film I was expecting to see a new level of comedy. I was hoping to see a film where the humor was sharp the dialog was perhaps paradoxical while laughing at all the ways they could play off the already clich scenes that have been done in early 80s movies. Alas this was not the case. They literally sold out. Garant and Lennon created a film that fit well into the structure of Disney by giving us bathroom humor jagged bonding moments and that inevitable anticlimactic ending which sums everything up in a nice little bow. Did they need the cash? My guess is yes. For those that may be fans of Reno 911 or The State I would not go into this film expecting classic humor but instead be prepared for unfunny diaper scenes which seem to be the staple of this film.Since the story was filled with more holes than Swiss cheese it seemed only right for Diesel to fall into that one of those holes as well. He cannot do comedy. This film The Pacifier proves that. There were no scenes in which he was able to generate a laugh by anyone in our house. His comic timing seemed invisible to nonexistent all the while it just seemed as if he kept waiting for the chance to walk around without his shirt and perhaps fight some badguys. You could tell that he felt uncomfortable in this film and was not ready to handle the pressures of comedy. Perhaps it was the direction that he was given but Diesel continually went in and out of character. His main focus was to watch the children but whenever he had to do something else he completely forgot about the children and moved on. This is hard to explain but there were several scenes when Diesel left small children unattended in the house or in the car or somewhere offscreen while he went searching for his actual mission. I was surprised that Social Services didn't try to boycott this film. Perhaps it was Diesel's way of being funny but for me it just came off as sloppy. Comedy is hard and Diesel needs more work at it before he headlines another Disney bomb.Finally I would like to say that Adam Shankman needs to really work on his direction skills. I know he has done more films than just this but for some odd reason the editing was horrible in this film. Scenes would occur randomly while conclusions to those scenes would arise sporadically as well. It was chaos. We as viewers jumped around so much in this film that you just didn't get a feel of any of the characters. The Disney touch was so apparent that it forced the story to become unstructured and confusing. The wrestling to Nazi scene was especially bad in fact the entire Sound of Music moment was painful and disruptive to the entire film. Didn't these children's father just pass away horribly about two weeks ago? Nobody seemed to care and there wasn't one tear shed throughout the entire film. The structure on helping the children while continuously looking for Ghost just didn't fit. There needed to be more stories more moments between the children more glue instead of chaos holding these scenes together. The random relationship between Diesel and Graham was idiotic while the entire concept of falling in love with these children in just short of two weeks blew my mind. We were all over the place in this film and it hurt.Overall this film was worse than pathetic. All three key elements to this film the writers the major star and the director just didn't seem to be on the right page. It was sad to see such great comics like Lennon and Garant churn out duds like this. It was sad to see Hollywood resort to the clichd 80s concept of bringing an action star into comedy and watch him fail miserably. The story was horrendous and glued together by a twoyear old. The comedic moments were nonexistent while Diesel wandered through the entire film in and out of character hoping to revive a dying career. Nobody made me laugh. Nobody was funny. Nothing was worth viewing a second time. If you are looking for a decent comedy that fully represents the key elements in this film I would check out the comedic actor John Candy tackle it in Uncle Buck.Grade  out of ".

It has everything fight scenes for the guys Vin Diesel wearing nothing but a towel for the ladies baby poop for gross little boys girl scouts doing karate on boy scouts for little girls and quite a few heartwarming family moments.Plot line goes as follows Lt. Shane Wolf a high ranking Navy seal is leading a mission to rescue a military security expert Professor Plummer from kidnappers. He has created a program that will prevent enemy countries from being able to launch their own nuclear weapons. The professor is killed and the program never found. It is believed to be at the professor's home with his wife and five young kids. Lt. Wolf is assigned to protect them and locate the program known as Ghost.

Wolf will stop at nothing to protect the children. Although first at odds with the children he learns what it feels like to be a father and grows to love it and them.I had never seen a Vin Diesel movie before and was very surprised as to how good he was in this movie. The best character in the movie is Murney played by Brad Garrett. He almost stole the movie because he portrayed this loony character so well. He had the best lines and will leave you in stitches. Although no man will admit to enjoying this movie too much of a threat to their macho personas I consider it to be an excellent family movie.".

Then came the pacifier around and this is the type of film I expect to have a pre engineered script at the basis of it. Pre engineered in a way it has been written to please certain target audiences and not in an effort to make a good film.It is obvious that this film is only made to give Vin Diesel access to certain mom and dad audiences he couldn't reach with his earlier efforts. Everything in this film is based on playing it safe giving the viewer a predictable Luke warm rehash that invites to nod off semi permanent. Think the very very worst of the older Disney movies add the very worst of the Sylvester Stallone family entertainment  another disappointment outings and it gives you this.For a man that  if I can believe his interviews had to really fight to get where he is now Mr Diesel shows a remarkable lack of courage in his choosings for parts.

Unfortunately the man lacks building experience and in accordance with the Murphy principle anything that might go wrong actually does. It takes ages to get permits from the official authorities. The red tape is an eternal drain of energy. The hired handymen prove to be dabblers and impostors. The structure that is finally erected by the family man himself with his own hands collapses due to a minor breeze. Soon the project dominates and ruins his life the fun is gone and only hurt pride makes him persevere. But enough is enough eventually a ready to hand house is bought on the market from a house construction agency. The project ends as a laughable experience. The claim of curiosity and originality in this film stems from its many layers. On the surface it is a slapsticklike comedy not really funny since German humor is in general popular and lacks the AngloSaxon subtlety. Humor requires the ability to moderate. On a psychological level there is the portrayal of personal initiative which is turned into a caricature. Free enterprise is depicted as rotten and individuals are powerless against the red tape. On the social level there is the advocation of cooperation and division of labor leading to professionalism and accomplishments that are outside the reach of individuals. You prosper as a part of the community. In conclusion I can definitely not praise this film. Nevertheless the enjoyment of mishaps in combination with personal identification and painful recognition this is the stuff that my nightmares are made of imprints the events in your memory and makes it an unforgettable film.".

Nevertheless the enjoyment of mishaps in combination with personal identification and painful recognition this is the stuff that my nightmares are made of imprints the events in your memory and makes it an unforgettable film.";

The young lovers are temporarily separated but as old Logan Reeser gets deeper in debt and might have to shut down the mill Frank and Sylvia devise a clever plan and together they prove that love and determination can save a town from disaster and be the answer to Reeser's prayers as well...Although the DVD isn't very cool only chapter selections no special features I really enjoy this movie. I love its message regarding environment similar to what was voiced in such good films as Silkwood A River Runs Through It Erin Brockovich... Credits should also go to the cinematography and the solid performance of the entire cast especially Hilary Swank with her incomparable freshness and natural beauty. So if you're tired of movies that offer nothing but senseless violence and obsessive sex crave get Heartwood and enjoy this heartwarming love story as narrated by its main character It started 15 years ago in a forest in my sawmill town Deroy population 254 where the trees are more than a livelihood they're a way of life...".

Although initially we have two highschool girls Anne Suzuki and Aoi Yuu squabble over a hapless senior the film isn't really about teen crushes and jealousy. Instead as layers of each girl's background and character are peeled away we discover a surprising amount of depth and resonance to Hana and Alice's friendship. The ballet scene is much talked about and fawned over but the real highlight for me was where we find out that Hana was in fact a nearautistic child shunning the outer world from her flower house until Alice came along and enticed her out into the world. This scene increases the emotional strength of both the film and the girls' relationship exponentially and turns the movie from merely entertaining into truly touching.Director Shunji Iwai once again establishes a particularly delectable mood  as only he can  and has the guts to carry it all the way. Although most of the press and public attention in the Far East focused on the freshness of Aoi Yuu it is the former child actor Suzuki Anne who gives a performance of veritable subtlety so nuanced and superbly mannered that you almost don't notice it until you give it a thought. She has the less flashy and more mundane role of the two yet there isn't one moment where she's caught acting something that sadly can't be said for Yuu. To think that Suzuki has just turned 18  what a career she has in store for us.Although somewhat long and dragging in places you can only enjoy so many shots of young girls in tights dancing  no hang on... 'Hana and Alice' is a rare instance where one is allowed a flight of fancy without the attendant guilt and in which friendship is explored with affection not angst. Don't let the fluffy romance tag fool you this is a film which makes you nostalgic for those dreary days back in youth when you had your best friend walk alongside you on the way to school and didn't realize how special or fleeting it was.".

	schema:headline " Dreamworks";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilersNo not Mr. Spielberg's outfit which incidentally also has my high regards. I'm talking here about the somewhat dreamy quality entirely complimentarily meant of this recent work of Japanese director Shunji Iwai whom some describe as a 'poetic' director.As the title suggests this is a story about two girls Hana 'Flower' and Alice. Not suggested by the title however is the asymmetry  this is Alice's story even though Hana has an important part to play too.It may seem slightly odd that director Iwai should take so long at the beginning of the film in taking us along the inseparable pair's inconsequential daydreaming wanderings. The length of this opening sequence however is of crucial significance in underscoring the metamorphosis in their relationship. As we soon find out these two a going through the transition from junior high to high school. After this opening sequence the two are rarely seen together until towards the end of this 135 minute film. As Hana says to Alice on the phone they are in high school now and should not be like a pair of twins anymore. While the motivation for her to say that is actually to spend more time with her newfound boyfriend there's more truth to what she said than she realizes.Played by slightly chubby Anne Suzuki but not quite as chubby as she was in 'Returner' Hana tricks shy Masashi Miyamoto into believing that he has amnesia and that she is his girlfriend. Other than the typical persona of a playful teenager we do not see very much of Hana's character until quite some time later. Of her family we also know little except for an ordinary middle class mother who is not embarrassed to walk around in underwear in front of her daughter's teenage boyfriend a little playfulness on the part of director Iwai as seen throughout the film.The focus now turns to Alice and we are taken into the layers of her character. After seeing her somewhat laid back and timid disposition at a talent scout interview we learn about the family that must have played a large part in shaping her character. We first saw her tempremental mother the only other member of her household who introduces her as 'the girl next door' to her boyfriend when they run into her by chance. Most poignant however is a day she spends with her father a regular but infrequent event. In his thoughtful sensitive touch director Iwai shows us how Alice is cool to his father in the beginning but gradually warms up during the course of the day they spend together in various picturesque part of Tokyo including I believe the Meiji Shrine. The poignancy is in that while the father while obviously caring cannot empathize with the teenage girl's yearning for paternal love. With tears in her eyes as the door of the train is closing Alice whispers 'Father I love you' to which he replies with a polite kindly smile 'You should be saying 'goodbye' undoubtedly well meant as an instruction of Japanese etiquette. While the romance Hana longs for with Miyamoto does not blossom although there is beautiful flower in abundance anywhere she appears an unexpected to her only certainly not to the audience turn of events leads to Alice being asked by Hana to play the role of Miyamoto's exgirl friend. As the intriguing triangle develops we see interaction between the two girls again as well as some tender affectionate scenes with Alice and Miyamoto.This then is essentially the plot. But why dreamworks? In one way or another the three main characters are going through a dream. By the very fact that he is living through the illusion that he has amnesia the somewhat enigmatic and unexpressive Miyamoto can be said to be really having amnesia of forgetting something that never was. He talks to Hana about the very dreams that he has but in the end it mysterious comes out that he is aware of what's going on all along. Iwai thrives on these mental tricks. Hana is the creator of Miyamoto's dream as well as her own a teenage girl's romantic infatuation. At the end she awakes to a new level of maturity and the restoration of her friendship with Alice appropriately elevated. Through the masquerade she has been forced into by her best friend Alice breaks out of her dreamy cocoon discovering some of her own delicate feelings as well as gaining her confidence that soars in her triumphant ballet performance at the crucial interview.The visual images throughout the film carry the hallmark of Iwai. We see splendorous scenes of blossom fields with crisp clarity as well as mystic outfocused scenes of dreamy landscape. We see abrupt jump cuts in succession as well as wondering languid shots. We see human object framed in endless varieties. Most remembered is the sequence on the group of girls posing at the end of the ballet school with the still pictures eventually finding their way into a photo exhibition which plays a pivotal role in eventually mending the rift between the two girls. The music mainly alternating between piano and strings is equally attention demanding if not more so. It would almost be considered distracting had it not been so beautiful. As the audience you somehow just have to develop the capacity to take in music and vision both. Last words? This is a film worth seeing again and again and again.".

	onyx:emotionText "spoilersNo not Mr. Spielberg's outfit which incidentally also has my high regards. I'm talking here about the somewhat dreamy quality entirely complimentarily meant of this recent work of Japanese director Shunji Iwai whom some describe as a 'poetic' director.As the title suggests this is a story about two girls Hana 'Flower' and Alice. Not suggested by the title however is the asymmetry  this is Alice's story even though Hana has an important part to play too.It may seem slightly odd that director Iwai should take so long at the beginning of the film in taking us along the inseparable pair's inconsequential daydreaming wanderings. The length of this opening sequence however is of crucial significance in underscoring the metamorphosis in their relationship. As we soon find out these two a going through the transition from junior high to high school. After this opening sequence the two are rarely seen together until towards the end of this 135 minute film. As Hana says to Alice on the phone they are in high school now and should not be like a pair of twins anymore. While the motivation for her to say that is actually to spend more time with her newfound boyfriend there's more truth to what she said than she realizes.Played by slightly chubby Anne Suzuki but not quite as chubby as she was in 'Returner' Hana tricks shy Masashi Miyamoto into believing that he has amnesia and that she is his girlfriend. Other than the typical persona of a playful teenager we do not see very much of Hana's character until quite some time later. Of her family we also know little except for an ordinary middle class mother who is not embarrassed to walk around in underwear in front of her daughter's teenage boyfriend a little playfulness on the part of director Iwai as seen throughout the film.The focus now turns to Alice and we are taken into the layers of her character. After seeing her somewhat laid back and timid disposition at a talent scout interview we learn about the family that must have played a large part in shaping her character. We first saw her tempremental mother the only other member of her household who introduces her as 'the girl next door' to her boyfriend when they run into her by chance. Most poignant however is a day she spends with her father a regular but infrequent event. In his thoughtful sensitive touch director Iwai shows us how Alice is cool to his father in the beginning but gradually warms up during the course of the day they spend together in various picturesque part of Tokyo including I believe the Meiji Shrine. The poignancy is in that while the father while obviously caring cannot empathize with the teenage girl's yearning for paternal love. With tears in her eyes as the door of the train is closing Alice whispers 'Father I love you' to which he replies with a polite kindly smile 'You should be saying 'goodbye' undoubtedly well meant as an instruction of Japanese etiquette.

	schema:reviewBody "Iwai's tale of friendship and love among 15yearolds is a bittersweet affair joyous and poignant in fragments. It is not a perfect film but still imbued with enough of Iwai's visual flair and inventiveness to raise it above much of what Japan has offered up in the first decade of the 21st century.Hana Anne Suzuki is inadvertently brought to Makun by her best friend Alice Y Aoi. She utilizes an accident to convince clumsy Makun Tomohiro Kaku that he has lost his memory and that she is the love of his life. The lie grows out of control and sucks in the best friend. Alice meanwhile has her own troubles to contend with namely an eccentric mother disinterested father and an actingmodeling opportunity that continually misfires.Like Iwai's 'Love Letter' the essentials of the plot are intricately laid out but ultimately matter less than the shotbyshot scenebyscene poetry conjured up by camera light and direction. There is one breathtaking shot in a classroom when Astro Boy is revealed watching brazenly over a lover's tiff. The manga motif serves to underline the heightened emotions and extreme dramatics of the tale. Similar optical playfulness is employed when Hana watches Makun on the train seemingly in conversation with his girlfriend. That shot is matched later when we are optically fooled into thinking Makun will kiss Alice. It is this continual ability to surprise and delight that means the 2hour plus running time while selfindulgent manages not to feel too much of an imposition.There are some wonderful set pieces to celebrate here. Alice's father making a complete mess of gifting his daughter a fountain pen is painful and hilarious. Ditto Hana's mother appearing in her undies before a shellshocked Makun. A klutzy classmate's photos of the girls in ballet tutus turn out to be magical. These scenes stagy and contrived in the hands of a lesser mortal are fluid vivid and delightful when presented by Iwai.It is testament to Iwai's genius that a host of Alisters line up for walkon parts in this film. For example Hirsohi Abe used to playing leads is practically an extra here when he shows up as the boyfriend of Alice's mum. What other living director elicits such reverence? Hana and Alice glows quite literally. The film captures that vividness of passionate friendships and love first encountered that only the qualia of a 15yearold knows. Ultimately the running time is a shade too flabby to count it among Iwai's masterpieces the plural is deliberate but this is a subtle complex film worthy of repeat viewing.".

I found Aoi Yu and Suzuki Anne very easy to relate to recalling the confusion insecurities etc of high school days. It is one of Iwai's more comedic pieces and at the same time subtly moving. It was not overly simplistic or clear cut. And I especially enjoyed Aoi's ballet solo toward the end of the film both for the solo itself and it's place in the story I think that fans of Iwai's style will enjoy it.Keep an eye out for the many cameos Hirosue Ryoko of ARITA Osawa Takao of Lily Chouchou Ito Ayumi of Swallowtail and Lily Chouchou...

	schema:reviewBody "In recent years Japanese director Shunji Iwai has become the dark poet of adolescence exhibiting a profound insight into how teenagers think and act capturing the rhythms of their speech and depicting their not always smooth transitions from being a child to becoming an adult. Iwai's bleak 2001 film All About Lily Chou Chou dramatized the isolation and emotional torment that accompanies teenage bullying and the failure of modern technology to provide an outlet for loneliness. The polar opposite is Hana and Alice his 2004 film just released on DVD which shows the sweet perhaps too innocent side of Japanese high school life without any hint of the turbulence displayed in Lily.Written and directed by Iwai who also composed the musical score Hana and Alice is a charming comedydrama of friendship and conflict between two junior high school girls who fall for the same boy depicting their gradually developing ability to handle complex emotional situations without the typical comingofage clichs. Originally filmed as three shorts for a candy commercial Hana Anne Suzuki and Alice Yu Aoi are fifteen year old high school students and best friends. Alice is the more freespirited and creative of the two while Hana is more reserved but still quite playful. The two go to school each morning on the train attend the same ballet classes and are virtually inseparable.On the train they both notice a handsome student Miyamoto Tomohiro Kaku traveling with a tall Americanlooking boy who they guess is his older brother. Hana pursuing her new interest joins the school drama club where Miyamoto just happens to be a member. Following him home after school Hana watches in horror as Miyamoto his head buried deep in a book and seemingly oblivious to the world around him walks headfirst into a garage door and is knocked unconscious. Seizing the opportunity after coming to his aid she tells him that his accident has caused him to forget that she is his girlfriend. She solicits Alice's help in pretending to be his exgirl friend but the more convoluted the lies become the more strain is put on the girls' relationship especially when Alice develops strong romantic feelings for Miyamoto.Hana and Alice is a beautifully filmed and often very funny film that features gorgeous cinematography by the late Noburu Shinoda magnificent music and ballet sequences and brilliant performances by Aoi Suzuki and Kaku. The film has many memorable moments including an enchanting fiveminute ballet sequence a tearful confession by Hana minutes before she is to go on stage to perform a glowing photo shoot of the ballet class outside at night a fight on the beach between the two girls and Alice's loving visit with her estranged father. While the story is thin and feels stretched over 135 minutes Iwai's subtle delineation of character and insight into adolescent life makes Hana and Alice a film to cherish.".

	schema:reviewBody "It didn't take me too long to realize that Iwai is one the cinematic epitomes of rich human elaborations as well as a cultivating virtuoso and a master of abstract imagery and atmosphere. As an amateur film maker I couldn't have been more appreciative of the way he combined subtle expressions with sounds of music that set moods for his characters in the most distinctive and relating way.Obviously out of the wide range of movies he did from the initial look Hana and Alice seemed most linkable to All About Lilly ChouChou. In a way it seemed like a new chapter to the original film which took on friendship in a harsh and mesmerizing manner and more ways than not Hana and Alice was just what I wanted to see from Iwai.As we meet the lead characters nothing seems extraordinary and we get a glimpse of what two friends do on their way to and out of school. Iwai perfectly capable of story telling without any twisting premises set up and he can go on for hours it seems by simply offering realistic dialogs and gorgeous visuals. Of course when the male character gets introduced the chances of a conflict quickly arise but the story chooses to shelf Alice for the short time while letting Hana follow Miyamoto as he numbly recites poetry without looking ahead. Really there is no point in me detailing how exactly the trio come about it's nothing astounding but entertaining and at times harmlessly humorous.Other minor but compelling conflicts are planted in both Hana's and Alice's lives but the building blocks seem more geared toward heightening the love interest of the two leads. In the midst of all the romance and friendly endeavors Iwai doesn't shy away from creating ambiance as he once again reels into the darkness similar to what he did in AALCC but this time around with dove like images of ballerinas dancing and glimmering under a pursuing light. All of this fitting beautifully with the story and underlining his unique style.Obviously equal emphasis is put on how Hana and Alice mature with time and since the film is rather long sufficient time is given for that to convey albeit through some events that might seem a bit filler to those unaccustomed to Iwai's style. Considering how young the actors are their delivery was perfect and they were able to pull me right in as I developed a genuine fascination for what they were going through. However as the film was nearing the end the romance slowly deflated. The resolution with Miyamoto was carried out abruptly toward the end. Understandably so it seemed like his sole purpose was to strengthen the bond and importance of Hana's and Alice's friendship but not so much to make the truly worthwhile romantic impact that the film was using as its backbone the entire time. Again that's something that was purposely articulated and may not please all.Some might find such closure to be a bit inadequate others might find Hana and Alice's reunion after a minor struggle with love to be enchanting and perfectly satisfying. I got pleasantly stranded right in between as this film was able to hit some strong marks with great acting and Iwai's superb visuals. Definitely an easy recommendation to the fans of the director and alike.".

Really there is no point in me detailing how exactly the trio come about it's nothing astounding but entertaining and at times harmlessly humorous.Other minor but compelling conflicts are planted in both Hana's and Alice's lives but the building blocks seem more geared toward heightening the love interest of the two leads. In the midst of all the romance and friendly endeavors Iwai doesn't shy away from creating ambiance as he once again reels into the darkness similar to what he did in AALCC but this time around with dove like images of ballerinas dancing and glimmering under a pursuing light. All of this fitting beautifully with the story and underlining his unique style.Obviously equal emphasis is put on how Hana and Alice mature with time and since the film is rather long sufficient time is given for that to convey albeit through some events that might seem a bit filler to those unaccustomed to Iwai's style. Considering how young the actors are their delivery was perfect and they were able to pull me right in as I developed a genuine fascination for what they were going through. However as the film was nearing the end the romance slowly deflated. The resolution with Miyamoto was carried out abruptly toward the end. Understandably so it seemed like his sole purpose was to strengthen the bond and importance of Hana's and Alice's friendship but not so much to make the truly worthwhile romantic impact that the film was using as its backbone the entire time. Again that's something that was purposely articulated and may not please all.Some might find such closure to be a bit inadequate others might find Hana and Alice's reunion after a minor struggle with love to be enchanting and perfectly satisfying. I got pleasantly stranded right in between as this film was able to hit some strong marks with great acting and Iwai's superb visuals. Definitely an easy recommendation to the fans of the director and alike.";

	schema:headline " Who would've thought that this masterpiece came from a KitKat commercial";
	schema:reviewBody "Hana  Alice began as a series of shorts to promote Nestle's KitKat candy bars. Through the genius of director Shunji Iwai this evolved into not just a feature film but a darned profound one. In the DVD features he talks about how much of the movie was improvised but it doesn't show. The end result is a very thoughtful seemingly carefullyplanned poetic view of friendship memories and our individual yearnings for things that are out of our grasp.The plot itself is very cute and interesting a girl conspires to snatch a boyfriend by convincing the boy that he has amnesia and is in love with her. He's just dense enough to fall for it. But things get tricky when he starts asking questions causing the girl to enlist the help of her best friend in deceiving him. It's a great comedy of Shakespearean proportions but what makes it particularly fun to watch is the gorgeous way in which it's told.If you're unfamiliar with the works of Shunji Iwai this is a great place to start. He is a great artistic director who does not necessarily get bogged down in poetry beyond the realm of mere mortals such as us. In other words he has a unique visionary style that's not pretentious or overly experimental. If I were to sum up his style in one sentence it would be that he allows the scene to speak for itself without too many camera theatrics. You can expect to see long scenes without disruptive cuts without much camera motion or with a simple graceful linear camera movement following the actors rather than jumpy MTv editing. This is actually an approach used by several great Japanese directors I've seen like Hideaki Anno Ritual and Takeshi Kitano Fireworks Kikujoro and perhaps it is derived from the master Kurosawa himself.Something else worth noting is that the director composed all the music himself furthering the idea that the presentation we get is very lucid and consistent with itself. The music compliments each scene as if telling the story as opposed to background filler.While the plot may seem straightforward there's actually quite a lot of complexity under the surface. Each character is driven by some inner yearning and their actions are not necessarily clear until you discover what drives each person. Thus things remain unpredictable until the end when you get a chance to digest why each person is the way they are.There's fantastic acting all around and both Anne Suzuki Hana and Y Aoi Alice get a chance to shine. Hana's moment is in a powerful monologue near the end while Alice's moment is in a gorgeous ballet routine which will stun you into silence.Much like German director Wim Wenders' film Lisbon Story which began as a promotional spot for the city of Lisbon yet evolved into a poetic masterpiece Shunji Iwai's Hana  Alice is just about the best candy bar commercial you'll ever see in your life.".

He's told he was in love with one then both. They both act parts fashion entire pasts and emotions.So love as this game of fiction and getting to allow to be seduced by an image. This is excellent work and in how it's subtly acknowledged inside the film one girl signs up for a drama class and has in fact done so to be close to the boy himself an actor the other is randomly approached on the street to model for TV commercials  and this may well reference Mikio Naruse's wonderful Street without Return from '34.So the third layer is how the play is going to be resolved on a level behind the base narrative of ordinary life and into the stage where love is the heightened game of duplicity. One ploy is simple enough opening day for the school play both girl and boy were rehearsing and a nearperfect rendition of the mechanisms that give rise to images out on the stage performance roles fiction consumed as real and backstage the internal machinations of tortured soul. The other is a little more intricate because of how unassuming Alice auditions for a part in TV commercial.Now so far this is no different than a French film. Notice what Iwai does an extra layer that is deeply Japanese. Now the Japanese idea of high beauty and by extension performance what is often perceived as quaint reticence is formless heart expressed in visible form. Meditation. But even a patriarch of Chan like Hongren could not so simply gauge his pupils' inner heart when the time came to decide for a succesor.

So much so that it slipped from her a bad actress in terms of the conventional drama of the world. We trust however that even though the image is false she's moved to it truthfully. Her audition is to play an image on a screen. Instead the director decides on a whim that he wants her to do a ballet dance as per her resume and in a short skirt an almost humiliating prospect.

This time involving the young trio of Hana Alice and Masashi.The story begins with the friends Hana acted by Suzuki Anne Returner 9 Souls and Alice Aoi Yu All About Lily Chou Chou Harmful Insect crossing frozen fields to a distant train station. There Alice shows Hana the object of her affection a tall JapaneseAmerican. The two girls ride the the train many times.

One day while following her crush Hana witnesses Masashi hits his head hard on a garage door knocking him to the ground. Hana rushes up to him and asks him if he is okay. Masashi begins reciting some of his rakugo lines and is convinced that he is okay but Hana asks him if he remembers her. On this he is not so clear Hana then states that she is his girlfriend. This of course shocks Masashi and so begins the process of Masashi trying to recover from an amnesia created by the lovesick Hana.I was worried by the premise of this film at first because it has been done a number of times before. However I should have had more faith in Iwai Shunji. This is truly a good film and it really tugs on the heart strings. Those of us who have had our love for someone else nonreciprocated while definitely be touched. The acting is well done. Especially that of Aoi Yu who played Tsuda Shiori the young girl forced to be a prostitute in Lily Chou Chou. The music as always is very nice and this time it was actually composed by Iwai Shunji.".

What will happen to the relationship of the three.I have a lot of friends but I don't have friends like Hana and Alice. They are always together and they say everything each other. They look happy and I think it is good thing. However friends sometimes become rivals. In this movie Hana and Alice love the same man and they become rivals each other. I think moderate distance is important. We can share glad feeling or sad experience with our friends but not interfere deeply. By watching this movie we can rethink about the relationships with our friends.".

One day Hana falls in love with a boy who goes to the same high school. Hana deceives the boy and gets him. However the boy loves Alice and Alice also loves him. What will happen to the relationship of the three.I have a lot of friends but I don't have friends like Hana and Alice. They are always together and they say everything each other. They look happy and I think it is good thing. However friends sometimes become rivals. In this movie Hana and Alice love the same man and they become rivals each other. I think moderate distance is important. We can share glad feeling or sad experience with our friends but not interfere deeply. By watching this movie we can rethink about the relationships with our friends.";

The strengths of the story come from the chemistry of ordinary characters filmed in a loose narrative. As a result don't expect a fastmoving plot heavy on easy humor or bawdry. HANA AND ALICE certainly has its memorable quirks but nearly all of Ieai's films the narrative is naturalistic the story fairly long at two hours fifteen minutes.

The story has too many elements that lead nowhere without having much to say and that also goes for the relationship between Hana and the boy.

	schema:headline " Movie about two friends falling for the same person in a Asian high school yes it's been done before but it's alright";
	schema:reviewBody "The plot of this movie has been done countless times in Asian dramas two girls falling for the same guy. The direction can be sort of cartoony at times and over ridiculous for this type of movie but something about it still makes the movie worthwhile to watch. It's one of those movies that your just going to have to go with in order to enjoy it. The story first starts out with lies leading to bigger lies and so forth but that is just the surface of it all. Watching this was sort of like watching a Asian drama except instead of taking up few episodes this sums up the story in one movie. Some of the flaws is how it makes one of the character more likable between the two. If it made both characters likable than it would have been more interesting to watch. But this direction where it shows the different side of each characters was done in a pretty good manner and still engaging so it's sort of passable. Yeah so the set up is ridiculous and not that believable but than again most Asian dramas are like that. Some parts seem to drag on a bit although very few. Also since there wasn't enough development between characters it would have been better if it elevated the relationships. And so it can give more of a reason behind the final decision of the male protagonist in the end. It didn't even show his final decision clearly even if he isn't the main part of the story some of the audiences probably want to know his final decision after sitting through one of the focus of this film. Another thing I didn't like was the lead actor the guy that has two girls falling for him something about him I found really annoying and irritating to watch. And no it's not because two girls were falling for him it's just the actor. And it wasn't just his performance either maybe he reminded me of someone I know in real life. All the main actor does in this movie is act all dull and tedious and make a awkward shock face occasionally. But he was a annoying character in this but I guess it had to have someone that is gullible which is fine but he was just irritating and so boring to watch. It just would have been nice if he had some likable attributes or show attributes of why these girls would fall for him plus it would make the movie somewhat believable. Well at least he wasn't a over cocky character which would have been way worse. The movie runs about 2 hours and it would have made the movie better if it had more development so it can answer the question why. Being fast paced is sometimes good and all but it's difficult to buy into the chemistry between the characters because of lack of development. Despite some of the flaws besides the main actor in this movie it had enough of it's moments to make it to around the 6 range. Especially the part where Yu Aoi does ballet which was the main highlight for me I don't like watching ballet but that scene was nice.6.710".

In exile outside the city walls Franois looks for ways to protect France from Burgundy's plots. When Charles plans to have one of his associates marry the king's ward Charlotte Villon successfully disrupts the engagement but for so doing is sentenced to death.

	schema:reviewBody "THE BELOVED ROGUE United Artists 1927 directed by Alan Crosland offers John Barrymore the opportunity of enacting a role portrayed numerous times on stage and screen by other actors that of Francois Villon the first great poet of France. Villon had been portrayed on screen in IF I WERE KING by William Farnum Fox 1920 and Ronald Colman Paramount 1938 while Dennis King 1930 and Oreste 1956 did the musical versions of Paramount's THE VAGABOND KING. John Barrymore's characterization ranks one of the finer carnations as well as bazaar. Villon in THE BELOVED ROGUE is described through intertitles as poet pickpocket patriot loving France earnestly Frenchwomen excessively French wine exclusively. A fun loving fool sporting Peter Pan attire with Robin Hood tights who recites poetry whenever it suits him steals from the rich and gives to the poor and travels along with two other companions Jehan Slim Summerville and Nicholas Mack Swain all the similarities of a Douglas Fairbanks adventure combining Robin Hood D'Artagnan of the Three Musketeers and Zorro all into one. Francois Villon is far from being a fictional character originated in novels he actually lived 14311463. How much displayed on screen to be fact is uncertain but Barrymore performs in the manner of having himself a grand ole time whether romancing a girl or sliding down roof tops covered with snow. THE BELOVED ROGUE is not actually a biography of the famed poet but the spirit of the man undisciplined and riotous with a gift of writing and reciting poetry.Aside from the lighter moments mentioned that may give the impression of a costume comedy set in medieval times THE BELOVED ROGUE starts off dramatically in Vauxcelles France the year 1432 with the execution of Francis De Montcorbier as he is burned at the stake in the fashion of Joan of Arc. His wife Lucy Beaumont who looks on with bitterness afterword's gives birth to a son she hopes will live for France as her husband died for it. The child grows up to become Francois Villon John Barrymore and 25 years later he is seen entertaining the crowds after being elected The King of Fools for All Fool's Day in the guise of a clown. When he makes a witty jest at the expense of Duke Charles of Burgundy Lawson Butt his cousin King Louis XI Conrad Veidt banishes him from Paris. Villon returns to Paris anyway and after supplying food and wine to the poor using the king's catapult Villon discovered by the king escapes as he himself is thrown from the catapult flying through the air and landing himself in the boudoir of Charlotte De Vauxcelles Marceline Day the King's ward forced into a loveless marriage to Count Thibault Henry Victor a henchman of a plotting Burgundy. Villon's speech and manner makes him Grand Constable of France but after revealing the schemes perpetrated against the king Villon is captured tortured through flogging and pitted against the flames of fire before his death sentence is to be carried out. This is followed by one of the more memorable scenes where the weakened Villon is placed inside a metal cagelike structure as it is lifted up and left dangling outside the window of the palace tower where Charlotte is held prisoner before her proposed wedding. With much more to follow the movie fails to disappoint. The supporting cast includes Rose Dione as Marget Angelo Rossito as Beppo the dwarf and Dick Sutherland as Tristam L'Hermite the busiest man in France  the executioner. Look quickly for future child actor Dickie Moore early in the story as the infant Francois. German actor Conrad Veidt making his Hollywood debut comes close to being unrecognizable as the eccentric King Louis XI. Described as superstitious crafty cruel and a slave to the stars he fails to make a move without the advise of his astrologer Nigel DeBrulier. Marceline Day performs her task well in the typical damsel in distress manner.Not as well known as Barrymore's notable silents as DON JUAN Warners 1926 THE BELOVED ROGUE is a lavish scale production with Paris settings reminiscent to ORPHANS OF THE STORM 1921 and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME 1923 compliments of set designer William Cameron Menzies. Good camera angles and overhead camera shots also add to numerous shots of Barrymore's classic profile.THE BELOVED ROGUE was one of the 13 silent features aired on public television's The Silent Years 1971 hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian film collection accompanied with excellent piano score by William Perry the same print distributed on video cassette in 1998 by Critic's Choice Masterpiece Collection from which this review was based. At the length of 99 minutes running times may differ due to projection speed. Other distributors such as Video Yesteryear in the 1980s possess a copy to THE BELOVED ROGUE at 147 minutes. Which version is better depends on the individual viewer. THE BELOVED ROGUE might be one of the most overlooked of all silent movies due to the lack of television revivals in recent years however it is something to consider especially for silent film enthusiasts andor film historians who enjoy watching both Barrymore and Veidt hamming it up to a point of laughter and disbelief.

	schema:reviewBody "Besides being entertaining in itself with plenty of action wit and more this feature gives John Barrymore an excellent role that plays to his strengths and that gives him a lot of good material to work with. Barrymore's vigorous style works well in the role and he has many opportunities for drama humor and romance.The story is based very loosely on the life of the 15th century French poet Franois Villon but it really only uses the character and the basics of the historical setting. The character that the script creates though is not only a great role for Barrymore but is wellconceived as a movie character. And if Barrymore's entertaining portrayal of Villon fanciful though it is encourages anyone to find out more about the historical Villon so much the better.The real Villon was both a worse criminal and a better poet than the movie suggests. A number of his crimes were truly harmful offenses rather than the impish pranks that he plays in the movie. At the same time his poetry was quite a bit deeper than is suggested by the occasional light verses in the intertitles.Conrad Veidt is cast as King Louis XI Villon's sometime friend and sometimes persecutor. Veidt gives a really good turn to the character using his physical posture and mannerisms to suggest the king's complex character.There are a number of good sequences that are sheer entertainment such as the catapult scene and Villon's first visit to Charlotte's palace and that are rather impressive on the production end too. The story as a whole is the best kind of historical melodrama with numerous turns of fortune and plenty going on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon.  Although remade in the thirties as IF I WERE KING with Frank Lloyd directing Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring this version is even better. Barrymore with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the winedepressed Villon with a verve that Colman could not match.  The photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly Conrad Veidt in his American premiere the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day and the supporting comics Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal every scene they are in.It is a shame that Barrymore did so few firstrate comedies.  Among his sound films only his lead in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice.  In this silent movie Barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fools and tenderly as Villon in love.  He even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of Fairbanks most convincingly. He also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era.Finally a brief word about Alan Crosland a director known today only for directing the first talking feature THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year this was released.  Crosland was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known.  Perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his bestknown work will be your introduction to his other talents.  If so you could do far worse.".

Whereas in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues like he was in this film. In reality he wrote some lovely verse and was frequently on the wrong side of the lawnot the combination of a patriot and Robin Hoodlike character like he is in the film. Provided you know that the film is nearly 100 fiction then it's well worth seeingjust don't assume it's a good history lesson.In THE BELOVED ROGUE Villon is played with wild abandon by John Barrymore. I was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto who was the plucky dwarf played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films. Mack Swain is best known as the silent film foil in many of Chaplin's short films and played his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a nice job and have no complaintseven with Barrymore's rather overthetop treatment that was rather reminiscent of a Douglas Fairbanks performance. However the performance I had a serious problem with was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this unsubtle would be a gross understatement. He played the role like a high schooler who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical Richard IIIskulking about and acting like a demoniacal caricature. While Veidt was wonderful in many many films both silent and sound but here he is just ridiculous.As for the story it's full of lusty adventure and actionlike a swashbuckling film minus the sailing ships. The sets worked out well for all this as they'd been used the previous year for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were set around the same time period.Overall it's one of the last great silent films. There's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance comedy and action. Well worth seeing though it loses a couple of points for Veidt's overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history.By the way this film was also made twice as IF I WERE KING 1920 and 1938 and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. However in total six films have been about Villon and tell more or less variations on the same tale!".

	schema:headline " John Barrymore Is Fit to Be King";
	schema:reviewBody "In 15th century Paris poetic lover John Barrymore as Francois Villon leads crowds in an extended celebration of All Fools' Day which irks King Conrad Veidt as Louis XI. Consequently Mr. Barrymore is banished to the outskirts. After Barrymore is caught sneaking back to the city Mr. Veidt sentences him to death. Barrymore proves himself cleverer than your usual connoisseur of wine women and song. He convinces the superstitions Mr. Veidt their deaths are destined to occur within the same day and becomes a pampered member of the court. Soon Barrymore risks his life to rescue beautifully figured Marceline Day as Charlotte and save France...This version of If I Were King is obviously tailormade for Barrymore. The United Artists production values are very high.Barrymore was one of the best actors around through the 1920s. He appeared in relatively few films but they were carefully selected.

	onyx:emotionText "In 15th century Paris poetic lover John Barrymore as Francois Villon leads crowds in an extended celebration of All Fools' Day which irks King Conrad Veidt as Louis XI. Consequently Mr. Barrymore is banished to the outskirts. After Barrymore is caught sneaking back to the city Mr. Veidt sentences him to death. Barrymore proves himself cleverer than your usual connoisseur of wine women and song. He convinces the superstitions Mr. Veidt their deaths are destined to occur within the same day and becomes a pampered member of the court. Soon Barrymore risks his life to rescue beautifully figured Marceline Day as Charlotte and save France...This version of If I Were King is obviously tailormade for Barrymore. The United Artists production values are very high.Barrymore was one of the best actors around through the 1920s. He appeared in relatively few films but they were carefully selected. Here he is probably at his hammiest  which he admitted upon seeing the film at a crowded premiere. Not to be outdone Veidt chews a fair share of the scenery. Lucy Beaumont leads an accomplished supporting cast. However hammy Barrymore is highly appealing. He is also despite reports to the contrary still in peak physical form.

Lois XI has been shown to be blindly dependent on the astrologers his actual statecrafts and the intrigues for which he was called spider are totally negated. In fact his physical characteristics were made like a spider. His reforms his bonhomie with the common men too were completely overlooked. Lois XI was historically too different and supposed to be a far better person from the caricature that is shown. Villon too is another historical figure but again his life especially the end doesn't match with history nor does the fate of Charles the Duke Of Burgundy. It could have been better if he hadn't attended the ceremony since the fictionalized Count and fictionalized Charlotte's story won't have hurt the history. Of course the relation between Lois and Charles are real as was between Villon and Lois who had a very kind disposition towards Villon. Even the end of Villon isn't right since Villon in reality had simply disappeared from public undoubtedly dead but as an unknown person. The only facts are Charles Duke of Burgundy's enmity to Lois Villon's being close and loyal to the King Lois and his much more than what is shown bohemian life. If I leave the historical aspects and treat it just as a movie  not based on real people  I give it 8 stars. Merceline Day looked gorgeous JB was of course a consummate actor a bit theatrical on today's standard but I have to look at the trend then and also remember it is a silent movie so a bit of overexpression is required. Conrad as Lois XI had been creepy as this story called for. So over all as a fiction movie it is enjoyable.But knowing that this is as well as an historical movie the stars go down due to blatant contradiction with facts.

John Barrymore plays 15th century French poet Francois Villon who with his pals Jehan Slim Summerville Nicholas Mack Swain and Beppo the Dwarf Angelo Rossito live among the beggars of Paris. They go about life with a devil may care attitude enjoying the wine woman and song of the Parisian streets.The film opens on a serious note with Villon's father being burned at the stake for being a patriot. When Francois grows to be a famous poet hope is held out that as his father had DIED for France his son would LIVE for France. But Francois has become a beggar in the streets and is elected as The King of Fools by the street crowd. When confronted by the Duke of Burgundy Lawson Butt who has designs on the French throne held by King Louis XI Conrad Veidt Francois insults him and is ordered arrested by Louis who also happened on the scene.Francois is banished from the kingdom and is forced to live outside the walls of the city.

The King reluctantly agrees.Villon and his pals commandere a wagon full of food and drink bound for the Paris aristocrats.

The actors and acting are generally very good too Fita Benkhoff is great and the Kessler twins add a lively touch. Only Gunther Philipp is too old for the role of Jan not only to make a believable student but even more so as a desirable husband for Komtesse Bronislawa. However half of Millcker's music is missing! Many of those beautiful and wellknown songs simply do not show up. Some of the key lyrics are used in the dialog but this just reminds the viewer what is missing. It seems the script writer tried to concentrate on the story line and didn't have the time left for the songs.

I read 'Biggles of 266' when I was aged 10 and 29 years later I'm still reading the adventures.What a waste of the Biggles movie license.The film wasn't all bad though. Neil Dickson's portrayal of Biggles was spot on. The supporting actors did a pretty good job as well. The production design was excellent well the 1917 bits anyway. That takes care of the good points.Where the hell did they drag that soundtrack up from? Nasty is what I call it. I actually cringed during the film due to inapropriate music.The stunts were mostly unnecessary egoboosting cliches.The script was a total nightmare. Either copy Indiana Jones OR Back to the Future not BOTH! If they'd cut the 80s bit out cast HydeWhite as an american reporter and kept the secret weapon bits in I would have no quibble with this film.I would recommend buying the DVD if only for the unintentionally hilarious documentary. ..we thought a big star would've 'unbalanced' the film... you don't say!!!3.99 at WH Smiths  buy it now!

I read 'Biggles of 266' when I was aged 10 and 29 years later I'm still reading the adventures.What a waste of the Biggles movie license.The film wasn't all bad though. Neil Dickson's portrayal of Biggles was spot on. The supporting actors did a pretty good job as well. The production design was excellent well the 1917 bits anyway.

Modern physics denies that such waves can exist but Tesla was convinced that they did and according to some he provided it Tesla Horwitzer. The British actually developed the first theoretic underpinnings for a sound weapon of the type depicted in Biggles and frankly I thought that is where the idea came from. We moderns think far to much of our capabilities. What is happening today is that some open minded scientists are revisiting discarded Victorian science. How many people know that the modern principles of William Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic principles are taught today in a truncated form and that the missing parts may in fact provide the theory for effective wave weapons ever wonder why the US government spends so much time on Star Wars technology?. By the 1930s the Germans were developing a number of secret weapons including the so called death rays. I think it prudent to give early modern humans credit for being just as creative as our generation and a lot more open minded.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're on the Western Front in 1917 and the Germans have nearly finished work on a breakthrough secret weapon. This fiendish device emits high pitched powerful sound waves that...I'd better keep this simple...destroy the subcleotic structure of an object's crone base causing crystatin failure with subsequent nektonic surt degradation on a massive scale. This results in catastrophic softening of human flesh and brittle crumbling of metal structures and objects. At least that's how I think it works. If the Hun uses this weapon it could change the course of history as we know it. There's only one man who can stop this madness...British Captain James Bigglesworth Biggles to those who know him adventurer warrior always there when things are the diciest and yet driven by resolute honor. Biggles is the sort of man that schoolboys would look up to and who would devour the stories of his adventures. In fact between the end of WWI and the start of WWII British schoolboys did just that in tale after tale written by W.E. Johns. In this movie we discover something Johns apparently was unaware of. Some people it seems have time twins. When one of the time twins is in danger his twin will be sent instantly through time and space to help. That's the pickle young American marketing hotshot Jim Ferguson Alex HydeWhite head of Celebrity Dinners finds himself in. One moment he's worrying about whether the creamed corn looks like a dog's breakfast and the next he's running toward a downed British biplane in the middle of a blasted battlefield with whiz bangs falling around. He rescues the pilot...who is Biggles Neil Dickson. Only when Jim lands back to his own time does he get an explanation from no other than Peter Cushing in his last screen role as the aged Air Commodore William Raymond Special Air Force Retired who has quarters in 1A Tower Bridge London. Raymond was Biggles commander back then. He explains to Jim the phenomenon of time twins something modern scientists still are only beginning to understand. More importantly he explains the vital importance of Biggles' effort to locate and destroy this new German monstrosity. Biggles is aided only his loyal team made up of Ginger Algy and Bertie. Facing Biggles is the might of the Hun led by German fighter ace Eric Von Stalheim. Even though Jim's fiance Debbie thinks he's crazy Jim prepares himself to aid Biggles. Of course before long Debbie finds herself back in time too. The movie is absolute nonsense but good nonsense in my opinion. There's no nudgenudge by the director or the actors to let us know they're in on the joke. They play it straight which makes things all the more enjoyable. Neil Dickson is just fine as the strongchinned resolute resourceful brave honorable dashing Biggles. I'll not put a bullet in your head old boy he says at one point to Von Stalheim because that's not how we do business! Alex HydeWhite holds his own as the babyfaced but resolute Jim Ferguson very much a creature of the 1980's who now finds himself bouncing in and out of WWI. It looks like this town's been nuked he says to Biggles when they find themselves in the middle of a ruined town square. Nuked? What's that? Biggles asks. It's an American slang term. It means to overreact. And Peter Cushing looking even more skeletal than usual at 73 but still a commanding actor and reasonably spry brings the same kind of utterly believable delivery to his lines that he gave to mummies vampires and werewolves. It was good to see him again. Biggles was unfortunate in being released a year after Back to the Future came out. As a timetravel adventure it didn't compare and quickly faded. Still it's a fine example in my view of an affectionate stiffupperlip boy's own adventure. Biggles isn't a great movie or even a memorable one but it's competently made and it's fun. That's not a bad epitaph for a movie.".

Some people it seems have time twins. When one of the time twins is in danger his twin will be sent instantly through time and space to help. That's the pickle young American marketing hotshot Jim Ferguson Alex HydeWhite head of Celebrity Dinners finds himself in. One moment he's worrying about whether the creamed corn looks like a dog's breakfast and the next he's running toward a downed British biplane in the middle of a blasted battlefield with whiz bangs falling around. He rescues the pilot...who is Biggles Neil Dickson. Only when Jim lands back to his own time does he get an explanation from no other than Peter Cushing in his last screen role as the aged Air Commodore William Raymond Special Air Force Retired who has quarters in 1A Tower Bridge London. Raymond was Biggles commander back then. He explains to Jim the phenomenon of time twins something modern scientists still are only beginning to understand. More importantly he explains the vital importance of Biggles' effort to locate and destroy this new German monstrosity. Biggles is aided only his loyal team made up of Ginger Algy and Bertie. Facing Biggles is the might of the Hun led by German fighter ace Eric Von Stalheim. Even though Jim's fiance Debbie thinks he's crazy Jim prepares himself to aid Biggles. Of course before long Debbie finds herself back in time too. The movie is absolute nonsense but good nonsense in my opinion. There's no nudgenudge by the director or the actors to let us know they're in on the joke. They play it straight which makes things all the more enjoyable. Neil Dickson is just fine as the strongchinned resolute resourceful brave honorable dashing Biggles. I'll not put a bullet in your head old boy he says at one point to Von Stalheim because that's not how we do business! Alex HydeWhite holds his own as the babyfaced but resolute Jim Ferguson very much a creature of the 1980's who now finds himself bouncing in and out of WWI. It looks like this town's been nuked he says to Biggles when they find themselves in the middle of a ruined town square. Nuked? What's that? Biggles asks. It's an American slang term. It means to overreact. And Peter Cushing looking even more skeletal than usual at 73 but still a commanding actor and reasonably spry brings the same kind of utterly believable delivery to his lines that he gave to mummies vampires and werewolves. It was good to see him again. Biggles was unfortunate in being released a year after Back to the Future came out. As a timetravel adventure it didn't compare and quickly faded. Still it's a fine example in my view of an affectionate stiffupperlip boy's own adventure. Biggles isn't a great movie or even a memorable one but it's competently made and it's fun. That's not a bad epitaph for a movie.";

Other than that this is a witless affair indeed. It's quite sad to see the legendary Cushing slumming in such a weakly written cameo role. Some of the action sequences set during WW1 rise to the giddy heights of mediocre but the 1980s sequences are hopelessly tacky and the twist ending in which our irritating hero is zapped back to a cave full of cannibal tribesmen is just plain awful.

	schema:reviewBody "Cards on the table time  I have not read the 'Biggles' books by Captain W.E. Johns. I remember seeing them on sale in the children's book department of W.H. Smiths back in the 1970's but never plucked up the courage to actually buy one. I was more into the 'Nick Carter  Killmaster' novels. I assumed the 'Biggles' books to be jingoistic relics from the days when England was alleged to have ruled the waves  and skies  the sort of stories Grandad read as a boy. But that was then. Around the end of the decade a feature film was mooted starring John Cleese in the title role. Though it would have been interesting seeing the star of one flying circus in yet another it never happened. Dudley Moore's name next came up in connection with the project. Fine if they wanted to send up the character but not for an allegedly straight adaptation. Appearing on Granada's 'Clapperboard' to talk about the Robert Powell version of 'The ThirtyNine Steps'  which he had adapted  writer Michael Robson stated that he was currently working on a screenplay for 'Biggles'. As he said it he looked faintly embarrassed.The problem in bringing 'Biggles' to the Silver Screen was that the character  indeed the genre  had been sent up rotten over the years by amongst other things 'Monty Python' 'Ripping Yarns' and Russ Abbot. Just put a comedian in a World War One flying suit  with goggles  give him a handlebar moustache make him talk thus Wizard Prang! What larks! Shot down two Fokkers over the Channel. One did a belly flop over the teddy bear! and the audience would be certain to die laughing.In 1986 a 'Biggles' movie finally appeared. The writers decided to bring in a scifi element in an effort to grab some of the 'Back To The Future' audience. It starts in the thenpresent day with Jim Ferguson an ad man based in New York who is being stalked by a mysterious Englishman Colonel Raymond played by the great Peter Cushing  in what turned out to be his last role .Ferguson keeps jumping back in time for no apparent reason to 1917 where he meets flying ace James Bigglesworth or 'Biggles' for short. Biggles has discovered that the Germans have invented a new sonic device capable of mass destruction.So back and forth goes poor old Jim.

In one amusing scene Jim dresses as a W.W.1 soldier and waits in his hotel room to be blasted back to Biggles' side but it never happens. A cleaner finds him the next morning and laughs at him.Neil Dickson is not on screen enough of the time to warrant his top billing which is a pity as he's terrific in the role of 'Biggles'. Most of the film is devoted to Alex HydeWhite  son of Wilfrid  as 'Jim'. He's okay but I wish that the focus of the story was more on the title character. The action scenes while not as good as those of say 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' are nevertheless exciting. One particularly good moment has a helicopter containing Biggles and Jim winding up in 1917 where it comes in handy against the Germans. There's also a very emotional scene in 1986 where elderly Colonel Raymond is reunited with Biggles the latter not having aged a day since they last met. Overall this is an enjoyable romp but it is a shame that its makers did not have the confidence to make this a real 'Biggles' movie instead of trying to shoehorn him into a daft scifi story. Ironically the 1917 scenes have dated far less badly than the 1980's stuff. The rock soundtrack was another mistake.The director was John Hough whose other credits include 'The Legend Of Hell House' and the Hammer movie 'Twins Of Evil' as well as episodes of 'The Avengers' television series. 'Biggles' was dumped on by critics and ignored by the public when it came out but now seems quite charming. Interestingly around the time of its release I spotted a young boy coming out of a library with a heavy looking book  an omnibus edition of 'Biggles'. If the film for all its faults inspired someone to seek out and read the original stories then it could not have been a waste of time after all. I may give them a go myself one day.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cards on the table time  I have not read the 'Biggles' books by Captain W.E. Johns. I remember seeing them on sale in the children's book department of W.H. Smiths back in the 1970's but never plucked up the courage to actually buy one. I was more into the 'Nick Carter  Killmaster' novels. I assumed the 'Biggles' books to be jingoistic relics from the days when England was alleged to have ruled the waves  and skies  the sort of stories Grandad read as a boy. But that was then. Around the end of the decade a feature film was mooted starring John Cleese in the title role. Though it would have been interesting seeing the star of one flying circus in yet another it never happened. Dudley Moore's name next came up in connection with the project. Fine if they wanted to send up the character but not for an allegedly straight adaptation. Appearing on Granada's 'Clapperboard' to talk about the Robert Powell version of 'The ThirtyNine Steps'  which he had adapted  writer Michael Robson stated that he was currently working on a screenplay for 'Biggles'. As he said it he looked faintly embarrassed.The problem in bringing 'Biggles' to the Silver Screen was that the character  indeed the genre  had been sent up rotten over the years by amongst other things 'Monty Python' 'Ripping Yarns' and Russ Abbot. Just put a comedian in a World War One flying suit  with goggles  give him a handlebar moustache make him talk thus Wizard Prang! What larks! Shot down two Fokkers over the Channel. One did a belly flop over the teddy bear! and the audience would be certain to die laughing.In 1986 a 'Biggles' movie finally appeared. The writers decided to bring in a scifi element in an effort to grab some of the 'Back To The Future' audience. It starts in the thenpresent day with Jim Ferguson an ad man based in New York who is being stalked by a mysterious Englishman Colonel Raymond played by the great Peter Cushing  in what turned out to be his last role .Ferguson keeps jumping back in time for no apparent reason to 1917 where he meets flying ace James Bigglesworth or 'Biggles' for short. Biggles has discovered that the Germans have invented a new sonic device capable of mass destruction.So back and forth goes poor old Jim. One minute he's in N.Y. extolling the virtues of T.V. dinners the next up to his neck in blood and mud in W.W.1 France working alongside Biggles who apparently is his 'time twin'. In one amusing scene Jim dresses as a W.W.1 soldier and waits in his hotel room to be blasted back to Biggles' side but it never happens.

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot go for long without returning to Angelopoulos. He isfor me quite simply the world's greatest living director. His films generally home in on a single theme and explore it with a profundity without equal in contemporary cinema. In Landscape in a Mist it is the quest for the Deity. In Ulysees Gaze he studies the man who would put Art before human considerations. In The Beekeeper he considers the destructiveness that can arise if the male menopause gets out of control. His characters are constantly standing on an abyss. Either they fall like the director in Ullyses or they are redeemed like the children in Landscape. Spiros Marcello Mastroianni at his finest is a recently retired schoolteacher who sublimates an empty future in the temporary respite of a journey with his bees to find a spring climate where they will flourish at the end of a long winter. The opening of The Beekeeper is masterly. We learn everything we need to know about Spiros's loneliness and the emptiness of his family relationships by observing the party that follows his daughter's wedding. It is a quiet affair at the family home. Very few words are spoken but glances particularly between Spiros and his wife tell of a lack of communication and infinite sadness. There is a moment of pure magic when the daughter catches sight of a bird in the room which neither we nor any of the other characters see. She tries unsuccessfully to catch it during which time seems to stop still as it does when people in a street in Landscape stand motionless looking up at falling snow. It would be misleading to suggest that the rest of The Beekeeper sustains the level of inspiration of its first 20 minutes. Compared with Landscape Ulysses and Eternity and a Day the situation is static rather than developmental. A girl hitchhiker foists herself on Spiros. At first he tries to shake her off. She is after all a rather selfish empty headed tart who at one point even encourages a young soldier to have sex with her in a seedy hotel room which Spiros is forced to share with her. Eventually Spiros himself seduces her in a clapped out old cinema where they are spending the night. It is an act neither of love or lust but one born of the desperation of a middleaged man trying to regain something of his lost youthful virility. The result is selfdisgust and a terrible suicide of death by stinging. The only assertive creatures in Angelopoulos's despairing world are the bees.".

I don't think I was under the illusion that it was going to be all holiday sun and gaiety  indeed it is not. We in the U.K are not used to seeing Greece in the winter with remnants of snow and greying landscapes that hint at times passing of buildings in slight dilapidation and overtones of regret and slight bitterness.

The last scene but one outside the old rundown movie theatre where they have been sleeping a speeding trains hurtles as if like moving film itself very fast transient timeless golden against a Hollywood backdrop of romance from the '30s or 40's. I found this a sober absorbing and never boring film that gave space and time to allow one to think outside of what was happening. The lifecycle struck me as being maybe that of that of the queen bee and her workers. The beautiful unnamed stranger who mates with the worker Spyro and then moves on ready for the next one. The final scene spinetingling in its portrayal I'm NOT going to spoil it! re emphasises that for me. There is a little humour and gentle light relief in amongst all this as Spyro meets up with old friends and his daughter along the way. If you want a frilly popcorn film forget this one but for adult thought provoking and unpretentious  and mostly a different experience as well as for Marciello's masterful and understated performance this is most satisfying world cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film didn't really work for me. After reading the mostly wonderful accolades above I was expecting better things from this movie but finished up being disappointed. It wasn't the inactivity either. I like Bella Tarr films so I am used to long takes with not very much happening. Another reviewer of a Tarr film recently noted that you could write a masters thesis on what is not going on in between the bits of dialog. Okay this is kind of cutesy but I know what he meant. There is a tension or at least a relationship between the characters and sometimes a drama of the moment in the what will happen next sense. With the Spyros character there was the feeling that during his moments of stoic inactivity of which there was a lot there was nothing going on inside. It was just a complete blankout no drama no tension from silent inner feelings directed towards another just nothing. The same scene could have been shot to equal effect without him being there. I was waiting for someone to come up to him and shout Hello in there in Greek of course or to give him a much needed kick in the seat of his pants. Whilst I am on the subject of pants I would have reckoned that someone with a grown up son and two grown up daughters would have at least known that you have to open them in order to have sex. Any spotty teenager on his maiden voyage would not have acted in such an inept way. All the incidents except one in this film happened to Spyro not because of him. That one was when he drove his wagon through the front of a restaurant in order to get the girl and that came over as more of a student prank than an act of desperation.But hey I hear you say this is a film that deals with the problems of loneliness and isolation and I should be more sympathetic to his situation. I understand this point of view however it is difficult to empathize with someone who has turned his back on a wife that obviously still had feelings for him a family he could draw round him but who are now indifferent to him and friends throughout the country who he leaves at the first opportunity. Even the girl who was selfish never really did anything bad towards him. Spyro had no warmth within him and never did anything to gain respect. In the end even his beloved bees turned against him.In my opinion the high ranking Artificial Eye distributor has scored an own goal with this one but the enthusiasm of others will probably vindicate them.".

On the way he picks up a young girl Nadia Mournuzi with whom he has an onoff affair before she leaves him to embark on her travels once more.Set during the early spring Theo Angelopoulos's film evokes a world coming to life after its winter hibernation  of showers watery sunshine and pinkish sunsets setting over mountainous rural landscapes. Such images of future promise contrast starkly with Spyros's mental state his beekeeping business is in decline his wife Anna Jenny Roussea no longer lives with him while he has become estranged from his daughter. It seems that he embarks on an apparently neverending road trip because he believes he has to rather than of his own own volition.Unable to express himself except through physical acts Spyros remains perpetually alienated from the landscape and the people inhabiting it. He visits several local communities all of whom enjoy collective experiences of sitting outside sipping their drinks and gossiping happily but he can never involve himself in their lives. He remains an outsider the object of cinematographer Giorgos Arvanitis's penetrating gaze.Despite Mastrioanni's masterly performance notable mostly for its stillness rather than action L'APICULTEUR proves an unpleasant cinematic experience. Spyros has done something in the past to alienate himself from his family there is a suggestion that he is a actually a pedophile. On his daughter's wedding day he gathers her up in her arms in such a way as to denote excessive affection later on he makes love to the girl on the cinema stage by smothering her in spite of her repeated entreaties to let her go. It's as if he cannot endure the sight of young people as they remind him of his own mortality hence he needs to deflower them of their innocence.The cinemaimage is also significant suggesting the desire to exhibit all his seamier qualities in public. Angelopoulous intensifies that sense with a scopophilic obsession with photographing the girl in the nude the camera lovingly tracking the contours of her body in a series of shots taken from Spyros's point of view. In the end we wonder whether she functions solely as an object of the director's and the leading character's misogyny.The mood is one of unrelenting intensity that seems particularly redolent of the midEighties a time when antifeminism was much more of an issue in Europe than it might be today. L'APICULTEUR 's certainly an arthouse film but one whose shortcomings need to be pointed out.".

	schema:headline " The Beekeeper A good Theo Angelopoulos film about two lonely people.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is amazing that it is only on two occasions that the great Greek director Theo Angelopoulos 19352012 chose to cast major film stars of international reputation in his films. In 1995 he directed Ulysses' Gaze with one of American cinema's greatest actors Harvey Keitel. The BeekeeperO Melissokomos was his first film with a major starItalian actor Marcello Mastroianni who is known to all those who appreciate great cinema. It is interesting to note that in both these films Theo Angelopoulos has extracted unglamorous performances from these two actors who are known to ordinary cinema audiences as mere 'film stars'. The decision to cast Marcello Mastroianni must be viewed as an artistic challenge for Angelopoulos as he was already a middle aged man when he was paired against a young girl in a film about hopelessness uselessness wherein one comes to realize the futility of one's drab existence. Through his film about a man and his passion for bees Theo Angelopoulos teaches us that happiness is fleeting. One learns the most crucial lesson in life that even though bees are sweet for honey their bite is extremely dangerous. This is precisely the lesson which the film's protagonist experiences after a series of minor incidents which happen in his life when he travels across Greece in the company of a young girl. The notion of So near yet so far appears to be this film's leitmotif as even though the protagonist stands near his wife for a photo shoot discontent is always visible on their faces. This notion makes its second appearance when the protagonist meets a young girl who is hitch hiking across Greece. Lastly no film director has attempted to show the love felt by a young girl for an old man in an extremely personal manner as depicted by Angelopoulos in The Beekeeper as mutual respect is the key element in this film.One could also state that the young girl allowed herself to be treated well by the old man. This is the reason why the young girl feels that the old man is the only person who has treated her well.".

	schema:headline " The Bee Keeper slight spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film I have seen by Theo Angelopoulos and it is slow paced and introverted where much is implied little is said and the interior lives of the characters are depicted mostly through symbol and metaphor. The plot is straightforward An elderly man Spyros makes his annual spring time trip through Greece in order to cultivate his hives. During the journey he meets a young woman who attaches herself to him and the film charts their fractured journey and relationship.Spyros comes from a long male line of bee keepers who made similar journeys to the one he undertakes and over the opening credits we hear narrated a story of the hives spoken by an adult male to a male child. The story tells of the virgin bees that are kept captive their entire lives as any one of them could be a queen. It is a sad story because the female bees can never escape their imprisonment much as a person cannot escape their fate. The tale tells also of the drones that perform a ritualised dance in the presence of the queen bee who selects one to fertilise her nest. The tale is beguiling and sad and we learn later that Spyros's wife Anna selected him from one of three suitors suggesting she was a queen bee and him a drone.The film begins on the first day of an unusually cold spring with snow on the ground at the wedding of one of Spyros's daughters. The wedding scenes are amongst the most beautiful in the film long slow pans over people in a blue room with white light. These early scenes could be a series of paintings. After the wedding we learn that Spyros and Anna are separating about which both are sad and it is in this spirit that Spyros begins his annual voyage.At his first port he picks up a young girl who is hitchhiking. She tells him 'no one is looking for me'. As they journey we glimpse scenes of the two of them together largely illustrating her antics Spyros's bee keeping and his occasional visit to friends and places he has frequented on previous journeys. Spyros is intrigued and troubled by his companion who appears oblivious to him and his feelings. A song that she dances to and is repeated later in the soundtrack has the line 'all by myself I'll try to make it I'll do it my way'. The song is striking and ugly and discordant with the rest of the soundtrack. The irony is that neither Spyros or the girl is happy alone and neither is forging an individual existence Spyros is repeating a family pattern and the girl who never has a name represents a type of rootless and needy young woman.Things do not end well for Spyros or his bees. This is foreshadowed in the song of the pepper tree that Spyros sings early on and then hears as a memory when he returns to what was his childhood home. The journey becomes a descent into sorrow with his meetings a series of goodbyes along the way the most poignant of which is with his other daughter. I agree with others who suggest the film has the flavour of a Greek tragedy made modern.The film is beautifully shot and Greece looks simultaneously seedy and quaintly exquisite. It is a difficult film because of the feelings it evokes and the demands it makes on the viewer. The acting is particularly good and Marcello Mastroianni is amazing as Spyros. He inhabits his role so completely that it seemed I was watching Mastroianni the man and not the actor. I found myself drawn to his character and enjoy films that show older people and their lives. I don't understand the film entirely or the relationship depicted between Spyros and the girl and I fear such understanding might prove elusive on future viewings. Even so I felt the need to write something about it just as I felt the urge to play the opening scenes again when the film ended. Would I recommend it? Yes if you are patient and have imagination.".

Shortly thereafter Lady Sylvia Marsh returns to Temple House a nearby mansion far earlier than expected. At a party in the village Angus meets Lord James D'Ampton who has just inherited his family's land right next to Temple House. Angus learns of the D'Ampton Worm a huge dragonsnake that an earlier D'Ampton killed by cutting it in half. There's a pretty catchy rockfolk song that tells the D'Ampton Worm legend. As people begin disappearing and acting strangely over the next few days the skull is stolen from Angus's room and the watch of a missing person is found in a cavern that was the legendary home of the D'Ampton worm. Angus and James discover that there was an ancient cult that worshiped the worm as a god and they theorize that the creature somehow survived its destruction but it was trapped inside the cavern. The remainder of the movie shows Angus James ...";

	schema:reviewBody "I've now seen Ken Russell's adaptation of Bram Stoker's story about half a dozen times each at different points in my life.  This is one of those few movies that seems to age very well and get better with each viewing.  Never a big fan of Russell his over the top visual style seems right at home in this sometimes campy sometimes scary always entertaining horror film. But what makes this film stand far above others in its genre is the fact that it is in actuality a wicked black comedy.  Every time I see it i pick up on something new that is in the background of a scene or some piece of dialogue I previously overlooked and I burst out laughing.  The film features probably the single best line of any movie ever made delivered with deadpan foppishness by a notyet famous Hugh Grant.  I believe we probably have another reptile on the premises.  Watch it and you'll understand why it's so funny.  It's all about context.  While some may find many flaws in this production I recommend just going with the flow and trusting Russel and his cast who all also seem to be in on the joke.  Amanda Donohoe as the evil serpentine priestess and Stratford Johns as Hugh Grant's butler are particularly on target with every line delivered.  I'm going out on a limb and giving this a 1010.  In actuality it probably deserves and 810 at best.  But it is one of my personal faves and seems to age like a fine wine.".

Donohoe is just brilliant the monster is cheesy the blatant gags will make you roll your eyes and groan and there are a few extraordinary Russell touches in the very brief quasipsychedelic visions experienced by a few of the characters.

Russell uses three different versions of the legend of the Dampton worm and this includes that written by Bram Stoker. The other two based on stories within Britain. And surprisingly enough the tale is closer to them than Stoker. Amanda Donohoe was simply stunning as Sylvia and she delivered her lines with charm and wit and her costuming was slithering skintight scrumptiously slinky. I even bought a snakes and ladders set just like the one Rosebud that she threw into the flames. The worm was brilliant and deserved an Oscar for his role as he arose from the depth of the cave. I also love the song played in the beginning too. My only irk is that Catherines voice appears to be dubbed by someone else. One of the high points for me was when Sylvia sprayed venom over the cross. My reason for voting this movie so high is because it delivers on so many levels and it is a 'classic' in my book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being one of the few who has read Bram Stoker's originalnovel I can say without reservation that Ken Russell's vision of the story is farsuperior. Why? You would have to read the novel but I can vouch that it is unfilmable and would put any audience tosleep. It's not bad and it has some excellentideas but that's really what sums Stoker upbesthe had good concepts and a backgroundstory but a boring execution. Stoker went to greatlengths to show us how much he hated the aristocracy just as in Dracula but it gets tedious and tootalky. Also the Irishman was dying of some braindisease so the story is pretty fragmented. He died shortly after completing it in 1912.

Russell being Russell intuited the sexualsubtext of the story and takes it to realms of comictranscendence.Russell saw the exquisitepotential in the story and even spiceditup further with his wonderful blend of sexualobsession and highcamp. He also lends the story a veryserious mysticism. It's ripping! Amada Donohoe standsout as Lady Sylvia Marsh an acolyte of a oncedead sect of vampiric serpentworshippers and she shines here. It is probably her bestperformance in a movie. There are somany greatmoments in this film and many are very witty and funny with plentyof sexjokes this is a Ken Russell film afterall. Russell wisely let the film be campy and tongueincheek since he wanted the audience to laugh with the story rather than at it! Characters practically wink at the camera after delivering their wittylines and Hugh Grant is pretty funny he gets it. This has to be the first time most American audiences saw Grant in a starringrole and it left a bigimpression on me.The theme I enjoyedmost was the idea of paganreligions being dormant for Centuries and then reassertingthemselves in our modernworld in manyforms like folklore songs and even in physicalmanifestations it's an excitingconcept with all the sexualimplications Russell loves trottingout. There's also atmospheregalore and some very pointedjabs at OrthodoxChristianity that the cynical will enjoy. What I really loved though was how campy the wholeaffair is since much of this is for laughs. The film also has an interesting new take on a kindof serpentvampirism. Sex was the basis in most Victorianliterature so Russell has a fieldday with it and why not? He laysbare Stoker's sexualobsessions and has them outintheopen not really a majorshift from the originalnovel! The title saysitall doesn't it? Lesbianism paganism mystery religion archaeology humor murder monstershow can you lose? This was part of a threepicture deal that director Ken Russell had with Vestron pictures and included the excellent Gothic 1986 and D.H. Lawrence's The Rainbow 1989. The 1980s was possibly his purest period where he had a very freehand in his productions. It should be noted that Russell is a great adapter of D. H.

	onyx:emotionText "Being one of the few who has read Bram Stoker's originalnovel I can say without reservation that Ken Russell's vision of the story is farsuperior. Why? You would have to read the novel but I can vouch that it is unfilmable and would put any audience tosleep. It's not bad and it has some excellentideas but that's really what sums Stoker upbesthe had good concepts and a backgroundstory but a boring execution. Stoker went to greatlengths to show us how much he hated the aristocracy just as in Dracula but it gets tedious and tootalky. Also the Irishman was dying of some braindisease so the story is pretty fragmented. He died shortly after completing it in 1912.

A great cast made up of the beautiful Catherine Oxenberg A wonderful young character actress called Sami Davis an up and coming Scottish actor called Peter Capaldi a classy actress called Amanda Donohoe.. Oh and some bloke called Hugh or something. Add a few more out of work BBC Thespians to the mix and you have a classy supernatural film that will thrill the critics and maybe win some awards.Then Ken thought FK IT.I'm going to make a crass exploitive films with Nuns being raped naked women giant snakes Boy scouts being bitten on their TODGERS Stone Dildos Jesus on a cross Bagpipes  well one of the cast is a Scott. Then I'm going to redub my lead actress. Make sure the actors look like they've forgotten their lines and have a really bad song sung by badly dubbed singers during a party scene.Ken you are Amazing. Lair of the White worm is Amazing. Its so bad you can't help but watch it over and over. All the cast went on to bigger and better things. Well except that Hugh bloke? Not sure what happened to him. But I'm still sure all the actors and crew will never forget there work on Lair of the White Worm. Its the only movie where Ken Russell can plead GUILTY with a big grin on his face to all the rubbish critics have written about his work. P.S I HOPE THEY GOT THE JOKE? . I DID!".

A good movie is in some ways is like a great plate of Italian food. It needs a firm base some zesty sauce and just the right amount of cheese.I first heard about this movie when I was in high school. Everyone around me was catching it on cable except me. Everyone seemed to have the same opinion of the movie man it's so weird. When I finally got to see the movie we were over at a party at a practical strangers house in a town far from our own at 3 in the morning an uncomfortable situation. But when this movie came on for some reason it made everything alright. I saw it years later in a bargain bin VHS rack and I had to get it. It was by far the best 5 I've ever spent. This is one of those movies that is great to watch late at night with a good buzz on. I'm sure it annoys the hell out of my wife but this movie makes me laugh like a little kid.Filmwise the movie is terribly made or if you're a Ken Russel fan wonderfully made. There's holes in the script the acting is bad the props even worse but there are so many insanely bad puns in this movie that it gets more entertaining each time you see it.I know I haven't said too much about the movie but perhaps that's for the best. To sum it all up it's a great flick if you're in the mood for a real cheesy B grade movie.".

	schema:headline " Great 80's horrorcomedy starring Hugh Grant";
	schema:reviewBody "Lair Of The White Worm is a great British made horror movie filled with English style black humor. It is based off the Bram Stoker novel and directed by English director Ken Russell Gothic Altered States. It is about a small English country town that celebrates the centuries old slaying of a giant snake god that once lived there with an annual party extravaganza hosted by Lord James D'Ampton who's family slayed the giant serpent centuries earlier. But some of the coeds have now discovered a giant snake skull in their excavated yard and are about to find out that the legend of the snake god and its human sacrifice is still very much alive today and they are about to find themselves a part of it.Whereas the Bram Stoker novel is a very serious and creepy turn of the century story the movie version of Lair Of The White Worm took a lot of liberties from the book. The emphasis is still on scares but with a late 80's twist full of horrorcomedy great oneliners and wicked naughty fun. Hugh Grant is at his finest as the young and friendly wealthy English gentleman landlord D'Ampton who has returned from an Air Force tour of duty and now leads his friends to unlock the mystery they are now apart of. His girlfriend played by attractive Catherine Oxenberg is well cast as is Amanda Donahue as the mysterious and alluring Lady Silvia Marsh who may very well be connected to the ancient snake legend.Ken Russell fans will be in for a real treat with his usual blending of eerie and fantasy dream sequences intercut with reality. Ken Russell does a great job as a visual director here making the camera help tell his story with talent moving in and out of wide angle lenses to emphasis the weirdness and unreality of the subject manner. Dick Bush's colorful night lit cinematography full of shadows adds to the story's atmosphere. The viewer also will see more in the movie each time with repeated viewings. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always thought that The Rocky Horror Picture Show was the best Ken Russell film ever made without the actual involvement of Ken Russell so I was terribly disappointed when this film came out as it was so clearly meant to be Russell's chance to capitalize on the sensational success Rocky Horror was having as a midnight movie but just not making it. It's Lisztomania which came out the same year as Rocky Horror not Lair that turned out to be the closest Russell ever got to making his own version of the cult film that imitated his unique razzle dazzle style so profitably. It's even got Nell Campbell in it. But that was just Russell being Russell of course.I recently snagged Lair again as part of my Doctor Who hiatus summer of Capaldiwatching and found that I like it a lot better now that I'm 27 years older and have seen a lot more of both Russell's work as well as the classic Hammer horror films that both Lair and Rocky Horror pay tribute to. It used to drive me up the wall that Amanda Donohoe's Lady Sylvia failed to be as sensational a sex villain as Tim Curry's Dr. FrankNFurter. Now I think she's pretty sensational in her own right. And of course her mission isn't to give herself over to absolute pleasure but to bring the evil ways of paganism back to Christianera Britain. In that way she's closer to Willow MacGregor in Wicker Man than to Frankie. And the climax of Lair is very much like an Art Deco version of the Wicker Man sacrifice. Maybe that's why Russell sent in the Glaswegian Peter Capaldi in his tartans and hand grenadefilled sporran to save the day and restore the Wicker Manbesmirched honor of the land of John Knox. The fact that Hugh Grant's Lord D'Ampton is completely upstaged by Capaldi's Angus Flint I now realize is not a fault at all but an intentional strategy of Russell's to make the intrepid Scotsman with literal dirt under his fingernails the true hero of the piece while the handsome filthy rich young English nobleman is just literally a tosser notice the girly magazine on his bedside table. I recently read the neverproduced screenplay of Ken Russell's adaptation of Dracula which Russell had hoped to make as part of a package deal with Lair and it gave me a lot more insight into this film. It's a surprisingly good script definitely the highest quality Dracula adaptation I've run across. Russell clearly knew how to structure a good Hammerstyle Gothic story that's stronger on character plot development and atmosphere than juvenile cheap thrills and though Lair is no classic it's as entertaining and absorbing as the average Hammer film i.e. incredibly. Russell also wrote an unproduced sequel to Lair Revenge of the White Worm as yet unpublished. There aren't many details out there about it but I have to believe Russell brought Angus Flint back in it. You'd miss him if he wasn't there.".

Certainly not his greatest role it is certainly one that is memorable for it's campy fun.Bram Stoker is best known for Dracula which has been made into countless films but this film adaptation of one of his other novels is well worth watching.Beside Grant who I will watch in anything there is the amazing Golden Globe winner Amanda Donohoe C.

These two were recently united again in Starship Troopers 3 Marauder.It also stars Oscar winner Peter Capaldi Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life.Besides some really fantastic cars it has some scenes that are indescribable and have to be seen to fully appreciate. It's almost like watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show at times.Donahue was simply stunning as Sylvia and she delivered her lines with charm and wit and her costuming was slithering skintight and scrumptiously slinky.

Ken Russel loves any excuse to have a psychedelic dreamhallucination scene and or some sacrilegious rant but this one goes all out. The most psychedelic movie scene ever made is probably the last tank scene in Altered States but this movie has it all.and Amanda Donahoe is probably the sexiest villain ever created!For background  my next fav. is The Wicker Man 1973 original the recent Nic Cage remake was awful. Then Elizabeth with Blanchet heartbreaking and Gladiator Ridley Scott. With Russell Crow. Scott is probably the better director but not as fun as Russel.But for all of us who love this movie  READ THE BOOK by Stoker! Don't remember the URL but there are a lot of old books published for free online for free download and I found it and printed the whole thing out. maybe ebooks.com or some such? Russel made something fun and watchable out of a complete mess of a book. In the original there's a few extra characters that serve no purpose and it's impossible to follow the plot as characters are in one place then appear somewhere else that makes no sense and there's tons of logical flaws in it. There is kind of a cool kite in a thunder storm thing.Finally my band did a version of the theme song for fun. Then we researched more lyrics and it turns out that it's a very old 1800's traditional song from the British isles based on an actual legend. With two more verses that the movie didn't use.So to wrap up.. it's a wonderful movie based on a terrible novel that was based on a fun song based on a silly legend. Kudos for Russel for even thinking of doing it and doing such a great job.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Bockerer III  Die Brcke von Andau is an Austrian Germanlanguage film from 2000 so this one is heading towards its 20th anniversary. The title already gives away that this is the third film from a quadrology. While the gap between films 1 and 2 was huge the gap between films 2 and 3 is only 4 years. It runs for 90 minutes approximately slightly over and is a late career effort by writer and director Franz Antel who is mostly known for all the sex comedies he made earlier in his career several decades before. So yeah as most of them were really bad this one here is a bit of a step up in quality. But that doesn't mean it was a good watch. Not at all. The good news is that it is probably not worse than films 1 and 2 so if you liked these then you will maybe enjoy this one here too. The bad news is that I found the first 2 Bockerer films extremely weak and forgettable. Not seen number 4 yet. Oh well what else can you say about this one here. The story goes on chronologically ant it plays way after the War already. The Austrian accents are pretty thick so even if you are a German native speaker you may need subtitles to understand absolutely everything. Merkatz is okay in what is still perhaps his careerdefining role. He's not the reason why this film franchise is so underwhelming. If you read the name Merkatz and the title Bockerer then maybe you'd expect a comedy but it's not. It's all about the drama with several historic references. Overall I give this film a thumbsdown but like I said earlier If you enjoyed the previous 2 then feel free to check it out. If not then skip this one. I think it's highly unlikely you plan on seeing this one without having seen the previous installments here so you be the judge. The storytelling approach and tone doesn't change a lot not at all actually even if it is set years later.".

But he instead is a narrator showing how easy it is to recognize evil even without a profound education. Also without prejudice his circle of friends contains all kinds of Austrians an how they reactedhad to react to the new situation. Especially his wife and son fanatics about the Nazis introduce us to a very dark side of these days.After all this movie is not meant to get translated because its feeling comes out of the way those people talk and how Bockerer opposes the system by underlining he is Viennese no Aryen where his dialect plays an important role.

The director is Franz Antel and quite a few writers worked on this one. Bockerer is the careerdefining performance of Austrian actor Karl Merkatz and he won a German Film Award in a split decision for his lead performance here. This film is one that had also a sequel but in a really rare case it took 15 years until the second film came out. Films 3 and 4 followed quicker. Merkatz now in his mid80s is still acting but after Antel's death it seems unlikely that a fifth film will be made at some point. On its IMDb page the film is categorized as a historic drama but I thought there was also some comedy in here probably rather subtle on most occasions and not too obvious and it's the typical Austrian sense of humor that not everybody will appreciate. This film was also submitted by Austria to the Oscars in the Foreign Language category but it did not manage the nomination. And I must say the Academy got it right. It baffles me to see this one at a huge 8.2 rating. I cannot understand it at all. This was neither a particularly smart nor a really historically relevant film that adds anything new to the genre. Merkatz was probably the best thing about the film but not because of being great just because of everything else being so mediocre and forgettable. I give this 100minute film a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Bockerer 2 is an Austrian production from 1996 and the main language in here is German. This film has its 20th anniversary this year. The title already says that this is the second Bockerer film and so far four have been made. It took 15 years for this sequel to be made so lead actor Merkatz who won a German Film Award for the first and writer and director Antel who also directed the first had aged considerably. But this did not keep them from making 2 more Bockerer films. Antel is dead now Merkatz still alive and acting but it seems unlikely a fifth film will follow at some point. I am not sad about this at all. The good thing is that I did not find this sequel worse than the original film. The bad thing is that I found the first film entirely forgettable really. The cast here are probably mostly Austrian actors that are not known in Germany. The only name that sounds familiar is Alexander Wussow son of Klausjrgen Wussow. There is a bit of a romance plot in here about a couple getting marries but otherwise the film is similar to the first only that it plays later. You will find many historical references and it's not as dramatic as the first film I get but rather takes the comedy route. Comedy already existed in the first but not as frequent and obvious as in this sequel. But of course you will also get some subtle jokes in here and the usual Austrian brand of humor. Not enough in terms of quality and quantity though for a 100minute movie. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Czechoslovak citizen were forbidden to own large amounts of foreign currency while in the country. If foreign currency was brought to a bank it was exchanged for Crowns or Bony. It was necessary to exchange foreign currency to obtain Bony. Since Tuzex store were accepting only Bony they were extremely desirable thing to own and a whole criminal circle of gangs developed around it.2. At the time of the filming Radek John's salary was 1800Kcs or Crowns about 22000 a year. A hard working Vekslak could make even 12 million Crowns. Quite a difference. 3. Phase one of the deal Vekslak went on a bus full of foreign tourists and exchanged Czechoslovak Crowns for some foreign currency. Phase Two Vekslak changed the currency in a bank for some Bony. Phase Three Vekslak was selling Bony in front of Tuzex at a high rate. Or they were also offering foreign currency if someone wanted and therefore skipping phase two.4. Tuzex store functioned this way Communists did goods exchange with western countries for example Semtex explosives for Lego toys or Swiss watches ... etc. Comunists kept the foreign currency and top officials had luxurious villas and cars that they kept in Switzerland and other countries.5. The top Czechoslovak exports were Weapons and Semtex explosives. Most common goods in Tuzex were Brand name Jeans especially Levi's and Wrangler Watches Lego and fine cognacs and sweets ... as far as i remember. That's why Vekslaci all wore Levi's swiss watches. 6. Vekslaci sometimes started to bring foreign goods such as Porno videos and some electronics that was impossible to get even at Tuzex stores.7. Film Bony and Klid was banned by communist party however someone somehow got hold of a film played it ones in a movie theater and made a Video screener out of it before the film was locked for good. The movie became a hit on the black market and was selling for even 500 Crowns. A year later the communist party officially released the movie in the movie theaters since they knew that it is already out on the street.".

	schema:headline " Be a crook and meet hot chicks and bad Czechs";
	schema:reviewBody "I screened the Czech movie 'Bony a Klid' specifically because I wanted to develop some familiarity with the Czech language but this turns out to be an enjoyable film in its own right with several action sequences that don't rely on dialogue.The title 'Bony a Klid' is an intentional pun on 'Bonnie and Clyde' as this movie depicts attractive young criminals who are meant to be latterday Czech versions of Bonnie and Clyde. By the way I wish that more people knew the facts about Bonnie and Clyde instead of the Faye Dunaway mystique. The real Bonnie and Clyde were Depressionera punks who didn't have the guts to hold up banks so they robbed small businesses such as groceries and gas stations that were just barely getting by. At one point Bonnie and Clyde couldn't even steal a car so they made their getaway on stolen mules. Over their entire career Bonnie and Clyde stole less money than Jesse James hauled from one bank robbery six decades earlier without adjusting for inflation. End of digression.According to a Czech speaker who viewed this movie with me and translated some of the dialogue the title 'Bony a Klid' translates as 'Boons and Rest'. The criminals in this movie want to accumulate enough 'boons' see below and stolen goods so that they can take it easy the 'rest'.Martin is an innocent lad from smalltown Mlada Boleslav who comes to bigcity Prague hoping to exchange his krona for deutschemarks so that he can visit Germany. A local spiv named Robert obliges Martin but at an unfair exchange rate. When Martin finds out he was rooked he plans revenge on Robert ... but then decides to join Robert's gang instead. From this point most of the rest of the film recounts the gang's activities in various blackmarket schemes and wideboy scams. The gang buy sell and steal foreign goods at dishonest exchange rates and they also deal in 'boons' these are tariff coupons permitting the purchase of rationed foreign goods. The caper scenes are shot and edited to make the gang look a bunch of sexy young outlaws and bouncing Czechs. SPOILER COMING NOW After the young crooks have lots of illegal fun all ends tragically.I have very mixed feelings about this film. I get the impression that it's a fairly accurate depiction of blackmarket activity in Prague in the 1980s a point in this film's favour even though the world which it depicts is an unpleasant one. I also recognise that young people in Prague in the 1980s didn't have the economic options of young Americans or Brits from the same period and so their descent into crime is arguably justifiable. Still I dislike the fact that this is one more movie that glorifies criminal activity and which puts a veneer of glamour on the crimes by making the criminals young and goodlooking. The ending seems morally forced as if someone decided that we must accept a 'crime does not pay' finale to atone for sympathising with the crooks.The lead actors give excellent performances. In the central role as Martin Jan Potmeshil makes a convincing transition from gormless hick to cunning thief. Veronika Jenikova is attractive and shows real presence. The directing and editing are above average bringing taut pacing to the caper sequences. And I'm extremely impressed by the AngloCzech pun in the film's title. Despite my ethical misgivings I'll rate this movie 8 out of 10.".

In this film you'll get to see police corruption a dog barking without opening his mouth sabotage Chuck Norris trying to rape a Chinese girl 70s cop music Don Wong riding a motorbike cool cars and a lot of black guys beaten up by Don Wong maybe the movie was racist. The film starts with some big letters that say CHUCK NORRIS IN and then slaughter in San Francisco. And so the film goes but then you realize that big o' Chuck isn't the primary character in fact he's just a mafia guy known as the Boss that appears like 2 times in 30 minutes he wears funny sun glasses and talks high pitched because of the English accent dubbing don't worry about that all the cast of this film even the Chinese have English accent and talk high pitched. I can't imagine why but that makes the film funnier. Alright now that we all know what kind of movie is this we can get to the story... Not much to say here is the typical 70's80's action thing we have a cop and we have his black cop friend who is murdered because he saw too much after that the Chinese cop starts to investigate who killed his favorite black friend. We can see our hero walking on the street with a cool 70's funk searching for answers visiting his friend's grave his friend's wife and child by the way Blackie's daughter was smiling and playing with some toys while his mother was crying. So Don Wong our hero gets to the bottom of all and realizes that the Boss is the new San Francisco's drug lord and his men killed Blackie. So here we get to the typical final fight...a lot of extra guys who had no idea of what karate is we got a lot of shots of Don Wong beating the hell out some really bad actors the Boss eating an apple while he watches how Wong kicks their men's ass Don Wong cutting a black guy's face with a shovel and the final Don Wong vs Chuck Norris fight. Great. Excellent movie. Recommended for nostalgia people and low budgetlame plot Kung Fu fans. Richard Harrison style. Better.".

It's filled to the brim with big plaidcentered 70's fashions a nice fuzzy funky soundtrack with cool drums and seeing how it was a very mustachioed time back then those are on just about every male face as well. Even though the film is ostensibly American because it is a Golden Harvest production and everyone including Chuck is dubbed somehow things get lost in translation. And it's not just the overdubbed loud classic 70's Kung Fustyle dubbing it's also the sound effects like fist and foot blows sounding like someone smacking a cardboard box with an aluminum baseball bat. If someone hits you and that sound comes out of your body you are in serious trouble.Speaking of things that are overinflated the role of Chuck Norris in this movie comes to mind. His role is pretty small but packaging was retrofitted to make this a Chuck movie after his success. Meanwhile Don Wong who is a real Don Juan gives the Chuckster a run for his money. Additionally we believe one of the thugs towards the beginning of the film the guy in the brown leather jacket though that doesn't narrow things down much is none other than Ron Marchini. He's not credited but we strongly believe it's him. Maybe someone out there can help confirm this for us. Nevertheless Mr. Norris and his bizarre body hair situation Chucking it up to the soundtrack which sounds like a funky version of the music from NES' Lode Runner makes this worthwhile never mind all the other ridiculousness herein.As for buying this movie the options available are not great. There's the version under the title Karate Cop  not to be confused with the Ron Marchinistarring movie from 1991  that was released on the lowbudget label MNTEX which is unfortunately in EP mode. Then there's the version on Rhino under the Slaughter in San Francisco moniker but that's a panandscan barbarity. Nevertheless we'd probably say go with the Rhino version given the choices at hand.For Chuck Norris fans andor those who like their Martial Arts movies on the light and dippy side only the most cruel among moviegoers would truly dislike Slaughter in San Francisco.".

The movie really focuses on Don Wong most of the time. What does Norris do in the film being the crime boss? He eats smokes practices the martial arts on boards and at all different times of the film all of this only takes a couple minutes. At the end he finally fights Don Wong and the star of the film gets beat up! Also Chuck's voice is dubbed and speaking of dubbed. It seemed like the entire cast was dubbed! Even the police dog! The dog was barking while you saw him panting! It was crazy! The fighting however is really great and the sound effects used was funny! One thing I wanted to point out is when Wong's partner gets out of the bar and he and Wong are both drunk they fight each other and the punching sounds sound really loud but it looks like they are just easily throwing punches instead of aggressively doing so and after this they split up and Wong's partner is stumbling around very drunk on the street and several seconds later he is ambushed by a bunch of Norris' henchmen and he fights like a sober miracle happened! It was hilarious! The quality of the movie isn't too good but it really makes the nature of the film like the dubbing and sounds even better! Fans of Chuck Norris will probably be disappointed due to his small part and the lack of his real voice but fans of martial arts films in general will think of this as a special treat!".

One thing I wanted to point out is when Wong's partner gets out of the bar and he and Wong are both drunk they fight each other and the punching sounds sound really loud but it looks like they are just easily throwing punches instead of aggressively doing so and after this they split up and Wong's partner is stumbling around very drunk on the street and several seconds later he is ambushed by a bunch of Norris' henchmen and he fights like a sober miracle happened! It was hilarious! The quality of the movie isn't too good but it really makes the nature of the film like the dubbing and sounds even better! Fans of Chuck Norris will probably be disappointed due to his small part and the lack of his real voice but fans of martial arts films in general will think of this as a special treat!";

	schema:headline " FANTASTIC movie! A shame it's almost unknown!";
	schema:reviewBody "I found out about this film from Quick Change with Bill Murray 1990. Both Quick Change and HoldUp are film adaptations of Quick Change by Jay Cronley. But I'm not here for a history lesson.HoldUp is truly a comedy gem. Francis Veber serving as one of the script writers certainly helps this. Storywise I won't give any spoilers the first act of the movie that takes place in the bank is almost the same as the remake movie. Both versions of the bank robbery are very fun to watch. What really makes HoldUp stand out from the Bill Murray movie is the second act.Although I love Bill Murray as an actor I can firmly say that Quick Change was simply unbearable to watch. It gets old and stale after the bank robbery. The same thing happened to me when I tried reading the book. I suppose I can praise the makers of Quick Change for sticking close to the source material but it won't help much if the book itself blows. And no matter how many celebrity cameos there are in that film it doesn't help it.HoldUp shows us a lot more of the character's personalities. Kim Cattrall's portrayal as Lise shows us this demanding confident woman who makes her own choices in the end. In the original book and the second movie she is simply the generic sidewoman that oos and ahhs at the leading man. And speaking of leading man JeanPaul Belmondo pulls off an excellent Grimm along with Guy Marchand as the sidekick who plays the part of the sidekick with more dignity than Randy Quaid did. The late Tex Konig also gives a memorable performance as the truck driver who is desperate to get his dough as well as an amusing cameo from Jacques Villert as the taxi driver. And it all ends with a wonderful and delightful twist!The music is also less repetitive than the remake. This film does however use a musical snippet Liza's Road many times during the film though cleverly played in different speeds and instruments it achieves a continuous soundtrack that isn't typical 80's cop drama music played over and over and over again.To make a long story short too late if you HAVEN'T seen HoldUp  WATCH IT! Even if that means getting a regionfree DVD player. It's WORTH IT! This film needs to get out there more!".

	onyx:emotionText "I found out about this film from Quick Change with Bill Murray 1990. Both Quick Change and HoldUp are film adaptations of Quick Change by Jay Cronley. But I'm not here for a history lesson.HoldUp is truly a comedy gem. Francis Veber serving as one of the script writers certainly helps this. Storywise I won't give any spoilers the first act of the movie that takes place in the bank is almost the same as the remake movie. Both versions of the bank robbery are very fun to watch. What really makes HoldUp stand out from the Bill Murray movie is the second act.Although I love Bill Murray as an actor I can firmly say that Quick Change was simply unbearable to watch. It gets old and stale after the bank robbery. The same thing happened to me when I tried reading the book. I suppose I can praise the makers of Quick Change for sticking close to the source material but it won't help much if the book itself blows. And no matter how many celebrity cameos there are in that film it doesn't help it.HoldUp shows us a lot more of the character's personalities. Kim Cattrall's portrayal as Lise shows us this demanding confident woman who makes her own choices in the end. In the original book and the second movie she is simply the generic sidewoman that oos and ahhs at the leading man. And speaking of leading man JeanPaul Belmondo pulls off an excellent Grimm along with Guy Marchand as the sidekick who plays the part of the sidekick with more dignity than Randy Quaid did. The late Tex Konig also gives a memorable performance as the truck driver who is desperate to get his dough as well as an amusing cameo from Jacques Villert as the taxi driver. And it all ends with a wonderful and delightful twist!The music is also less repetitive than the remake.

Also notable are Richard Boone as the genial mentor to Rone Bibi Andersson as the desperate wife of a Soviet spy chief Kosnov and Barbara Parkins as an enchanting fellow agent.

Veteran actor Max von Sydow has a good turn as Colonel Kosnov a determined man with a brutal record who organizes a third section of Soviet agents.This is the seediest spy story I have seen to date. Harsh tactics are used by both the Americans and Soviets and agents are expected to compromise themselves to the fullest extent in the service of their country. The story remains interesting throughout with intrigue duplicity and twists. The pace is slow so this film is not recommend for those looking for a James Bond style spy thriller but rather those looking for a John le Carr type spy story in the vein of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.".

I could be wrong. The moment flew by.";

It keeps moving with twists to keep the viewer on hisher seat edge wondering who is who and who can be trusted.  Why this hasn't been released on video is a complete mystery to me.

His trademark moustache shaved and his dark hair bleached an alarming whiteblond Boone does a deadpan deadly good ol' boy of a spymaster with crackel barrel charm and ice cold menace.  He simply cannot read a line wrong check out the scene near the end where he tells hero Patrick O'Neal that he's going to Paris.  Director John Huston frames the shot to catch Boone's always expressive hand movements as Boone delivers a long speech with delightful vigor and spin.The movie is a disappointing Huston film and really pretty awful in general but of some historic importance.  The new ratings code was in place since 1968 R and X ratings were in older directors like Huston felt the need to sex up their movies. The Kremlin Letter astonishes in the depravity of its characters. Message spying is a dirty business with no loyalties and anything goes  prostitution drug pushing kidnapping of innocents blackmail torture murder.Along with the great underrated Boone this was among the last films for the elegant George Sanders and the interesting Nigel Green. Along with sweetfaced meanvoiced Dean Jagger White Christmas these actors demonstrate just how deadly an overthehillgang of old secret agents can be.Not a good movie not a coherent movie but worth seeing for Boone Sanders Green Jagger  and Huston's desperate attempt to get sexually trendy as the New Hollywood of the 70's kicked in. Problem hard to see. Is it even available on tape?".

Message spying is a dirty business with no loyalties and anything goes  prostitution drug pushing kidnapping of innocents blackmail torture murder.Along with the great underrated Boone this was among the last films for the elegant George Sanders and the interesting Nigel Green. Along with sweetfaced meanvoiced Dean Jagger White Christmas these actors demonstrate just how deadly an overthehillgang of old secret agents can be.Not a good movie not a coherent movie but worth seeing for Boone Sanders Green Jagger  and Huston's desperate attempt to get sexually trendy as the New Hollywood of the 70's kicked in. Problem hard to see. Is it even available on tape?";

The lead has all the charm and acting talent of George Lazenby and Orson Welles is used for decorative puproses only you never even understand what he's doing in the picture. The movie's only interesting moments come at the very end when it finally manages to suggest how cruel and inhuman the world of espionage can sometimes be.

What could go wrong says I in a Cold War intrigue drama with such a lineup and directed by John Huston who puts in a cameo? As it turns out plenty. I wondered why I had never heard of this flick and after watching it I realized why. The plot is incomprehensible involving a mysterious letter that must be retrieved. It turns out that this letter which we learn of at the beginning of the movie is nothing more than what Hitchcock called a McGuffin an undefined object which gives the director an excuse to strut his stuff. In this case the stuff is a beautifully filmed exercise in obfuscation. It is never clear at any point who is doing what to whom. Huston got Welles to play a role but he phones in his part in the pompous way of his later years. After a couple of hours of confusion the ending rather than giving us any closure heaven forfend that a viewer might ask for closure merely prolongs the incomprehensible. In sum a confusing overwrought pretentious mess. The only upside is that it is beautifully shot. I wish I could also say that it's a pleasure to watch but good cinematography only takes you so far. The frustration of the confusing plot kills everything. Skip it.".

	schema:headline " Wayne Loren and Brazzi Lost in the Desert";
	schema:reviewBody "Legend of the Lost is a film that could have been pretty good but was destroyed because of the lack of chemistry between the leads John Wayne and Sophia Loren. They don't relate or react to each other at all and every intimate scene between them seems forced.On the bright side you have cinematographer Jack Cardiff's gorgeous onlocation Technirama cinematography. The deserts of Libya never looked so good. And the script by Ben Hecht was actually quite good.But Legend of the Lost is a member of an entire genre or subgenre of films that might best be called Twoperson Films. That is the entire film centers on two or three characters that are somehow isolated from society and exist on their own in some desolate or deserted place. John Huston was a master of this genre and his films The African Queen and Heaven Knows Mr. Allison may very well be the best examples of the genre. Unfortunately for Legend of the Lost this type of film mandates that there be great chemistry between the leads or the whole film breaks down. Look at the great chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen and the great chemistry between Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison. This is where Legend of the Lost begins to come apart. Wayne was an actor who was legendary for his ability to relate to his leading ladies on screen. Throughout his six decade long career he played opposite a wide variety of actresses from Jean Arthur to Marlene Dietrich to Lauren Bacall to Katharine Hepburn and was able to light up the screen with just about all of them. Unfortunately for whatever reason the chemistry between him and Loren just wasn't there. In hindsight of course its easy enough to clamor for Maureen O'Hara who had done similar roles in the many Arabian Knights type adventure films she had spent most of the 40's doing but I do give Wayne credit for taking a chance on the then almost unknown Loren. Unfortunately things just didn't work out.Veteran director Henry Hathaway directed Legend of the Lost and after its failure placed most of the blame on Loren saying something to the effect that she was gorgeous to look at but wasn't a very good actress. Although he might have had a point Hathaway was also likely trying to deflect blame away from himself for the failure. The fact remains that he failed to overcome the casting problems that beset the film. And this is why Hathaway is remembered as a good but not great director and I say this as Hathaway's biggest fan. The great directors have the ability to elevate a film above script and casting problems and Hathaway failed to do that here. Of course Hathaway would say that given the material and genre it would have been very hard if not impossible to do that here. And he may very well be right. In hindsight it might have been better to get John Huston himself to direct the film though considering Wayne and Huston's equally disastrous joint project The Barbarian and the Geisha was still waiting in the future perhaps its better Huston wasn't involved here.I've always felt that Legend of the Lost was Batjac's attempt at a prestige picture. I think that Wayne was trying to impress the critics by producing an artsy film that would appeal to them and when it failed he went back to the familiar places and faces that he had found success with earlier in his career. It was probably a very wise decision on his part.Legend of the Lost is not for everyone. With different casting the film could have become a classic. As it is it survives best as a remembrance of what might have been.".

They don't relate or react to each other at all and every intimate scene between them seems forced.On the bright side you have cinematographer Jack Cardiff's gorgeous onlocation Technirama cinematography. The deserts of Libya never looked so good. And the script by Ben Hecht was actually quite good.But Legend of the Lost is a member of an entire genre or subgenre of films that might best be called Twoperson Films. That is the entire film centers on two or three characters that are somehow isolated from society and exist on their own in some desolate or deserted place. John Huston was a master of this genre and his films The African Queen and Heaven Knows Mr. Allison may very well be the best examples of the genre. Unfortunately for Legend of the Lost this type of film mandates that there be great chemistry between the leads or the whole film breaks down. Look at the great chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen and the great chemistry between Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison. This is where Legend of the Lost begins to come apart. Wayne was an actor who was legendary for his ability to relate to his leading ladies on screen. Throughout his six decade long career he played opposite a wide variety of actresses from Jean Arthur to Marlene Dietrich to Lauren Bacall to Katharine Hepburn and was able to light up the screen with just about all of them. Unfortunately for whatever reason the chemistry between him and Loren just wasn't there. In hindsight of course its easy enough to clamor for Maureen O'Hara who had done similar roles in the many Arabian Knights type adventure films she had spent most of the 40's doing but I do give Wayne credit for taking a chance on the then almost unknown Loren. Unfortunately things just didn't work out.Veteran director Henry Hathaway directed Legend of the Lost and after its failure placed most of the blame on Loren saying something to the effect that she was gorgeous to look at but wasn't a very good actress. Although he might have had a point Hathaway was also likely trying to deflect blame away from himself for the failure. The fact remains that he failed to overcome the casting problems that beset the film. And this is why Hathaway is remembered as a good but not great director and I say this as Hathaway's biggest fan. The great directors have the ability to elevate a film above script and casting problems and Hathaway failed to do that here. Of course Hathaway would say that given the material and genre it would have been very hard if not impossible to do that here. And he may very well be right. In hindsight it might have been better to get John Huston himself to direct the film though considering Wayne and Huston's equally disastrous joint project The Barbarian and the Geisha was still waiting in the future perhaps its better Huston wasn't involved here.I've always felt that Legend of the Lost was Batjac's attempt at a prestige picture. I think that Wayne was trying to impress the critics by producing an artsy film that would appeal to them and when it failed he went back to the familiar places and faces that he had found success with earlier in his career. It was probably a very wise decision on his part.Legend of the Lost is not for everyone. With different casting the film could have become a classic. As it is it survives best as a remembrance of what might have been.";

The Legend of the lost is one of those particular film which should have become a superb adventuredrama which in turn should have evolved into a classic.

January seeks enough money to break free of the monotonous cycle of drunken nights in jails Dita hoping to find someone who appreciates her for herself and not just one night stands and Bonnard hoping to find a desert treasure left to him by his father. All three struggle against themselves and their weaknesses and then at the temptations which cause them to remember why they failed the first time. Against them is the limitless Shahara which is unforgiving and more than a challenge to lesser adventurers.

Okay it has some corny lines and Sophia is just too beautiful... but more than that this film tells a wonderful story of broken promises hidden agendas and betrayal from others we believed were above reproach... and there is some terrific character development in the dialog I feel I know these people. For me it is one of the most atmospheric films I have come to know. I feel the hot Sahara sun in that Lybian desert the wind blowing sand in my face the coolness of the water in the oasis and the quiet beauty of a desert twilight.

	schema:headline " A Desert Character Study from John Wayne SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "Wayne is a desert guide in Timbuktu and anxious to get out of town for good. Loren is a local lady of questionable morality. Brazzi is a pious visitor seeking a guide to lead him into the deep reaches of the Sahara he's searching for a lost treasure the location of which was disclosed to him in a letter from his beloved saintly father who he believes probably died at the site. Brazzi wants the treasure to help the poor and sick i.e. to carry on the work of his father. Early on Wayne makes it clear he has no respect for Loren and she returns the feeling but Brazzi treats her in a kindly way and tries to save her soul. Wayne regards Brazzi as a hollow dogooder. A very long trek through the Sahara eventually leads them to the treasure site which turns out to be a Roman settlement. There they find the treasure but they also find the body of Brazzi's father entwined with the remains of a woman a lowerclass or worse woman judging by the cheap jewelry that remains on the body. Brazzi's father had been stabbed in the back. There's also a love letter in the woman's effects that makes it clear Brazzi's father and she were having an affair. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me Brazzi's image of his father and derivatively of himself collapses and he loses his mind. His father is transformed from saint to sinner and everything about him is revealed as a lie. He no longer wants to save Loren's soul now he wants her body and he's willing to bribe her with the vast wealth he's discovered. But she wants to stay saved  she rejects Brazzi's advances. Brazzi decides Loren's really in love with Wayne so he tries to shoot him. In the ensuing confusion Brazzi steals off with the pack animals the jewels and the water. Wayne and Loren set off on foot and catch up eventually. I reiterate the plot at some length to clarify two issues raised by other reviewers. First Brazzi's mental breakdown is dissimilar from that of Fred C. Dobbs in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Dobbs was motivated by greed and it was his essential paranoia that ultimately worked its way to the surface. Brazzi's character broke down because the core of his personality i.e. the selfimage of the faithful son longing to live the life of his beloved father disintegrated when he learned the truth of his father's affair. Second Brazzi and Wayne are not rivals for Loren's love. For most of the movie Brazzi is protecting Loren from Wayne's ill treatment because he respects her soul he isn't in love with her. When later Brazzi lusts for Loren he's out of his mind and Loren knows it she says he's drunk. Legends of the Lost turns out to be a really interesting character study with a fairly clever storyline good acting by all and as many have noted some gorgeous Technicolor photography. One strange note  the music sounds like a 50s scifi or chiller theater score. It's not bad but at least to me it sounds out of place.".

	schema:reviewBody "Legend of the Lost paired John Wayne and Sophia Loren for their one and only teaming on the silver screen. Too bad it wasn't in a much better film than this barely disguised rip off of Rain.The setting for this film is French West Africa as it was then known in 1957 before it became several new African countries in a few years. The Duke is Joe January a freebooting American expatriate who hires out as a guide on the desert.Rossano Brazzi wants to hire Wayne as a guide to take him to a fabled lost city that he swears his father found out in the middle of the Sahara. The father disappeared on a return trip and Brazzi is also looking to find out what happened to him.In Timbucktu both of them encounter Sophia Loren who's a working girl. She's got the both men going but it's Brazzi she really loves. Brazzi's a spiritual sort of fellow talking about doing some good for the native population. When they go out in the desert she trails after them.They find the ruins of what was an old Roman city bet you didn't know the Romans got that far south. Brazzi also learns what happened to his father with a letter found on his remains and two other human remains and some forensic conclusions. For the rest of the story if you've seen any adaption of Somerset Maugham's Rain you know what's going to happen.I have to say that on the plus side Jack Cardiff's color cinematography of the Libyan desert because that's where the film was shot is breathtakingly beautiful. The rest of it is kind of silly. Forgetting the fact that Sophia with two men on the desert is going to lead to obvious complications I cannot believe that Wayne was taking booze on the trip. In his role here and in real life Wayne was a prodigious drinker. But alcohol except some small amount for medicinal emergencies is an outright hazard on the desert. The sun will dehydrate you that much quicker if you keep drinking alcohol as well as water. Not to mention traveling by day instead of by night. My conclusion is that since this was a Batjac production John Wayne wanted to do something that could be classified as arty. Since he had already done well in The Long Voyage Home I'm not sure what he felt he had to prove. I do wonder what Somerset Maugham must have thought when he saw this film though.".

Here you have an American Waynetrying to celebrate 4th July there then a white prostitute Loren and a French Lord Brazzi. Wonder how a white prostitute and an American were able to reach that far area as Timbuctu. At present a plane flies daily from Bamako to Timbuctu and to go by road is not advisable. Another fiction is to find a river in the Sahara. In any case the best is to forget the origin of the subjects and its fictions in the film and to follow the plot which is of value. Love may be developed after continuous talks between people poor and non educated ones may like to be rich but in several cases their sense of solidarity prevails over the ambitions and this is what we find in the film a good example of cruel egoism and also human solidarity.

It's not helped by Brazzi and his inability to act he is someone who continues to baffle me in how he managed to get mainstream cash work in the first place. Loren as usual pouts and teases the men on screen and the boys in the audience but do we care? Actually no. During her moments of peril one can't help hoping that Duke Wayne will shoot her to ease all the suffering of the viewers.Ah bless The Duke for he be the one bright acting spot in the picture. In fine physical shape and clearly knowing that tongue in cheek is the best way to play this one Duke enjoys himself and hopefully his fans can get a modicum of enjoyment from this badly casted piece. The location work in Libya is real nice Jack Cardiff once again delivering fine photography with the desert sequences enhanced by the always pleasant Technicolor. But don't be kidded that this is a character study worth venturing into for if it didn't have the star names attached to it they would have burned the negative long before release. 3.510".

Should have been a blockbuster.Instead a studiolike programmer focused on a Saharan adventure and getting everything wrong. For example making Timbuktu a part of French Morocco complete with bellydancers and corrupt Prefect. And a hackneyed plot recycled from everything from She to King Salomon's Mines. Apart from Wayne Loren Hecht and Cardiff this movie has absolutely nothing going for it.Except for Wayne Loren Hecht and Cardiff.As ridiculous as it is Legend of the Lost is very much a vehicle highlighting all of the principles at their best. Wayne as Joe January are you serious? pulls off Hecht's tongueincheck dialogue effortlessly as well as his character's jovial lechery with Loren doing the same as a sexyashell bad girl flashing a lot of leg and coming just short of repeating her Boy on a Dolphin wardrobe malfunction. All the while projecting a serious intelligence as well as sex. Even Brazzi makes his character dramatically believable. Add to all of that the energetic extras and you've got the makings of a great Graphic Comic.Which I think is the standard Legend of the Lost should be judged by. Especially when you add Cardiff's cinematography which even many of the negative reviews praise. The visuals editing and production values are outstanding.Before its time or more likely a happy accident Legend of the Lost seems to have suffered more from audience expectation than its success at doing exactly what it set out to do. I don't think it was ever meant to be anything except a fun romp through a territory already well trod and familiar as such to its audience. What we would call today a 'Little' movie.And that's where I believe all of the negative reviews come from. When you've got Superstars as principles especially in the 50's you're going to expect The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind not Harold and Maude. Reacting according.So in my opinion Legend of the Lost is a small gem worthy of serious reconsideration. Suspend your disbelief dump the Big Stars expectations and just watch the visuals the score's pretty good too and you might be rewarded.A final note the movie begins with the Prefect marching down a street followed by his entourage each element of which is separated given 23 seconds to drive home the point as the Prefect inspects his territory which includes its own little intriguing snippets and finally meets up with the Important Foreigner Brazzi. As a tone setter I thought it was brilliant.Correction and blame the lame Web algorithms I tried French Timbuktu and French Mali coming up goose eggs on both. Turns out the French mistook Mali for the Sudan not a big surprise soooo .... The French were in charge of Mali Timbuktu and a lot of other West African territories in 1957. Even so Timbuktu still never looked like Morocco French or no French.".

Enter the gentlemanly Rossano Brazzi who springs Duke and hires him as a guide to a destination in the far desert and who converts Loren from her thieving ways into a good Christian. Brazzi is in suit and tie pith helmet and fancy leggings. He tells the roughly clad Duke that he's never been to the desert but has read about it. He speaks with a foreign accent  he's supposed to be French the accent is Italian but to Hollywood he was just a continental rather like the menu of a restaurant specializing in continental food. He speaks of finding a treasure with which he will build a refuge for the needy. Here is the first exchange between him and Loren who has just stolen something from him.Why did you steal it? Because I wanted it. If you wanted it why didn't you just ask for it? He gives the item back to her. It's only a few minutes into the picture and already we know that Brazzi is a sissy that he will not get the babe and that he will run up against the Duke's solid bulk sooner or later.Duke sums him up very well in his peerless Dukese phraseology. I've met these dogooders before. Mostly they want to do good for themselves.Actually the film's plot is a torpid mixture of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre in which one of the trio goes paranoid Rain in which the Reverend Davidson converts a whore and then floods out and attacks her and The African Queen in which a mismatched couple travel alone through dangerous territory and come to love each other just as they think they're about to yield to the fathomless cool enwinding arms of death.The photography by Jack Cardiff is splendid. This is no Lawrence of Arabia but it makes good use of the Libyan desert and its vast majestic expanses.In many ways it's the best thing about the movie. Certainly the role of the antifeminist hard drinking plain spoken practical but not unperceptive man of the earth gave the Duke no trouble. He could have wired in his part by Western Union. He even wears that cavalry hat with the brim turned up in front left over from previous movies. Sophia Loren is cute when she's mad. She's cute when she's NOT mad. But she's only in it because movies like this must have a beautiful woman for the men to come to blows over. And this IS one of those echtHollywood movies where the lowlife Gypsy hookers have hair by Mister Kenneth make up by Max Factor and choreography by Agnes DeMille. A couple of the Arab gypsy girls are blond and blueeyed but does it matter? Well it matters not at all any more than Loren's Italian accent matters.Loren to Brazzi Yew could leave the drims yewr fodder drimt. The film's most impressive feature Some great photography of a Roman city in ruins in the middle of nowhere. The kind of place you want to settle down in and call home. It's here we learn that the Duke can read Latin. That's about the only thing that's liable to surprise you.".

Joe is just that good a desert man and Paul though he has the water a head start and a pack animal has gone crazy and indeed is on the verge of death. He was no desert man!

I thought so anyway when I first saw it on TV as a kid.I did not occur to me then but for a 'lost city' Timgad appears remarkably well maintained in this movie. The adventurers come across an archaeological site which clearly has had its streets swept regularly and various monuments reconstructed. Only the gift shop is missing.That the characters strike out from Timbuktu and arrive in northern Libya means they have traversed almost the entire breadth of the Sahara surely an impossible feat even for the indomitable Mr Wayne. His character is rueful when he namechecks the place as well he might be since a bus ride from Algiers would probably have sufficed!That he knows the name of the ancient Roman city was perhaps a favour to the Libyan tourist board.".

Sophia Loren plays one of the town whores and Rossano Brazzi is the adventurer seeking treasure based on the map left by his late father.The three team up together as a result of comical circumstances. Sophia falls in love with Rossano and follows him who teams up with John Wayne as they go in search of the lost city of gold. This almost sounds like one of Bob Hope's Road To... movies. It certainly has the same appeal.The best scene is seeing Sophia Loren swatting at tarantulas that appear out of nowhere in a cavern she decides to take a nap in. Both Rossano and Sophia do their best impressions of 'insanity' as they both get a shot at being dehydrated and wandering the sands of time. John Wayne as usual keeps his cool and acts as savior to both but only one of the two will survive.Watching this movie wasn't so bad. It was a break from seeing John Wayne battling it out with Indians and cowboys or shooting at soldiers in a war. Think of this as the laidback version of Indiana Jones for the late 50's.610".

	schema:reviewBody "He may not be battling the entire Apache Nation or winning World War II single handedly but John Wayne has his hands full with costar Sophia Loren in this desert adventure. Wayne's character is Joe January a guide hired by Paul Bonnard Rosanno Brazzi to help him locate his missing father and a lost treasure in the Sahara Desert. Loren's character Dita is a reforming prostitute who shanghais herself onto the expedition and creates an unnerving romantic tussle between the two male leads who manage to have two fist fights on her behalf before it's all over.That said the premise sounds more interesting than the actual presentation. The film moves along rather slowly and offers little in the way of excitement or interest in support of the story. The one sit up and take notice scene occurs when January attempts to pull the plug on the expedition when their water runs down to an eight hour supply and Dita obliges by dumping the canteens in support of Bonnard's legend. Fortunately the lost city suddenly appears and sets the stage for some intrigue as Bonnard slowly loses his mind after discovering the remains of his father's party. Jealous of January's interest in Dita he leaves both stranded at the ruins taking all the water supplies and pack animals with him.Offsetting the pace of the story is the excellent cinematography of the Libyan Sahara rich with vibrant color. You felt the searing heat and the wretchedness of being stranded without hope for survival yet knowing things would always work out for hero and heroine. At least Wayne's character had one true friend in the film his donkey mule? Janet remained true blue to the end.This is not one of John Wayne's more charismatic adventures and among his lesser known starring roles. I'll recommend it though for at least one offbeat scene  Wayne does a mean jackass impersonation!".

While it is easy to lay the film's failure on Hathaway he was dependent of the material he had to work with and Wayne's production company Batjac obviously blew most of the budget on the stars the location getting worldclass cinematographer Jack Cardiff and hiring Hathaway to direct.The script by the legendary Ben Hecht and rising screenwriter Robert Presnell Jr. offers some intriguing moments but certainly needed far more 'polishing' Wayne's character bitter drunken guide Joe January does an abrupt 'aboutface' into a traditional Wayne hero halfway into the film about the time pious Rossano Brazzi loses his faith because of his father's lies.... The plot line loses credibility during several key scenes Wayne and Loren march out after Brazzi in the heat of a Sahara day with only a bagful of water? Uh had Wayne been working as a desert guide for long? Brazzi's whackedout behavior and actions were so close to what had happened to his father that you'd think SOMEBODY might have seen what was coming and taken precautions! As for Sophia Loren...she showed amazingly few physical effects from the blazing sun or dehydration and her character a prostitute wanting to find a better life displayed little growth other than no longer using a frying pan on Wayne's head and was in fact just a variation of the 'loose woman with a heart of gold' she played frequently particularly in American films. As for the film's finale with a dying Wayne and the miraculous appearance of a caravan conveniently arriving in the nick of time...Clearly a stronger rewrite was sorely needed! In a desert film atmosphere is everything and while Cardiff's panoramic desert shots are superb some of the finest ever filmed prior to Lawrence of Arabia the limited budget becomes painfully obvious in the small 'indoor for outdoor' sets used in key scenes. The special effects budget must have been nil as well the bat scene as swarms pour out of a well is painfully artificiallooking. The fistfights are silly as Wayne and Brazzi are obviously missing each other no matter how impressive a sound each 'blow' makes. As for exotic Timbuktu...instead of looking mysterious or even POPULATED the film presents a sleepy little village where the prostitutes and dancers far outnumber the patrons and average citizens for that matter with only two 'policemen' to control things one of which is Kurt Kasznar a chubby greedy little prefect who holds Wayne in nearindentured servitude to collect on fines...uh Duke controlled by HIM? Not likely! In the midst of all the silliness there was one surprisingly uncensored scene with a potent sexual energy during a sandstorm Wayne Loren and Brazzi are huddled under a sheet the sand pounding against it causes Loren to cry out writhing in pain and fear and Wayne climbs on top of her to take the brunt of the storm. Her facial expressions and moans as she squirms beneath him and he stares at her face convey far more eroticism than any 'love' scene in Legend of the Lost and is quite unconventional for any film from 1957 especially a JOHN WAYNE one! Could a more polished screenplay and a bigger budget saved this film? Who knows...but it would have made Henry Hathaway's job a LOT easier!".

There isn't much else yet Hathaway manages to keep us watching maybe with a promise that something is going to happen even if in the end it hardly ever does. It's success probably had a lot to do with the Westener's love of deserts and exotic locations maybe there's a touch of the T. E. Lawrence in all of us. It's hardly the best of Hathaway but there's no denying it's very enjoyable.".

	onyx:emotionText "Considering that for most of this film there are only three characters on screen and two of them are very badly played by John Wayne and Rossano Brazzi the third is a sultry looking Sophia Loren and she's very good in an underwritten role Henry Hathaway's Legend of the Lost is a surprisingly entertaining piece of nonsense complete with lost treasure and some gorgeously photographed desert locations courtesy of Jack Cardiff. There isn't much else yet Hathaway manages to keep us watching maybe with a promise that something is going to happen even if in the end it hardly ever does. It's success probably had a lot to do with the Westener's love of deserts and exotic locations maybe there's a touch of the T. E. Lawrence in all of us. It's hardly the best of Hathaway but there's no denying it's very enjoyable.";

It's unusual to see Wayne starring in something other than his usual western and war movies but he fits the role quite nicely here and plays his typical toughtalking hardbitten character this time acting as a guide in the Sahara desert for a man searching for his lost father.As usual the desert landscape is in itself a character and becomes an effectively hostile backdrop for the proceedings. The movie was shot in Libya so has an air of authenticity to it. Aside from Wayne the viewer gets glamour and romance from Sophia Loren while Rossano Brazzi brings most of the character as the man being driven out of his mind by his father's fate.It's fair to say that LEGEND OF THE LOST has some silly moments such as the tarantulas appearing out of nowhere to attack Loren. Still it's an adequate enough piece of adventure one with an effective last half an hour as the desert itself becomes the enemy and the characters struggle to survive against the odds. Wayne is on form as ever and the drama of the climax makes up for the slow parts earlier on.".

And I must give credit to Mel Blanc who excelled in both characterisations of Daffy and Speedy. The music is lovely and there are some good visual gags.However there were other elements that made this cartoon disappointing. The animation was one instead of the slick and colourful animation that makes the best of the Looney Tunes cartoons so good it felt here rather rushed and lacked finesse in spots. Also whereas most of the visual gags were great parts of the script were lacking. Somehow it doesn't have the wit or the zaniness of other Daffy cartoons and some worked if only for Blanc's delivery. The pace was a tad too fast in places as well. In some respect the whole short felt rather rushed not only in pace but in quality.All in all reasonable but one of my least favourite Daffy cartoons and that is a shame because I like him ever so much. 610 Bethany Cox".
