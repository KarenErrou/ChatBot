This is a movie that has always stayed with me and still scares the heck out of me when I watch it in the dark. Who knew that even before taking a driver's ed class that cars could scare me? But this isn't just any ordinary car this is a killer car! This is a car with ghosts in it and you wouldn't like them if you make them angry or try to take their owner away. Christine is the car that you definitely don't wanna mess with otherwise you may have to face those bright lights and loud rock and roll music what happens next you may not wanna know.Arnie Cunningham a typical high school nerd with only one friend a childhood companion named Dennis Guilder a popular jock. Arnie's life begins to change when he discovers Christine a red 1958 Plymouth Fury in serious need of repair. Arnie begins to restore Christine to her original beauty but as he spends more and more of his time repairing her those in his life notice that he is changing as well. Formerly shy Arnie develops a cocky arrogance. Dennis as well as Arnie's new girlfriend Leigh discover that the car has a deadly past. The previous owner Roland LeBay became consumed with Christine and he paid for it with his life. Leigh and Dennis try to save Arnie from a similar fate. They realize that the only way to save Arnie is by destroying Christine. Christine however isn't ready to give up Arnie without a fight.Christine is a classic horror movie that for me will always deliver on the good scares. I still have a hard time watching it. I think the scariest scene for me will always be the last scene where Leigh and Dennis face off with Christine and you see that Arnie just completely gone. I'm honestly shocked that Keith Gordon didn't continue on with his acting career he just blew me away as Arnie reading the book I couldn't picture anybody else. He's absolutely incredible. John Stockwell also pulls in a good solid performance as well. This is one of the rare horror movies that is over all very enjoyable and if it doesn't scare you I still think you will like it it has a great story and a very good cast and crew. I highly recommend that you see this movie if you get the chance it's a classic.810".

But as it happens I loved it! A lot of people would say This is a horror it's supposed to be scary!! And a lot of people are right in this regard it wasn't very scary at all. At least to me. But...the way Arnie turns from such a geek to a cool tough badass was pretty awesome. Also I liked the depth of all the characers relationships with one another. It definately stirred some serious emotions when Buddy and his goons tore up Christine. Most of all though I think the car herself was what made the movie as good as it is. Just the style and freshness of the '58 Plymouth Fury kicked ass. If you're reading reviews like this one trying to decide if you even want to see it I say go for it. What have you got to lose after all? The hour and a half you would be spending trying to find a review for a movie you decide to see you could have already watched Christine. That's my advice.".

Well such is a case in point when it comes to John Carpenter's Christine Now as a rule and a longstanding one at that I could never read a Stephen King novel but i could always find time to watch an adaptation of the same if and when it either came to video as was the thing before the wonders of DVD or if it arrived at the local cinema.My personal highlights from the Stephen King Oeuvre are Silver Bullet if only to see the likes of Gary Busey and Everitt McGill ham it up beyond the call of duty. Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining complete with a knockout performance from the maestro of barnstorming himself Mr Jack Nicholson as we already know there have been so many translations from page to screen of everything and anything the king of horror writing has penned some good some not so good.However when it comes to Christine it was pitch perfect in every way shape and form. Directed by John Carpenter who has been hit and miss down through the years. A wonderful array of golden oldie classics playing throughout the movie itself a truly wonderful script written by Bill Phillips containing many a gem which still lingers in the mind even to this day.Which leads me finally to the actors casting down to a tee and as i said ably assisted by a good script well drawn characters of course from the mind of Stephen King but brought to vivid life by the likes of Robert Prosky who appears as the junkyard owner Will Darnell a true standout in the whole movie. Why even Roberts Blossom think all the way back to Bob Clarks's take on Ed Gein Deranged the man still lends a sense of deadly menace to his character even though his role is primarily a cameo role but in fairness quite pivotal in terms of progressing the story.However those two being character parts we need to see the story unfolds. We begin in prologue fashion as we see upon fade in superimposed the year is 1957 We see a car assembly line all the new cars are being overseen and given the once over by the foreman from a distance we get our first glance of how beautiful and intoxicating Christine the car is to look at.Of course that illusion is soon shattered when firstly a foreman shatters his hand then one of the workers decides to take a little rest and relaxation in the front seat all the while smoking his cigar when ash from the cigar drops onto the plastic covering so it begins and the true nature of Christine is revealed.Flash forward to present day and we see Arnie Cunningham the nerdish lead character played with aplomb by Keith Gordon who would later go on to direct the really excellent The Chocolate War as well as many more. However when it comes to acting Keith Gordon would never better what he had done prior to this or even after.We have all at one point either been or have known someone like Arnie Cunningham perennial book worm not exactly a ladies man but when he catches first glimpse of the wreck that will forever alter his very being It is at that point we see that compulsion leads to obsession when Arnie falls under the spell of that 1958 Plymouth Fury.Watch as Arnie emerges from his shell argues with his parents something that he would never have done or even finds his first and last girlfriend. All this achieved upon the influence and presence of what would appear to be a car but for teenager Arnie it represents his first steps towards independence but underneath the surface of it all we already know the motive and inevitable end.With wonderful turns by William Ostrader as chief bully Buddy Reperton and Malcolm Danare as Moochie along with John Stockwell as Arnie's only friend Dennis and Alexandra Paul long before she donned the lifeguard bikini for Baywatch as Arnie's suffering girlfriend Lee.Watch and be amazed time has not taken it's toll on John Carpenter's finest hour.".

Stephen Kings books usually have the same why behind the what and Christine was no different. However John Carpenter took all of the why element found in the book out and made it a love story between a nerdy teen Arnie CunninghamKeith Gordon and a run down car named Christine which I believe added some substance and improved the story in ways King never imagined. Watching Arnie's transition from nerd to almost greaser is a tense and creepy process with a huge nod going to Gordon. Carpenter makes the atmosphere with his directing and the mood is always somber with one of my Favorite Carpenter Scores. While movies like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were showing one side of the coin Christine showed the other. What most look at as a killer car movie is really much deeper and in my opinion the subtext shows a side of the teen years that most would be more likely to remember. This is a underrated movie that shows more about isolation and life in high school than anything that happened in Shermer Illinois.Check it out!".

This accompanied by excellent photography special effects timing and musical score make Christine a definite mustsee movie.Please Note The Australian TV edit cuts out some of the best scenes so this movie is best seen on DVD or video.".

This accompanied by excellent photography special effects timing and musical score make Christine a definite mustsee movie.Please Note The Australian TV edit cuts out some of the best scenes so this movie is best seen on DVD or video.";

As someone who was knocked out by Rob Bottin's intricately gruesome FX work in The Thing but left cold by the shallow characters Christine fills in the gaps of suspense and human story with ease. In retrospect some of the absurd plot elements a haunted car as Carpenter constantly reiterates lends the film an odd humor that doesn't detract from things and indeed it was Stephen King's own infatuation with cars and rock music that inspired this story of obsession. Scenes are composed with great skill by Carpenter making wonderful use of the widescreen image and there are many striking images sprinkled throughout the most incredible being the flaming Christine speeding after a villain. The excellent cast gives their all in making a potential Bmovie premise glow with Alist polish Keith Gordon's Arnie the painfully square highschool senior who buys the titular vehicle John Stockwell's Dennis the resourceful jock and best friend Alexandra Paul's Leigh the earthy girlfriend who sparks Christine's jealousy and Harry Dean Stanton's Junkins the snooping P.I. provide this tale with a lot of propulsive force.

	schema:headline " Not Carpenter's best but pretty good";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me make this clear right away I haven't read the book nor do I intend to. You won't find any comparisons between the book and the film in this review. This film combines two of the biggest names in horror from two different medias Stephen King is pretty much legendary for his written horror work. John Carpenter is also a pretty wellknown name but as a horror director rather than writer. Having not read the book I have no idea how true Carpenter stayed to the source material but I can understand from various sources that he changed a lot and the changes were very big so fans of the book might not like the movie. Whenever I hear about a film being made that is based on a King novel my response is usually that of someone who lacks any interest in it whatsoever. When I hear that it's directed by John Carpenter one of my favorite directors particularly within the horror genre I develop an interest. Carpenter does a great job of turning something as potentially lame and goofy as a possessed car into something that you really fear. I was at the edge of my seat for a lot of the scenes and I jumped at several shocking moments. The story revolves around a nerd buying a car and the car significantly changing his personality. He changes enormously throughout the film and I must say the actor does a great job of capturing the emotion of the character. The plot is great it doesn't move along very fast but rather deliberately slow building up atmosphere building to a climax that is every bit as exciting as the buildup promises. The acting is great especially by Keith Gordon who portrays the nerdlike Arnie who buys the demonic car. The film has pretty much the same sense of humor that Carpenter's films usually have albeit slightly less of it is present than in several of his others less serious films. The special effects are very good they are almost impossible to tell. Had I not known better I could have sworn that they were real. They probably could be more wellmade had they been done today but I still think it's amazing how real they look. They don't look the least bit dated. All in all a good Carpenter film that probably won't be to everyones liking. I recommend it to fans of Carpenter and fans of atmospheric horror films in general. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I rewatched John Carpenter's adaptation of Stephen King's novel again for the first time in over ten years and it's just as I remember it to be. Not much of a compelling horror film but merely a black comedy and a homage to the typical 50's teenage lifestyle. Carpenter and King seem to share a common interest for the dazzling 50's atmosphere and this perfectly translates itself in Christine'. First and foremost there's the beauty of the 1958 Plymouth Fury a car that almost represents this decade entirely by itself. But also the music hairstyles and dress codes make you feel like you've landed in the fifties even though the movie is entirely set and timed in the early 80's.  The nerdish teenager Arnie Cunningham falls head over heels in love with the wreck of a gorgeous car and decides to restore it. Pretty soon Christine's influence Christine is the name of the car makes Arnie go through a complete metamorphosis. Positively at first as Arnie impresses girls and turns into an attractive rebel. But it doesn't take that long before he becomes totally obsessive over Christine and starts acting like a psychopath. If you're not expecting an eerie and tense chiller from the creator of Halloween' and The Fog' you won't be disappointed. Christine is a totally different kind of horror and not nearly as intense as Carpenter's previous work. I mean how scary is it to see a wrecked car rebuild itself?? The few exiting scenes featuring in this film are when Christine independently stalks some John Travolta lookalikes who trashed and violated her earlier in the film. Christine should be considered as a fun and wellmade satire with a brilliant goldenoldies soundtrack watching this film feels like listening to a jukebox and decent acting performances. Keith Gordon does well as Arnie and Alexandra Paul looks gorgeous as the highschool hottie. Veteran actor Harry Dean Stanton Alien The Green Mile has a tiny role as a police detective. And finally cinema buffs might recognize Kelly Preston in her meaningless role of cheerleader bimbo.".

Christine should be considered as a fun and wellmade satire with a brilliant goldenoldies soundtrack watching this film feels like listening to a jukebox and decent acting performances. Keith Gordon does well as Arnie and Alexandra Paul looks gorgeous as the highschool hottie. Veteran actor Harry Dean Stanton Alien The Green Mile has a tiny role as a police detective. And finally cinema buffs might recognize Kelly Preston in her meaningless role of cheerleader bimbo.";

	schema:reviewBody "Probably not rated as one of John Carpenter's best more so middle ground but I thought otherwise as it's definitely my second favorite just after 1982 remake of The Thing of his longlisted horror output. Yep I put it ahead of his influential 1978 slasher 'Halloween'.Anyhow Carpenter did a seductively lowkey and restraint job with this Steven King adaptation by streamlining it with hypnotic visuals like the flaming car and getting able performances from his cast. Keith Gordon and John Stockwell make for a likable pairing and watching Gordon's character's compelling transformation is convincingly staged from the once placid dweeb to an obsessively psychotic controller that goes on to hurt those who care for him. It's big change in attitude with a downfall spiral that sees him not going back. The basic plot might get on the silly side and move on too suddenly but Carpenter keeps our affection towards the purring red and white 1958 Plymouth fury and its strangle hold over Arnie a worthy Gordon. Total infatuation. In the end I liked how it just didn't focus on revenge with it weaving in elements of humane qualities involving teenage angst rebellion and love. A well told story.Carpenter confidently straightup direction which is far from stylish or slick passionately lets the possessed car take over with its own vivid personality and just listen to those swinging 50s rock 'n roll tunes. This car does feel like if it had a mind of its own! Atmosphere is little and while there's a real sinister nastiness lurking underneath it never really shows to only take place in offscreen shocks. He tries building suspense mainly those scenes involving Arnie getting revenge on some punk bullies where it sometimes works and if it didn't it still had the mesmerizing imagery. Watching the car get torn apart in scenes to only repair itself was eyecandy if haunting and it finishes on a bone rattler of a climax. The music score was another interesting touch quite spacedout but rippling in affect and Donald Morgan's cinematography held a crafty edge.Rounding off the cast was a solid Stockwell a reasonably modest Alexandra Paul and a perfectly gruff Robert Prosky. Buddy Repperton was right on the mark as the main goon picking on Arnie. In smaller roles were the reliable Harry Dean Stanton and an early appearance by Kelly Preston. Christine Belford shows up as Arnie's strict but concerned mother. Also appearing is Roberts Blossom.What can I say  Christine is number one in my eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I lost interest in John Carpenter many years ago because his films started looking and feeling like the work of someone who no longer cared. Christine on the other hand is the work of a director at his peak. It is a brilliant cinematic reduction of the King novel's strongest elements. It is still a love story about a boy and his car and it is still a study of teenage angst and high school cruelty but it is also spare stylish and uncluttered. Keith Gordon is totally believable as Arnie Cunningham a name often mispronounced a stuttering nerd who is given a supernatural injection of confidence by the mysterious Christine. His transformation into an assertive confident teenager and then into an arrogant foulmouthed narcissistic ahole is a pure joy to behold. William Ostrander is simply amazing as Buddy Repperton an oversized machine shop jock who takes great delight in the torture and psychological abuse of Arnie. The final comeuppance of Repperton and his gang of mindless goons is deliciously satisfying. Also raising the performance bar is Robert Prosky as the indefatigable Will Darnell a gruff gross cigarchewing human troll whose garage for workin' stiffs! Arnie uses to rebuild his precious automobile. Prosky's numerous dialog exchanges with the nerdish schoolboy  That's the last time you bring that mechanical ahole in here for example  are hilarious. Arnie's disintegrating relationship with his parents is very well handled by Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips as is his doomed romance with the stunning Leigh Cabot Alexandra Paul. Carpenter's score is brilliant and Donald Morgan's cinematography especially the night scenes is dazzling. A masterpiece.".

The characters the self awareness of Christine and the overall feel of terror that this town and group of people found themselves in with this jealous car alive and running amuck...it's the combination that makes a great horror movie. Hamburgerloving girlfriends beware! Christine plays no second fiddle!First off the music is so important to the character of Christine. Old 50's rock  roll drives this car along its path of destruction and it is so clear why Stephen King based the era of its construction of the '58 Plymouth Fury in Detroit as their economic downturns were upon them Christine was not a good spokes model for the car industry up there. Second the special effects were phenomenal. The reversing crumpled fenders the busted glass the charred paint job that somehow found the perfect coat of the rarest color around 20 years after the car model originatedit's a fantasy and a nightmare combined into one.You need to own this movie. It's a delight. The characters are fully fleshed out my favorite was the mechanicshop owner Will Darnell played by Robert Prosky and very unique. It's too bad Arnie's parents were complete control freaks they got the hardest job of trying to come between the car and its owner since the beginning. It really shows what car possession means. I would run out and purchase it on Blu Ray if it becomes available but until then DVD will do.".

	schema:headline " Beyond desire is something WAY out of control!";
	schema:reviewBody "In some genres a certain combination will bring out a pretty good story. In this case Author Stephen King gave us the equation as well as the solution. The book Christine is a horrifying story about the psychotic bond between a school geek and his demonic car. You have a story about a shiny car that was born bad. It's bad enough as is but it also goes deeper than just a maniacal machine. This car can love just as well as it can kill. It has a burning desire for the affection it can receive only by the loneliest of men with nothing else to live for. It is all very depressing I will explain.Putting aside the opening sequence we have two friends full of life. One being Arnie a stereotypical geek with virtually nothing going for him the other being Dennis a literal allAmerican applecheek football jock the kind of guy to help his fellow man out. We find a nice bond with them. Perhaps they grew up together or maybe their parents were friends. Whatever the case it's a friendship worth having. Enter Christine a bloodred Plymouth fury with an eerie past and a mysterious gravitation field effective on the most uncommon of men. Arnie is instantly seduced by this man killer of a machine and once the final connection is made there is no turning back. Arnie's behavior begins turning and changing in reflection of this unholy presence that destroys its enemies. A once respectful 17 yearold begins to display the most unbecoming of behavior towards his parents the public authority and soon his friend Dennis. He also reacts violently against the new girl in town Leigh who only wants to help.This film never grows old in it's distinct style and outrageous effects. Acclaimed director John Carpenter of Halloween fame brings to the screen a stylish eerie chilling adaptation that also bears within itself a depressing element of a desire that kills. We have Arnie who desires Christine who in turn yearns for his absolute devotion. Human hearts don't work like such unless it is Christine they desire. The concept also asks the question what do you want and what are you willing to give for it? Soon enough the character Arnie is isolated in his own desire that grows with both rage and passion every time someone or something interferes with he and his car. Christine is a deadly temptation as Arnie is the weak desire. Unnatural love takes it's course while reality in the form of Dennis and Leigh goes on. Only so much can occur before evil vengeance is unleashed in a rage beyond control. What puts the depressing part in motion is the need of the two martyrs to help but trying to stop Christine is like teaching a bowl of rocks to fly.Keith Gordon certainly gave us his best as the illfated Arnie which was a long way from almost becoming sharkfood in Jaws 2. We see him transform throughout the entire film from honest decency to morbid selfishness and the unnatural moments of intimacy with he and the car are too creepy for words to say. John Stockwell gives the biblical impression of a modern day prophet in Dennis a teen who plays life by the rules not only because he is smart but because he cares. He has a real heart for friends and the moral law of nature. Bravo! Alexandra Paul is also good as Leigh. Naive and gentile but also very smart and proactive. Harry Dean Stanton turns in a fine performance as does the rest of the cast.John Carpenter was riding the waves of success as his legacy was continuing from The Fog. He put together a score to suit the film and a great rock'n'roll soundtrack to fit the conceit of death with tunes of life. All around creepy and never a dull moment. Christine will serve you with chills and thrills to the final cut.".

The friend played by John Stockwellthe girlfriend played the beautiful Alexandra Paul are very real and convincing in their protrayls. Not to be omitted are the three villians of the high school They are menacing. Robert Prosky's crude rude and profane junk yard owner is a standout.I find no fault in the film.

The friend played by John Stockwellthe girlfriend played the beautiful Alexandra Paul are very real and convincing in their protrayls. Not to be omitted are the three villians of the high school They are menacing. Robert Prosky's crude rude and profane junk yard owner is a standout.I find no fault in the film. Even though I didn't mention all the cast members they deserve kudos. I'ts fascinating and really holds. Great entertainment!";

	schema:headline " An EffectiveUnderrated Horror Classic. John Carpenter and Stephen King at their Best.";
	schema:reviewBody "John Carpenter's Christine is an effectivewellmade and underrated Horror Classic and was the first and only collaboration between John Carpenter and Stephen King. A great mixture of excellent directiongreat charactersatmosphere and a wonderful Rock N'Roll soundtrackChristine is Carpenter and King at their bestone of the best Stephen King adaptations and one of the best Horror films of the 80s.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same nameChristine tells the story of a nerdy teen named Arnie CunninghamKeith Gordonwho discovers a 1957 Red Plymouth named Christine and falls in love. Although wreaked and damagedArnie decides to by it and rebuild it. While Arnie rebuilds itArnie's best friend notices changes in Arnie's behavior and discovers that Christine is a car with a life of her own and will kill anyone that gets in the way of her and Arnie's relationship. Nowit's up to Dennis and Arnie's girlfriend LeighAlexandra Paulto stop Christine and save Arnie before it's too late.Christine is an excellent Horror film because this film takes the concept of haunted car and makes it truly creepy and the film works because of the storycharacterssuspense and atmosphere. While some people wouldn't find the idea of a haunted scaryCarpenter takes Stephen King's story and makes it frightening and believable where you feel like something in Christine can happen in the real world and that you're not safe or securewhere you feel like any character isn't safe from Christine's wrathrage or fury. Christine is a character in the film that doesn't say a word in the film but has a evil presence that you feel like she's everywhere at anytime and can strike when she wants to and there's nothing you can do about it because she is powerful and in control. The film and story also seems to havein my opinion a weird sense of humor and playfulness about itselfwhether it's the dialog of the characters or dealing with Christine and how serious the characters are about the situation at hand with Christineso while the film is downbeat at timesthe film doesn't always take itself seriously. I also love how the film portrays teenagers and teenage life in the filmwith the three main characters dealing friendshipsparentsbullyinglove or revenge or life in generalwhether it's Arnie and Dennis' friendship or Arnie's troubled relationships with Leighhis parentshis love for the car Christine or Arnie dealing with school bullies and the film doesn't sugarcoat it. The only other Stephen King Adaptation that I can compare to Christine and deals with teenagers is the Brian De Palma classic Carriebecause while both films have different story linesboth films deal with the concepts of teenage liferevenge and death. Both would make a good double feature. John Carpenter is a master and expert of dread suspenseterror and atmosphere and it is on full display in Christine. John Carpenter uses the Christine car to give the movie a sense of dread and fear every time she shows upbecause you never know what Christine's going to do in certain situations and that's one of the things that adds to the terroryou are distracted by Christine's beauty as a caryet we forget that she is pure evil. The presence and fear by Christine is felt throughout the film and not one character in the film can escape from Christine's brutality and vengeance. Horror fans maybe a little disappointed with the lack of blood and gore that's not shown in the filmbut the film doesn't need it or require it because Christine like Carpenter's earlier classic Halloween relies on terror and suspense and Christine isn't darkgloomy or gory like Carpenter's brilliant The Thing where everyone and everything is doomed at the end. Like I said before earlier Christine has a playfulness and sense of humor and after all the film is about a haunted car. Christine is a Horror film but is pretty light in comparison to Carpenter's early films. The ending of the film is great because it ends on a cliffhanger and will make viewers ask a lot of questions and wonder what will happen. The whole cast does a great job. Keith Gordon gives the best performance of his acting career as Arnie. Gordon is frightening and believable as Arnie and his transformation from awkward nerd to psycho is excellent and scary. John Stockwell is wonderful as DennisArnie football jock best friend with Stockwell bringing depth to the role and has a good chemistry with Gordon. It's interesting that both Gordon and Stockwell both became film directors later on. Alexandra Paul does a great job as Leighthe new girl in school who becomes Arnie's girl friend and hates Christine. Robert Prosky gives a fantastic performance as Will Darnellan auto shop owner that Arnie works for. Harry Dean Stanton does a wonderful job as cop Detective Rudolph Junkins who's investigating Arnie and murders associated with Christine. Roberts Blossom is great and creepy as George LeBay the man who sells Christine to Arnie. Christine BelfordRegina Cunninghamand William OstranderBuddy Reppertongive good performances as well. Also look out for an early appearance by Kelly PrestonRoseanne.John Carpenter's direction in the film is excellentwith Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film an energy and pace and giving the film a sense of terror and dread when Christine shows up. Great directionJohn.The score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is effective and masterful and adds to the film. Another great Carpenter score. The film has a great Rock N'Roll soundtrack with songs like Bad To The BoneGeorge Thorogood and The DestoyersBeast Of BurdenThe Rolling StonesBony MoronieLarry WilliamsCome OnLet's GoRitchie ValensKeep Knockin'Little RichardRock And Roll Is Here To StayDanny  The JuniorsNot Fade AwayBuddy Holly and Tanya TuckerPledging My LoveJohnny AceHarlem NocturneThe ViscountsI Wonder WhyDion  The BelmontsWe Belong TogetherRobert  Johnnyand more.

	schema:headline " Great Concept with Sloppy Execution  a Contrived Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "The concept of Limitless is fantastic  what would happen if you could take a pill NZT that would allow you to use 100 of your brain instead of the standard 20 and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well limitless  pun intended  but unfortunately despite some great acting especially by Bradley Cooper who plays Eddie Morra  the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration the film just could not overcome some major plot holes sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.LOTS OF SPOILERS...Many times throughout the film the script uses PLOT driven storyline instead of CHARACTER driven storyline in order to go from Point A to Point B which the script called for  in the process didn't make much sense given who the characters were in the picture. Some examples1 The movie needed for Eddie to find the NZT stash  money in his Brother in Law's apartment steal it get away with it and then take the pill feel the effects and use the money to regain his life. Problem? It's absolutely ridiculous to imply that the cops wouldn't have searched him or at the very least patted him down after calling in a murder  going down to the station for questioning. Of course the huge wad of cashpills he shoved down the back of his pants would have been found had they searched him so it didn't happen. It's illogical and absolutely ridiculous that he would be able to steal what he did from the apartment an apartment that he locked himself in when the police initially arrived  and have no issues.2 The movie needed for the Russian thug to come after Eddie in order to find the NZT take it and then make trouble for him the entire movie. Problem? It's not believable that super smart Eddie wouldn't remember to pay back the 100k that he borrowed especially when the money was constantly on his mind and he had just made 2 million off of what he borrowed. This is clear cut plot driven over character driven storyline because it's ridiculous for Eddie the character to not remember such a basic task especially when there was direct danger to his life if he forgot.3 The movie needed for Atwood's lawyer to steal Eddie's stash of pills causing Eddie to spiral out. Problem? Isn't it far fetched to imply that Atwood's henchman killed the woman in the hotel to frame her murder on Eddie at the oft chance that Eddie would retain the same lawyer that worked for Atwood just so he could get close to him to steal his pills for Atwood to save Atwood's life? Huh? How did the henchmanlawyer even know that the pills would be on Eddie to take? They never used to be  the custom suit w hidden pocket was something new. He certainly didn't carry them on him back when the woman was initially killed. This whole setup was contrived and made no sense and was based on a lot of coincidences ones that no one could have predicted.That is just a few examples of sloppy storytelling. There are also a bunch of basic nit picks that I have like 1 Why didn't Eddie who was fearing for his life buy a gun  train how to use it under the help of NZT? He hires bodyguards and buys a fortress to live in but doesn't purchase a handgun? 2 Why didn't the scientists who made NZT take it themselves in order to use their super smarts to perfect the drug and make it what Eddie's scientists were able to create in the end without the aid of being under the drug's influence? 3 After drinking the Russian's NZT laced blood why did Eddie lie there on the ground waiting for the henchmen to return so he could poke one in the eye w a needle? Why not get out of there? Did we really need that stupid fight scene? 4Breaking into the safe with a chainsaw in minutes? Impressive 5 Is it really believable that NZT wouldn't have hit the black market and been all over the place?Lastly  a huge problem I had with Limitless was the happy Hollywood contrived Ending. Withdrawal from NZT? Side effects? Once the drug wears off so does the heightened brain activity? No problem  the movie flashes forward 12 months to give Eddie Morra a rainbows puppies  sunshine like ending where his labs have now created a pill that works like NZT only there are no side effects and the super smart effects are permanent. How nice! He's all happy now  brilliant forever  running for Senate  he's with his girlfriend  their ordering food and look he's fluent in a foreign language because he's so smart and YUCK. The ending was so over the top in an 'everything worked out in the end' way. I hated it. I didn't need for Eddie to die or crash and burn or anything like that but Limitless took the concept of a happy ending to another level.Also with the ending comes a rushed attempt to villanize De Niro's character of Carl Van Loon who out of no where makes a pathetic power play by trying to blackmail Eddie  is quickly shot down. The whole scene between them fell flat for me and felt incredibly sloppy and quickly put together.Overall in spite of all the shortcomings Limitless is still a really good movie. It's thrilling fast paced and the basic concept is interesting and makes for an entertaining film  you just can't really think about things like logic or else you will be disappointed. 710".

Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a superyou. The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a somebody. The movie graphics plot and main actors well DeNiro Cooper and Johnny Whitworth were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind who would you be? Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though the one guy Johnny Whitworth did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented. I'd definitely recommend watching this movie. If only just for the ridiculous scene with the skates. Hilarious.".

Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.It's sold as Bradley Cooper gets smart drug fix from Robert De Niro then must defeat him through a series of cat and mouse games. In actuality Eddie Morra Bradley Cooper is a struggling writerslob who acquires a drug called NZT48 a pill that allows him to recall everything from the briefest of encounters. In minutes he is transformed from a guy no one could believe has a book deal to a man no one can do without. Doors open too many doors really. Eddie's problem solving solutions end up fanning the flames of questions around him and before long it seems that everyone in the city is after him. The intricate dynamics that weave this trail of lies is the best since Match Point 2005.Cooper's performance totally shocked me. He's able to go from panicked addict to conversationalist genius and back without losing the support of the audience. With no key player for Eddie to confide in or take along for the journey the supporting performances are little more than plot points. Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro don't have nearly as much range to showcase in this screenplay. However with a little change Anna Friel's one scene could have been expanded into something with more drama and likely give Limitless the emotional impact needed for some to take it seriously. Enough cannot be said for how amazingly brisk and refreshing the production comes across. Nearly every scene has at least some artistic appeal. This is one of the more attractive films I've seen using the Red digital cameras and I have to give the colorist some praise for the warm palette used to show the influence of NZT48. Thanks to the mindaltering plot Limitless is one of the few movies where extravagant transitions make sense. Limitless is indicative of a minor subgenre that sprang up around the dawn of the current millennium I call this the genre of selfdiscovery. Examples of these films include Fight Club and The Beach and more examples can be found in Asian cinema where I also believe Limitless drew inspiration for art direction. The primary goal of these metaphysical pictures is to delve into what makes us tick. Limitless asks the viewer to exam what's holding each of us back from being the perfect versions of ourselves and by stories end this viewer certainly felt inspired. I can see room to complain when it comes to the way Limitless approaches relationships. Remember I'm seeing this as a specialty film about inner exploration and as such I'm allowing for some leeway in how director Neil Burger is able to keep the pace going while focusing almost exclusively on Eddie. Still I would have appreciated one scene showing how his limitless knowledge afforded him relationshiphandling tact. Limitless has such a breathtaking pace that you aren't going to find the time needed to nitpick. Some of the action at movie's end is resolved with little plausibility but it's too much fun to attack. At least the title of Limitless offers some truth in advertising.".

He then stumbles upon a past acquaintance who introduces him to an experimental drug that could change his life forever. The intriguing proposition of the story centers around this pharmaceutical experiment that optimizes brain usage to 100 from the meager 20 that we normally use. The problem that we soon discover is that supply is limited..... and restricted.Eddie Bradley Cooper's attempts to write a novel go in vain and his inability to push himself to seek refinement is evident with his apartment his relationship with his otherwise focused girlfriend and his dependent finances. At such a juncture he stumbles upon his ex brotherinlaw who introduces an experimental designer drug that enhances brain functionality to harness all its potential. As he is then confronted by his landlord's wife who yaks at him for the pending rent Eddie chooses an intelligent escape by taking one of the pills and then whatever he has seen heard read or experienced in his life is available to him as reference. Knowledge acquisition is rapid and so is its retention. Eddie soon discovers that he can achieve the impossible like Bruce Almighty and as greed takes over he seeks to exploit the financial markets to make some astronomical gains. Overnight success draws inquisitive eyes of the ambitious and Eddie would need to maintain a low profile if he doesn't want to expose his secret to his phenomenal analytical abilities. Veteran investor Carl Loon Robert De Niro employs Eddie and gives him the incredible opportunity to make it to the big league in a very short time. Just when it all seems to be going his way Eddie realizes that the pills have an adverse effect on his health and without a regular intake he would almost lose his life. To add to that he is pursued by a goon who now knows the secret to his supreme abilities and demands more pills for himself. There is always some danger lurking around the corner in Limitless. Even though the idea of an intelligence enhancing medication seems like the ultimate strength one always feels restless and is aware of some form of imminent threat. It just seems too good to be true and that is primarily what grips you through this well paced screenplay. The film looks great with the camera speeding through the streets and the stunning views of New York city. The mood resembles that of Neil Burger's previous film 'The Illusionist' and this one is equally intriguing if not more. The background score is well suited to the film's pulsating situations. The beautiful Abbie Cornish plays the tense situations quite well and in confrontational scenes with Cooper she emerges strong. Robert De Niro gets a Michael Douglas type role where he seems to enjoy throwing his power around. Good to see him threatening people around him because that is what he does best..... Bradley Cooper took complete advantage of the opportunity where he can play a definitive lead and he is quite convincing both as the struggling author and the coolest man in town with higher intelligence. Director Neil Burger keeps the momentum going while keeping us glued with suspense action and twists. A novel idea is simplified in his execution and he makes it easy to absorb it as a reality right from the beginning. He does avoid superficial scenarios and unnecessary drama and chooses to portray the hardships that Eddie encounters while he possesses such power. Limitless entertains with the possibilities and the consequences of uncontrollable powers. However in the end it is no 'Inception' in story telling or concept and if you're in with unreal expectations it will surely disappoint but due credit must be given to Neil Burger for a good execution of the concept that even in the end doesn't fall flat on its face. 8.081 on a scale of 110.".

The concept is interesting enough super drug that enables all our human powers but the execution of that idea in this movie was a total disaster.It's an incredibly shallow story where our main guy works his way up in the system by writing a great book whilst on these magic pills gets involved with a silly loan shark at some point who for some reason seem to haunt him throughout the movie. His girlfriend is involved also and is hunted down by a man who is constantly following our protagonist and in what is one of the movie's absolutely dumbest scenes said girlfriend manages to escape from this guy by making a run for it having hidden from her follower behind some trees for some time nobody knows exactly why the follower knew she was hiding behind those 45 trees he's waiting there for her for a long time instead of simply looking behind the trees something you would do if you suspected someone you were looking for hiding there using a kid on skates to slash this guy down in an iceskating rink.Later on our man manages to achieve success and the American Dream is complete of course. The conversations in the movie are shallow very Hollywoodesque easy to swallow but it doesn't really seem real.In exploring an idea that could be very interesting the movie doesn't really deal with or manages to show the different facets of how a brain on this drug could in fact function. We basically just see a person who is good at performing whatever it is he does and the visuals of the movie sharpens or lights up every time he takes one of the pills in this case investing money and writing and ultimately archieves his goal  by staying on these pills. But there's no indepth exploration of the idea just a shallow American Dreamstory that we've seen so many times before but a lot better told than this.".

He's built right for it too sort of more likable Matthew McConaughey with his chiseled looks and piercing blue eyes. Limitless attempts to do for Cooper what The Bourne Identity did for Matt Damon remake him from a pretty boy romantic lead into a gritty dark hero.It works too for the most part. Limitless is a fun ride all the way through and it's visually striking to boot. It opens with a steady camera zooming through Manhatten through streets and taxi cab windows it sets a good tone for the rest of the film.The story centres around the myth that humans are only using a tiny portion of our brains at once. Cooper plays Edward Morra a writer with a book contract but a terrible case of writers block. Within the first few minutes he's dumped by his girlfriend for lack of motivation in his life and runs into his ex brotherinlaw from a very brief marriage right after college. Vernon the exbrotherinlaw is never given a last name because he's only there to introduce the main plot of the movie. He gives Morra a clear pill that he claims will give him the focus he needs to finish his book along with his business card just in case. Being in a desperate state Morra takes the pill while being shouted at by his landlords wife for being behind on the rent. Within thirty seconds he's deducing everything around him and naturally beds the wife and does her law school paper that she was stressing over. He then writes a massive chunk of the novel and falls asleep. The next morning he's lost his newfound mental abilities but he does have enough of a novel to hand in to his publisher along with a fantastically clean apartment being that a side effect of the drug is OCD apparently.He stops by Vernons apartment to see about getting some more but this is where things go wrong. The plot unfolds around Morra using his stash of the drug to advance quickly through the world of high finance attracting the attention of Robert De Niro playing a sinister Warren Beateytype of stock market broker while avoiding sinister figures who are after every pill they can find and are killing everyone connected to it. Also it turns out that the drug has serious side effects if you take it regularly but will also kill you if you stop.It's best if you don't think about the movie and just enjoy the story and stunning visual effects. There are plot holes big enough to throw Matthew McConaughey's ego through but considering the movie is built upon a faulty premise picking it apart defeats the purpose. It's just a fun thriller that gives you a couple hours of entertainment. It's well made well acted and is paced about right.There is one scene where he licks blood off the floor because it's laced with the drug that will absolutely kill any romantic comedy hotness Mr Cooper possessed but I don't think that's anything but a plus. It just means we might see him expand more into action oriented roles and if Limitless is any indication he might just be able to swing it.".

We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years but only a handful e.g. the first Iron Man were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home because the subject matter is handled seriously the characters are 3d lifelike people the plot has lifelike complexity there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts going in whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular here.So the good Original creative writing. Original creative beautiful cinematography. Original creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.The bad Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The forelast scene is over the top. I loved it. My wife said They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right? and they were. I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the rollercoaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.So unfortunately this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.".

Somebody cared. I had my doubts going in whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular here.So the good Original creative writing. Original creative beautiful cinematography. Original creative direction. Interesting throughout. Believable except when it isn't trying to be. Good pacing. Well acted.The bad Some scenes stretch credulity. Most by just a little. The forelast scene is over the top. I loved it. My wife said They're trying to pull a Tarrantino. Right? and they were. I can't blame anyone who says this scene ruined the movie for him. It isn't believable. It isn't consistent with the rest. But it's definitely where the rollercoaster that is this movie is at its most extreme. By contrast the last scene left me with a feeling of something missed. It's like the script saves the best for the sequel.So unfortunately this movie doesn't have an ending that makes you forgive it for everything else. Quite on the contrary. It just happens to be so good that I was willing to forgive it its bad ending.";

	schema:reviewBody "Someone asked me once what I thought ADD medication does. I thought  about it for a second and replied In the simplest terms it changes  your mind. Sometimes people's minds need changing. More than just a  push or a boost sometimes people need help remembering things  learning new things making connections between things they already  know motivating themselves to use that information etc.  In the movie Limitless there's a pill that does all of that and  much much much more.  The tagline for this movie is What if a pill could make you rich and  powerful? I prefer a line from the trailer How many of us ever know  what it is to become the perfect version of ourselves? Bradley Cooper  plays Eddie Morra a writer who can't motivate himself to write his  book even when he locks himself in a room with his laptop. He doesn't  do drugs anymore but anyone who looked at him would swear he was  always strung out. He doesn't have anything.  One day Vernon played by Johnny Whitworth his exbrotherinlaw who  is also his exdealer offers him some help a clear little round pill  that will clear his mind. Within a minute of taking it Eddie finds he  can remember tiny things from years earlier make connections between  little bits of information that he'd never given so much as a second  thought reason with startling eloquence and most importantly to  him slam out ninety pages of his book in one sitting that make his  publisher beg for more. Does he want more pills after all this?  Absolutely.  He's not the only one who wants them though. Despite Vernon's initial  claim that the pill is FDAapproved it's clear soon enough that this  is nothing you'll ever find in a drugstore. Whoever Vernon got it from  and however he got it Eddie'll likely never know because Vernon is  murdered shortly after he and Eddie reconnect. Eddie finds Vernon's  stash of clear little pills and proceeds to make over his life. He'll  need every ounce of intelligence the pills can give him too to fend  off a ruthless loan shark the police officer who wants to know Eddie's  connection to the dead dealer and whatever shadowy figure is following  him from the moment he starts taking the pills.  In the meantime Eddie realizes he can do far more than write books  with his newfound intellect. In a few short days he makes millions on  the stock market bringing him to the attention of Carl Van Loon one  of the wealthiest most powerful men in the world played by Robert De  Niro. Carl is more than happy to benefit from Eddie's freak status  and even cautions Eddie not to push himself too far. Eddie has the  brains but Carl clearly has the experience and the resources. He  warns Eddie to not try and become his competitor read enemy.  Finally Eddie has to deal with the drug's side effects. He has waking  blackouts often finding himself across town in strange locations  with complete strangers and no memory of how he got there. Withdrawal  symptoms are worse than your standard medication obviously and  stopping could mean hospitalization or worse. Since he doesn't know who  makes the pills or where to get more this is his biggest problem.  Or would it be worse to stay on the pills? Eddie claims they're just  making him into a better version of himself but are they in fact  changing who he is? Do they not just change what you can do but also  what you will do? His girlfriend played by Abbie Cornish once had to  deal with a man who wouldn't do anything now she has to deal with a  man for whom there's nothing he wouldn't do. The end of the movie  leaves the question of just how much the pills change you unanswered.  Based on a novel written by Alan Glynn this movie has plenty of action  sequences to complement the moral dilemma it poses how far will you go  to become a better version of yourself? Like all the great science  fiction movies this thriller doesn't focus on the scifi aspects  choosing instead to highlight the exploration of humanity on which we  embark with the very first scene. And anyone who contemplates  medication to improve their lives will certainly find a resonance with  the character of Eddie Morra. Watching this movie may not change your  mind but it will certainly open it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I wasn't moving forward I felt I was going to explode.  Eddie Morra Capitalism too has to keep moving keep expanding or it dies. And because logarithmic growth is in its DNA companies can only grow on the basis of everincreasing levels of consumption.  John Sanbonmatsu Limitless sees Bradley Cooper playing Eddie Morra a failed artist who stumbles upon a drug which essentially grants him super powers. How does Eddie use these powers? To make money buy penthouses play the stockmarket woo women become megarich famous and eventually the President of the United States. Though the film at times hints that Eddie will one day use his gifts for positive socially beneficial aims its overall message is an ode to superficiality and the powers that be.A cross between a comicbook superhero movie and Oliver Stone's Wall Street Limitless initially works well as a mindless power fantasy. The audience rides Eddie's highs grinning as he's reborn a dapper speculist who beds babes and rakes in billions on Wall Street. But it's all bells whistles and cheap gags. In the real world when the Masters of the Universe dump cheap subsidised cotton on the world market 20000 destitute farmers are drinking pesticide in India days later. Like clockwork.If the film seems to get stupider and stupider as its hero gets smarter and smarter it nevertheless unwittingly works as some kind of allegory for hedonistic capitalism. Our hero has the opportunity to do and be anything he can but instead chooses to cater to his own basest desires becoming greedier and greedier until his body starts to break down. But though the film rightly suggests that a life oriented towards a kind of pathological need for satisfaction comes at a corresponding price jogging dieting stress desensitisation addiction pain preparatory activities etc Eddie is himself never shown to suffer even a moment of regret has absolutely no self doubt and actually learns to fix his breaking down body so that he may continue consuming with impunity. Eddie may be an egomaniacal power hungry narcissist the film then says but it's okay because nobody gets hurt and he intends to one day do good as the US President. End result Limitless PRETENDS to say that powergreed is ultimately an addictionhigh that is destined to corrupt but ultimately suggests something else intellectual and personal greatness equals moneypolitical power and vice versa.Today we live in an era of unbridled capitalism. One which broadcasts the notion that personal limitless hedonism is a legitimate even the legitimate goal of life. In the era of high mass consumption this globalisation of desire is itself a prerequisite excess must escalate or the system dies. Indeed making desire and excess legitimate was perhaps the real revolution of the 1960s. As Tom Wolfe once remarked the 60s released an affluence that would have made the Sun King blink. But while consumer capitalism needs a hedonistic consumption ethic it also needs a work ethic. The contradiction of today is thus how to reprogramme the inheritors of this limitless ethic so as to suppress certain desiresexpectations  and to reestablish old bourgeois values of restraint  without killing the subject the goose that lays consumer culture's golden eggs? Or how to make the subject give up more to give you more? This nosedives into what Freud Marcuse and Lacan called the death drive each reinterpreted the former's use of the term. For Freud the death drive is literally a drive toward death and the inorganic. It exists in opposition to the pleasure principle and enables us to posit a life that exists beyond the pleasure principle. For Marcuse however who witnessed a burgeoning post war boom in consumerism and advertising the pleasure principle is ITSELF the death drive as the aim of an instinct is in every instance a satisfaction which can only be obtained by removing the state of stimulation. Lacan would then expand this further while the drive's goal is satisfaction its aim is actually intermediate objects which stave off the ultimate object of enjoyment. In other words the drive must not aim directly at satisfaction or else risk losing it altogether. So where Freud saw civilisation and scarcity as taming man's desires and baser cravings Marcuse and Lacan recognised that civilisation does not eradicate the ErosThanatos dialectic pleasurepain but recruits it for its own purposes. Scarcity then becomes the logic of domination.What Marcuse then began to document was the social shift away from an overwhelming presence of death to a pervasive limitless enjoyment. The subject was now mandated to consumeenjoy no longer holding onto Puritanical ideals of abstinence and selfrenunciation. Eros then becomes the psychic dominant of late capitalism. This society Marcuse then wrote is however predicated on the death destruction and domination of a great majority of people the enjoyment that it propagates is always only available to a select few. For thinkers like Lacan political struggle then became a fight predicated on Thanatos the death drive which became an ethical stance that must be accepted in order to disrupt the superego bond that keeps the individual at bay in the community.Note that the death drive as defined by Lacan no longer describes a literal death as in Freud's case but rather death within the Symbolic Order. After having rejected the Symbolic Order composed of language conceptualisation categorisation and The Law the subject persists as a kind of living dead. This obscene continuation of life a mockery of the symbolic order itself is nonetheless still within the symbolic order.

	onyx:emotionText "If I wasn't moving forward I felt I was going to explode.  Eddie Morra Capitalism too has to keep moving keep expanding or it dies. And because logarithmic growth is in its DNA companies can only grow on the basis of everincreasing levels of consumption.  John Sanbonmatsu Limitless sees Bradley Cooper playing Eddie Morra a failed artist who stumbles upon a drug which essentially grants him super powers. How does Eddie use these powers? To make money buy penthouses play the stockmarket woo women become megarich famous and eventually the President of the United States. Though the film at times hints that Eddie will one day use his gifts for positive socially beneficial aims its overall message is an ode to superficiality and the powers that be.A cross between a comicbook superhero movie and Oliver Stone's Wall Street Limitless initially works well as a mindless power fantasy. The audience rides Eddie's highs grinning as he's reborn a dapper speculist who beds babes and rakes in billions on Wall Street. But it's all bells whistles and cheap gags. In the real world when the Masters of the Universe dump cheap subsidised cotton on the world market 20000 destitute farmers are drinking pesticide in India days later. Like clockwork.If the film seems to get stupider and stupider as its hero gets smarter and smarter it nevertheless unwittingly works as some kind of allegory for hedonistic capitalism. Our hero has the opportunity to do and be anything he can but instead chooses to cater to his own basest desires becoming greedier and greedier until his body starts to break down. But though the film rightly suggests that a life oriented towards a kind of pathological need for satisfaction comes at a corresponding price jogging dieting stress desensitisation addiction pain preparatory activities etc Eddie is himself never shown to suffer even a moment of regret has absolutely no self doubt and actually learns to fix his breaking down body so that he may continue consuming with impunity. Eddie may be an egomaniacal power hungry narcissist the film then says but it's okay because nobody gets hurt and he intends to one day do good as the US President. End result Limitless PRETENDS to say that powergreed is ultimately an addictionhigh that is destined to corrupt but ultimately suggests something else intellectual and personal greatness equals moneypolitical power and vice versa.Today we live in an era of unbridled capitalism. One which broadcasts the notion that personal limitless hedonism is a legitimate even the legitimate goal of life. In the era of high mass consumption this globalisation of desire is itself a prerequisite excess must escalate or the system dies. Indeed making desire and excess legitimate was perhaps the real revolution of the 1960s. As Tom Wolfe once remarked the 60s released an affluence that would have made the Sun King blink. But while consumer capitalism needs a hedonistic consumption ethic it also needs a work ethic. The contradiction of today is thus how to reprogramme the inheritors of this limitless ethic so as to suppress certain desiresexpectations  and to reestablish old bourgeois values of restraint  without killing the subject the goose that lays consumer culture's golden eggs? Or how to make the subject give up more to give you more? This nosedives into what Freud Marcuse and Lacan called the death drive each reinterpreted the former's use of the term. For Freud the death drive is literally a drive toward death and the inorganic. It exists in opposition to the pleasure principle and enables us to posit a life that exists beyond the pleasure principle. For Marcuse however who witnessed a burgeoning post war boom in consumerism and advertising the pleasure principle is ITSELF the death drive as the aim of an instinct is in every instance a satisfaction which can only be obtained by removing the state of stimulation. Lacan would then expand this further while the drive's goal is satisfaction its aim is actually intermediate objects which stave off the ultimate object of enjoyment. In other words the drive must not aim directly at satisfaction or else risk losing it altogether. So where Freud saw civilisation and scarcity as taming man's desires and baser cravings Marcuse and Lacan recognised that civilisation does not eradicate the ErosThanatos dialectic pleasurepain but recruits it for its own purposes. Scarcity then becomes the logic of domination.What Marcuse then began to document was the social shift away from an overwhelming presence of death to a pervasive limitless enjoyment. The subject was now mandated to consumeenjoy no longer holding onto Puritanical ideals of abstinence and selfrenunciation. Eros then becomes the psychic dominant of late capitalism. This society Marcuse then wrote is however predicated on the death destruction and domination of a great majority of people the enjoyment that it propagates is always only available to a select few. For thinkers like Lacan political struggle then became a fight predicated on Thanatos the death drive which became an ethical stance that must be accepted in order to disrupt the superego bond that keeps the individual at bay in the community.Note that the death drive as defined by Lacan no longer describes a literal death as in Freud's case but rather death within the Symbolic Order. After having rejected the Symbolic Order composed of language conceptualisation categorisation and The Law the subject persists as a kind of living dead. This obscene continuation of life a mockery of the symbolic order itself is nonetheless still within the symbolic order. But now the agent derives pleasure from pain he or she has gone past the pleasure principle and enjoys being rejected by the symbolic order. This is the opposite journey of Limitless Eddie expands and expands and literally becomes The Law.7.510  Low rent Fight Club. Worth one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "'LIMITLESS' Three Stars Out of Five Bradley Cooper has came a long way from TV's 'ALIAS'. Here he headlines his first major motion picture taking over a role once filled by Shia LaBeouf who backed out of the film after hurting his arm in an automobile accident. A film with Robert De Niro playing a supporting player! As a whole the movie is entertaining but nothing great and Cooper's leading man performance is adequate but not spectacular. I think he's better in ensemble pieces like 'THE HANGOVER' and 'THE ATEAM'. The film tells the story of a down on his luck writer who takes a secret drug which enhances the level his brain is able to function at making him 'super smart'. It's directed by Neil Burger and written by Leslie Dixon based on the book 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn.Cooper plays Eddie Morra a New York City writer who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend Abbie Cornish who has also recently been seen costarring in 'SUCKER PUNCH'. He's struggling to meet a deadline for a book he's been contracted to write when he stumbles upon his ex brotherinlaw Johnny Whitworth who offers him a free sample of an unknown pharmaceutical drug called NZT. The drug provides him the ability to use a hundred percent of his brain's full capacity as opposed to the supposed normal twenty percent and makes him super confident. When he comes across a full stash of the drug he begins succeeding at everything he had always dreamed of. Then the side effects kick in and he discovers there are others after the drug as well that will stop at no cost to get a hold of it.The movie has an interesting premise and is played out at an amusing pace but it's full of holes and moral detachment. Without giving away too much I'll just say that if you stop to think about many details in the story they don't really make sense. There's also several things the main character does in the film that are highly morally questionable yet they're portrayed as if they're heroic actions. I also think Cooper isn't quite cut out to carry a film like this and makes the character even a little less likable. With all it's flaws the movie is still somewhat interesting and intriguing and definitely entertaining. It's a mixed bag but worth the watch.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vffxjYiwLUko".

We know people are active and while some of the people are interesting in the movie others are fairly boring. Don Cheadle and the other guy from California bring nothing new to the table. The other four stories are interesting but nothing ever happens to any of them. For example with the female rebel we hear her story and see her walking around.

It is geared at an already knowledgeable audience so those who don't know anything would most likely feel lost.Overall it is okay but nothing special.

My only gripe is the music score which relies on pseudo New Agey schmaltzwhich doesn't compliment the film I guess it could have been far worseohsay a musical score by Andrew Lloyd Webberfor example.

My only gripe is the music score which relies on pseudo New Agey schmaltzwhich doesn't compliment the film I guess it could have been far worseohsay a musical score by Andrew Lloyd Webberfor example. That aside Darfur Now is another addition to the growing ranks of quality documentaries that are playing out these days.";

I have been aware of this genocide for a couple of months and I am fully applied to make this situation end. Without further Ado this movie is an excellent documentary that included several topics that i have discussed with my fellow classmates. I believe there are other great documentaries based on Darfur but there is nothing wrong with people trying to express their feelings towards the on going genocide. I believe that everyone can make a difference by just watching this movie and being inspired to do something great and is able to help out the world. This movie is amazingly great and all the topics talked about in this movie are absolutely incredible. Just listening to the words of refugees in Darfur makes a great difference.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since 2003 the people of Darfur  mainly tribal blacks  have been undergoing a systematic genocide at the hands of the largely Arabrun government of Sudan Darfur being a western region of that nation. The UN has estimated that as of 2007 200000 residents of Darfur have been slaughtered and 2.5 million more displaced from their homes and forced to flee to refugee camps both inside Darfur and in neighboring countries.The mustsee documentary Darfur Now focuses on six specific individuals who have chosen to make a difference in the world. Adam Sterling cofounder of Sudan Divestment Task Force is a young activist from Los Angeles who spends his time not only trying to raise public awareness of the atrocities taking place in that part of the world but also lobbying the California legislature and governor to get oil companies to stop funding the Sudanese government. Luis MorenoOcampo is a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court whose job it is to build a case against the Sudanese government officials in order to bring them to justice in The Hague. Ahmed Mohammad Abakar is the Chief Sheikh of the Hamadea Displaced Persons Camp. Don Cheadle Hotel Rwanda is of course a wellknown movie star and author who has met with a number of world leaders on the issue. Pablo Recalde is a humanitarian who delivers food to people in the refugee camps often at great personal risk to himself and those who work with him. And finally Hejewa Adam is a rebel for the Sudan Liberation Movement a group dedicated to fighting back against the killers.All six share a common belief that what happens to one person on this planet happens to us all  and it is this philosophy that motivates them to take an active role in doing everything they can to try and change that world.Survivors of the raids recount in horrific detail the inconceivable suffering they have endured at the hands of the Janjaweed an Arab militia unit funded by the government to carry out rapes pillaging and murder on a massive scale though the government of course denies it. We also spend time with the rebel forces  motley bands of dedicated but poorly armed and trained men and women who have taken to the hills to defend their lives and homeland while they wait patiently and in many cases in vain for the white people to come and help them.Writerdirector Theodore Braun effectively cuts back and forth between his various subjects and in so doing brings an emotionally compelling dramatic arc to the film.More than anything else Darfur Now drives home how monumentally difficult and frustrating it can be to get recalcitrant people to put aside their daily concerns or footdragging governments their political expediency in order to help put an end to any humanitarian crisis not just the one in Darfur. But at the same time the film points out that people of goodwill particularly if they are large enough in number can have an enormous impact if they are simply willing to step up to the challenge.Filled with both hope and heartbreak Darfur Now is a fit companion piece to The Devil Came on Horseback an equally compelling documentary on the same topic. Together these two fine films help to bring Darfur's plight to the worldatlarge.The theme of both films is perhaps best summed up by the actor George Clooney who in a press conference on the issue asks One day this will end and the question will be where did the nations of these United Nations stand? Where indeed!".

The team at Illumination Entertainment who also brought you Despicable Me tried something new and approached a holiday that hasn't earned much attention from the film industry. Maybe they will set a standard for Easter films and this could be the beginning of Easter films. Or the end.The movie starts off strong we are introduced to the hero of the film E.B. voiced by Russell Brand I can only assume E.B. stands for Easter Bunny who is touring the candy factory with his dad on Easter Island where else would an Easter Bunny live?. His father voiced by Hugh Laurie really wants E.B. to be the next Easter Bunny. Unlike Santa Claus where there is only one of him that lives for a really long time there is a long line of Easter Bunnies that have been keeping this Easter tradition alive for 4000 years for the Christians do the math does something seem fishy? For the Catholics that fishy pun was intended for you in this Lenten season. At the same time we see Fred O'Hare get it? O'Hare. I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere as a small child who catches a glimpse of E.B.'s dad delivering Easter eggs. Fred even sees the Easter sleigh A sleigh? Yes I must have missed that one as a kid. It's an Easter sleigh towed by hundreds of tiny yellow chicks..Fast forward 20 years Fred played by James Marsden is now a grown man living at home with his parents with no job or even a real future. And E.B. is now a teenager for any of the viewers do the mathwait don't do the math and just go with this one who wants to drum in a band instead of inheriting the title of Easter Bunny. He runs away to Hollywood to follow his dreams. There Fred literally runs into E.B. with his car. I didn't realize how funny it can be to see a CGI bunny get hit by a car.Fred and E.B. don't hit it off right away Fred is pretty sure he is imagining the whole thing. E.B. annoys Fred with his antics and then Fred tries dumping E.B. in the wilderness. E.B. finally proves to Fred that he is the Easter Bunny by pooping out jelly beans. It's fun for the kids I guess. Fred then remembers the time he saw the Easter Bunny which makes him ignore the fact that he despised this rabbit 10 minutes earlier. Here as in most kiddie films the two characters that had their differences and are now best of friends must work together to fight a common enemy and therefore save Easter.Should you see this movie? Nope. The CGI and detail put into it was great but they didn't put half as much effort into the story. Sure it was cute and sure it had a few funny moments but it's just not worth it to see this movie. The kids have probably seen the trailer and want to see the bunny that poops candy. If they are between ages 4 and 9 maybe put the DVD in their Easter basket next year but don't waste 90 minutes for a 15second joke.".

Unfortunately Hop ended up being a horrible film which uses the most cloying and tiring routines from the family cinema. In a few words I found the story to be boring the humor to be excessively simple and trite and the performances with one exception to be lacking of any life or energy. However the solid animation and vivacious music might fool to some kids to make them believe they are having fun.I previously mentioned that almost all the performances also the voice ones feel listless. The only actor who shows conviction in his role is James Marsden as the leading character. His best attribute in this movie is that he makes us to believe he is genuinely interacting with a rabbit which would not exist on the screen until months later during the postproduction. And I also liked the fact that he takes his character seriously thinking about it better I think that that is what makes the relationship between his character and the rabbit credible. Unfortunately Marsden's competent work was not enough for saving this movie from being an absolute tedium.And just in case the screenplay was not questionable enough Hop forces its premise even more in order to justify the use of sporadic rockandroll songs with the hope of looking cooler. Besides the excuse of the rabbit wanting to be a rock singer is simply a rehash of the old clich son who refuses to follow his father's steps. Anyway I think that Hop is an atrocious movie which made me feel like genuinely wasting my time. In other words avoid it at any cost.".

The visuals with CGI bunnies and the Easter Island Wonka factory is fun but it all continually falls short of amounting to anything. Clever casting with appealing James Marsden helps but his family scenes are uniformly weak and play like bad 60s TV scenes we all groaned about in the original Bewitched. Overall HOP is a huge disappointment made irritating by boring Brand. A real missed opportunity made infuriating by the sitcom style and the go nowhere script and hopeless character development. All that technical expertise and THIS is all they do with it. That is lazy and cynical film making as if bundling shiny ribbon together is all that is needed. I went with a 4 year old and she like others in the cinema just became bored.".

Don't get me wrong we don't shelter our daughter her favorite movies are Star Wars original of course but a lot of stuff out there is just boring to kids.Nothing original??? Really.

	schema:reviewBody "Just as how Santa Claus stories work through their way through the Christmas period Hop brings forward the Easter season some three weeks early with a kids film that combines the best of live action and animation in yet another talking animal story which is something quite expected when you combine filmmakers who had worked on Alvin and the Chipmunks and the producers of Despicable Me who probably would have floated the idea that cute yellow things make for comedic villains since they're going against type.Hop is a tale about sons being unable to live up to the ideals of their fathers being told what is expected being seen as soft and unable to exert any say in what they really want to do in life. When we first see EB or short for Easter Bunny voiced by Russell Brand plush toy comes to mind for its incredibly cute design when the wide eyed bunny tours and allows the audience to see first hand what would be the equivalent of Santa's operations that the Easter Bunny adopts with multitudes of chocolate and candy making machines all outsourced not to elves but to chicks to operate and churn them out before making deliveries in one single day to all the kids.But as EB grows up his propensity to take on the family business or rather his calling in life takes a hit and wanes because he aspires to dabble in music and play drums. Rather than take over from his father he runs away to Hollywood to seek out his fortunes and thereby putting Easter potentially on hold and bumps into Fred O'Hare James Marsden who is also kicked out of his family home because his father and family members find it a tad ridiculous that he mucks around home for the last one year doing nothing. So it's a chance meeting of two similar sons set to prove themselves in a whole new world and bring about the usual kids theme of friendship perseverance and plenty of juvenile comedy. Look out for David Hasselhoff playing himself and the requisite cute bunnies collectively known as the Pink Berets who would probably steal the show.I have to admit though that some of the jokes do work since it's quite a wide spectrum from the usual toilet humour  EB poops delicious multiflavoured candy!  to a hilarious get up of the song I Love Candy with the duo continuing a ruse from earlier involving EB pretending to be a plush toy. This aspect of the film compensates for the lack of sophistication of the plot which for some weird reason has Fred not being satisfied with having validated that he's not crazy with his young time witnessing of the Easter Bunny going about his one day routine but desiring to instead become a bunny himself. That brought about what I thought was the most direct reference back to Despicable Me with the mindless bantering amongst the minions of the Easter Bunny's factory where second in command Carlos Hank Azaria in the absence of EB and his dad getting old secretly coverts a plot to usurp the festivity and run the entire show himself. While the minions have different designs and varying degrees of intelligence the chicks here adopt a uniform look and as expected there's always a smart alecky character to become cannon fodder for laughs.Besides priming itself for a respectable box office result when the Easter holiday rolls along what this film would probably successfully do is to ramp up demand for rabbits and chicks amongst its targeted demographic so parents do spare a thought and taper those short term wants. Strictly for the kids. Do stay tuned until after the end credits for a scene to witness James Marsden's Mandarin diction.".

	schema:headline " Cute bunny  cute chicks  if that's good enough for you then hop don't walk to see this";
	schema:reviewBody "The Easter Bunny is to Easter what Santa Claus is to Christmas. Legend has it that both the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus go around people's houses at night before their respective days bringing gifts though in the case of the Easter Bunny these tend to be more specific to coloured eggs candy and chocolates. Despite their similarities Hollywood seems to favour Santa Claus over the Easter Bunny going by the number of Yuletidethemed films around the plump jolly whitebearded man in a red suit and the dearth of films about the latter. Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio however attempt to change that with their partlive action partanimated romp Hop a through and through family film centred around the Easter Bunny. Also the writers of last summer's surprising hit for Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment's Despicable Me Paul and Daurio display much less of their ingenuity this time round. Indeed their adaptation of the Easter Bunny legend borrows too heavily from Yuletide films like Elf Fred Claus and in particular The Santa Clause that it almost feels that they have merely switched elves for chicks reindeers also for chicks and Santa for the Easter Bunny. The references are apparent right from the start when we are first introduced to the Easter factory where all the candy and chocolates for the kids are prepared. Production designer Richard Holland's vision of this is no more than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory crossed with Santa's workshop in any of the films mentioned above and despite the riot of colours there's little wildly inventive that will make you go 'wow'. Same goes for the Easter Bunny's mode of transportation which is really an eggshaped sleigh pulled by hundreds of tiny chicks or the source of its magical powers derived from the Egg of Destiny or the equivalent of a Santa suit. Paul and Daurio's reliance on these Yuletide film tropes extends as well to the plot of the movie which essentially is the story of the heir apparent to the Easter Bunny throne E. B. voiced by Russell Brand who also makes a liveaction cameo later on absconding his responsibilities to pursue his dreams of musical superstardom much to the chagrin of his father Hugh Laurie. You can probably guess the narrative pretty much from here on end just add in another outofwork slacker Fred James Marsden who is in the same reallife situation as E.B. with his father Gary Cole. Besides sorting out their own fatherson issues E.B. and Fred will also spend time bickering with each other before bonding through a fictional David Hasselhoff playing himself reality show Hoff Knows Talent an alltoo obvious riff on America's Got Talent and a singalong at a school play where both take turns singing 'I Want Candy'. There's also a subplot which sees E.B's father's number two a duplicitous Spanish chick Carlos voiced by Hank Azaria insinuating that he be crowned the next Easter Bunny in E.B's absence but this is played for little more than to allow for an frenetic actionpacked finale at the end. Though originality isn't one of its strong suits director Tim Hill's Alvin and the Chipmunks film does take pardon the pun more than a few hops in the right direction. Most prominently Hill's experience with such partanimation partlive action fare is amply demonstrated in the seamless blend of E.B. and the rest of the computergenerated animals with their human counterparts special mention goes to E.B whose features and expressions are beautifully and vividly animated. Impressive too is Illumination Entertainment's ability to create 'ohso adorable' sidekick characters the chicks including Carlos and the over enthusiastic pronetodancing Phil reminiscent of the little yellow minions from Despicable Me and equally irresistible. Hill has also assembled a lively voice cast led by the vivacious Russell Brand. Though there is none of the raunchiness usually associated with him think Get Him to the Greek Brand's distinctive laidback charm is still intact and fits his character perfectly. Just as outstanding is Hank Azaria's voicing of both Carlos and Phil. Though the two characters couldn't be more different in nature Azaria finds a unique voice for each and is especially good at delivering Carlos' punchlines with aplomb who can forget Carlos' line 'It's called a coup d'tat which is a French for coup d'tat!' And thanks to Brand and Azaria's voice talents as well as the excellent blend of liveaction and animation Hop still proves to be more than agreeable family entertainment even if laughoutloud moments are fewer and furtherinbetween than one would expect. Not to mention of course that the familiarity with Yuletide films of Santa Claus is unmistakable which also makes Hop just as undemanding if not unexceptional fare as most of these movies. Still it's colourful it's buoyant and it's cute so that's definitely enough to keep the kids entertained.www.moviexclusive.com".

	onyx:emotionText "The Easter Bunny is to Easter what Santa Claus is to Christmas. Legend has it that both the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus go around people's houses at night before their respective days bringing gifts though in the case of the Easter Bunny these tend to be more specific to coloured eggs candy and chocolates. Despite their similarities Hollywood seems to favour Santa Claus over the Easter Bunny going by the number of Yuletidethemed films around the plump jolly whitebearded man in a red suit and the dearth of films about the latter. Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio however attempt to change that with their partlive action partanimated romp Hop a through and through family film centred around the Easter Bunny. Also the writers of last summer's surprising hit for Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment's Despicable Me Paul and Daurio display much less of their ingenuity this time round. Indeed their adaptation of the Easter Bunny legend borrows too heavily from Yuletide films like Elf Fred Claus and in particular The Santa Clause that it almost feels that they have merely switched elves for chicks reindeers also for chicks and Santa for the Easter Bunny. The references are apparent right from the start when we are first introduced to the Easter factory where all the candy and chocolates for the kids are prepared. Production designer Richard Holland's vision of this is no more than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory crossed with Santa's workshop in any of the films mentioned above and despite the riot of colours there's little wildly inventive that will make you go 'wow'. Same goes for the Easter Bunny's mode of transportation which is really an eggshaped sleigh pulled by hundreds of tiny chicks or the source of its magical powers derived from the Egg of Destiny or the equivalent of a Santa suit. Paul and Daurio's reliance on these Yuletide film tropes extends as well to the plot of the movie which essentially is the story of the heir apparent to the Easter Bunny throne E.

	schema:reviewBody "I feel bad rating this movie so low because I suspect there was a lot of good intent. There was certainly good casting the most amusing aspect of this movie is the sly cameo stuntcasting. Hugh Hefner does a voice cameo that's pretty funny for instance.And then there's Hugh Laurie as EB's dad. While it may seem at odds with his nearlyamoral Dr. House once upon a time Laurie provided the voice for Peter Rabbit in the animated Beatrix Potter stories. He reprises this voice here. It almost qualifies as an injoke I was certainly amused by it but it didn't really do anything to advance the story.I also feel bad for the performers in general. They're good and they're stuck in the most cynicallywritten movie I've seen in a long time. There's NOTHING original here. At all. James Marsden is likable enough as is the nearubiquitous Russell Brand's EB. The scenes are all pretty much lifted from old Disney movies and Christmas specials even an incomprehensible nod to Back to the Future. We don't really learn a lot about the bunnies and their world and we don't get anything but the sketchiest motivation for anyone. And while David Hasselhoff's cameo in the Spongebob movie was clever and selfdeprecating here it was just kind of sad.Yes I realize the response to this will be aw give them a break... it's cute... The trouble is there have been tons of genuinely GOOD family movies made in the past several years. Back in the bad old 80s this tired script might have been forgivable. Universal Pictures is making a lot of mileage out of Hop coming from Illumination Studios the same people who did Despicable Me because THAT movie was genuinely GOOD. I'll grant that technically Hop is pretty good. But all the technical brilliance in the world won't make up for a poor story.In all fairness I'll admit that my 7 year old enjoyed it. My 10 year old though rates it at about a 3 on the 110 scale so the bar's pretty low. Wait for video.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been numerous infestations of animation meets live actor films like Scooby Doo Marmaduke Alvin and the Chipmunks and the worst of them all Garfield. All of the aforementioned secretions offer nothing but cheesy pointless stories and most of them were quite an embarrassment to watch. When I saw the trailer for Hop I wasn't performing any backflips about this one either. In place of murdering classic animation that I grew up watching and still enjoy it to this day Hop was a refreshing 360 degree turn as we are treated to a spontaneous story saturated with plenty of subliminal messages of morality topped with classically stylized fun that's filled with childish imagination not that there's anything wrong with that. Fans who have adored those Rankin and B animated puppetry might feel a bit of nostalgia due to the classic themes upgraded into the story. It surely comes alive in the long run but in sporadic moments it falls a bit short.The visual settings are sweeter than the jelly beans that our protagonist craps out of. The animation featured here was virtually believable and it gives you the impression that you're viewing an everyday regular movie only with talking animals and the iconic holiday character the Easter Bunny has a secluded hideout where he does his business.Many reviewers have claimed that it is a combination of Willy Wonka starring in a holiday themed film and it actually work out splendidly. Where special events happen just once a year mastering their craft with the greatest of ease. Granted the characters are plagued with a lack of informative tidbits of the world surrounding them is just a sample of how perfect timing the comical factors are in Hop.There are some flaws depicted here but in the thick of it it's mostly stuff I won't lose any sleep over. Our protagonist E.B. voiced by Russell Brand changes the scenario around rapidly by conducting so caring we just feel like we generally care for the critter and the conflict he encounters.When I walked into the theater I was expecting a solidly built movie which is a complex task for an animated movie for the young ones to enjoy. It's also covered on the holiday of Easter which is quite refreshing because there's very few holiday specials centering around the Easter holiday What other holiday will the film industry cover next? Could it possibly be St. Patrick's Day? Who knows? Practically I couldn't give a rat's  as long as the high quality of Hop is proved successful. If you want to see a spontaneous and substantial film that everyone can enjoy I recommend you hop over to the video store and rent or purchase Hop.".

If they really like a movie it sticks with them we'd barely got in the car before they'd moved onto another subject. 'Hop' is a lame rip off of a more successful movie franchise don't be fooled by the fact that it's from a major animation studio. It is quite simply boring and unengaging for both kids and adults alike.";

Hop has transformed Easter into the new Christmas drawing masses of families into the theaters. However while the film was a success at the box office being named the first blockbuster of the summer the film has much to be desired. Russel Brand Get Him to the Greek stars as a rabbit named E.B. who is destined to take the place of his dad High Laurie House as the Easter Bunny. As the Easter Bunny E.B. would be taking over control of Easter Island where chicks prepare Easter eggs and luscious candy delights for the Easter Holiday every yearsound familiar elves making toys for Christmas. However E.B. has a different idea about what his future has in store. To avoid his destiny E.B. leaves Easter Island two weeks before his coronation on Easter day through a rabbit hole to Hollywood. After a misunderstanding at the Playboy Mansion E.B. meets disappointment Fred O'Hare catchy name who has failed to live up to his father's Gary Cole Talladega Night expectations. However Fred's life is turned around after he meets E.B. allowing him to realize his life long dream of becoming the Easter Bunny. However before this realization can be made a reality Fred and E.B. must stop the evil plot of the head chick at the factory Carlos Hank Azaria Love and Other Drugs that would change Easter forever.The only thing that Hop is successful at is targeting children. It provides this audience exactly what they would want out of a familysafe Easter film. Everything about the film is harmless and clich within its kid friendly genre ultimately pleasing parents who do not have to worry about what their kids see. However from a critical standpoint the only character that is somewhat worth following is E.B. Lets face it you do not see many British bunnies that sound like Russel Brand every day.The truth is that even though Hop may be the best film in theaters for kids to see it has no excuse to totally disregard originality. Even though not many films about Easter are ever seen in theaters Hop seems like just another Christmas film shot during the spring season. Every plot line and twist can be taken lightly because believe it or not it has all been done before. The jumbling of so many clich plot lines makes the story random and by the end none of the film was fully developed. Also the acting in the film is horridly hokey except for various Russel Brand moments. Even so Brand was a very awkward choice for his role because he is the only bunny with a British accent. The clumsiness of the casting does not stop there with the evil chick Carlos Hank Azaria Love and Other Drugs being the only Hispanic chick in the movie.The story is very plain mixing The Santa Clause and Alvin and the Chipmunks with an Easter shell. This makes Hop nothing more than a kidpleasing flick that will make you wonder if Christmas came early this year.".

EB manipulates Fred into taking him in whilst at Easter Island No 2 man to the Easter Bunny Carlos Hank Azaria who is a chick plots to take over and become the Easter Chick.Hop is the way I see it nothing special. It follows the modern animated film structure of jokes plot CGI wizardry. Hop's animation is beautifully done but the trouble is that so is all other animation from any given CGI family film throughout the last five years. What little of the plot there is is too similar to everything else if not rushed and bad. For example I was confused at the choice of not making anyone care about EB being a talking rabbit. It feels like a way to sort out the plot quicker as does the conclusion where EB foils Carlos' plan by drumming the theme to 'I Want Candy'.James Marden was a great choice for Fred's character but I do not feel the same way about Russel Brand. He just does not go with EB. Hugh Laurie and Hank Azaria are both great though.In conclusion this is a film for kids and the people who are fans of the likes of Despicable Me Gnomeo and Juliet and Alvin and the Chipmunks but other than that it is a small disappointment.".

A nice very truetolife look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter  I've been there and this is absolutely accurate.It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe this film is 12 years old  I remember seeing it in theaters and I recently rented Ruby again. Except for the 80's looking clothes it has held up very nicely. Ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing. Boy talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! Anyone seeing Ashley here in Ruby In Paradise would assume this elegant natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting  instead she has become the go to girl for dumb action films and slasher movies! Very disappointing but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise.As some other commenter's say this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced. This is not an action film nor is it really a romance. The director Victor Nunez Ulees Gold another excellent character study treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail. In that way I think this is one of the most moving and respectful comingofage stories about young women that I can recall  it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity but about her life choices and her growing maturity.A lovely film if you take the time to watch it...I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls or boys for that matter and give them a chance to think about and discuss it.Particular kudos to director Nunez who also wrote the script which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a femalewritten novel or memoir but in fact it's Mr. Nunez's original work. Rated 8 out of 10.".

But as great as these performances were no performance was better than Ashley Judds Ruby Lee Gissing in Ruby In Paradise.What a GREAT film.There are scenes in this film that ring a sense of truth to what we say and act on in human nature as real people and not of what Hollywood synthesizes the fake emotions of what human nature should be like.  Take for example in the scenes where Ruby trying to be employed and make an existence for herself trying to work for living.  If this was a big Hollywood studio film her character would be receiving monthly support payments from God.

NOTE This isn't an action movie!!! It uses an occasional voiceover narration by Ms. Judd while writing in her journal  and oh I see I've just lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful movie where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in  oh I dunno carrying water and chopping wood.Actordirectorwriter Todd Field who played Nick Nightingale in Eyes Wide Shut costars as Ruby Lee's noble love interest one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth.But not even his character is the answer for Ruby Lee There's no external hero imposed upon her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writerdirector Victor Nunez who also wrotedirected Ulee's Gold did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself  confronting ageold challenges of good v. evil along the way.The supporting cast is also stellar and the music used particularly the cuts by chanteuse Sam Phillips whom I hear is the wife of T. Bone Burnett is right on  most especially Trying to Hold on to the Earth. Now when I hear the first few chords of that song tears spring to my eyes Pavlovian and unbidden  not sure if it's the music or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet charming message of empowerment.This movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find hisher way. For any woman of any age it is a must see! The downside It is NOT on DVD except in Spanish. We learned however that it is legal to make one copy of a VHS version which can be readily found online. My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and got a DVD copy made for me. Although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up onair  on an indie channel usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world. So buy a copy for yourself.This movie should have a major rerelease and it would if I were Queen of Hollywood. Figgy Jones".

	schema:headline " Ruby in Paradise is the story of a young woman who moves south to Florida in the hopes of improving her life.";
	schema:reviewBody "I totally agree with the main points of those who have already reviewed Ruby in Paradise. After having spent time living in Florida I would just like to add that this movie does a fantastic job in creating the mood and atmosphere of living in Florida. Businesses such as Chamber's Emporium are everywhere. The invasion of tourists from spring breakers to Canadian snowbirds is perfectly captured. The contrast between Ruby's two boyfriends made the movie more realistic. Ruby's first boyfriend was easily a mismatch considering he was more like the boyfriend that Ruby fled from at the beginning of the movie. The brainy boyfriend who looked down upon commercial businesses such as Chamber's Emporium captured a feeling that many students expressed during the Vietnam War Era of the 1960s. It was easily apparent that Ruby was well above that type of attitude. I especially enjoyed this movie because it did so vividly bring back memories of my time living in Florida. Of course my stay in Florida would have been much better if I could have spent time with Ashley Judd as her third boyfriend. Ha! Ha!".

After having spent time living in Florida I would just like to add that this movie does a fantastic job in creating the mood and atmosphere of living in Florida. Businesses such as Chamber's Emporium are everywhere. The invasion of tourists from spring breakers to Canadian snowbirds is perfectly captured. The contrast between Ruby's two boyfriends made the movie more realistic. Ruby's first boyfriend was easily a mismatch considering he was more like the boyfriend that Ruby fled from at the beginning of the movie.

It tells the story of Ruby Lee Gissing a young woman who packs up her old beater of a car one day and just drives out of her deadend life in a rural Tennessee backwater in search of something anything better.This isn't the sort of film that builds up to a melodramatic moment where Ruby must decide whether to stay or go. In fact the very first scene with her driving away with her old life literally in her rearview mirror would have made a great final scene to another movie. Instead we really don't know much of her backstory other than she's finally as she says later Made it out of Tennessee without getting beat up or pregnant.For no reason other than a pleasant memory of a vacation she had as a child she lands in a seaside tourist town Panama City Beach. Unfortunately it is the offseason and it looks as if she may may have traded one futureless existence for another.Here the movie takes a subtle turn. She finds a job not a great one but it pays the bills. She starts keeping a journal. She makes friends. She makes missteps with relationships. She starts building a new life that isn't going to change the world but it is better than the one she left behind. It all unfolds by degrees that some will find dull but many will find true and familiar and poignant. By the end of the movie we realize that paradise can be what you make of it. And we know that Ruby will be just fine.This movie is currently posted on YouTube and has never been released in any other format other than VHS. See it while you can.".

Nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award   looking at  Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby.  Ashley Judd Sisters won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage.Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common  man. I like that. The story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitos Florida is no paradise to me I itch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City Florida. Indeed the sand is very white.  I have been there.   Favorite Quotes Necessity has always been a good excuse. All that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now who is going to be and when and why.".

Nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award   looking at  Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby.  Ashley Judd Sisters won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

The plot lacks sophistication or credibility and while the idea is original the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference deusexmachina.

Somehow closed thrillers appealing to an inner search resolving conflicts in abstract living parallel worlds parallel to a reality which is as normal as possible. It worked in Abre los ojos because of the dreamworld vs hell duality. Here the mixture is between various strange or not normal worlds the always fascinating period of religious ceremonies in Spanish Andaluca.the game world invented by Moll's character through which Simn Noriega will get at his inner struggle.Noriega again playing his abre los ojos character safe choice by the production no risk This is a failure due to several aspects one related to direction which has to do with not being able to hold interest until the end the film dies completely as the historical Seville center is exchanged by the Expo92 site. this leads me to second aspect picking up Sevilla in the moment of its more visceral more mediterranean moment of the year and building there an absolutely inner abstract Amenbar kind of story is a failure by principle. No story can hold against those strong traditions. You either make a picture about Sevilla about religion and insert content on that basis it was following that path for the first half or you detach the story from any perfectly identifiable context example once more Abre los ojos and build whatever you want in that abstractnormaluniversal etc. space. And in this secondyou have to hold the viewer with strong thinking and fine construction. The first chance s more documented in a way more earthtoearth the second may or not work out more intelligent.Anyway trying to mix both was the failure here. OK Amenbar's soundtrack following Herrmann is good works in the mood there are good shots of Sevilla exploring some places and the overall production is quite good Spanish is now and was already here in a great production level. But you have much better things to watch from this country. Anyway i'm still trying to find something worthwhile and which understands Sevilla a fantastic city to which cinema hasn't been paying the necessary tribute.My evaluation 35 holds only for the production some beautiful faces and the other good elements i mentioned".

OK Amenbar's soundtrack following Herrmann is good works in the mood there are good shots of Sevilla exploring some places and the overall production is quite good Spanish is now and was already here in a great production level. But you have much better things to watch from this country. Anyway i'm still trying to find something worthwhile and which understands Sevilla a fantastic city to which cinema hasn't been paying the necessary tribute.My evaluation 35 holds only for the production some beautiful faces and the other good elements i mentioned";

	schema:reviewBody "'Nobody knows anybody' is a conspiracy theory thriller about a Satanistnut bomber targeting the religious festivities of Seville during Holy Week.  He also happens to be the best friend of the film's hero.  The plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game with himself and the hero as players and Seville as the virtual environment.  The very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old Pacmantype games.  Looked at this way the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by blackhooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays.  From the start we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game  the hero's job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper at one point the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend's father. Clues are liberally scattered as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e.g. the advert in the bar.  The detectivepaper chase elements are made part of a game in progress rather than an investigation after the fact.  The film borrows heavily on 'Se7en''s pattern narrative and anyone with a Catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to EAster.In this reading the game is on the level of narrative with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case the computer to win and save the day.  But there is a second game the film itself which subvert the first. There are another set of of clues which point not to the killer's intentions but the filmmaker's and his hero's.  In the first ten minutes there are references to chess a writer called Navokov and a cult leader called Sarin.  If we remember that the chessloving Nabokov's 1930s pseudonym was Sirin we see another game afoot one where we suspect not the villain but the hero himself.  In a Nabokov novel like 'Pale Fire' an authorfigure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text.  Throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e.g. the image contracting or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero's point of view.  The opening references to games are all linked to him.  In the early sequences much is made of the character's sexual and creative impotence so the film could be his attempt to master his life to be a winner in a way he can't for real.  No sooner has he won the game than his writer's block vanishes the words he types are the title of the film suggesting he is the overall author.  Further that title in Spanish reflects on itself negatively a very Nabokovian involution that suggests a hero like Kinbote trapped in his own solecism.This jumble of postmodern literature Borges Eco Pynchon et al are alluded to also Fincher 'XFiles' 'Run Lola Run' Chris Marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text and as a cultural history haunting the present Bunuellian anticlericism and Alex de la Iglesia's 'shock' films result in a film that is just that a jumble each cleverclever allusive element cancelling out the last dissipating interest.  The lack of clarity about the game's rules renders it incomprehensible and eventually wearing.  Ironically in a work of such overdetermined artifice the film's main interest lies in its documentary quality as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently.  Such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like 'Sans Soleil' or 'London' but ultimately you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness.".

Charlie's Angels and Starsky and Hutch are just two of the more profitable franchises the latter of the two bringing in 28 million in its first week. But both of those series tend to have fun with what they're parodying rather than remaking. The Mod Squad is basically just a remake of the show of the same title minus any real sort of substance and humor and only a low amount of actual fun. It could have been a blast but it's just rather mediocre.Three young delinquents Claire Danes Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps are recruited by a cop Dennis Farina to infiltrate many various operations prostitute rings drug circles that police could never get into. But after their boss is murdered and they uncover a conspiracy the three delinquents take it upon themselves to find out the truth behind the crime.2.55 stars.John UlmerThe plot is pretty weak even for a 60s TV show remake. The Mod Squad ran from 1968  1973 with somewhere in the vicinity of 120 episodes. I never saw any but I can't imagine this film adaptation does the show much justice.The cast is considerably OK. Danes is quite enthusiastic and pretty enough for her sweetblonde role Ribisi is fine as a criminal and Epps is decent enough too. Farina Get Shorty Another Stakeout is a good actor always very funny but here his role is completely wasted literally! and short on the sort of sly humor that would have been appropriate given the actor behind it. The dialogue is really corny and so are the characters' actions. Television shows need not worry about smart dialogue or characters because they're usually 30 minutes long sometimes an hour and we just get hooked on what's going on. Can you imagine if a soap opera made its way onto the big screen? It'd completely flop. People watch television shows because they like to see continuous stories with recurring characters they learn to love over a certain time period.You can't get any joy out of watching a bunch of actors try to grow on you for 90 minutes. If Alias had ever started out as a bigscreen movie it might have flopped because let's face it the show is not exactly quality material. People watch it because they get hooked on it and they enjoy watching the stories and the revelations like an old woman addicted to her General Hospital episodes.So here's proof that if The Mod Squad had originally been a movie there probably would have been no television show. Despite some rather bad wordofmouth this movie isn't a terrible one. I've seen much worse and compared to bigscreen disasters like Freddy Got Fingered or lowbudget ones like The Blade Master this is nothing very laughable at all.But compared to the fun factor of Charlie's Angels or Starsky and Hutch The Mod Squad falls flat on its face. It's not very funny it's not very fun and it's not very original. It's a cashin which is something Hollywood is not in short supply of right now. If you miss The Mod Squad you're not missing anything that hasn't been done before.".

The story lines frequently dealt with thentimely topics of the counter culture feminism civil rights racism the war in Vietnam the Baby Boomer era generation gap and more. Without actually being cops this was a precursor of sorts to the 1980sera 21 Jump Street.This film takes the basic general concept of the Mod Squad but doesn't execute the story very well. The lead characters played by Omar Epps Giovanni Ribisi Claire Daines all come across as sullen twits who have had previous scrapes with the law as teens but somehow have come under the mentorship of a police Captain played by a wasted Dennis Farina. Major Spoilers the death of the Captain early on in the story prompts a revenge investigation by the Squad but his death puts a cap on finding out just why this guy was so committed to mentoring these delinquents instead of just allowing the book to be thrown at them years ago.The main plot has the team investigating a drug ring that heavily uses young adults as mulesdealers. Of course the main boss is anything but someone their age hence the don't trust anyone over 25 attitude among the trio.Julie Danes has a cheating boyfriend and in one sequence she sets his car and clothes on fire in revenge. This comes only a few years removed from a similar tactic seen in Waiting to Exhale so there's a bit of anticlimactic context to it.The villain is a generic mobster and a sequence where he wants to dance with one of the male Squad guys is played straight but comes across as an awkward gaypanic joke.The theater audience I saw this with got more of a hoot out of Eddie Griffin's cameo than they did out of Omar Epps' entire performance.About the only role I envied in this film was Claire Danes' pants.".

At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum making it groundbreaking. This is just tedious. Claire Danes is nice to look at but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies. Giovanni Ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that Droopy the Dog look for an hour and forty five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to flee the set but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. Sure the production is nice with the now seemingly obligitory rave nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. Oh and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too. It's kind of like deciding to use the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go on a family vacation to Hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments but the next scene would suck the life out of it. You can knock  another Spelling remake Charlie's Angels all you want but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself. The Mod Squad makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went.".

The relative cool at the time of the original TV serieswhich cast ostensible hippies as offendersturnedundercovercopsis hard to reproduce as since then we've had 21 Jump Street and so forth.

Actually they're all OK under the circumstances but none are particularly convincingjust good actors miscast as action heroes. Still there's nothing particularly obnoxious about this misfire the way there is about say your average Michael Bay joint. It's just mediocre. The packaging is perfectly competent if uninspired. The director's only prior feature was an excellent indie drama Johns and it's really too bad that this flop mainstream crossover seems to have basically killed his career. He did have a hand in the screenplays for later successes 8 Mile and The Fighter. Actually the brief dramatic aspects hereRibisi's disillusionment with his parents Danes with her lying beau are decently handled. It's more the actionadventurecomedy angles that fail to levitate though despite a few silly moments they're not particularly bad. The funniest moment is a complete non sequitur when Ribisi shows up on the beach with takeout coffee and his recipients have no idea why he got it. Believe me it's better in context. Why do certain mainstream movies bomb and get labelled as serious duds while others that are at least as bad andor as financially unsuccessful get labelled as disasters? It's not always explicable. The Mod Squad isn't a particularly good movie. But it's not a particularly bad one either. Actually it's kinda enjoyable at least on the level of the routine TV action series episodes it was inspired by and which its musical score conspicuously imitates. It's just another soso wouldbe franchiselaunching film that got branded a dud cuz it landed like one.

One scene had  our three protagonists in  the front seat of a car plotting their next move. This was the bench mark. We saw the camera pan left right right left right left then left again so continuously I became dizzy.

I'm sorry but to me kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers. I walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back!

Number twoAs soon as the movie started I was confused it was like I walked in halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy but It's just not believable to me that little skinny Omar Epps can chase down a big grown man without a gun and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous plot. I'm sorry but to me kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers. I walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back! I do not reccomend this movie to anyone over 12 years old!";

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen the original television series The Mod Squad therefore I can not offer any comparison between the new movie from Scott Silver and the old time TV program. I can however tell you the this is one movie that contains a whole lot of nothing.The movie stars Claire Danes as Julie as an addict at age 18 Giovanni Ribisi as Pete who when directly to Beverly Hills to the County Jail and Omar Epps who has no heart or compassion leading him to a life in prison. The teens are called the Mob Squad because Capt. Greer Dennis Farina has taken them from their lives at crime and supposedly turned them around now doing serious undercover police work for him.The plot what little there is has to do with the young trio fulfilling an assignment penetrate a club where prostitution and drugdealing are seemingly accruing. The only problem the team can't officially carry guns badges and the movie never tells us if they can aren't allowed to arrest anyone.The film offers a few shocking surprises in the story line consisting of a few corrupt cops who we thought were good guys. The villains are somewhat of a mystery  until the middle of the movie and the ever popular concept of trust no one is used with some curiosity. This whole movie is kind of like the very recent The Corrupter which was a whole lot worse than this. That was mindless violence. At least this film was mindless action. See The Corrupter review. You'll understand what I mean by mindless violence compared to mindless action.The Mob Squad is shot in supreme style and glamour. The characters act like top class superheros the cinematography is used with a dazzling array of lights and background effects and the movie is directed with a focused point of view. My objection all of the action sequences never build up any momentum for themselves. The plot contains purpose for violence but it is worked into the movie almost as if the film was shot with no action the reedited for the addition of excitement.Likable characters inherit the credits.  Claire Danes UTurn Romeo  Juliet is kind of fun to watch as she and her buddies get further and further into deep trouble. Giovanni Ribisi Friends provides UNfunny comic relief which really doesn't fit in but is still enjoyable. Josh Brolin Nightwatch puts a sense of sneakiness and wit into his unpredictable character.The movie has such little plot though. I had extremely low expectations of the film when I went to see it and it was much better than I thought it would be. I suppose that I might give this film a marginal recommendation to a certain extent if you liked the television program or asinine combat the movie just might be to you liking.Director Scott Silver definitely knows his stuff here. He cowrote the movie as well and has lots of fun with different elements in his production. Too bad for the brainlessness of the plot. You see I have a very hard time giving a movie thumbs up when three characters are the main situation in every part of a story and when the film ended I didn't feel that I knew them any better than I did when I saw them on the screen for the very first time.".

First the premise is ludicrous. If these three were any good at undercover work it might have made more sense. However they blow their cover almost immediately. Second it's all so dull. The just over 90minute runtime drags more than it should There's nothing that held my interest Long stretches of tedious dialogue and lifeless action. Third and most importantly the script is horribly predictable. It's not very hard figuring out what's going on and who the baddies are. Plot points are telegraphed from the beginning. It's one of the more poorly written scripts I've seen in a major theatrically released film. Too bad really. The Mod Squad should have setup Claire Danes for a long interesting career in films. Coming off Little Women and Romeo  Juliet she was primed to be the next big thing. But if you look at her filmography it's not hard to see what this movie did to her career. Sure she's been successful but she hasn't been the big star she could and should have been. As for Danes' costars the less said the better. Epps proves he can't act and Ribisi is uberannoying.

We get together three very cool young actors in Claire Danes Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps. They look the part for sure and for me they fit their characters fine.

It was entirely too serious of a plot for the image the producers wanted to portray.  Those kids were just really really messed up and I seriously doubt that was the trademark of the original series.  I haven't even ever seen the original and I am still convinced that this movie falls far short of the first mark.".

Many teens and adults may find this movie wasteful but anyone who keeps an open mind and makes efforts to read between the lines can really see that there is a lesson to be learned. As in reality there are many towns such as the fictional rural town this movie takes place in. In such towns with closed industrial mills and no jobs you will find kids with too much time on their hands like in this movie. At the beginning the kids didn't see a point to their lives and just didn't care. Sheriff Tom Palmer Guttenberg didn't have much of a life either. Anna Montgomery comes to town as the school teacher and really turns them around. She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning but it goes to show that hard work heart persistence belief and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher coach and leader. Towards the end anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field thanks to true leadership.I admit this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement. Though it may not be a classic like Forrest Gump or Citizen Kane it really is a great family movie and really goes to prove a point.

The name The Big Green refers to the team's name which was what the field they play on used to be called. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children are practicing while the parents look on when it starts to rain the kids wont give up the ball and the coaches and parents try and get the ball. what happens is a cute moment between all of the families playing soccer in the rain and mud together. overall this film is just very cute and I highly recommend it especially for families with young kids. or even for elderly people who can no longer understand a very complicated plot my grandmother really enjoys this movie. anyways if you haven't seen this movie you should seek it out and watch it when you get the chance.".

I watched this movie for the first time when I was nine and I absolutely loved it. I loved cheering for the underdog and from my nineyearold point of view all the events were realistic and all the characters were believable. I especially loved Larry who was hilarious in his delusions. I watched this film again tonight and realize that it is a clichd film but only because I'm much older and more cynical. However this does not take away the fact that it brought back the days when I resolutely believed that the harder I worked the more it would pay off and that anybody could be a winner. It is optimistic heartwarming and uplifting for that inner nineyearold.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is great and i love it to this day. It starts out by showing a hick town in the middle of nowhere. I can relate to this because i live in a hick town. These boys are buying Cheeto's to feed the birds. They lay down in the middle of a field and let birds eat off of them. This looks like fun actually. A beautiful woman runs up with a water hose and scares the birds off in an attempt to save the children. They then find out she is their teacher. For some reason there is only two classes. I guess the little kids are elementary. They tell the sheriff there is big news. Their new teacher is hot. The next morning she tries to teach them only to find out she knows nothing about them. THe way she finally connects to them is to play soccer using a kickball. For some reason they think a football looks like a lemon. I don't know why. They need another player to be an official team so they get this kid Newt. he is always dragging a wagon full of junk. The fact that he has show and tell just goes to show how little he is. At their first official game they lose badly and feel horrible. They don't even have a name. It is decided the next day to call themselves the big green after their field of all things. Anna starts them on training which involves a lot of running. She even makes Tom join in the running although she is the only one not exhausted after the workout. She seems to be in exceptional shape. They train but still lose until they get uniforms and all of the sudden feel like a real team. They talk to this Mexican dude's mom and get him to join. They start winning and eventually get to the final game. Their opponent turns out to be the jerk that beat them the first time. He hits on Anna and they make a deal. If he wins she will kiss him. If they win he has to kiss the goat who is eating trash at that moment. It is quite funny considering the deal they just made. They lose for a while and then Tom brings the Mexican brat up there. He gets the game going again and they actually get good points and tie it in the last inning. The game goes in overtime and it get close but in classic Disney format they win and are all happy and proud. Come on did you think they were gonna lose? Like Disney would let that happen. The coach has to kiss the goat and everyone laughs when he kisses her because of course kissing a goat is the climax of all that is funny. Tom picks up Anna and gives her a big wet one. The kids pick her up and cheer. All the parents are so proud and everyone is so happy now.".

It is very interesting to see everything they have to go through to get there. Loved it as a child. Even if you are not a soccer fan it's a great movie to watch. It sends kids a good message.

The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like who coincidently teaches the class in a short skirt and gets them interested in football. Naturally they're all rubbish don't forget they're no hopers except for one kid who has moved from El Paso. Blah Blah etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of wellrounded kids. Hell even the adults start to come round drunks are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.This movie stars Steve Guttenberg. Now before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute. Guttenberg is rubbish. No no come on let's face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie? I have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either. She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it. Although I have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit. The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this. Most of them are disgusting andor annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all. There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat so don't bother seeing this movie.".

It also has one of my most favorite actors Steve Guttenberg a Jewish guy who I really like! Your children WILL enjoy this film today!

	schema:reviewBody "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes it is good very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunkerlike apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex BobOmbs but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging hyperactive girlfriend Knives who's only 17 kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt although even more lamed brained actually works and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news to win her love Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus there's the matter of breaking up with Knives and the battle of the bands is coming up!That's the setup what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely overthetop video game style fight scenes. Stylistically I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers such as veganpowered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here that's the whole point.The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief nor do they run screaming for the police which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before Scott replies with a straight face It's okay neither have I. Or the band's selfintroduction We're the Sex BobOmbs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out much to Scott's amazement and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly nontraditional with heavy use of dreams daydreams montages animated flashbacks and asides and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which the sound is another high point not only the energetic rock fueled sound track but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story providing interesting characters and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of tooobvious puns I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars.".

Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teenagelooking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bomomb and is going out with a minor highschool Chinese girl Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona the everchanginghaircolour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon but he has to face his own personal demons break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teensophomore movies produced in the last years and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute funny entertaining has great characters a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a videogame in which the main characters are the players and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the videogame approach but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people sex is not the focus although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover the emotions of the girl are not the focus here but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an overconfident guy your dream girl is ubercool and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles Michael Cera as Scott Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers Ellen Wong as Knives Chau Mark Webber Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However Cera really shines in this movie in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning the camera's movement the videogame and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan exboyfriend which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made.".

After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's ComicCon and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts literally the Universal logo and theme are 8bit you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows video games and comics just like a 20something's life would include are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot it all feels natural.While the audience might've been biased we held a 10minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you.".

The style of the movie with its end of level baddies gameplay setup and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a humdrum movie.

As a huge fan of things like fighting games comics or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 810".

The visual effects are top notch successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing like defeated opponents transforming into coins.The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also the ending is very frustrating with Scott in my opinion choosing the wrong person to be with.I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on but my guess is based on its length a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice I would advise you read the multipart graphic novel instead of seeing this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scott Pilgrim Michael Cera is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau Ellen Wong who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace Kieran Culkin and his nosey sister Stacey Anna Kendrick. At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona Mary Elizabeth Winstead. He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven exboyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.Although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been adapted from a 2004 graphic novel series it is to a fault like a computer game. It's been directed by Edgar Wright who previously worked on Shaun of the Dead 2004 and Hot Fuzz 2007. He has chosen to shoot the film with an overwhelming number of visual tricks that look to have come straight from the graphic novel source and the arcades machines. When someone knocks on Scott's door the onomatopoeic words appear on the screen. When Scott kisses Ramona tiny hearts trickle out between them. During the fight scenes icons popup to reveal Scott's high scores like an arcade game. But Wright seems too excited by these gimmicks and they are used too frequently. Rather than being charming little treats for the audience they quickly become excessive. The film's rapid pacing is also problematic. As the director and one of the film's screenwriters Wright seems highly intent on moving through the film's opening quarter as quickly as possible with rapid cutting hurling the audience from one scene to another. Given the speed of the first act and the array of video game aesthetics thrown in the rest of the film desperately lacks urgency. It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno 2007 it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly Like with jetpacks? There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air 2009 is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead's hair looks her character is still underwritten. It's disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film's central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent onscreen.Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It's pacing runs on a single exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game.".

It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno 2007 it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly Like with jetpacks? There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air 2009 is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead's hair looks her character is still underwritten. It's disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film's central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent onscreen.Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It's pacing runs on a single exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game.";

According to other members of my generation it is the movie to end all movies and the best movie... I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eyepopping visual effects I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun to a point. Entertaining? Well...Scott Pilgrim's first problem is the plot. The plot is selfconscious and repetitive as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil ex's. That's the whole plot and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn't matter in an effectsdriven popcorn movie but with nothing to root for or no suspense of any kind I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn't all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.Not to say the film doesn't have it's good points. Michael Cera though not as witty as he can be is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind it is jam packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout and as a director Edgar Wright hasn't lost his talent. Unfortunately the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me. Maybe it's because I don't play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I'm just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does but I simply can't. I'll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 510 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter.".

That being said when the movie in question is already being marketed as a comedy a person can really find themselves reaching.

This is that rare beast a film that actually makes the rational audience member seethe and froth with rage at how shallow and calculating it is how utterly empty and devoid of any soul or any artistic sensibility.Of the actual plot there isn't much to say. Blah blah urban ennui blah blah cardboard existential angst blah blah the theme tune from Legend Of Zelda? Blah. Michael Cera once again sleepwalks through a part he seems to be playing via satellite linkup. His philosophy behaviour fashion sense and interests are all carefully delineated in order to make him the ultimate hipster composite an icon for trendwhores everywhere. Will he get the girl of his dreams whose quirks are equally well chosen to make her his ideal match? Will his tedious garage band make it big? Will this movie try and challenge its audience in any way? Seems to me the mark of a good film is to start from more or less a neutral position then to actively make you enjoy it via good writing acting and direction. This is the emo equivalent of one of those dreadful Christian Bible films where quality is pretty much irrelevant since the faithful will always defend it on the grounds that it's Jesusfriendly. Here the target audience will be so enthralled to see it's own interests acknowledged in 35mm that normal standards won't apply.Hollywood has always made its money by tailoring genre films to demographic expectations  so it really shouldn't be any surprise that a movie so resolutely targeted at 20something hipsterslackerposeurs should be as blandly plastic and artificial as any Disney pukeathon. But for those of us who quite like things like old 8bit video games and anime it's hugely irritating to find them hijacked and pressganged into service as garnish for some smarmy indie manifesto. And it's even more annoying that someone like Edgar Wright who up to now I rather respected for his subversive take on sitcoms Spaced Zombie horror Shaun of the Dead and crass action flicks Hot Fuzz is basically pandering to a ready made market with something as utterly conventional as this. Because ultimately though it might seem superficially to be a fresh and original product this movie is total formulaic sludge full of lowbudget indie tropes jacked up on a hundred million dollar budget.Had it been made by a genuine independent company with a cast of unknowns and utilising the whole retro gaming aesthetic more authentically it might actually have been a lot better. Because it is kind of cute and fun to see some old Super Mario graphics crop up infilm and sometimes the use of sound FX is clever enough to justify the exercise. But then it would probably have won a bunch of awards at Sundance and been remade as precisely the film we have now. So Edgar Wright has thoughtfully cut out the middleman. Indie cinema nowadays is generic enough in it's attempt to be the 'antiHollywood' but once mainstream studios have finished coopting its clichs and CGIing the crap out of it this is the result.Terrible terrible film.".

The acting was awful the dialogue was awful the characters were all horrible people the editing was obnoxious and annoying the special effects were obnoxious and annoying the story was Annoying the music was awful and there was Not one Single Redeeming or Likable Feature about The Whole Thing!The frenetic editing style mixed with lots of colourful flashing things almost seemed like a desperate attempt to keep the audience focused on the film treating their aged 1625 demographic like magpies with short term memory loss if there isn't something flashy colourful and new on the screen every 10 seconds their eyes might wonder away from the screen and down to their iPhones since they just can't stop themselves from updating their Facebook status in the middle of the cinema. Besides that i found the whole arcade game mixed with comic book style tiresome and ugly to look at.The whole film is so obnoxious and in you face all the time with its oooh we're so geeky cool and retro yeah 8Bit rules i'm in a band! PacMan is so totally awesome etc attitude which is pretentious and sickening. The attitude of the film is that of PseudoIntellectual studenttrendyhipstercool kid posturing it was trying too hard to be clever i couldn't focus on what was going on because the editing and the special effect were giving me a headache the characters had nothing interesting to say and were for the most part horrible people i couldn't relate or care about them at all and the whole film was messy unfocused and most of all Uninvolving.I was so full of rage that i felt like i was about to have a panic attack i was hyperventilating my whole body was shaking my knuckles were white from clenching my fists and i felt physically sick! We Just HAD to Walk Out i was so ANGRY i started screaming in the middle of the street and my hand had a steel like grip over my mouth to try and stop me from swearing on top of my lungs! I mean i wasn't sure if i was going to like it but i did not expect to be so insulted and enraged and i highly doubt if the remaining 67 minutes would have been any better! I have Never walked out of a screening in a cinema before and its my ultimate golden rule never to do so even if its really bad i stick with it until the end so i can say i have seen the whole film and i can make a fully informed opinion about it BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN PUT UP WITH!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Being quite the fan of director Edgar Wright's previous efforts and being a self confessed gaming nut since 1981 and seeing the rise of the Nintendo generation from the beginning who supposedly this film is directed at. I was really excited and looking forward to spotting all the gaming references that Wright likes to sneak into his films and shows.It turns out this film is the most shocking example of what passes for entertainment these days. It was terrible unfunny and extremely annoying.The film is absolutely tailor made for a generation that has an attention span of about 0.2 seconds. The characters all talk in a similar quickfire style with a camera cut happening almost every half second and the screen is littered with bright coloured animated fx obviously there to stimulate whatever moronic mind would find this fun. The characters are horribly accurate examples of today culture with protagonist Scott Pilgrim himself being the archetypal anti hero. Weedy weak unsure of himself and sensitive along with the token gay friend and 'rocker' girlfriend.This is a nerds wet dream. It places a weakling in a world where game rules apply and said weakling proceeds to annihilate 7 rather more burly boyfriends of the pretty girl he is trying to woo. It's what every nerd outcast and skinny emo boy in the world wishes would happen to them.I'm insulted that this film wants to the the hero for gamers of the world. I am a massive gamer and absolutely nothing about this film appealed to me at all.Now to be fair I must give kudos to the visual effects in the film. They are both stylish and impressive and the actual fight choreography itself is excellent. To those that think that this is enough to make a film good even a comic book action film must have something seriously wrong with them.Do yourself a favour walk out after the 8bit Universal logo. It's by far the best part of the film!".

	schema:reviewBody "I honestly wanted to like this movie because I liked Michael Cera's work in other titles like Youth in Revolt. However he often seems to be typecast as the lovable loser and in this film it just did not work for him leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable.The plot centres around his character Scott Pilgrim who is struggling to make his band a success and get over a bad break up a year before. He dates a high school girl 5 years younger for a while before being attracted to the clich unapproachable new girl in town with the mysterious past. She is obviously way out of his league but seems attracted to him as a rebound because he seems sweet and shy and all her exes were evil. Even though this is obviously not a recipe for a lasting relationship he follows her like a poor lost puppy cheating on his poor lost girlfriend. Eventually he dumps his girlfriend so him and the new girl he knows nothing about can live happily ever after. However surprisingly there is a catch in the form of the 7 evil exes he has to defeat to win her hand. Notice it says 7 evil exes not just ex boyfriends. This is because a tired 'I kissed a girl and I kind of liked it' moment is dragged out in a desperate attempt to stop you losing interest it doesn't work.Through the fight scenes the film makes hackneyed points like 'self respect is stronger than love' using hamfisted video game metaphors you'll be bored of before the action even starts.This might work as a game but not a film the story and the characters are so superficial and two dimensional that the only true stars are the special effects and Ramona's cool hair.The game sequence's are not the really unrealistic bit that comes with the human relationships. During the final fight Scott finally casually admits I cheated on both of you. I'm really sorry...so are we all good? And they are! So he gets to screw over everyone and get his sappy ending. Wait I thought this was supposed to be a feel good movie? In conclusion I found the movie and especially the ending disappointing. There were a few fun moments but not enough to make it worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat all the way through. Worst meaning it bored me senseless. I was on the verge of turning it off several times and the only reason I let it keep playing was I somehow hoped it would come alive somewhere in the middle or three quarters in or even in the last few minutes. But it just doesn't. Despite having the potential to be a good movie  A girl with rad hair colour a reasonably OK story line comic strip captions indie music and quite a few actors I like it totally fails to be interesting in any way. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities about it. None. There are no characters to like. Or dislike. Since the main character is so totally unlikeable it's impossible to dislike his enemies much and when you don't actually care if the evil exes take him out or not it renders the whole experience simply boring. Besides they don't seem that evil I don't really know what was evil about them apart from being exes. Scott Pilgrim on the other hand is an utterly awful character I'm glad he's fictional. I'd like to call him quite a few things but I'm pretty sure IMDb would censor them and not accept this review so I'm leaving them out cos I want to warn others before they waste money and an hour and a half of their lives on this movie. If there is such a category as indie Bmovie this is it. Except that Bmovie implies it's so bad it's at least funny. This is not even funny. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen all the way through. So if you decide to watch it despite reading this and it turns out you find it boring too during the first 20 minutes SAVE YOURSELF! TURN IT OFF! You can spend the remaining 1hr 25 minutes doing something way more fun with your life. Cos pretty much ANYTHING will be more fun than watching the rest of this movie. If you're on the other hand aiming for death by boredom  carry on. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world will do the trick. Guaranteed.".

So for the most part we get nicely observed almost documentarystyle shots of farm life e.g. a farmer slits a lamb's throat in closeup and the countryside on a swelteringly hot day.

The rest of the cast is good too although one wonders whether the film sometimes offers a limited view of the secondary characters. Perhaps though it's just aiming to portray the limitations of the world in which David is being brought up he's fatherless and we might hope that he will have more positive influences around him than these men who seem so scornful of their own upbringings and rather dismissive towards their wives.In general then Le Souffle at 77 minutes manages to make quite an impact and I'm looking forward to Odoul's  and Bonnetblanc's  next work.".

This is not supposed to be 'real' the frequent dream sequences point to a directorial awareness that he is making a comment on the very themes he is focussing on.

	schema:headline " A beautiful little film.";
	schema:reviewBody "There are no crucial plot elements in this film as it's not the kind of film that relies plot therefore no danger of spoilers. Rather it is a film about one day in the life of a troubled and restless teenager David which is spent on his uncle's farm. This for the most part is a day of immense boredom which he begins by being ordered by his uncle into doing various tedious chores around the farm e.g.collecting wood and hay etc.These he does only with great reluctance. After the morning's work he is invited to a drinking session on the farm with his uncle and his friends but although he joins in and becomes very drunk and throws up he just becomes even more bored and restless. Bored of the company of these older men he begins to wander around the farm. Although there's not much of a plot there is a climactic ending however which is propelled along by tragic event near the end of the film which I won't go into.The day is shown through a strange blend of realism symbolism and dream. In the very beginning of the film the emphasis is on realism. One of the earliest scenes shows graphically his uncle cutting the throat of a sheep or lamb have to admit that i turned away at this point because i knew it was coming. I think the idea of showing this scene was to dispel right away any idea of this countryside farm as being some sort of idyllic setting. For teenagers who have grown up in small towns farms or villages eager for excitement and brought up on mass mediated pop culture TV and entertainment the countryside is a place of inescapable and intolerable boredomI grew up in one so i should know. David's own attitude to animals and nature seems ambivalent or continually changing throughout the film. In one Scene David finds a dead rabbit and spends some time digging a grave for it gently caressing and kissing it as he puts it in. But in another scene we see him repeatedly kicking a cockerel out of his way and in another throwing stones at a donkey. Another reviewer described the David character as a 'tedious arrogant sociopath'. True but isn't that a n accurate description of most teenagers. As teenagers go i found him quite likable. Frequently throughout the film we see what seem to be very short dream sequences although these could also be merely describing Davids state of mind. Either way no direct or obvious explanation is given to what these strange images might mean. They reminded me a bit of Lynch's 'Eraserhead' particularly the bit with glittering dust floating through the air like stars.The entire film is beautifully shot in sharply contrasting black  white. The use of sound is also very striking and effective. Occasionally the sound of an airplane can be heard roaring past although we never actually see it and sometimes with the sound trailing off into the next scene. In one part the sound dies off altogether in what would normally be the loudest scene of all  during a thunderstorm and this creates a strange psychological effect. This along with some of the other poetically symbolic scenes reminded me of Tarkovsky's films. I really can't understand people who claim this film is boring and pretentious i found it to be neither. As for the charge of 'boring' well it's a film partly about boredom the boredom of youth so it would have been totally inappropriate for it to concentrate on any plot particularly a complex one. But that's not to say the film itself is boring. Far from it it's a film full of interesting characters and beauty. And as for the 'pretentious'charge pretentious seems to be a word used by people who are unable to appreciate artistic beauty or who are unwilling or unable to engage with a film done in any other way than the typical Hollywood way which is itself a form of snobbery. The word 'pretentious' means to make undeserved claims of distinction or importance. The director has not done that with this work he has simply made a beautiful little film.Definitely worth watching.".

In this process naturally we have to discard our preconceptions and routine streams of thought who made the film is it arthouse does it belong in a list of masterpieces.A bunch of those here a remake of a well known French film the presence of Richard Gere usually signifying fluff the very idea of a film that never made much sense to begin with. Who needs a Breathless remake much less the Hollywood version? But we got it so what about it? The Godard film was about young people coming to discover for the first time the struggle with important things about love and meaning dealt with in the pretentious silly superficial ways of youth. What tied the struggle together was a boyhood fantasy about movies. We had a protagonist acting out an imaginary gangster part and the reality of the film arranged around him as a movie plot in which to act the part. It was about the safe distance provided by the fictional as conflated into the emotional distance between two people.Now watch how the remake transcribes this. Richard Gere is the Michel Poiccard character but instead of Bogart he is a Clark Gable. A movie hunk 'exhuding studly scent' as another reviewer aptly puts it. Recklessly oblivious to anything but the present moment and what it has to offer he is the very dream of movies. A doofus at first sight but who instinctively seems to have grasped the essence of life by the balls. As much a target of ridicule as admiration. We see him empathize with utmost seriousness with Silver Surfer comics! Something akin to a destiny for him.But we're not inside him we're siding with the French girl who's come to LA to study architecture. The girl who plans thinks wants the buildings she will create to last. The perfectly logical human being who along with us is swept away by the irresistible allure of an existence without bounds centered in the 'now' and radiating outwards. Valerie Kapriskie is a perfect match here an Ali McGraw to Steve McQueen she's great because she can't act to hide what seems a genuine infatuation with Gere's adolescent antics mixed with genuine frustration.We travel with them through a fetish dream of LA. Cars are fireengine red Thunderbirds summer dresses and even telephones pink. I've been going this month through a phase of cinematic vacation in Los Angeles and this one has the best sense of place of anything I've seen yet. The dark joint with the jukebox the empty streets blowing with hot summer wind.But it's more than a ride of pure exhilarating movie pleasure there's something to talk about here.It's peppered throughout but centered in a scene by a pool. The girl wants to know what is behind the man's face what kind of nothingness. He blurts something about love no doubt cribbed from some magazine. A little later an aging architect who no doubt has been where she is and has come to understand the world tells her that nothing that is built lasts.And the best part taken from the pages of a Silver Surfer comic. I won't go into details but it says something about us the sentient beings narrating our story removed from our heart yet discovering it in every reflection. It makes for perfect Zen.So we have this hipswivelling rock'n'roll Zorba the Greek who is empty inside in the best sense possible so that he is filled with everything. Like only a blank sheet of paper can be clearly written on.And he's on the run for a fateful mistake of shooting a cop. How the scene is edited is important we see a windshield shatter then Gere looking with astonishment at the pistol in his hand. Elements crucially missing from the edit the action itself reveal the emotional state how many mistakes can we look back on and be perplexed how we let them happen? There's more to it. There's a marvellous love scene in a movie theater playing Gun Crazy which the film is reversed from. The two lovers roll around as behind them loom huge footage of the fictional couple in Gun Crazy discussing what pertains to the two lovers.And before the climax we ride all the way up to a property overlooking the LA nightscape. Errol Flynn's as we find out again movieland.It is better than the Godard film miles better. It's as much about the old tropes of sex and violence as that film except it's filled with actual heart. It is about kitsch elevated into noble gesture about reality dismantled into fiction and the opposite. Novice film buffs discovering a sense of importance with Tarkovsky and Malick will find little in this simple film to appreciate but those who've done their rounds and are looking for specific things may be strangely fulfilled by this.".

The girl wants to know what is behind the man's face what kind of nothingness. He blurts something about love no doubt cribbed from some magazine. A little later an aging architect who no doubt has been where she is and has come to understand the world tells her that nothing that is built lasts.And the best part taken from the pages of a Silver Surfer comic. I won't go into details but it says something about us the sentient beings narrating our story removed from our heart yet discovering it in every reflection. It makes for perfect Zen.So we have this hipswivelling rock'n'roll Zorba the Greek who is empty inside in the best sense possible so that he is filled with everything. Like only a blank sheet of paper can be clearly written on.And he's on the run for a fateful mistake of shooting a cop. How the scene is edited is important we see a windshield shatter then Gere looking with astonishment at the pistol in his hand. Elements crucially missing from the edit the action itself reveal the emotional state how many mistakes can we look back on and be perplexed how we let them happen? There's more to it. There's a marvellous love scene in a movie theater playing Gun Crazy which the film is reversed from. The two lovers roll around as behind them loom huge footage of the fictional couple in Gun Crazy discussing what pertains to the two lovers.And before the climax we ride all the way up to a property overlooking the LA nightscape. Errol Flynn's as we find out again movieland.It is better than the Godard film miles better. It's as much about the old tropes of sex and violence as that film except it's filled with actual heart. It is about kitsch elevated into noble gesture about reality dismantled into fiction and the opposite. Novice film buffs discovering a sense of importance with Tarkovsky and Malick will find little in this simple film to appreciate but those who've done their rounds and are looking for specific things may be strangely fulfilled by this.";

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1983 the remake of JeanLuc Godard's A Bout de Souffl was savagely attacked by critics. It was understandable at the time. Today I'll bet many of the critics probably feel the film is much better compared to today's bottom feeder cinema many of which top the box office.Richard Gere's Jesse LuJack does the rare feat of being both repulsive and likable. Early in the film you despise the reckless cocky S.O.B. of a criminal that he is but as the film wears on you suddenly find his character extremely appealing. Once you warm up with him you realize how much fun Gere is having playing LuJack. His traipsing in L.A. becomes very entertaining in a video game sort of way. Singing to Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis disrupting his girlfriend's exam and his role as The Fugitive makes the film so compelling and fun to watch. He embodies coolness while being hip which can be hard to do.As for Valerie Kapinsky I have seen some of her softcore films from Europe and she is tremendously sexy. She has sex appeal and looks delicious in virtually every scene. Her acting here gave her an undeserved rap. She's supposed to be playing a French exchange student. I think she did the best job possible by playing herself. I would take Kaprinsky over some American actress faking a French accent. There could have been other French actresses out there that could have taken the part but she fit in perfectly for the role IMO. She probably didn't object to the nudity required.The film also delivers some steamy situations. Making love in front of a huge screen showing an old movie I think Judy Garland was in it while being on the lam in L.A. just sounds so dreamy. Makes me want to do the same with my girl only I won't have an arrest warrant on my head LOL! So yes the movie isn't a classic and it isn't Casablanca but the film is much much better than the turkey it received in 1983. It's definitely worth seeing.Interestingly enough Jim McBride would later direct a biopic of Jerry Lee Lewis in 1988 called Great Balls Of Fire so his interest in late 50's rockabilly was apparent here regarding the great soundtrack.".

The fact that this still gets so many negative reviews proves that even now most people simply don't get it. The main thing is Gere's performance  you'll either love his preening irrepressible arrested adolescent or find him grating. I think it's the performance of his career. This is one of Tarantino's favourite movies and although it's not really anything like a QT movie you can see why it appeals to him. I was all set to hate it but by the end I loved it.

Breathless could be seen as an expansion of his minor role as Diane Keaton's dangerous prettyboy in Looking for Mr. Goodbar  transposed from wintery Chicago to sultry L.A.I won't analyze this film.

Kaprisky is a goner after that.3. Gere's line I think maybe I was rolling dice when I should have been rolling you. Cheesy sure but look at her face when he says it.4. The shower scene together. Kaprisky running hot and cold. Jesse you're crazy. ... So what? ... It's OK. I like it.5. Gere turning female heads wherever he goes as he exudes his studly scent.6. Los Angeles as The Place to Be. I lived and loved in L.A. during the earlymid80s and can vouch for the intoxication of being young and on the go in the City of Dreams. It's one bigass place. McBride and veteran lensman Richard Kline do a superb job of capturing its heat light L.A. sunsets put a glow over the whole city and diversity  from the downtown hotels and office towers to the industrial sections to the Hollywood hills to upscale West L.A. to the beach communities where we see what must be every mural in L.A..7. The amazing ending. Gere taking his allornothing motto to the wire.

	schema:reviewBody "...you knew when it was announced that the cinesnobs would love to hate BREATHLESS. No it wouldn't be Godard's A BOUT DE SOUFFLE and it wouldn't have all the revolutionary touches of the 1960 original. While the director had made a cult favourite a dozen years before the postnuclear tale GLEN AND RANDA and would go on to make THE BIG EASY and GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! Jim McBride wasn't even a tenth as well known as Godard. But it did have Richard Gere at the peak of his popularity as the male star and he gave perhaps the most entertaining performance of his career to date... ...the story is basically that of the Godard picture but instead of a French guy pursuing an American gal in Paris here we have an American guy pursuing a French gal in California. Jesse Lujack a charming but larcenous hustler steals a car from a casino parking lot in Vegas and hightails it to L.A. to hook up with Monica a French exchange student he'd spent the previous weekend with. But on the way he unintentionally kills a highway patrolman.

No it wouldn't be Godard's A BOUT DE SOUFFLE and it wouldn't have all the revolutionary touches of the 1960 original. While the director had made a cult favourite a dozen years before the postnuclear tale GLEN AND RANDA and would go on to make THE BIG EASY and GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! Jim McBride wasn't even a tenth as well known as Godard. But it did have Richard Gere at the peak of his popularity as the male star and he gave perhaps the most entertaining performance of his career to date... ...the story is basically that of the Godard picture but instead of a French guy pursuing an American gal in Paris here we have an American guy pursuing a French gal in California. Jesse Lujack a charming but larcenous hustler steals a car from a casino parking lot in Vegas and hightails it to L.A. to hook up with Monica a French exchange student he'd spent the previous weekend with. But on the way he unintentionally kills a highway patrolman.

Sit back and enjoy the movie will develop in its own good time.The genre should be romance. Nothing else really fits. Screenplay and writing are French which explains this movie. It definitely has a French flavor throughout which is another reason it was probably panned. Richard Gere gives a stunning performance and well worth watching for him alone. Valrie Kaprisky is the excellent costar and makes the movie work. She has the center role of the picture. Together the two make it a memorable movie. I wish she would do more American films. Her talent is to make her character come alive through her presence on the screen not so much the dialogue which is mere accompaniment. Both deserve five starts for their synergy together.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a remake of a French film sure. But watch this film and you will have insight and understanding of the American male pathos and the American male soul. Richard Gere plays Jesse Lujack a petty criminal and wanderer who becomes caught up in a harsh set of circumstances that leave him running from the authorities. Jesse is the type of guy who is always in search of excitement or action because that is who he is he is your typical handsome good natured male transplanted in the American underbelly. And because of this tragedy is never far behind.On the run Jesse meets up with Monica a beautiful French exchange student played by the lovely Valerie Kaprisky whom we might assume has met in some bar or shopping mall. Jesse and Monica are both beautiful people so we understand how they probably met vis a vis  the natural way through physical attraction. There is a problem however. Jesse is from a different world than Monica. She is a college student who appears to come from money and privilege and appears to be more comfortable with stability and therefore is respected in society. While Jesse is well the other kind.This movie is brilliant. One of the gems from the 80's. It has a wonderful pace thanks to director Jim McBride. The music is fantastic various pop songs and surfer jams are placed throughout. The writing by JeanLuc Godard and Francois Truffaut is excellent because it is very accurate to how real people communicate this is true with not only the lead actors but with the small roles as well. Yet when it's all said and done this is Richard Gere's movie. He is an absolute tour de force. He embodies Jesse he knows how he thinks how he acts and how he moves. It is quite the achievement. Arguably the best of Gere's career. There are many sequences that highlight the film. My personal favorite is the scene in the pool between the two leads. Gere and Kaprisky are young in their prime and playing off each other attracted repelled and attracted again. There are reasons for this and I will not elaborate... you have to see it. It's a brilliant scene. Just see this movie. You will not be disappointed. 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "REC is a film that utilises the POV Point of View camera technique for the entirety of its duration. It is a technique in which the person behind the camera is a character that is integral to the plot narrative and story of the film. In brief REC is a horror film that begins with the crew of a TV show called While You Sleep making a documentary about firemen. As the film progresses the crew are lucky enough to accompany the fireman on a call out to a local apartment building.Undoubtedly and unsurprisingly REC will be measured by the film The Blair Witch Project especially given its plot and the manner in which the film plays out. Comparatively REC is also a horror low budget sticks to a female lead and has an ending that is very similar. Although The Blair Witch Project was a ground breaking film given its illustrious marketing campaign and widespread fooling of audiences if the two are to be judged purely on their viewing merits then REC is by far the superior  if anything REC is the film that the Blair Witch should have been. It is the film that I wanted to see when I queued up in the rain 10 years ago full of hype anticipation and adolescent excitement.Despite REC being a better film than The Blair Witch Project some critics have attacked it for employing such a tired technique that has been used too much in recent films i.e. Cloverfield and the forth coming Diary of The Dead. The method that has been employed in REC is I believe a method that is now firmly embedded in the medley of cinematic processes that a filmmaker may chose to exert. It seems strange to me that once a new technique is discovered or employed and put to use regularly people and critics complain  especially when it works. Granted if we are subjected to a recent flurry of films all using similar methods then yes it deserves further scrutiny and what usually surfaces is that greedy studios are exploiting market trends.The film is codirected by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza and they have clearly dipped into the bucket of clichs with REC but in doing so they have created something that is both fresh and reinvigorating. It should be noted that clichs aren't always a bad thing and when put to good use can give the audience exactly what they came to see. It's true that the plot is minimal and there are loose ends but then the vast majority of horror films often suffer from these traits and sometimes purposefully but with REC it doesn't make the film any less enjoyable. It is also evident from the plot and the methods employed that the film is very low budget but this does not do it any harm instead it complements the narrative and increases the films appeal.I believe the true quality of the film lies in its ability to cleverly use the history of the genre and the bare minimal of resources to its maximum potential and unlike Cloverfield there's little room to doubt the reasons for the cameraman to continue filming and this is like Blair Witch due to the fact it's his job. He is there to film a documentary and in true cameraman style his instincts take over. The acting on show here is also a lot better than Cloverfield and the people all look normal some are even unattractive.To put it bluntly REC contains some of the most fear inducing and scariest scenes of recent times. It achieves a level of fear that's rarely experienced in cinema and if watching the film carefully it can be seen how. REC has been made by people that are incredibly familiar with the horror genre and fans will recognise the homage's and the inspirations used from Evil Dead to The Shining to 28 Days later and many more. With such a wealth of horrorviewingexperience combined with inspired filmmaking they are able to draw upon some of the best moments in horror history.Towards the final reels the film plays like an amalgamation of ideas and inspirations. One of which is the influence of contemporary video gaming as some scenes allude to how certain computer games work most notably first person shooters and this is supported by the POV technique as we the viewer live the character of the cameraman much in the same way a gamer lives the character heshe is in control of. This notion is furthered by the different levels in the apartment building the films use of rooms the final scenes and several allegories to various computer games including Resident Evil Alone in the Dark and Silent Hill.For a feature film it is incredibly short at only 75 minutes in fact it is closer to the length of a TV documentary which is perhaps its aim. I cannot recommend this film enough and have even tried to construct my review in a way as to not give too much away as it is a film that needs to seen. Watch it with the lights off with a friend and in a small room. Enjoy.".

This is the kind of movie you wish you hadn't seen because then you'd be able to experience it again for the first time.It doesn't have amazing dialogues it doesn't have a compelling story but still is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in my life. It's a short movie short enough to have you interested all along and everything is well packed the pace being almost perfect. It goes from a quiet even boring documentary from a cheap local TV to an atmosphere full of tension and expectation. Truly a unique experience. It has some flaws but the movie as a whole made me forgive them all.".

First of all let me say this is one hell of a terrifying movie i think i don't have to repeat the synopsis several people already did that before me...the story doesn't seem to be very original we all have seen zombie movies before. But because of the claustrophobic setting this is totally different after all. It's a brilliant move to let it take place in an apartment building with limited space. Also the first person way it's shot which has done before as well adds to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie. That and quite few great scares which you really won't see coming from a mile away like a lot of Hollywood horror movies and the great and shocking ending makes this movies one of the best horror flicks i have ever seen. Literally. And believe me i have seen a lot of them. Hollywood...watch and learn ! You don't need gallons of blood and body parts flying around to make a movie that will scare the living hell out of you !".

I'm not going to spoil the story to you because it's very brief like a prime time news story. I just want to mention the opening segment of the scifi movie District9. The style used in District9's opening segment is inspired from Rec. This horror film has been made within a first person point of view live action perspective and shot by a single handheld camera. The ultimate challenge is that the entire movie goes until everybody dies. There are no bad guys and no good guys. Everybody is a victim. Everybody must die. All along the movie we are controlling Pablo's camera and we are in his point of view. If you ever played FPSfirst person shooter computer games you'd like this even more because this film is entirely in FPS gaming style. We are always in point of view of Pablo's video camera. If the battery dies the camera shuts down then we can't see anything. If the audio receiver is disconnected we can't hear. If the camera lens gets broken we'd take off the lens and start filming via night vision. This is a very strong premise and absolutely this is what made me keep watching till the end. Otherwise zombie movies for me are just unreal and nothing interesting or scary and always guessable too. I'd recommend this film for adolescents who want to have fun on Halloween. As a unique zombie movie it deserves multiple views. Turn on the volume and just join the fun.".

It's hard to comment on this movie without spoiling it but i'll try. It's very difficult after 40 years of terror movies to make something new or special anymore. Balaguer manages to master the false documentary style to create a really scary atmosphere and the movie beats all resistance to destroy the suspension of disbelieve. The jumps in your seat are guaranteed and the adrenaline flow is sure so good a medicine for us lovers of terror cinema. In the process the film has certain social issues a message against racism a portrayal of more than 10 characters and the sweet drops of necessary humor. We saw a interview in the Spanish TV last week and the directors explained that most of the actors didn't know what was gonna happen to them and the camera never stopped recording whatever were their reactions to horrible surprises. Only one actor knows what to do where to go and he is the one leading the action from one place to the other of the house. The effect is a rushed and hysteric spontaneity pure madness... WOW! Try to watch it in a good theatre with a good sound quality and a good screen. I hope our fellow Americans will be able to watch this before watching the Hollywood replica Quarantined. Our small cinema industry deserves it.".

Though the night consists at the beginning of nothing much happening at all things take an unexpected turn when the crew follow a call out to an apartment where they find a crazed old women who attacks and bites a policemen present infecting him and turning him into a crazed zombie. Its not long before there chance of finding outside help is stopped as the authority's isolate all the apartment block inhabitants and essentially quarantine them leading the inhabitants and the TV crew to fight against and avoid the ever increasing zombie infection. REC achieves its scares and intensity through the use of close up point of view camera that has most notably been used in two American films this year CLOVERFIELD and GEORGE ROMERO'S DIARY OF THE DEAD and also the night vision sequence in THE DESCENT where the scare comes from the camera panning to one side and revealing something you don't want to see. This use of p.o.v makes the film more intense and personal and interestingly enough the director who was present at the screening explained in a Q A after the film that he didn't tell or inform the cast of what was going to happen in the scenes thereby increasing the realism of there horrified reactions. It's this brilliant style and memorable shocks that lend REC as one of the most clever and inventive horror films of recent memory. Go see it at the cinema as this is the only way that will make you appreciate the intensity of the film though be prepared to be exhausted of ever a film had the mantle of shakiest camera in the world this is it and also see it before the Hollywood remake QUARANTINE is released later this year.".

I've screened this film for my Halloween Horror Marathon every year and it scares absolutely everyone. The newbies are always crawling out of their skins.Why? Because Rec can't happen but if it could happen this is how it would happen.Spoiler kind of. You have probably already guessed what happens but just in caseI live in the containment area for the CDC in Atlanta. In the event of a pathogen outbreak the CDC can declare a kind of martial law and a scenario very similar to this is precisely what will result. Rec gets containment policy very right and said policy is very scary.Safe to read the rest of thisSometimes a simple plot is the best. Different things are scary to different people but Rec is scary to pretty much everybody. Like everyone else says avoid Quarantine. It's a shotfor shot remake that still manages to be not as good as the Spanish original.".

I've screened this film for my Halloween Horror Marathon every year and it scares absolutely everyone. The newbies are always crawling out of their skins.Why? Because Rec can't happen but if it could happen this is how it would happen.Spoiler kind of. You have probably already guessed what happens but just in caseI live in the containment area for the CDC in Atlanta. In the event of a pathogen outbreak the CDC can declare a kind of martial law and a scenario very similar to this is precisely what will result. Rec gets containment policy very right and said policy is very scary.Safe to read the rest of thisSometimes a simple plot is the best. Different things are scary to different people but Rec is scary to pretty much everybody. Like everyone else says avoid Quarantine. It's a shotfor shot remake that still manages to be not as good as the Spanish original.";

So I went onto youtube and found Rec just to see what it was like and the strange thing is I saw Quarantine in the movie theater I wasn't scared I watched Rec on my computer and it scared me to death. I think the story was a little better explained in this version as well as it was just more intense. I feel weird saying that because Quarantine is the exact same movie just it's done in English but for some weird reason this movie just scared me even more. I think I also liked the actors a little better in this movie because they seemed stronger and reacted more naturally. Rec is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time and I really wish I checked it out earlier than I did.Angela is a TV reporter who does a quick little night segment on firefighters and what their jobs are like. Everything starts pretty boring and it seems like they're not going to get a great story... until there is a disturbance call. They all go to this apartment building where everyone is downstairs complaining about noises coming from this apartment with an older woman the fireman and police go up there to find the woman very disturbed and mumbling. All of a sudden the woman tries to attack them the police and firemen along with Angela go downstairs to find out that they've been locked in the police outside have quarantined the building. The woman viciously bites one of the firemen who turns into a rabid zombie who starts attacking the others. The virus is spreading and there's only so much time before they all descend into this scary nightmare.I would highly recommend Rec for any movie fan this was just a fun movie to watch and one of the better horror films I've seen. Quarantine was just the American version with a few deleted scenes that are not in Rec but I felt that Rec explained itself better. Why and how the virus came to be as well as where the mysterious tenant is and what he did. Like I said I do feel silly they're both pretty much the exact same movie just in different languages but I just enjoyed this movie was just better. So if you do get the opportunity I do highly recommend going on the net and looking up this movie it'll give you the heebee geebee's... OK that was lame.910".

	schema:reviewBody "It's such a shame to me that this movie will go widely unnoticed by American audiences who will only be aware of the upcoming remake. In my opinion and I know that it happens to be an opinion shared by many others on this site there is no need to remake this film. A strong marketing campaign for this original work would be a more fitting route albeit less successful financially. And that is the problem Money. It's sad to me that the art of film is often sacrificed for financial gain but hey it's a business.So on to the movie itself. Wow. Honestly and this isn't me just trying to beat my chest in a declaration of machismo I don't get scared by movies much. It only happens every couple of years. I still watch horror movies all the time. In fact probably 75 of the movies I watch are horrorthrillersuspensegore or whatever you wish to call them. Needless to say I've seen just about every scary movie out there. I guess the reason I watch so many is the desire to be scared. I'm chasing the dragon if you will. I love being scared by a movie. I don't know if I've become desensitized or films today just aren't as scary. Maybe it's a combination of the two.At any rate it's not often that a movie comes along that truly scares me. This one did. And it did it well. And often. It was true whiteknuckled heartpounding Holy Crap! scary. I know a movie is really frightening when my girlfriend becomes completely silent while watching. Where normally every ten minutes there's a Why'd he do that? or a I bet she's lying! or even I think that zombie looks really fake. with this movie there was just silence. Paralyzed silence. Because I watch so many horror movies by default she does as well.We've seen it all and while this one treads familiar waters i.e. contagious virus zombies characters stuck in one location documentary style filming etc. it does it in a way that feels fresh. What it does extremely well and better than Blair Witch or Cloverfield in my opinion is using the one handheld camera in a way that feels like a director is putting a lot of time and thought into the shots without taking away from the intimacy or realism.The plot is original where it needs to be and the ending is anything but a let down. In fact this is one of those movies that when it ends and after you wipe the poop out of your pants you have to talk about it. Theories are discussed opinions are formed new things are learned it's a definite watercooler film.I felt like giving it a 10 but I always reserve that for movies that have been out for a significant amount of time. But I have a feeling that this little gem might earn that right in the future.So check this movie out before Quarantine comes out and you will not be disappointed. Without a doubt it's the best horrorsuspense movie of the last few years along with  l'intrieur El Orphanato and The Mist.".

I'm no Jennifer Aniston fan but I have to admit she's a talented actress and not just a celebrity when I see her in a role like this. Judy Greer and Dan Fogler are great in supporting roles.It's difficult to say much about the plot without giving most of it away. The script is full of the physcobabble you would expect in a movie about a self help guru sometimes it comes across as intentionally silly and sometimes it seems to have real meaning. There are small revelations made all the way through the movie that lead up to the final conclusion.There is also unexpected eye candy in the form of beautiful floral arrangements that contrast well with the gloomy Seattle weather.I was afraid my 56yearold husband would complain about driving 45 minutes to see a movie like this on a week night. But he also enjoyed it and there were no complaints. Most of the people in the theater also seemed to enjoy it although I have to admit that they didn't laugh as much as we did. Not a must see but if you're looking for some good entertainment you could do far worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "The premise of this movie held a lot of potential but unfortunately Love Happens doesn't deliver as... not much happens in this movie. Aaron Eckhart who seems to struggle not to be typecasted as your average guy in light romantic stuff plays... Burke an ordinary dude trying to overcome his wife's passing by becoming a modernday guru for people who have lost loved ones. Jennifer Aniston who basically embraces her career of being typecast as a romantic interest in romantic flick plays herself once again. This time she goes by the nickname Eloise but she'll still be that same single woman who's had a string of bad relationships and is till looking for the one.Directorwriter Brandon Camp doesn't give the character of Eloise much substance and seems content just to let Aniston do her usual work. He seems to have focus mainly in the script and on screen on Burke. In the first few minutes it seems to work Burke is an interesting character. The selfhelp speeches are wellwritten the pressure on Burke's shoulders is felt. Unfortunately much of the movie revolves around the relationship that develops when Burke and Eloise bump into each others and begin to know each others. Their interest for each others is uninteresting and lacks credibility in part because Eloise is so poorly sketched and also because as we learn to know Burke's real issues it just seems... wrong. And as the film goes on it just gets worse as it seems Brandon Camp doesn't understand the topic of mourning very well and also seems to send the message that using people as emotional crutches getting involved in relationships when you are not fully ready are good things. Many scenes are almost surreal. Releasing domestic pets into the wild breaking and entering at your former inlaws lying magically curing your sense of loss by shopping at Home Depot... I like quirky stuff but the mix of comedy romance and the intense drama underneath wasn't done very well. To top it off the whole movie is wrapped in a sort of romantic relationship that never happens and played out with two actors who have little to no chemistry together.Aaron Eckhart is a gifted actor that should have no problem finding roles but as far as a lead he's been slightly unlucky and needs to select projects a bit more carefully or risk being typecasted in that type of flicks much like his colead. For Aniston this is the latest in a string of duds. As for Brandon Camp this isn't his first project tackling grief as he wrote the poor Dragonfly 2002 and I shudder when I look at his next project Steinbeck's Point of View which also seems to deal with issues of life and death. I have nothing against writers who focus on certain issues as long as they master those issues well which isn't the case for Camp.".

I think what I liked the most about it was it was not your typical romance movie. I had heard before seeing it that it was predictable and just like every other chick flick but the truth is... it's really not. This movie had a lot of depth a lot of touching moments and yes obviously romance. That being said this movie was more about finding the good in life and forgetting all of the hurt and heart aches then it was about romance although that aspect of it is in there too. Aaron Eckhart is impossible not to like and quite the eye candy. This movie also had some great songs in it! Overall definitely not too bad!".

I had heard before seeing it that it was predictable and just like every other chick flick but the truth is... it's really not. This movie had a lot of depth a lot of touching moments and yes obviously romance. That being said this movie was more about finding the good in life and forgetting all of the hurt and heart aches then it was about romance although that aspect of it is in there too. Aaron Eckhart is impossible not to like and quite the eye candy. This movie also had some great songs in it! Overall definitely not too bad!";

Love Happens script feels like a rough draft a Hollywood wannabe would hand in at a weekend workshop. Love Happens is completely incoherent. It never gels even into simply a coherent bad movie.

John Carroll Lynch is both poignant and frightening as a bereaved father who can't get over his son's death. We get to ogle Aaron Eckhart's abs as he broods beside a beautifully lit pool. Jennifer Aniston plays a florist she reads a series of poignant cards that accompanied bouquets. One character owns a pet sulfurcrested cockatoo and the bird is very pretty.

	schema:headline " Delivers the corniness and calculated sentiment that Hollywood has been cranking out for decades...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's no secret that trailers lie they piece together the best parts of a film to make it seem so much better than it actually is but sadly the trailer for Love Happens which roused more laughter than sympathy in this critic did not lie. The film is every bit as cornball and schmaltzy as its promotional material implied if of course you distended it out to 109 minutes of intermittent torture.Burke Ryan Aaron Eckhart is a selfhelp author and therapist who has become a posterboy for helping others cope with their loss. However he has yet to fully confront his own loss the death of his wife in a car accident three years ago and so finds it difficult to approach Eloise Jennifer Aniston a florist he meets outside a seminar and takes quite a shine to. If they are going to be together he is going to have to confront the memory of his wife and accept rather than ignore that she is gone.While the concept has promise it's the fault of director and cowriter Brandon Camp that this is a strictly routine melodramedy it's infused with the manufactured whimsy of so many crudelyassembled Hollywood romcoms and from the moment early on that Eckhart strolls along a hallway to the inordinatelysentimentalpopsongoftheweek to meet his overweight manager Lane Dan Fogler who doubles as a comedy sidekick it's clear that we're in for a bumpy ride.If there's anything that makes Love Happens watchable it's the performances chiefly that of Aaron Eckhart who now has a stunning string of turns under his belt from his breakout as the horrifying misogynist in In The Company of Men to his excellent interpretation of Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight. Few are going to remember Eckhart for this film especially but he tries his damndest with the material and as a motivational speaker dealing with his own demons he's basically an antidote to the similar Nick Naylor character he played in the brilliant Thank You for Smoking.Burke's character arc isn't entirely disinteresting but the problem is that it becomes smothered in the riptide of Hallmarkstyle truisms and sentimental monologues that not only make this film seem saccharine but even cause it to appear a touch disingenuous. Notably as his father in law Martin Sheen shows up he spouts a rhetoric about himself that's stagey beyond words and serves little purpose beyond blindingly obvious exposition for the audience. Nobody would ever speak that way in real life and it's just a lazy way for the writers to avoid having to write an authentic and genuine conversation between the two. More criminally such poor writing just squanders the talents of its rather distinguished cast.Despite his inability to assemble a tight script he has managed to assemble quite the roster and particular attention should be paid to lesserknown character actor John Carroll Lynch who plays Walter a reluctant participant in Burke's seminars who is struggling to deal with the accidental death of his young son. His few scenes in the film are bright sparks in this mottled picture and reinforce his status as one of the best working character actors today after brilliant bitparts in Zodiac and Gran Torino. Also making a welcome appearance is Six Feet Under's Frances Conroy who plays Eloise's mother and lights up the room for her mere two minutes of screen time.Arguably the film's biggest foible is that it never really manages to establish palpable chemistry between its two sizzling leads and aside from one fun scene where Burke chews Eloise out for pretending to be deaf to avoid talking to him Camp tries to get by on corny verbiage and lingering shots of the beautiful leads looking forlorn. There are a few clever ideas throughout such as Burke meeting with a crude marketing team who declare that a weight loss product in his name would promote loss you can feel good about and the general depiction of him as a man wrestling with his own duality as grieving husband and charismatic entertainer but these inspired moments are just not enough to mask the film's myriad faults.Padded isn't even the word for Love Happens with one scene involving Burke and Eloise hanging around a park with a bunch of her hipster friends as they gawk at memorial statues of Bruce and Brandon Lee a lengthy caper where Burke tries to rescue his wife's pet parrot and set it free and even a scene where Burke goes for a swim and has a metaphorical rebirth there are clichs to spare and then some.In promoting the idea of turning grief into something positive I cannot fault the film's ending but I can fault it for its predictability replete with all of the tearful confessions hugs and reconciliations that you would expect. The film straggles along to its telegraphed conclusion about twenty minutes too late by which time the novelty of the good performances have somewhat worn off revealing the cloying layers beneath. Even with hugely likable performers at the helm there's little to salvage from this dead vessel of a dramedy it has little hints of promise sprinkled throughout but mostly delivers the corniness and calculated sentiment that Hollywood has been cranking out for decades.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's no secret that trailers lie they piece together the best parts of a film to make it seem so much better than it actually is but sadly the trailer for Love Happens which roused more laughter than sympathy in this critic did not lie. The film is every bit as cornball and schmaltzy as its promotional material implied if of course you distended it out to 109 minutes of intermittent torture.Burke Ryan Aaron Eckhart is a selfhelp author and therapist who has become a posterboy for helping others cope with their loss. However he has yet to fully confront his own loss the death of his wife in a car accident three years ago and so finds it difficult to approach Eloise Jennifer Aniston a florist he meets outside a seminar and takes quite a shine to. If they are going to be together he is going to have to confront the memory of his wife and accept rather than ignore that she is gone.While the concept has promise it's the fault of director and cowriter Brandon Camp that this is a strictly routine melodramedy it's infused with the manufactured whimsy of so many crudelyassembled Hollywood romcoms and from the moment early on that Eckhart strolls along a hallway to the inordinatelysentimentalpopsongoftheweek to meet his overweight manager Lane Dan Fogler who doubles as a comedy sidekick it's clear that we're in for a bumpy ride.If there's anything that makes Love Happens watchable it's the performances chiefly that of Aaron Eckhart who now has a stunning string of turns under his belt from his breakout as the horrifying misogynist in In The Company of Men to his excellent interpretation of Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight. Few are going to remember Eckhart for this film especially but he tries his damndest with the material and as a motivational speaker dealing with his own demons he's basically an antidote to the similar Nick Naylor character he played in the brilliant Thank You for Smoking.Burke's character arc isn't entirely disinteresting but the problem is that it becomes smothered in the riptide of Hallmarkstyle truisms and sentimental monologues that not only make this film seem saccharine but even cause it to appear a touch disingenuous. Notably as his father in law Martin Sheen shows up he spouts a rhetoric about himself that's stagey beyond words and serves little purpose beyond blindingly obvious exposition for the audience. Nobody would ever speak that way in real life and it's just a lazy way for the writers to avoid having to write an authentic and genuine conversation between the two. More criminally such poor writing just squanders the talents of its rather distinguished cast.Despite his inability to assemble a tight script he has managed to assemble quite the roster and particular attention should be paid to lesserknown character actor John Carroll Lynch who plays Walter a reluctant participant in Burke's seminars who is struggling to deal with the accidental death of his young son.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I have no idea how this got a feature release from a major studio but apparently they believe everyone out there is dumb and will go see any movie marketed with Jennifer Aniston.Second of all I just really want to talk about the beginning and ending because the rest of it isn't even worth writing about.It starts with Eckhart's character tossing back Grey Goose like he's a closet alcoholic which is what you'd expect to happen...but doesn't. And that's too bad actually because it would have been better than what we got. In fact they never explain why they clearly started on that path but my hunch is they weren't sure what to do to tie up the corny ending. So if he is responsible for this wife's death and it is related to drunk driving how can he admit such a thing to his beloved audience of psychobabble feelgood clones and risk losing his company and good name and gain their sympathy? He can't. But you can bet that was the plan originally.Instead they wrap it with he was arguing with his wife over paint swatches no less and it was HE who was driving ooohh shocker! so of course as it turns out it was he who accidentally swerved and killed his wife. So that was the surprise twist in that it was not her driving and nearly hitting a dog in the middle of the road after all which was his story all throughout the movie. Huh who'd a thunk it? I like both of the main actors respectively but this was just tepid and contrived. Jennifer is a B actress at best and although always likable I think anyway she falls really flat here. Aaron's an Alister again my opinionor will be and he should try to focus on better quality films. I'd expect this type of film from her but not him.Blah...........! Ps for people concerned about the bird really it's a movie and I am sure the bird is just fine. Unfortunately yes there are people out there who are just dumb enough to release a tropical bird in the Seattle area or comparable whether they see this movie or not. My hunch is not that many people will ever see this movie so I doubt the city of Seattle will need to worry about a misplaced tropical bird epidemic any time soon.".

I won't mention Martin Sheen who like other senior actors nowadays yes I mean Michael Douglas don't care what they appear in as long as they get to act.We all know the old pattern of Hollywood scripts but do they really need to throw it in our faces like some driedout badtailored rag? I cannot empathize with acting like an oriental fakir when dealing with the loss of a dear one or with other likewise cheap absurd and lame resolutions. Freeing an exotic bird into the woods...really? Is this movie intended to be screened at Retarded Camp?At least I learned some new words which I'll never use.";

Aniston's and Eckhart's romance is not even established as love per se as it doesn't yet reach that point in the movie and beyond that their interaction is really secondary to the whole scheme of the movie! The movie is more about people getting over bereavement than anything else.The one plus I'll give is that there is some character depth with the Eckhart character ie he's not just superman his weak side is revealed which is somewhat refreshing. But this alone is not enough to save this movie.The word dud was made for movies like this. There's no better word to describe how you will feel during and after watching it.

	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that 'popular romance comedies' have the courage to tackle issues like death and grieving and make the story work but such is the case with LOVE HAPPENS a good little film written with Mike Thompson and directed by Brandon Camp. And it helps to have a solid cast of popular and wellschooled actors to pull off a subject that might make a few people uneasy. Dr. Burke Aaron Eckhart is a seminar man who runs a business with his colleague Lane Dan Fogler based on helping people cope with grief  a group called 'AOkay'. Burke is a popular guru more so because of his reason for ministering to grievers his beloved wife died three years ago in a car accident so Burke can speak about grief from experience. But it seems he is running away from something too. Most of his followers don't notice but one man Walter John Carroll Lynch is a particularly needy client and seems to pick up on something missing in Burke's seminars. Burke is currently in Seattle his deceased wife's home with his manager Lane who is cooking up all manner of marketing tools and opportunities for the AOkay team. Burke happens to literally bump into Eloise Jennifer Aniston who owns a flower business catering to the hotel in which the seminar is being staged. Eloise seems addicted to losers and is freshly apart from her latest affair she is comforted and supported by her sole employee the somewhat dingy Marty Judy Greer in a terrific cameo who encourages Eloise to look for some stability in her next mate. Burke is attracted to Eloise but is so out of practice in the dating game that he comes across as vulnerable  a trait that makes Eloise wary at first and attracted later. The odd things the two do in the mating dance finally result in the uncovering of the secret problems Burke carries. Refreshingly enough the film does not sell out with a happywappy ending just a few thoughts that are particularly tender. Eckhart and Aniston are a terrific team on the screen both are lovable without resorting to being sappy and repetitive. Fogler and Greer are excellent as are such fine actors as Martin Sheen and Frances Conroy in memorable cameos. There is a lot to like in this film that makes it a step above the usual 'chick flicks' that were more popular in theaters. Perhaps audiences sadly have difficulty hearing about grieving but death as well as Love happens! Grady Harp".

Both of them did not share any common traits or life except the bad guys killed and almost killed their fathers.

	schema:reviewBody "It may be a premature statement writing this in February of 2006 but Bandidas is one of the most entertaining films of the year. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek are wonderful together as the sexy bankrobbers hellbent on revenge and justice.I suppose you could call this film a guilty pleasure. There is nothing substantial here... It is merely a lightweight action adventure with barrels of laughs and two primoexamples of eye candy. But of the 200 entertainmentonly movies in 2006 it is virtually assured that this film will be one of the better examples.I was reminded a great deal of the cheerful tone and style that was evident in the Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster comedy Maverick. Add a sprinkle of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and you are rewarded with this Luc Besson penned screenplay.After a short opening displaying the investigative skills of Steve Zahn's character the film introduces us to Penelope Cruz's Maria playing Tic Tac Toe with her horse in the dirt. It is one of many scenes in Bandidas that hearkens the silliness of Laurel  Hardy. Maria is a smalltown Mexican farm girl who confesses that all she really knows about is horses and chickens. She is a dreamer and an idealist.Her counterpoint is Salma Hayek's Sara... An educated heiress who has just returned from University in Europe. She is a thinker and a realist.When Dwight Yoakam's evil land robber swoops in to take the money and land away from the locals killing Sara's father and severely injuring Maria's the girls team up to avenge their people and get the land back. By robbing the banks owned by the railroading thieves' American investors the girls cause slapstick havoc across the Mexican landscape.After getting some 'training' from Sam Shepard's character which includes a gratuitous pushups scene in the local stream the girls feel ready to try some elaborate heists.None of this is remotely realistic. At no point will you ever really be able to suspend your disbelief. This film plays more like a Laurel  Hardy film than anything else. We are only supposed to enjoy the interaction and comedic timing of these gorgeous babes best friends in real life  and it shows as they pretend to fire guns splash through any onhand body of water blow stuff up and seduce Steve Zahn on numerous occasions. In fact considering one specific scene I wouldn't be at all surprised if Steve Zahn did this film pro bono.There are some truly inventive and hilarious moments in this film. Consider the train shootout... a slowmotion sequence that was brilliantly shot with a special effects technique that I hadn't seen before. Also consider the wit of the 'banjotuning' scene. It was perfectly timed.This film has tons of memorable moments the church catfight the horse climbing a ladder the brothel kisses. It is packed with entertainment value and deserves a bigger audience than it will ultimately get. Penelope and Salma have great chemistry exuding illegal amounts of sexappeal and equal doses of hilarity. Bandidas is silly fluff that typically gets panned by critics like me... but I went with this one because it doesn't take itself at all seriously and because I never once thought to look at my watch. This is a breezy 93minutes that will leave your face aching from smiling so much.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com".

	schema:headline " BANDIDAS Unexpectedly Good! Irresistibly Charming!";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in Mexico in the 1800s a violently strong banking corporation is moving in on Mexican lands trying to muscle out the Mexicans off their own land. A spoiled brat lady and a farmer's daughter find themselves victims of such oppression and together have bonded to unite in a cause against the banking corporation. Eventually the two became bank robbers bandidas who rob the oppressors to avenge and restore the rightful property of their people.This movie is based upon the idea of its producer the highly respected film directorproducer Luc Besson who was responsible for films like Leon The Professional and The Fifth Element. Bandidas is directed by Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg.Being a big fan of Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti westerns like the Clint Eastwood classics A Fistful of Dollars The Good The Bad  the Ugly and the Charles Bronson revenge epic Once Upon A Time in the West I appreciated the manner in which the director employed subtle Sergio Leone shots and sequences not to mention a little of Ennio Morricone's music to spice up the little moments of Sergio Leone homage. But of course the film has the fast pace of a typical enjoyable actionadventure. There is one action sequence wherein the technique of bullettime as pioneered by the Matrix movies was smartly used in a well done impressive sequence.In terms of brands and generalizations the closest in comparison to this movie being a popcorn action chick flick is Charlie's Angels. But while the Charlie's Angels and its sequel may have been crammed with absolute unoriginality and badlyrecycled tricks Bandidas on the other hand is quite healthy with its own potentials. First of all these 2 main characters are very attractive not only in terms of beauty and sufficient cleavage exposure but also in terms of their on screen chemistry their chuckleworthy bickerings and arguments not to mention their vibrant aura on screen.Penelope Cruz for instance who plays a somewhat simpleminded farmgirl acts convincingly dumbed down to have the appeal which reminds you of Joey and Phoebe from the Friends TV series. Salma Hayek as the sophisticated and educated brat shows a radiant and spunky side of her on this role. i cant believe how delightfully ageless Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz are on this movie. While their nagging arguments may sounds a bit annoying in the trailers I eventually grew to realize that when you watched the movie in its entirety their noisy arguments are indeed hilarious and oftentimes cute. Although it's such a forgettable role country singer Dwight Yoakam pulled off a satisfactory performance as the main villain of this movie. Sam Sheppard also appears as the Bandidas' mentor. And the film also stars Steve Zahn who plays a quirky young scientist who obviously is trying to pioneer the science of crime forensics.There is a thoughtprovoking proMexican AntiAmerican colonialism plot in this movie which I suspect may be the reason why this film isn't out on US theaters yet it isn't even listed to be set for release in US theaters anytime soon. Which is a shame since this film really deserves a spotlight attention. Sure it's a mere popcorn flick but it's good as one.Do not be fooled by the film's lack of or unappealing sense of marketing this film really is big and deserves a summer blockbuster treatment. It's unexpectedly good! It's irresistibly charming! BANDIDAS is the summer big actionadventure that not many have known of yet.".

You have to go into a movie like this with a certain level of suspension of disbelief.

The storyline is not that interesting and gives you the idea that it has just been written to create the setting and atmosphere. The acting is also no Oscar material but is very adequate.

Of course as a healthy guy I have to say that Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz as main attractions do raise my interest. Furthermore Steve Zahn has always had my sympathy as he always seems to be able to be much more than likable in the parts he plays.

	schema:headline " Fun rollicking western with a twist.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bandidas is a highly entertaining fun ride. It takes place in Mexico during the Mexican revolution in the 1800s. Two dropdead gorgeous young women played by Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek decide to teamup and rob banks. This is quite a twist from the usual macho western movie formula. The women commit robberies out of vengeance in order to save land stolen from the Mexican people by a villainous land baron.The violence in the film is ubiquitous as it is in most westerns. However the violent tone of the movie is leavened with a jaunty slapstick humor. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek play the bank robbing duo more like a squabbling Laverne and Shirley rather than Butch and Sundance. They have hilarious catfights with each other as they try to learn to work together as a team.There's lots of incredible stunts throughout the film. Some are even performed by the horses ridden by the characters. This is one of the few westerns I've seen in which the steeds are as important to the plot as the humans are. This factor highlights the overall lightedhearted ambiance running throughout the course of the film.The serious business of justice and revenge is pursued with gusto by the beautiful bankrobbing twosome. But along the way the viewer is treated to lots of bellylaughs. Watching this film is a great way to get your funnybone tickled while rooting for the good guys in this case gals to triumph over evil.".

The women commit robberies out of vengeance in order to save land stolen from the Mexican people by a villainous land baron.The violence in the film is ubiquitous as it is in most westerns. However the violent tone of the movie is leavened with a jaunty slapstick humor. Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek play the bank robbing duo more like a squabbling Laverne and Shirley rather than Butch and Sundance. They have hilarious catfights with each other as they try to learn to work together as a team.There's lots of incredible stunts throughout the film. Some are even performed by the horses ridden by the characters. This is one of the few westerns I've seen in which the steeds are as important to the plot as the humans are. This factor highlights the overall lightedhearted ambiance running throughout the course of the film.The serious business of justice and revenge is pursued with gusto by the beautiful bankrobbing twosome. But along the way the viewer is treated to lots of bellylaughs. Watching this film is a great way to get your funnybone tickled while rooting for the good guys in this case gals to triumph over evil.";

Directed by the team of Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg it's a gorgeous widescreen combination of Western comedy and action film. It might be too silly for the tastes of some people but others are sure to find it likable funny and charming. Certainly it succeeds as a showcase for the appealing leading actresses who are at their sexiest and liveliest. Their banter flies back and forth and they even fight over the nerdy Quentin who becomes a believer in their cause.Zahn offers a good counterpoint as the straight man to their antics and it's an amusing bit of irony that HE'S the one who gets naked in this story. Delivering solid supporting performances are Denis Arndt Audra Blaser Ismael 'East' Carlo Gary Carlos Cervantes Jose Maria Negri and Humberto Elizondo. Sam Shepard gets a particularly delicious role as the retired bank robber who teaches Sara and Maria the finer points of that line of work.It may not be all that memorable but Bandidas IS a pleasant diversion for a little over an hour and a half.Seven out of 10.".

Both actresses do a fine job providing us loads of laughter. Their offscreen friendship reflects their moments on screen and both actresses must have had a blast during the making of 'Bandidas'. 'Bandidas' itself is a typical actionadventurewestern comedy flick with some wonderful cinematography that guides us through beautiful landscapes with two beautiful women. The background score nicely contributes. Sheperd and Zahn provide further comic support. Yoakam is the weak link as he's just not convincing and pretty wooden. Some of the funniest scenes include the catfight the training scenes the ways Maria and Sara dis each other. Some dialogues are just laugh out loud. the screenplay could have included some more interesting moments as it does tend to drag at some point. As a guy I really enjoyed 'Bandidas' but I don't see why women shouldn't enjoy it ".

	schema:reviewBody "The moment I saw the box of this movie I knew I was going to be watching this movie.Just the fact that the movie had both Salma and Penelope was enough but what really got me excited was when I remembered this movie is Written and Produced by one of favourite film personalities Luc Besson.You can never be sure of what to expect from Luc Besson but one thing you can be sure of YOU ARE GOING TO ENJOY THE MOVIE.This as I correctly predicted was one of Luc's fun movies. So all you have to do is not take this movie seriously pop it in the player sit back and have a rocking time.THE FOLLOWING PARTS ARE UNNECASSARY IF LUC SALMA AND PENELOPE AND MAYBE EVEN STEVE ZAHN IN THE SAME MOVIE ARE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE.If they are then stop reading give me a rating and go get this movie haha.This movie is Luc's version of Zorro with one apparent difference we have to absolutely stunning women as the heroes here. What eyecandy both the actresses look their ravishing best. However Penelope managed to look better than Salma. Their is no scenes that involves even exposure but both the actresses frequently display their ample bosom. hehe.The acting is as expected top notch as the entire cast consists of established actors. Special mention to Dwight Yoakam who plays the criminal big American banker in Mexico to the hilt. The modern implications of Big America presiding over the world are not lost. Their is hilarious joke on that too.The chemistry between the 2 actresses and and Steve Zahnis like fuel and fire. They shine on the screen and make the Short movie 93 min a super fun rollercoaster ride.They movie is filled with one great scene after the other a few that immediately come to the mind are the church scene the first bank robbery and .......MY FAVOURITE SCENE The scene where Penelope and Salma dressed as showgirls capture Steve Zahn and carry out their experiments on him. THE BOY IN ME HAD A HEART ATTACK AND MY HEART RATE WENT THROUGH THE ROOF. HELL JUST THAT SCENE MAKES THIS MOVIE PERFECT FOR GUYS. The ensuing fight and jealousy over the nerdy Steve will give hopes to 1000s of nerdy guys like me.The movie has Luc's signature use of classical music in a tense and exciting scene and the background score is not legendary but great nevertheless.The cinematography is as good as can get for such a movie the rustic beauty of Mexico and its small towns is effectively captured.The action sequences are good but run of the mill and have an element of humour in it. Fans of Luc will know what I'm talking about its the kind of action one saw in the Fifth Element.As usual as only some writers do this movie takes a jab at religion Americans westerns etc. Hell even the way death and murder is treated in this movie has humour to it. The over my dead body  scene is another memorable scene that comes to mind.I saw this movie with 2 girls and even they loved this movie so I can safely say that this movie is recommended for all audiences above the age of 13. If your a bunch of friends including girls then this movie is perfect for get together at home.A fun movie that cannot be taken seriously and even though it is cinematically as good as the best you can see that even the cast and crew had fun making it.Do not miss this movie.!!!! 's Faboulous cast and acting Luc Besson host of memorable scenes and one liners cinematically up there 's maybe it was the budget or intentional but action scenes were soso no big action scenes.total 810 absolute if you consider the fact that it meets expectations and in the category of fun films then its a 9 ".

The only light spark in the comedic section is pretty clear reference to old European comic book hero Lucky Luke in a form of a horse that rivals Lukes horse Jolly Jumper in wit.The plot of the film doesn't give out much of surprises actually any is the right word as the whole thing moves forward with steadily predictable space. It has evil bankers righteous police heroic underdogs and even a bit of love and through out its whole length pretty much everything happens in a comfortable or annoying depending on how you see it fashion.The best action scene of the film is spared to the end in where we are treated with nicely filmed slow motion gun fight in a tight train cart but other than that the main attraction of the tale are the two stunning beauties.

	schema:reviewBody "The pairing of Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz in action roles and a Western setting sounds like an idea that can't miss  and it doesn't. The two women make a dynamite team and are just plain enjoyable to watch together. Personally I'm not the biggest Cruz fan but she impressed me in this film particularly with her gun tricks. The leads get able support from a clever but physically clumsy Steve Zahn a creepy Dwight Yoakam and a gruff Sam Shepard. Even the horses are amazingly welltrained and add to the action and comedy. The directors maintain a lively pace with the exception of the kissing lesson scene which develops into a running gag that falls flat. The film's attempts at substance Viva la revolucion! also come off as forced but as a piece of lightweight fun Bandidas does the job. Highlight the wonderful fight between Cruz and Hayek this scene is a dream come true. 12".

Now YOUNG GUNS has people being blown away and those moments are taken seriously. There's comedy and there's reality. Here it's all fluff and silly comedy.Two stars thrown together in a terribly made movie with a useless done to death plot. Having the two speak English all the time when they are supposed to be Mexican makes no sense particularly when their strong Spanish accents are really stressing their lines. I'd rather read the subtitles and hear them speaking Spanish with them speaking English ONLY when interacting with Americans. In Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid when they go to Bolivia they had to learn Spanish words in order to rob a bank. Here in this unrealistic fantasy movie every Mexican in Mexico speaks English. Even farmers. Yeah right. The PG rating says it all. A movie for morons or to get younger people into the cinemas that don't like to read subtitles. Finally the action scenes are way too generic. This doesn't feel like it was written by Luc Besson at all. The same man who gave us the TRANSPORTER UNLEASHED and LEON THE PROFESSIONAL could not have written this crap. Someone must have altered his script.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching 'Irreversible' makes you question why you watch movies. If you just want movies to be entertainment and nothing more then obviously this is not something you will EVER want to see in your life. But if you think that film like literature is capable of many things including looking at horrible and disturbing subject matter that you would prefer not to deal with then 'Irreversible' is highly recommended. But beware I feel I have the ability to stand all kinds of extreme material but even I found it extremely difficult to watch. Writerdirector Gaspar Noe previously made the brilliant and confrontational 'I Stand Alone' a movie that unfortunately never reached a wide audience. He manages to top himself with this one. Both movies make a mockery of supposedly difficult Hollywood fare like 'American Psycho' 'Fight Club' 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'Requiem For A Dream' which are pure Disney compared to Noe's work! 'Irreversible' has a similar structure popularized but not originated in Christopher Nolan's 'Memento'. The plot is told in reverse chronological order. This means that the early parts of the movie show the most distressing and difficult material and as the movie continues it gets progressively lighter and therefore ends ironically on a happy ending. The opening sequences after the first more subdued scene which incidentally features a cameo from 'I Stand Alone' star Philippe Nahon as quite possibly the same character are the most difficult to watch not just because of WHAT happens one of the most extreme and realistic acts of violence I've ever seen in a movie but the way it is shown with trippy disorienting handheld camera work. Later in the movie we see why this event happened by witnessing a grueling rape sequence which is almost impossible to watch. It is these two scenes which made this movie so notorious but neither are gratuitous in my opinion they are just REAL. This is reality. Things like this happen every day. Watching it is horrible yes but even more horrible is the idea that real people must experience these events in the real world. This is what makes this such a disturbing and powerful movie if you have the stomach for it. On a technical level it is brilliant and the acting by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel then still a couple off screen gossip says this is no longer true and Albert Dupontel is first rate. 'Irreversible' is obviously not a movie for everyone but if you think you are up to it it comes with my highest possible recommendation as does 'I Stand Alone' 'Seul contre tous'. These are two astonishing movies which look at the unlookable and are literally unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "After notorious walkouts at Cannes and the controversy around the difficult long unrelenting rape scene this was high on my mustsee list of the last year. Not for voyeuristic reasons but because like A Clockwork Orange before it the most controversial films are often those with the most to say.This is not a date movie. Nor is it a pleasant enjoyable experience. It is however pure cinema from a director working at the highest technical level with the camera with lighting with makeup with scripting and with performance. Irreversible is that rare beast a selfcontained experience which goes beyond the cinematic and aesthetic to show something real both touching and frightening beautiful and horrific simple and innovative. The first twenty minutes are among the toughest you will encounter on the screen. The sound whines and hums the camera spins in all directions disorientating and showing glimpses of the scene. Dialogue is sparse the same lines being repeated over and over again. The subject matter is unpleasant taking place in a seedy gay club the protagonists Dupontel and Cassel searching for someone called the Tenia named after a tapeworm. And when they find him there is a sequence which lasts maybe two minutes which is incredibly difficult to watch yet difficult not to watch. Almost in disbelief you cannot believe what you are watching is happening yet marvel at how real it is both technically and in terms of human character.Beyond that the film does not let up for about another half an hour as the backwardsplayed story begins to piece itself together leading to an act of provocation unrivalled in cinema history. My second viewing of the film was with a 21yearold female who found it the hardest scene she had ever watched. It is the details of the rape that make it so shocking  her constant crying and squirming his inherent joy at her discomfort his pinning of her arms and gagging her mouth the passerby who sees the scene and walks away unbeknownst to either of them. And when the long unsettling scene is over the greatest act of destruction occurs  the destruction of purity and beauty. Yet as the film is told backwards when the rape is over we know there is more to come as we have already seen the aftermath. The brilliance is in naively praying it won't happen resigned to the knowledge that it will.My coviewer demanded that we stop the film there but i had to insist that she finish the film. Without following the film through to the endor the beginning we would not know the reason that the director put these scenes in front of us. For me the greatest scenes are those that follow  the party scene the subway journey of the three main characters the postdream awakening of the central couple  because they lift the film out of enfant terrible provocation and into a place of simultaneous beauty and pessimism making sense of the journey all three characters are about to embark on. In particular the significance of dreams is a key theme along with the linear destructive power of time which the whole film is playing around with.The film ends with the most difficult sequence to watch the spinning beautiful image of Monica Bellucci prior to any of the events of the film followed by a strobe light effect which is physically difficult to watch burning images and words into the brain.Clearly Noe is a director intent on provoking a reaction and  thank God  it is impossible not to react to this film. You may hate it you may admire it or you may be disgusted by it. All of these are perfect reactions to it. You cannot be indifferent to it. While it is undoubtedly a hard film to sit through if you put in the effort it rewards in dividends. And it not only deserves but really requires multiple viewings if you can stomach it. There is far more than can be taken in on the first visit much to decipher and interpret that I will not spoil here.While it does seem to reference the controversy of the aforementioned Kubrick classic  taking the violence and sexual abuse aspects to new levels updating for a new generation  and even directly tips its hat to Kubrick  panning down from a poster of 2001 as classical music swells before going into a psychadelic headtrip  this is a much harder yet more humane film than Kubrick ever achieved. There is unpleasantness here do not be fooled but there is also insightful comment on the nature of humanity instinct violence even love and relationships which alone makes the film worthy of appreciation. It is not a film all will be able to sit through  for a start its subtitled!  but it is a film which deserves to be seen at least once by anyone with an appreciation of cinema. It is among the finest examples of modern French cinema available and one of the most intelligent and original films from anywhere in the last five years.Finally it wouldn't be right to hail the film without mentioning the performers. Monica Bellucci is outstanding in an undoubtedly difficult part conveying the beauty intelligence womanliness emotion and despair of Alex in a way that never screams Moviestar! and is always believable. Dupontel is wonderful in perhaps the film's most interesting role a complex intellectual who it is often overlooked gives in to his most primal urges. He is sad smart witty and ultimately disturbed. But highest praise goes to Cassel one of the most interesting actors working who carries most of the film emitting charm energy fear shock humour and weakness. It is hard not to focus on him in any given scene and impossible to catch him acting high praise indeed given the other subjects which often fill the screen not least the stunning Bellucci. Together they are prime examples of true actors giving themselves over completely to their characters in a way that the likes of Nicole Kidman simply can't. They may be stars but they are first and foremost brilliant performers.Take caution but do not miss if you get the chance.".

They may be stars but they are first and foremost brilliant performers.Take caution but do not miss if you get the chance.";

	schema:reviewBody "A few months ago while I was going through the message boards on IMDb someone was talking about disturbing films and one that seemed to come up the most was a film called Irreversible. This film has come up in discussion so many times when the subject of disturbing film is brought to attention. When I think I've seen the worst of the worst I figured I should see what Irreversible had to offer. I have to admit after watching this movie it stayed with me. Definitely not being the easiest movie to watch Irreversible has a style to it and a very disturbing story that can haunt many for different reasons. Wither it's the extreme violence the cursing the drugs or the 9 minute rape scene Gasper Noe takes you into this very dark world and doesn't let you go.The beginning of Irreversible that is the chronological end of the story features two men going to a homosexual SM nightclub called The Rectum. Minutes earlier the men named Marcus and Pierre are escorted out of that nightclub by the police. Marcus is on a stretcher apparently injured and Pierre is in handcuffs. Earlier that evening Marcus and Pierre arrived at the club in a frantic search for somebody nicknamed le Tenia. Marcus finds the man believed to be le Tenia and attacks him. The man pins down Marcus then snaps his arm. Pierre rescues Marcus by bludgeoning the attacker's face using a fire extinguisher brutally and fatally crushing the man's skull after repeated blows. During the onslaught the real le Tenia is seen to be amused by the situation. It is revealed that le Tenia raped Marcus's girlfriend Alex and placed her in a coma by beating her severely.Filmed backwards I thought was extremely brilliant at least the way I interpret it. We see EXTREME violence and sexuality in the beginning pretty much being up front that this movie is going to be very uncomfortable and not a movie for all. Gasper Noe is basically telling the audience what you see is what you get not trying to pull you into something you might not want to be apart of. It also shows that these two men who kill this man violently are possibly the bad guys? No it turns out as we discover that a woman they both love has been brutally raped and beaten. Then when we meet her she's not just some woman who is the girlfriend of one of men trying to get revenge or a girl at a party dressed in a skimpy outfit this is a woman who is walking out of a party trying to get home and comes across the wrong place wrong time situation. The rape scene reason being that it's so different than any other rape scene you might have viewed in another film it's long one angle and the words that come out of the rapist's mouth are just awful. It's the most realistic rape scene I've viewed and I have to warn you that please if you have a weak stomach or have had that horrific experience this is not a movie for you.Irreversible is definitely violent there is a scene that most people debate which is more disturbing the rape or the fire extinguisher. The fire extinguisher is at the beginning of the film and is definitely realistic and beyond disturbing because you see everything. Also the hatred behind the killer is just there he has no remorse for what he is doing. Then when we find out later that he kills the wrong guy it just makes it that more brutal. Gasper Noe also films the movie in the worst way in the beginning making the audience sick with his spinning camera and disturbing noises. He doesn't lie to you he knows this film is going to be one of the most frightening pieces of work you'll see and he doesn't want you comfortable with it. Irreversible is one of the hardest films for me to recommend because it just depends on what kind of a viewer you are. If you can handle extreme violence sexuality and language you could get through this. I watched A Clockwork Orange when I was a teenager and hated it because I felt that Kubrick was trying to make me sympathize with Alex before watching Irreversible I rewatched A Clockwork Orange and realized I missed the whole message of the film. It wasn't about Alex but our society and I have the greatest admiration for the film now. Irreversible shows how we can go from hating someone to understanding their position to rooting for them. Are we the animals? Irreversible will have you thinking for days this is a film I will never forget.1010".

	schema:headline " some of the most disturbing scenes ever";
	schema:reviewBody "If there's one thing that can be stated with utmost certainty it is that Irreversible' a French film by writerdirector Gaspar Noe is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach.  In fact this tale of the brutal rape of a helpless young woman is one of the most harrowing films ever made and features two of the most graphic scenes ever committed to film the rape itself and the killing of the man responsible for the rape.Although I imagine that very few people will end up subjecting themselves to this film in the long run those who do will witness an amazing piece of work in many ways.   Like the movie Betrayal' from 1983 Irreversible' tells its story in reverse chronological order.   It begins with a frenzied man racing through a gay sex club madly searching for someone we know merely as Le Tenia.  Only as the story develops  as we are taken ever further back in time  do we begin to understand what is going on that this young man Marcus is seeking vengeance on the rapist who has brutally attacked his pregnant girlfriend.  Noe keeps us in a state of confusion by filming the scene in such a way as to reflect the maniacal state of Marcus' revengeobsessed mind.   The camera bounces around in epileptic confusion while the audience attempts to get its bearings.  Eventually as the filmmakers backtrack to reveal the events that have led up to this moment the camera calms down and we get to see the whole ugly story acted out in painfully graphic detail.  In fact in the rape scene itself Noe reverses his filmmaking style 180 degrees deliberately leaving the camera stationary and focused on the event as it plays itself out.  He simply won't allow us to stop looking.There are some I imagine who might object to this film on moral grounds feeling that it is little more than a cynical exploitation picture with artistic pretensions.  Yet that condemnation would do a disservice to the makers of this film who I believe do not want us to revel in the sordidness of what we see but rather to be appalled by the unspeakably brutal way in which human beings can treat their fellow human beings.   By having us sit and witness every moment of this brutality without the comforting filter of cutaway shots or easy dissolves Noe forces us to face the ugly truths about ourselves as a species.  The reverseorder structure of the film heightens the tragic nature of the story for it allows us to see just how happy and hopeful these characters are in the time right before the rape shatters their lives.  The latter half of the film contains no physical violence yet watching it unfold is an ineffably sad experience for we unlike the characters themselves are privy to the Sword of Damocles so precariously poised over their unsuspecting heads yet find ourselves helpless in being able to rescue them from the inevitable destruction it will cause.  Thus the structure robs us of even the remotest option of hoping against hope that the tragedy can somehow be avoided  for we have seen it as an already completed action.  For while the film may be reversible' life itself is not.  In the case of this film at least form does indeed become content.Vincent Cassel as Marcus Monica Bellucci as his girlfriend Alex and Albert Dupontel as their mutual friend Pierre all deliver excellent heartfelt performances.  I doubt that many people will have the intestinal fortitude to make it through large segments of this film but those who do will surely never forget what they've seen.".

The first one was Soldier Blue' when I was a teenager explicitly showing the massacre of the American Indians. Later in 1982 Sophie's Choice' when a mother has to decide which son shall remain alive. Irreversible' which I saw yesterday was the third one. The storyline is very simple In Paris a young couple goes to a party with a friend by subway. They discuss and the woman decides to return back home alone. She is violently raped in an underground passage. Her husband and her friend decide to make justice by themselves.  What makes the difference in this polemic movie? First of all like in Memento' the story is presented backwards in a reverse chronology from the credits to the beginning. Although not being original unfolded this way the story shocks much more. Then the cruelty of at least two very explicit scenes the rape of Alexandra and the aggression and crime of Pierre in the gay nightclub are amazingly well choreographed and real. The beginning of the film with the camera spinning randomly and a weird soundtrack makes the viewer sick and so disoriented and disturbed as Marcus the character of Vincent Cassel. Therefore technically this film is outstanding. The performance of the cast and the direction photography and soundtrack are stunning. Living in Rio de Janeiro a violent city the story is very real and scary and that is why it shakes up more than a horror movie. We never believe that this situation may happen to ourselves or to our friends but the daily newspaper shows many similar examples. The idea of the irreversibility of time and its destruction the same way of the lives of the characters in this movie is fantastic. Certainly a very sensitive person will be sick and will not like this movie. The box of the DVD should advise that this story is  recommended to a specific audience. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Irreversvel' Irreversible'".

It actually is one of those rare purchases that makes you wonder what the role of cinema is in modern society. Irrversible certainly can't be classified as 'entertainment' that's for sure. It merely looks like a brutal eyeopener highly unpleasant to watch at times and it sometimes makes you even feel ashamed to be human! Some of the stuff here goes beyond your most feared nightmares and could easily provoke depression antisocial behavior and anxiety among influential viewers. It's reallife drama and that makes it so powerful and shocking. Irrversible is told backwards 'Memento'style if you wish...only it's a lot more effective here as it was in Memento which actually was a pretty boring and extremely overrated movie. This very simple backwardsstructure aspect gives Irrversible the opportunity to implement a couple of unique and rarely seen style elements. The first half hour which actually is the end of the story smacks you in the face right away sets the tone for a nonstop raw experience. Also you don't really get to know the characters until the last chapter which is actually the beginning of the film The characters are a riddle to you constantly and you can't symphatise with any of them since you just know too little. Through wild camera movements and simplistic technomusic a claustrophobic and horrifying atmosphere gets created and the violence is really hard to digest. The infamous scene in which Monica Belluci brutally gets raped is one of the most perverted things I've ever seen. It seems to go on forever and you can really visiualise the painful hell the poor girl is going through. I'd call Irrversible a successful combination of ancient rough exploitation and modern arthouse filmmaking. The brutality portrayed here is typical for the euroshock cinema but the stylish shooting lifts it up to Cannes Festival material. Cult as pure as it comes!".

	schema:reviewBody "Argentinian born French film maker Gaspar No is already one of the most important and powerful film makers of all time. His 1998 debut feature film Seul Contre Tous is an unforgettably merciless but also so uniquely rewarding depiction of rotten society with even more rotten human beings that inhabit it with their selfishness and potential to violence and revenge  those things that everyone feels sometimes more or less often and things that only create more of them when not kept inactive and off. The last 15 minutes of Seul Contre Tous include some of the most unimaginably brilliant editing and camerawork including a bodymounted camera and clever communicationestranging with the unsuspecting audience not to speak of the soundtrack which force us to see the truth about ourselves and things around us. Those mentioned elements are also the same that stamp the work of Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto Tetsuo in 1988 Gemini in 1999 who is also a friend of No. These two directors do most of the important parts of their film making themselves camera operating editing directing writing.. and both have the talent to smash the viewer straight to the face and force him and her to think and even change towards something better. Now No has even surpassed his power and moment of total breathlessness of Seul Contre Tous with his 2002 film Irrversible a masterpiece that has the same ability to change people's lives and attitudes towards a better world but with the kind of power of imagery and soundtrack that only few unfortunately as films like these deserved more attention and respect are willing to accept and understand.Alex Monica Bellucci Marcus Vincent Cassel and Pierre Albert Dupontel are three French friends who live peacefully and also in love as Alex and Marcus are together and love each other genuinely. Alex has also been with Pierre but their thing didn't work and now they are only friends and all three get along more than well. Comes a weekend night and time to go to have some fun with more friends. Then as some alcohol and drugs are involved comes some arguing with the lovers and Alex decides to go home to sleep and leave her drunken boyfriend to dance alone. Unfortunately for all but fortunately for the real ill world and audience for whom this film with its message is made for she meets the most evil thing ever possible to live inside the flesh and bones of human being and a terrible rape takes place. How does man with his instincts react when he learns something terrible and violent has happened to his loved one and there's also a possibility to get to know who did it? Revenge is a human need has the mighty director said and the man's potential for mindless violence lack of moral and willing to take revenge are the main themes of this important film and it all is told with so much genius and unique elements the film already belongs to the list of the unmatched and the films that managed to make and achieve something for the first time in the history.The film is told backwards so that we'd see even clearlier what results from what and then we are forced to ask ourselves why which requires to look inside our own heads and souls and look into the mirror. The film begins with the most infernal 20 minutes of the whole movie history and culminates to the most graphically violent and mentally and physically shocking sequence ever created that leaves no questions for what is the real nature of violence and thus revenge like. The incredible colors lights and darkness of the beginning are already something very powerful and unique but are accompanied even further by truly incredible usage and movements of camera as it twists and shakes in agony of forthcoming and present terror for the whole beginning of the film. The film has only 19 or so partsscenes as it's told without single edits inside the parts. The form is very convincing and unconventional and naturally makes it even more realistic and easy to connect to our own world. Those who blame the disturbingly strobing pounding and restless sonic imagery of the beginning don't know how much camera is in cinema and how a talented maker can use it depict and show with it. It is Hell we're witnessing at the beginning of Irrversible so why would've No made it look peaceful calm and harmless as it's all really bad and wicked even and especially for those who support it as we soon learn at the Rectum finale. It is Hell that can be found anywhere where humans live be and do deeds together and to one another.No's camerawork is definitely something very difficult to imagine to be created and the director has said in interviews that there were indeed some segments mostly the party sequence when he thought he'd become crazy as it all was so difficult to do and keep in control. The camera is not so wild and restless after the beginning as there isn't even a reason for that again an example of what does camera mean in cinema and how it must be used without being gratuitous or meaningless. The crane shots of the beginning of the story but the ending of the film are also breathtaking and hypnotic and also show for one last time what is another key element of the film alongside the imagery the soundtrack and music sounds and voices of the film. The soundtrack consists of menacing pounding and with one word infernal sounds and also electric music but those waves are the ones that are not likely to be found from any other film. The sounds make the happenings of the screen look like how they are inside the film and how they would be if and when something like that happened in real life. Never have I experienced and heard the soundtrack strengtening the images as it does in Irrversible. I had one of the year 2002's greatest and unforgettable moments when I saw the film on big screen which it demands and I will never forget the feelings I had during the opening of the film and after I had read about the elements and creating of the soundtrack I understood even more about the uneasiness of myself and the audience as well as the genius of its creator. If one decides not to agree with No about the antiviolent message of the film he will be smashed numb in front of the images and sounds whether he wanted it or not.The point of the unspeakable violence of the film is to make it look and feel as bad and irreversible as in real world too. When the revenge takes place and we experience something extremely ugly and both physically and mentally painful No forces us to see the things that the avenging minds don't see at least in time how violence always requires more of it as human beings are pretty much the same animal and we all share these instincts and potential which still could and can be fought against. The revenge and its destroying face comes clear when we ask ourselves who did what did to whom did and finally why did and when the viewer admits those things and accepts the answers the message No meant has been delivered. In films violence can be harrowingly brutal shocking and graphic without being gratuitous and just cheap exploitation shock and that is the case with No's work as in any other important film that builds and gives and never takesexploits anything by raping the tool of cinema. After the Rectum finale only a stupid and a weak mind can think that any wise decisions were made after the fateful rape by the characters humans.Also the infamous crime scene that started it all is so easy to be judged as unacceptable and even more laughably pornographic as now it is nothing less than effective and useful for its purpose useful to show the nature of sexual violence and how it really is ugly nauseating sadistic and without respect for human life. If someone asks why such a long scene of rape must be filmed as those kind of things happen in real world all the time the answer is a new question since those things happen around us all the time and other tools have not been able to stop them or other violence in our world why couldn't an artist try his own extremely powerful tool cinema image and sound to change and affect things and people? Can there be enough weapons to stop those things happening around us and why the attempts of cinema and a film maker so often are overlooked and not given the acceptance and importance they deserved? Perhaps because they show too much about our very selves and to admit it that everyone of us is just a human is too difficult for many.Another important theme of the film is that of its title how things and deeds are and remain how they once get done and the more serious and critical the deed is the more we look and think about it afterwards still never being able to change it once it's been done as time is so merciless. Beautiful sunny and sweet things full of life can turn into destruction darkness agony death and eternal loss especially if wrong and fast decisions are made and too much power for the animal instincts are given. No's phrase time destructs everything is more than true but also to some extent possible to be affected by us who live this world and life so that no more destruction than there already is would take place. Too often precious things get killed because we didn't understand and see early enough and that's why films like this are universal and eternally fresh in their themes. The film is not thoroughly pessimistic and hopeless due to certain images of beauty and possibility the images of the beginning were destructed by a happening not possible to be prevented but the total death and Hell could have been prevented and that's why we the audience see it first.The actors all do incredible job as there wasn't a script for the film only a few written pages about the main happenings and parts of the story so all the dialogue was improvised by No's instructions and the three do it very naturally and it is not possible to guess there wasn't a screenplay for them without knowing it. In any possible aspect this film is unique and like no other it was made like no other it includes images and sounds like no other and it has a theme and message so strong like no other film some getting close in the whole history of movie making. Great art doesn't need to be conventional and like the other works of its kind and possibly the greatest thing an artist can achieve is a new powerful view and way to present it. That No achieved and delivered. He did a masterpiece in 1998 and he did another even more powerful masterpiece in 2002. Both films are perfect in my values and thus among the most important works ever made. No did these two and he's still young and full of ideas about themes and elements which he will use in his forthcoming projects. He must not be left outside the canon of the most important masters and philosophers of cinema like some other have and the world doesn't even know how much it gets if the financers of his films would understand this too. It is like I and the other audience didn't know what was to come when the hypnotic credits of Irrversible started to roll on the silent screen. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This very suffocating film is by far the most brutal and graphic piece of work done in a long time. Although the camera work is technically excellent it is overshadowed by the savage scenes which surround it from the moment Pierre smashes a mans skull and brain to jelly with a fire extinguisher you realize that this inhuman film ranks up there with the most vile and grim ones around. If this seen was not gut wrenching enough then the very disturbing rape scene that followed simply made the last scene look average. The director's goal was to make the viewer feel as uncomfortable as possible but at the same time make you really understand. Each time the 'Tenia' is shown brutally raping his victim Monica Belluci you find it unbearable to watch smartly the director may use another camera view so that you see less. You might then think it's over and you feel a sign of reliefwrong. Immediately you are thrown right back into the deep end and you begin to drown in her pain and terrible suffering as this very sick and deranged predator keeps going. At times I actually questioned whether it was in my right to watch this am I watching this because I enjoy watching or am I so disgusted and surprised by the tragedy that I need to know the full extent. For whatever reason there is the director definitely gained my utmost sympathy for this woman and triggered my rage and anger for this rapist. What struck me even more was the fact that after you suffer this scene which seems to last forever the 'Tenia' then goes on to severely beat his victim to a pulp how nice as if she had not suffered enough. I could tell you of the brilliant filmwork or the brilliant acting by Vincent Cassel La Haine Doberman and Monica Belluci The Passion of the Christ The Matrix ReloadedRevolutions but we the viewer are simply engulfed by the sadistic atrocities that are the sad highlight of this film. I will say that if you really want to find the hatred within yourself against cold blooded killers and rapists then this film will trigger it. I wouldn't recommend this film to someone in a conversation about films unless the very highly unlikely scenario of rape surfaced. Despite this I wish you could see this film just to understand the full extent of the harsh encounters people have in life and even if you can't fully watch then only glimpses will do the damage. The background music just to mention is quite daunting and further enhances the surreal and uncomfortable atmosphere.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a sucker for filmworld hypealways have been and probably always will be. When I stumble across a film that is so controversial it inspires both gasps of horror and cheers of praise I flock to it. There is something intriguing about film's capacity to house unpleasantness and just how far a director will go in conveying his message it's always interesting to see whether or not they have a justified reason for the excess. Irreversible the backwardstructured film from French shock auteur Gaspar Noe I Stand Alone spins you out of control with as much regularity as his camera and characters will allow. It's a curious piece of work designed to provoke the audienceat the beginning you're disoriented and confused and if you're like me getting carsick from the deliberately erratic camera movements and even repulsed by the actions of the unfamiliar characters hassling the patrons of a seedy homosexual club a sequence that ends with a ghastly murder. Okay then so what? Clearly the rest of the movie is going to give us an explanation...but would the film have had a similar effect if it were told in a straightforward manner? Is the backward motion of Irreversible just a gimmick used by Noe who is not immune from snobbery and pretension to draw attention to his film? It's hard to say. Personally I reject the notion of the reverse storyline being used as a gimmick simply because of how deliberately the previous pieces fit certain passages of dialog particularly a discussion of orgasms that serves as a prelude to one of the most horrifying rape scenes in film history Noe certainly wasn't asleep in his construction of the film. Irreversible displays the type of oppressive misanthropy the dialog is loaded with racial and homophobic slurs evidenced in Noe's I Stand Alone the tale of an outofwork butcher driven to madness by everyone around him but then pulls back from the hardedged violence to show a tender humanity that might be even more startling since the film could have easily played itself for nothing but shock value the entire time. Irreversible is an unsettling conundrum that guides us through the highs and lows of the human conditionit pushes buttons of morality shows in graphic detail what others would only suggest and brings us out the end of the tunnel exhausted invigorated and breathless. A stunning film somewhat hampered by its excessive dialog.".

It's a curious piece of work designed to provoke the audienceat the beginning you're disoriented and confused and if you're like me getting carsick from the deliberately erratic camera movements and even repulsed by the actions of the unfamiliar characters hassling the patrons of a seedy homosexual club a sequence that ends with a ghastly murder. Okay then so what? Clearly the rest of the movie is going to give us an explanation...but would the film have had a similar effect if it were told in a straightforward manner? Is the backward motion of Irreversible just a gimmick used by Noe who is not immune from snobbery and pretension to draw attention to his film? It's hard to say. Personally I reject the notion of the reverse storyline being used as a gimmick simply because of how deliberately the previous pieces fit certain passages of dialog particularly a discussion of orgasms that serves as a prelude to one of the most horrifying rape scenes in film history Noe certainly wasn't asleep in his construction of the film. Irreversible displays the type of oppressive misanthropy the dialog is loaded with racial and homophobic slurs evidenced in Noe's I Stand Alone the tale of an outofwork butcher driven to madness by everyone around him but then pulls back from the hardedged violence to show a tender humanity that might be even more startling since the film could have easily played itself for nothing but shock value the entire time. Irreversible is an unsettling conundrum that guides us through the highs and lows of the human conditionit pushes buttons of morality shows in graphic detail what others would only suggest and brings us out the end of the tunnel exhausted invigorated and breathless. A stunning film somewhat hampered by its excessive dialog.";

	schema:reviewBody "When his girlfriend Alex is brutally raped in an underpass boyfriend Marcus and Alex's exboyfriend Pierre are approached by a couple of criminal types who claim to know who did it and lead Marcus on the path to revenge via hookers and a man in a brutal gay club known as the Rectum.I shan't waste my time or yours by writing more of a plot to this film than that because this is all quite thin stuff. Normally I find myself gradually engaged by a film as it develops characters and stories however with Irrversible I was gripped immediately but the effect worked in reverse just like the film. Others have asked why this film is told backwards with some waxing lyrical about the film demonstrating the nature of actions and consequences. I don't buy this and I almost believe that the film is structured this way because No knows that his film is not good enough to engage the audience with the development of the story and characters to the point where they would still care by the end. Whereas by starting with his biggest and most impacting sequences he has preventing the audience thinking this is going nowhere by putting us right where it is going to.Of course what this means is that the film genuinely has nowhere to go to because the developmental issue is still there  albeit the need to see roots rather than branches. With this there is nothing and I felt myself becoming more and more disappointed with the film as it went on as it seemed to offer nothing but missed potential. Unlike Memento which was a thriller with the reason being to find out what caused the end Irrversible's ending is an act of violence and revenge that in essence occurs out of bad fortune rather than a series of events that are worth holding out for. With this in mind the focus comes more on the characters and their relationships to find a reason to make the impacting opening to the film feel that much more impacting. Sadly it does fall down and despite some interesting stuff that might have gone somewhere if not to the actual crime themes of sexual intimacy differences in men and women and so on are just suggested but never delivered upon and my interest and respect for the film waned frighteningly quickly.It is a terrible shame because the film had initially won me over quickly. With the first shots of spinning camera irrelevant men and disorientating delivery I prepared myself to hate this film and slate it for being pretentious. This feeling didn't subside much as we were thrown into a gay club ending with an intensely brutal scene of violence that quite sickened me. The reason for this is almost the following scene where we see the beautiful and classy Alex brutally and meaninglessly sodomised on the floor of a dirty underpass for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time and the wrong sex. With my eyes at the time I found these scenes to be quite brilliant but finding out later there was nothing beyond them I take a dimmer view. In his defence No's sequences should not be mentioned in the same breath as the recent Holly wood trend for torture porn because there is nothing erotic here. The rape scene in particular is disturbing sickening and based on violence certainly not sex attraction or arousal. Some comments on IMDb have disturbed me and shown that some people will still enjoy these scenes  one particular comment saying fans of rape movie will appreciate the sequence I felt was in particular poor taste. However for me it is as effective as it is unpleasant No does not adopt the angles style or nudity of pornography and indeed leaves the camera on the floor and lets the actors deliver an experience that is undeniably cruel and wrong. Viewers who chose to get off on that will do so however for those of us not stimulated by the violent degradation of another the effect will be harrowing.The cast are good where they are caught up in things. Cassel is convincing in his revenge scenes but has less to work with in the later earlier scenes. Likewise Bellucci is amazing in her key scene utterly convincing and heartwrenching in her agony and I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to shoot. Dupontel is interesting but his performance would have benefited from going from innocence to violence and not the other way round. Prestia is a convincing human version of Satan who is sickeningly real. No's direction is impressive even if his ability as writer is not. His camera earlier on matches the frantic violent mood of his characters but gradually calms down. Quite what he is saying with where the film goes or how it ends is beyond me but by then he had done sufficiently little to convince that I shouldn't worry myself too much.Overall an impacting experience film that starts out with the potential to be a challenging and difficult art film. However with nothing past these scenes of significant value the backward telling just seems like a way of having the big scenes before losing the audience rather than afterwards and for all my appreciation and admiration for his intense and creative technique as director I found No the writer to be lacking. In summary I'm not sure if I liked this or not or if it is worth seeing but it is certainly an experience that should be seen by those looking for a diverse taste of cinema whether it is enjoyable or not.".

The genius behind Irreversible then is the way in which it cleverly defies censorship through unfolding the action backwards and in single uninterrupted takes forcing the audience to witness a climactic and terrifying beginning set against an almost optimistic and happier end. The plot of the film is purely and simply a 'rape and revenge' tale with the crucial difference being that it is filmed in reverse. This means that after a bizarre seemingly unrelated conversation between two men the camera dizzyingly moves out of the window to the Rectum nightclub below opening the film with the lead character Marcus Vincent Cassel being led away by the police. Moments later we see the horrifically brutal act of violence that led to his arrest then Marcus discovering the badly beaten body of his wife Alex Monica Bellucci followed by the deeply shocking and powerful nineminute central scene in which Alex is horrifically attacked both mentally and physically anallyraped and then brutally beaten after she tragically walks through a subway underpass. This admittedly is extremely uncomfortable to sit through and there were numerous reports of walkouts when the film screened at both the Cannes and Edinburgh film festivals. However the structure of the film means that perversely and paradoxically Noe provides his film with a happy ending since the film leaves us with beautifully intimate and sometimes humorous scenes involving Alex and Marcus as lovers in bed whilst Alex discovers she is pregnant. Visually the film is extremely impressive as the swooping camera relentlessly follows the actors plunging us into a world of horrific nightmares and sexual depravity. The fact that the camera never cuts away with each scene lasting up to ten minutes long means that the audience is never given any space to breath and cannot escape the reality of what is happening before us. Similarly Cassel Bellucci and Dupontel as their mutual friend are exceptional through their immensely tender naturalistic and no doubtimprovised dialogue. The reversal effect of the film is both technically and mentally stunning as the audience in its position of safety and authority examines and replays the films unfolding with a deeper understanding and resonance for the tragedy and horror on screen. The film is undoubtedly an unusual and unique cinematic experience that forces you to examine the way in which you experience a film and indeed your reactions to it. Films like Irreversible Requiem for a Dream and Ma Soeur force us to consider the question of whether we can ever truly enjoy watching such harrowing films when they appear perhaps too realistic in their depiction of a brutal life. Some might argue that a film which conveys such disturbing images of extreme physical violence and rape must have something redeeming about it in order for the film to be constructed as a worthwhile cinematic experience. Certainly when talking about such controversial films as Irreversible and Requiem for a Dream it is impossible to say you liked them yet they remain powerful and thought provoking nonetheless. What can we say about it other than it is a film that captures the incapability of fate and consequence underlying how we are all susceptible to time's destruction. A controversial film yes but one that is sure to get people into a dialogue into the nature of cinema and entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there was ever a film that made you want to take a shower  afterwards this is it. I felt dirty and upset and confused but  mostly disgusted. Within the first twenty minutes we witness some  various depravities at a gay SM club called The Rectum a man get his  head crushed in by a fire extinguisher and a shemale prostitute being  assaulted at knife point. Within the following twenty minutes we see a  woman getting savagely raped and beaten for ten plus minutes. The trick  here is we see these events backwards.  Like MEMENTO Christopher Nolan's brilliant 2000 film IRREVERSIBLE has  a reverse chronology. So really the depravity and beatings I mentioned  are really the end of the film and the beginning is the end. The story  revolves around Marcus Vincent Cassel and Alex Monica Belluci a  young couple who are deeply in love. She is the woman who was raped and  beaten and Marcus spends the first last half of the movie seeking  revenge with his best friend and her exlover Pierre Albert Dupontel  in tow.   The first half of the film is extremely tough to get through. The  scenes in the gay bar and Alex's rape seem to never end and we're  forced to take in some truly disgusting sights. The man who is killed  with the fire extinguisher suffers the noexaggeration most violent  death in film history.  I'm not sure quite how the effect was done but it made me cringe and  I've seen it all. Usually in scenes where people are beaten to death  we see quick cuts of their bloody face followed by some shots of the  attacker from the back as they do their deed. Here director Gaspar Noe  keeps the camera stationary right next to the victim's  head. It's an amazing shot but one that will deeply disturb me the  rest of my days.  By the end of the film things are more pleasant but a great sense of  melancholy still covers the scene because we know what's going to  happen later. The ultimate goal of the film proves not to be a violent  exploitation piece but a portrayal of the tragic crime of rape.   I can't in good conscience recommend this film. It's too disturbing  and what's more features some of the most nauseating camerawork I've  ever seen.  I don't have a problem per se with trick photography but I'd like it  to have a point. The camera moves underneath people a couple stories  above them and sometimes just spins around and around in a stationary  position. There's a shot at the end beginning of a spinning lawn  sprinkler with a child running around it while the camera spins like  Mr. Toad's Wild Ride as operated by a crack fiend.   In the end I understand what the film wanted to do and I respect it.  But there are subtler ways to make a point and when you're going to  use the most graphic images ever put on film you'd better have a  stronger and more oblique message than 'Rape is bad.'".

This is something that will come in time but I felt it was only right to comment after my first impression. I instantly gave the film 10 out of 10 not because I overly enjoyed it nigh on impossible but because it shook me at times to my very core and affected me in a way that I cannot easily or fully describe. I can honestly say Irreversible is the most devastating piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. This isn't solely due to it's shocking content but more so the production as a whole and how it has been constructed and packaged. It truly is a work of art. Camerawork lighting colour primarily gaudy striking tones of red and orange all combine in an unforgettable amalgam of brilliance. Featuring towering performances from Cassel Belluci and Dupontel the film lurches backward in time depicting the events of a truly tragic night in the lives of three friends. Alex Belluci is brutally raped on her way home from a party and Marcus Cassel and Pierre Dupontel set off determined to wreak vengeance on the perpetrator. However that is merely the plot. Admittedly quite a simple premise but the way it is played out is unforgettable. This is a film that everyone should and arguably needs to see as it is for me a milestone of modern cinema. Raw and unflinching can you stomach it?".

But seeing it a 2nd time I didn't care for it as much in fact I feel I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it because seeing it the 2nd time you realise a lot of things about it that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor most of it was improvised and not very well the violence of the film is purposely over the top and Noe the director seems to delight in showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy horrific violence but has no purpose other than saying life is brutal. I can't deny that the film did have a great impact upon first viewing but too often when one's sense are assaulted like they are here you can mistake that for great artistic filmmaking. Technically the film is astounding. It was shot mostly in long takes but edited together with CGI effects the smashing of the head in the gay bar at the beginning was done digitally as part of the rape scene. It's definitely a curiosity but realise what you're getting into. It's really not for the squeamish. The opening scene in the gay bar is dizzying and brutal and the rape scene is beyond brutal. Noe films the rape scene in one take which makes it even more difficult to watch. Is the film art? No it isn't. Simply because the film polarized audiences doesn't make it art a common assumption by people. Noe's films he's only complete 2 features aren't really deep or anything just pessimistic and brutal.A telling episode about Noe happened a year or so ago. The IFC Theater in NYC has a feature they do occasionally. They bring in a filmmaker to introduce a film they admire. Noe showed his first film I Stand Alone and Pasolini's Salo. After Noe's film concluded he talked to the audience on why he wanted to show Salo. All he talked about was the coprophilia scenes aka the st eating scenes. He didn't talk about anything else that Salo had to offer in terms of its message on fascism sexual perversion the cinematography the production design. Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom is actually an excellent film. It's incredibly depressing and brutal but has a real sense of art and is a genuinely controversial film even to this day. Noe's films he's made only 2 are not like this at all. Both I Stand Alone and Irreversible hit you in the face the first time you see them but you shake it off and Noe has nothing more to give you. This film has no resonance at all. It's just for shock value.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's so much I could say about this movie but I will attempt to keep this short. First off the popular argument is whether this constitutes pornography or not. Some argue that because of the rape scene and it's visual no holds barred intensity it does. The supreme court says that pornography is any medium that causes sexual thought and has no artistic merit. The problem with this definition is that what constitutes art or artistic merit is never defined. Since artistic merit cannot be judged on with an objective opinion because no opinion is objective then the whole issue gets whitewashed. To say it is pornography is up to each individual viewer along witth the understanding that that does not dictate whether or not it actually constitutes pornography. There's also the unanswered question of who should it cause sexual thought to. I don't know about you but I'm not thinking about shampoo when I see those Hebal Essence commercials which are advertising and theoretically have no artistic mer it.Beyond all the hulaboo and philosophy I pose the question Why is pornography always conotated as bad? What's so wrong with mediums of pointless sloppy sex with no regard to supposed high minded ideals?Now with all that behind I'd like to move on to the movie. The first notably thing about the movie is the spinning camera that helps make this movie far more confrontational and challenging to the average movie goer than either the rape or the violence in the movie. I believe that the spinning is the reason for the numerous walk outs. I think if pulp fiction would have spun the camera as wildly there would have been just as many walkouts on that. I see the function of the spinning camera as the movies way of telling us that things just can spin out of control and i'm sure that most audience would have gotten it quite early on and the technique could have been dropped. This movie does not want to let off the audience that easily.The rape scene is another example of this. Going with this movie's very dark pessimistic view on human nature both in and out of the film this movie dares you with the hands down most graphically violent thing I've ever seen on film and the most unblinking nauseating rape scene ever. This movie practically dares you not just to look at the train wreck with an air of disconnected distance but to actually go right up and examine the bodies of the victims for yourself. While most people harbor the morbid capabilities to watch a car wreck from the safety of their car window or watch a war from the safety of their living room television most would not prefer to be in the war or at the wreck as a coroner. This movie holds up that hypocracy and dumps all over you.This movie very much reminds me of a movie that might have been shown to Alex during his treatment in A Clockwork Orange. With or without drugs this movie might have nauseated him. Save for rapist misogynist masochists and the occasional pedophile I can think of no average human being who could find the rape scene in the least bit appetizing let alone sexually desirable.The warmth of the late scenes would have been quite a touching movie in and of themselves had we not known the beginning. Compared to the romantic comedies and melodramas we are usually fed by Hollywood these have a certain touching authenticity to them. In this movie overiding agenda of pessimism one valid point is overlooked. Time heals all wounds that time creates. I give it 10 out of 10".

The film moves from Middle America to the halls of power in Washington to the global financial epicenter in Manhattan. With both humor and outrage the film explores the question What is the price that America pays for its love of capitalism? Families pay the price with their jobs their homes and their savings. Moore goes into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down and he goes looking for explanations in Washington DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the alltoofamiliar symptoms of a love affair gone astray lies abuse betrayal...and 14000 jobs being lost every day. Capitalism A Love Story also presents what a more hopeful future could look like. Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do?";

This is no easy feat. I must admit the first quarter of the film had me doubting if he would secede.

A judge in a US town was locking up juvenile offenders for crimes such as throwing meat or criticizing a viceprincipal online. The prison was a privately run corporation that was sending financial kickbacks to the very judge who was locking these kids up on absurd charges. Granted this was just one example but a shocking one that could make you question just what are American values. This is where the film really started to get interesting. Are capitalism and Christianity compatible? What becomes of capitalism when you strip out regulation? Who actually controls the government of The United States of America the top 1 or the bottom 95? When the markets crashed last fall and the banks cried uncle where was the oversight by our elected officials regarding the bailout funds? These are questions and some answers that make Moore's documentary effective and engaging. While he is reflecting upon the past he is also asking us what are we going to do about it in the future?".

	schema:headline " Michael Moore gets radical in the literal sense";
	schema:reviewBody "In his new film 'Capitalism A Love Story' Moore's focus is more basic the fundamental economic system which is also political. Or is it just our way of life? For all the anger and sense of wrong of the pushedthrough taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street investment bankers the foreclosures and the skyrocketing American unemployment this film doesn't feel as urgent as 'Fahrenheit' or as wellresearched and freshly informative as Sicko. Nonetheless it is more basic and for the first time Moore focuses on morals. He goes to the Catholic priest who married him and his wife the one who married his sisterinlaw and their bishop and all declare that capitalism advocates values that are unChristian. If capitalism encourages greed greed is avarice and avarice is one of the seven deadly sins. This is touchy stuff but it seems that the director felt the moment was ripe to bring it up. He was proved more than right when the financial meltdown came in late 2008 this was a sign that the greed was destroying us. And for a change certain words seemed no longer taboo. Moore noted that Bush made a speech touting the capitalist system and while campaigning Obama said something about sharing the wealth that led the opposition to accuse him of being a socialist. A socialist! The word could as well be Satanist or pedophile as far as US conservatives are concerned. It's so inflammatory in this country Moore himself doesn't dare use the word of himself. When asked if he was a socialist by Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! at the end of an hourlong interview there was an awkward silence. Moore said I'm a heterosexual. . .I'm overweight. . . . and then the program ran out of time. They say in Canada he isn't so reticent.As he tells it Moore was already working on this film when the meltdown came. The average guy sees the government bailouts as greed. Some progressive economists such as Nobel laureate and NYTimes oped columnist Paul Krugman have consistently argued that the bailouts were necessary that they just haven't been bold and thorough enough. The concept that the taxpayer is paying for them is a little simplistic. In that sense we're all paying for everything. It's better to be saving the financial system than to be invading Iraq and Afghanistan and bombing Pakistan  and it costs much less too.Moore jumps around playing his old games asking admission to General Motors headquarters or AIG stringing Crime Scene yellow tapes around the Stock Market and big banks following a window and door factory where all the workers were let go but then decided to sitin at the factory until they got their severance packages from Bank of America. There's a lot about foreclosures how they happen who has fought them and who exploits them. There are several companies where the workers are actual shareholders who have a vote on what happens a line operator gets 65000 a year more than some airline pilots whom Moore reveals to be so underpaid some have had to resort to food stamps. Obama did once spout vaguely socialist ideas but Moore shows how that was dealt with big banks made him beholden by becoming major contributors to his campaign. Moore says Goldman Sachs was the biggest with a million dollars actually the University of California is listed above that with a million five.Three are many tearjerking moments here. Moore has a field day with a couple who're ejected from their farmhouse complex and even paid 1000  the ultimate humiliation  to get rid of the contents of their house. A black family in another sequence is helped by an activist group to return to their foreclosed house and reoccupy it after living in a truck. Moore goes overboard on this stuff. As Felperin says Moore would probably show puppies personally drowned by Bush Treasury Secretary and former Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson if he could.But the Michael Moore wants to wake you up and make you mad and the most powerful  and important  argument is that of the Catholic priests that capitalism as it's practiced nowadays is unChristian  and in the terms of any spiritual system morally wrong. Also important if underdeveloped in this complicated effective piece of economic and political agitprop is the historical line traced back to the Fifties when life was relatively comfortable college and medical care were affordable through the Eighties when President Reagan turned the country over to the corporations and the consummate evil yuppie character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's Wall Street declared Greed is good. Since then as Moore rapidly points out the wealth has been gobbled up more and more by the few at the top the middle class has been ravaged and the poor have become more numerous.If capitalism as an old Fifties instructional film here intones is our American way of life then how come it's failing to serve so many Americans? At this point it would have been much better if Moore had been less resolutely U.S.centric Felperin  because capitalist economies exist in other countries alongside systems of social services alongside socialist benefits for the many. It's not so much simply capitalism that is killing us has not communism been proved a failure or at least unrealizable in the real world? but the cruel Darwinian selfish doordie form of it that's practiced in America. Greed is not good. As Moore does point out repeatedly ordinary and poor Americans have been hoodwinked by propagandists for American capitalism into thinking that the system is okay however heartless and imbalanced because they might hit the jackpot themselves someday. As Moore says ordinary Americans are beginning to realize that just ain't true.".

Also important if underdeveloped in this complicated effective piece of economic and political agitprop is the historical line traced back to the Fifties when life was relatively comfortable college and medical care were affordable through the Eighties when President Reagan turned the country over to the corporations and the consummate evil yuppie character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's Wall Street declared Greed is good. Since then as Moore rapidly points out the wealth has been gobbled up more and more by the few at the top the middle class has been ravaged and the poor have become more numerous.If capitalism as an old Fifties instructional film here intones is our American way of life then how come it's failing to serve so many Americans? At this point it would have been much better if Moore had been less resolutely U.S.centric Felperin  because capitalist economies exist in other countries alongside systems of social services alongside socialist benefits for the many. It's not so much simply capitalism that is killing us has not communism been proved a failure or at least unrealizable in the real world? but the cruel Darwinian selfish doordie form of it that's practiced in America. Greed is not good. As Moore does point out repeatedly ordinary and poor Americans have been hoodwinked by propagandists for American capitalism into thinking that the system is okay however heartless and imbalanced because they might hit the jackpot themselves someday. As Moore says ordinary Americans are beginning to realize that just ain't true.";

	schema:reviewBody "He took on our nation's obsession with guns in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. He took on the politics of BushCheney fear mongering in FAHRENHEIT 911. He even took on the health care insurance industry in SICKO. And once more the tenacious rabblerouser from Flint Michigan Michael Moore takes on the powersthatbe in a cinematic broadside that needs to be seenCAPITALISM A LOVE STORY.In this new opus from the man who has always gotten under the skin of the nattering nabobs of negativity on the Far Right Moore posits some very chilling questions about our system of Capitalism Is it really intrinsically evil? Should it be abolished? And he does so with the kind of simmering populist outrage that has been his stockintrade since his 1989 breakthrough ROGER AND ME which is in fact part of the archival footage he uses here. In it he details how America's financial system got overheated by deregulation and predatory loan practices that struck at the heart of the poor and middle class the ones who actually make up the heart and soul of America and who are always the most vulnerable leaving the rich to walk away with billions in taxpayer bailout money. It also shows us how corporate greed far from enriching our lives has actually corroded them and subsequently corroded our political system so that the villains of this whole scheme are the same ones that buy off our elected representatives to sit there and save their sorry behinds.But for each horror story he tells us and there are many make no mistake there are stirring examples of common people standing up against the faceless corporate bullies and exercising their democratic rights what a novel concept! homeowners in Miami who refuse to budge from a foreclosed home union workers in Chicago who refuse to leave their place of employment a manufacturer of doors and windows even after Bank of America has foreclosed people in Congress who have finally had enough and scream BULLST! to the corporate interests.All of this may seem like Moore is going to his usual excessive lengths to make his point particularly when it comes to the idea of abolishing the capitalist framework altogethera pipe dream if ever there was one. But when doing a satirical documentary like this a little excess can go a long way to expose some hidden truths about our country and the fact that Moore exposes truths that we either disagree with or don't want to know about inevitably makes him a target for blind followers of the Far Right and the PalinMcCainJoe The Plumber sect whom Moore once again is able to skewer with their own words. And he doesn't go so easy on Bill Clinton's administration either as several members of that administration themselves were involved in setting up the selffulfilling prophecy that led to the nearcomplete collapse of the American economy in 2008.It was Michael Douglas' character Gordon Gekko who in Oliver Stone's hardhitting 1987 film WALL STREET said to the audience at a stockholders' meeting Greed for lack of a better word is good. Greed works! Well as CAPITALISM A LOVE STORY shows just the opposite is true. It is unrestrained greed and unrestrained fear that pushed America to the brink of total economic meltdown. And it is those same elements that have led Moore to the conclusion that Capitalism is evil. If he is wrong in his conclusion then it is unfortunately not by much. And that is why CAPITALISM A LOVE STORY should be seen. We may not be able to abolish the capitalist system that has kept America a world power but unless we do fundamental things now to place regulations on those that profit from greed fear and predatory behavior then America may one day in the future go over the edge into the abyss with no hope to recover its lost greatness.".

Michael Moore has a knack for blending humor with tragedy.However this is a pseudodocumentary more like video oped about politics economics and modern American culture. So I have to judge it also based on the arguments presented. As such it's just a B.The problem with this movie is while it does expose 'the haves' for their excesses corruption and greed it doesn't turn the same camera on the protagonists in this film  'the havenots.' Consider the case of the family who is being evicted from their house even being paid to essentially work as the cleaning crew for their foreclosure. The father describes how their mortgage payment went from 1700 to I believe over 2500. Moore fails to illustrate the fact that this couple had clearly signed up for an ARM  adjustable rate mortgage. They had the opportunity to lock in a fixed rate and chose otherwise. In this case as in thousands of cases around the country the homeowner has chosen to gamble no differently than the Wall Street folks Moore condemns. He could argue that mortgage brokers didn't give its customers the best advice. But that's like saying a car salesman didn't explain to me the benefits of owning a hatchback. They are all just salesmen. Only a lazy consumer listens and follows everything a salesman says.Further while discussing how the Reagon era brought some terrible economic changes not the least of which was increased consumer debt he never explores why normal people decided to rack up that debt on unnecessary consumer purchases. Lenders can only be blamed for so much. Predatory lending? Sure. But even if they gave out 0 home equity loans and credit cards it wouldn't address the fact that people were living beyond their means. No one saved. And you can't blame any bank for that.Moore's exposure of the inherent corruption involved with the bailout bill passed just this past November was excellent and by far the highlight of the film. Not to discount the human element of the earlier scenes but his account of just how deeply involved currentformer Goldman Sachs executives where in the construction and execution of this bill really illustrates his core argument that 'the haves' are able to steal from the 'havenots' with little to no repercussion.Nevertheless his conclusion and that of several featured clergymen that capitalism is inherently evil is false. Unregulated capitalism perhaps. But unregulated anything can be evil. Capitalism is actually more democratic than our democracy. Remember we are a republic. We don't vote on issues  we vote for people who vote on issues. But capitalism allows everyone the ability to make a profit equally though it can be argued that access to education and credit may not be. Similarly we each have a power as a consumer to vote with our dollars. This is something Moore failed to delve into  the idea that a consumer is actually more powerful than a voter. Anyone could decide tomorrow to stop shopping at WalMart. It would be almost impossible for any organizationcorporationgovernment to corrupt this simple relationship. You can pay off politicians. But you can't really force people to pay someone for goodsservices if they don't want to. Even with all their wealth the top 1 can't make up much more than 5 of consumer spending. In this respect they are economically powerless.Capitalism is not the problem. Corruption is. Moore asks the question what would Jesus think of capitalism? I think he would be indifferent. Socioeconomic systems are just tools to be used. It's like asking what he'd think about knives. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want anyone to stab each other. But it'd be nice to have when making a meal. Of course he'd be disappointed by the sight of someone losing their house. But I think he'd be equally disappointed in the people who have lost the home. Greed is not a luxury of the rich. It's practiced by normal working people everyday.".

Actually I come from Europe but I'm not a socialist either!I just finished watching this and I was thinking when is this going to end it's just way too long. As I like watching good documentaries I thought this was a very bad documentary! There were nearly no facts presented and it felt kinda awkward a lot of the time. Their were a lot of emotions in it watching poor people lose their homes lose their jobs or getting screwed by idiots example the corrupt judge. Yeah sure you need to feel sorry about them with all the rhetoric Michael Moore uses and all the drama he builds up who doesn't feel bad for them!? But assuming it was the fault of capitalism is just pure bullshit! And that some people worship money more than anything else and are greedy as hell hasn't a thing to do with capitalism! It's the nature of some people that behave like this. Also the American culture provides the perfect breeding ground for things like this to happen. So it's the fault of the society that these things happen and not capitalism! Let me give you another example in very socialistic countries like Venezuela you also have greed corruption and an very elite top that have control and power over the majority. I don't want to defend capitalism or anything but to make it short... Every system has it pro's and con's there is no perfect system out there but capitalism is as good as it gets. It's the society politicians media culture education and the people who make the difference! That is also the problem of this documentary you can see and feel that Michael Moore made this documentary with a clear goal in his mind To defame capitalism by any means possible. And that is not how one should make a documentary! You can have your opinion but you should stay neutral and let the audience make up its own opinion rather than shoving your agenda down peoples throat. I think this documentary becomes more awkward the more the time passes... For example he more than ones stated that capitalism is now over because of the financial crisis and with Obama now being president we leave capitalism and everything bad behind us and America will become the social happyland! I was thinking WTF nothing much has changed! Yes we had an economic downturn but as soon as business is up on its feet again everything will be back as before and a lot of people will worship money and praise capitalism again... Nothing has changed! Thats why I say it's society not the system but Michael Moore doesn't understand that concept! Instead he is using emotions and polemic to make a point! He for example asked some priests and a bishop what they think about capitalism and what Jesus would think about capitalism. Their answer was for example capitalism is evil and he continued and showed a short film about a capitalist version of Jesus where Jesus uses all the clichs of greed and capitalism. WTF!? These are not arguments this is bullshit! Since when does it matter what a priest thinks!? Yes the priest can have his opinion but this doesn't make it an argument against capitalism. At the end of the movie he showed the pictures of New Orleans after Katrina with sad music in the background and said Why is it always the poor who have to suffer the misery? Why isn't Madoff up on the roof screaming for help? Or the head of Citibank? etc etc... Yeah that is the kind of juxtaposition Michael Moore uses to brainwash the audience. What does Katrina have to do with capitalism? And why not stick with the truth? The people stuck in the NYC World Trade Center on 9112001 screaming for help or jumping out of the window out of desperation were not what I would call poor people... And these kind of arguments and bullshit continues to the whole movie so why is Michael Moore doing this?? Because he cannot argument on an intellectual level and thats why he uses emotions drama juxtaposition and polemic to get his point down. This is not what I call a documentary it's more like a conspiracy or propaganda movie. If anybody wants to see a well made documentary about the financial crisis on an intellectual level I would recommend watching the 3 part series of BBC called the The Love of Money.".

	schema:headline " Moore holds back nothing";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Moore's latest feature Capitalism A Love Story has everything I could want from one of his films a hotly debated and relevant issue information personal accounts funny clips and great music. I enjoy seeing his films not so much to be informed which I feel he does quite well but to be entertained. That is something rare with a documentary. I don't think you can say the same about An Inconvenient Truth.Love him or hate him Moore makes a fantastic film. This time he takes one the recent economic turmoil this country has been facing for the past year or so. Moore traces it's roots back to the Reagan administration on up. He presents a lot of facts memos and documents some companies and banks would not like us to see but he does it because the people have a right to know.I can't say much about what went on because Moore presents a lot of data but to the best of my ability I can say that there is an awful lot of shady activity going on behind closed doors. We look at the bail out plan proposed to congress. We see how companies like Goldman Sachs infiltrates the government and starts doing their own bidding. We see companies spend their money frivolously while workers and homeowners are losing their jobs and livelihood. Some of these banks and groups do terrible things that force people into uncomfortable and downright oppressive situations.One thing I expected to see from this film was Moore perspective and nothing else. I don't know what information he is withholding and what truths he is stretching but I am impressed with how convincing some of his arguments and testimonials are. He plays on our heartstrings like a trained musician hitting home with issues involving blue collar Americans struggling to keep their jobs their homes and their families together.Aside from the content of the film the actual film itself is very well put together. He makes excellent use of stock footage from the 50s and 60s weaving them perfectly to fit the film's flow. One thing Moore does better than most is his use of music to drive home a point or a feeling. Be it classical rock or country Moore blends it all together quite nicely.This film makes you think. It makes you angry. It makes you want to do something and that's okay. That is what a film is supposed to do. It is designed to evoke some sort of emotion and help spring it forth. That's not to say you should go out and do something drastic but it will at least make for excellent conversation amongst friends and coworkers.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michael Moore's latest feature Capitalism A Love Story has everything I could want from one of his films a hotly debated and relevant issue information personal accounts funny clips and great music. I enjoy seeing his films not so much to be informed which I feel he does quite well but to be entertained. That is something rare with a documentary. I don't think you can say the same about An Inconvenient Truth.Love him or hate him Moore makes a fantastic film. This time he takes one the recent economic turmoil this country has been facing for the past year or so. Moore traces it's roots back to the Reagan administration on up. He presents a lot of facts memos and documents some companies and banks would not like us to see but he does it because the people have a right to know.I can't say much about what went on because Moore presents a lot of data but to the best of my ability I can say that there is an awful lot of shady activity going on behind closed doors. We look at the bail out plan proposed to congress. We see how companies like Goldman Sachs infiltrates the government and starts doing their own bidding. We see companies spend their money frivolously while workers and homeowners are losing their jobs and livelihood. Some of these banks and groups do terrible things that force people into uncomfortable and downright oppressive situations.One thing I expected to see from this film was Moore perspective and nothing else. I don't know what information he is withholding and what truths he is stretching but I am impressed with how convincing some of his arguments and testimonials are. He plays on our heartstrings like a trained musician hitting home with issues involving blue collar Americans struggling to keep their jobs their homes and their families together.Aside from the content of the film the actual film itself is very well put together.

Each of these could be democratic in that the people get to vote for laws policies and actions of their government.Capitalism is often linked to free enterprise conflating it with freedom. It's really about the right to own property and make money from exploitation of the work of others. It is built on a system of credit and interest charged for capital and money.Communism has not private ownership of factories and the means of production and no interest or credit. Presumably the economy is run by and for the people not the managers or owners of the means of production.Socialism is also has the means of production owned by the state which is the people. The state provides for rights such as housing health care a job and education.And then there are mixed economies as well. Moore's film underscores the immoral nature of capitalism which places wealth over human needs. he shows how the system has been rigged for the wealthy who always come out on top don't even play fairly and have workers believing that the system will reward them for hard work. But he shows this is a lie.His point is that is 95 voted they could turn the system into a just one. He's an optimist on that. The public has few options in elections and they are consistently gamed and stolen and government officials accept LEGAL bribes from anyone so their constituency is the ones with the most money not the ones with the most votes.".

	schema:headline " Weak arguments and misleading information";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Moore's film Capitalism A love story is a twohour critique of capitalism. This is nothing new from Moore though it's his first sustained critique of capitalism. Unfortunately and this is a major problem Moore doesn't really have a clear understanding of what capitalism is. The US is a mixed economy. It is a mixture of capitalism and socialism. The government owns and controls parts of the economy to some extent or other. Thus when things go bad economically it's not always capitalism's fault. Moore doesn't understand this. He doesn't know what crony capitalism or corporatism are. He talks about the bank bailouts and seems to think this is capitalism. He gives a perfect example of crony capitalism with the Friends of Angelo program at Countrywide. He thinks these are capitalism because they involve private companies. He shows us other private companies where workers get to vote on company policies or private companies run as coops and seems to think that this is somehow not capitalism. He waffles on regulation at times criticizing deregulation then saying that you just can't regulate capitalism because it's evil. His evidence is some theologians that say it's evil because it doesn't provide for the needs of everyone. Of course while these theologians are talking to Moore they're not providing help to the poor and downtrodden. Does that make them evil? Does the fact that capitalism encourages charitable donations mean anything? They seem to be setting up an arbitrarily high standard for capitalism which they can't themselves live up to.Moore wants to show how things are just getting worse in this country as capitalism further encroaches but he only has anecdotal examples. The poor in this country live better than the middle class in most countries throughout the world throughout history they have electricity clean water heat ac tvs cell phones cars wardrobes of clothing electronics computers internet and so on. And that's the poor. The poor used to starve to death and still do in many countries now we have an obesity crisis. Everyone's standard of living continues to improve due to capitalism. Is that evil?The arguments mostly rely on misleading information and insinuation rather than any serious exploration of facts. A good example is the case of the airline pilots. He looks at how poorly paid these local commuter pilots are. The reason of course is because they're on the lowest rung of the ladder flying short cheap flights. Careercast.com says that the average salary for a pilot in 2010 is 115000. Those greedy airlines are really squeezing those pilots. This might explain why Moore's implication that poor wages lead to more poor airline safety is unfounded. At the time of deregulation of the airline industry in the late 70s the number of airline fatalities peaked. That is after deregulation as the number of people flying was increasing rapidly total fatalities were still decreasing. The most dangerous airline in the country is Comair which has recorded 3 fatal crashes in 25 years out of a total of 5.54 million flights. Moore would say those accidents must have been caused by greed leading companies to short on safety. Actually the four world airlines with the worst safety record are all state owned Cubana Airlines China Airlines Pakistan Airlines and Iranian Airlines. Cubana airlines in fact had 8 fatal accidents in the past 25 years on only 320000 flights. Moore also clearly doesn't understand many of the issues he discusses. For example he talks about derivatives and claims they're just sophisticated gambling though he admits he doesn't understand them. But there are plenty of people who do understand them and what they'll tell you is that derivatives are a way for companies to share risk. The companies let other people buy up some of their risk so that they can reduce their exposure. The investors share potential profits or losses. It's a system that tends to produce more stability in a market one need just look at the erratic prices of the onion market the only agricultural market without futures trading for a good example. The derivatives can get complicated depending on the nature of what they cover. Could Moore seriously not find an economist who could explain this?In fact when he says he wants to end capitalism and replace it with democracy he really shows his ignorance. Capitalism is an economic system and democracy is a political system. It's possible to have one the other either or both. They're independent. In fact he brought Stephen Moore on the only person he brought on with any economics training who rightly pointed out that democracy has not historically overall led to greater prosperity improved living conditions or improved human rights. It's controversial but there's evidence to back this up. But capitalism does bring these consistently and unambiguously. You'd totally expect Michael Moore to try to refute this or even just respond somehow but he doesn't. He just moves on to talking about how capitalism is not guaranteed by the constitution which is inaccurate capitalism means private ownership which is protected by the 4th and 5th amendments not to mention the commerce clause in article I. By saying he wants to replace capitalism with democracy he avoids the important question if capitalism is so bad what do we replace it with? Every system is imperfect but what's the alternative? Should we adopt FDR's Second Bill of Rights? Is that better? Among those rights is the guarantee of a job. The Teacher Unions have effectively won that right by making it almost impossible to fire a public school teacher but it's led to declining quality of education. Doesn't that violate that other right to good education? It's easy to talk in the abstract about how great something would be until you actually have to put it in practice.".

	schema:headline " the kind of useful plea and battle cry that you can either take or leave";
	schema:reviewBody "What is Capitalism? How do we define it in the 21st century? How did we define it even fifty years ago when America appeared to be riding high and the middle class did quite well without foreign competitors without those you know other countries in Europe and Asia working at full capacity? How is it a moral issue for someone to be fully invested no pun intended in a system that requires that high profits be continually maintained? How about most importantly when a system that Churchill once said was simply the least evil one available corrupts people's lives systems of government and one's own immortal soul? More to the point what would Jesus do? If you ask Michael Moore or for that matter one of Moore's priests he interviewed for this documentary he would not quite fit in the corporate world. At all. Unless they redub King of Kings that is.These and many more questions are asked by Moore in his latest film perhaps even more ambitious and powerful than Fahrenheit 911. He cites Ronald Regan as one of the key contributors maybe the key one in politicaltheatrical terms to how Capitalism is today as he gives a speech early on with the CEO of MerrylLynch right by his side feeding him coaching ontape. But it's really many other things that have just gone wild from the seeds of Regan's corporate freeforall that let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and jobs are lost as profits keep gaining. This latter point stems from Moore's first movie Roger  Me and in many ways this is an epic revisit that shouldn't have to be but is of the things Moore was tackling back then with GM's closing of plants in Flynt Michigan. By now things are completely out of control and the set pieces in Capitalism A Love Story all make up a narrative of abhorrent greed and corporate irresponsibility... perhaps that isn't even a hard enough word for some of the things shown here.From the judge who puts away juveniles to a prison in WilkesBarre PA that is run by a corporation that gives big kickbacks to the judge that makes its young misdemeanor offenders into pieces of property to a gutwrenching account of Dead Peasants which means that your boss having filed a life insurance policy with their big corporate owner will get paid the sooner you die to the horror of airline pilot pay brought up by noneother than Sully the hero pilot to just the simple use of the word 'derivative' and how incomprehensible it is to nonHarvard graduates it all adds up. It's all presented with some sense of sarcasm but always with a pill of truth sometimes with people still dumbfounded by their foreclosed homes or those husbands and family members of the Peasants. It's not that Moore is up to anything completely new in terms of his style.

	onyx:emotionText "What is Capitalism? How do we define it in the 21st century? How did we define it even fifty years ago when America appeared to be riding high and the middle class did quite well without foreign competitors without those you know other countries in Europe and Asia working at full capacity? How is it a moral issue for someone to be fully invested no pun intended in a system that requires that high profits be continually maintained? How about most importantly when a system that Churchill once said was simply the least evil one available corrupts people's lives systems of government and one's own immortal soul? More to the point what would Jesus do? If you ask Michael Moore or for that matter one of Moore's priests he interviewed for this documentary he would not quite fit in the corporate world. At all. Unless they redub King of Kings that is.These and many more questions are asked by Moore in his latest film perhaps even more ambitious and powerful than Fahrenheit 911. He cites Ronald Regan as one of the key contributors maybe the key one in politicaltheatrical terms to how Capitalism is today as he gives a speech early on with the CEO of MerrylLynch right by his side feeding him coaching ontape. But it's really many other things that have just gone wild from the seeds of Regan's corporate freeforall that let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and jobs are lost as profits keep gaining. This latter point stems from Moore's first movie Roger  Me and in many ways this is an epic revisit that shouldn't have to be but is of the things Moore was tackling back then with GM's closing of plants in Flynt Michigan. By now things are completely out of control and the set pieces in Capitalism A Love Story all make up a narrative of abhorrent greed and corporate irresponsibility... perhaps that isn't even a hard enough word for some of the things shown here.From the judge who puts away juveniles to a prison in WilkesBarre PA that is run by a corporation that gives big kickbacks to the judge that makes its young misdemeanor offenders into pieces of property to a gutwrenching account of Dead Peasants which means that your boss having filed a life insurance policy with their big corporate owner will get paid the sooner you die to the horror of airline pilot pay brought up by noneother than Sully the hero pilot to just the simple use of the word 'derivative' and how incomprehensible it is to nonHarvard graduates it all adds up. It's all presented with some sense of sarcasm but always with a pill of truth sometimes with people still dumbfounded by their foreclosed homes or those husbands and family members of the Peasants. It's not that Moore is up to anything completely new in terms of his style. Indeed its the kind of film that takes into account Moore's personal history which he's done in the past if not quite as informative i.e. his original intentions to be a priest while showing how things have changed for him in the twenty years he's been doing this one guy he tries to ask a question with responds Stop making movies!

That being said I also have to disclose I have two business degrees including the coveted MBA. So is this a good movie well unfortunately no. This is not the capitalist pig that dwells within me speaking but a lover of good movie making speaking out. The second half of this movie was timely and in general pretty good the first half was uneven and at times a little stupid. The worst scene in the entire movie came just before the movie started to pick up steam. It involved a family who both the husband and wife worked at walmart. Walmart had taken out a small life insurance policy on the guys wife I am assuming to offset rehiring costs in case she died but Michael Moore slanted it to almost look like walmart killed this poor woman. Or at the very least hoped she would die so they would get a big payout. They had the whole white trash family gathered around the dinner table crying for their mom all the while implying walmart was evil and to blame. If you are going to attack walmart do it on unfair wages or supporting Chinese goods made in poor work conditions with no environmental standards not complete bull pucky. Well that was a rant. Which is what Michael Moore at least inspires in people on both sides. That is what I like about him but not this movie I say skip it.".

	schema:headline " Moore an easy target for the ignorant";
	schema:reviewBody "Why does IMDb allow a brownnosing AynRandian GOPer to write the featured summary of Moore's film? There is no indication that this person has even seen the film which only came out the day I am writing this. Critics of Moore of the Democratic Party of leftists Marxists Socialists Maoists Stalinists defenders of civil liberties intellectuals all these groups bundled into one ball by the Fox Newsers and well any group that doesn't just LOVE the glories of interplanetary cutthroat capitalism just want to jump down the readers' throats from the getgo shutting off the discussion that is so crucial to a democracy like ours in theory. Why does IMDb allow such a soapbox to someone who is so clearly ignorant of hisher subject matter i.e. Moore's documentary? I by the way have mixed views on Moore but I mostly feel positive about him. He is positively NOT fair and balanced to quote the most cynical of slogans heralded by the most cynical of cable news outlets. Moore is clearly a propagandist. He by and large preaches to the choir just as Sean Hannity does. But Moore is much more talentedand funnythan Hannity and his ilk and he has deep down an infinitely stronger sense of humanity than the Fox News crowd. I don't hate capitalism but it could sure be improved scaled back and regulated. Unregulated capitalism  piracy not freedom! I agree with Moore that Reagan did some awful things to this country most of all his production of policies favoring the rich and hurting the poor and middle class. Sadly there are many middle class people and even some poor who don't realize that the policies of the Reaganitespushed even further to the right by Reagan's heirsdo NOT benefit but in fact hurt them. The middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate and this shrinkage is not the result of the policies of Carter Clinton and Obama though they are not free from a bit of blame but the policies of Reagan and the Bushes.

	onyx:emotionText "Why does IMDb allow a brownnosing AynRandian GOPer to write the featured summary of Moore's film? There is no indication that this person has even seen the film which only came out the day I am writing this. Critics of Moore of the Democratic Party of leftists Marxists Socialists Maoists Stalinists defenders of civil liberties intellectuals all these groups bundled into one ball by the Fox Newsers and well any group that doesn't just LOVE the glories of interplanetary cutthroat capitalism just want to jump down the readers' throats from the getgo shutting off the discussion that is so crucial to a democracy like ours in theory. Why does IMDb allow such a soapbox to someone who is so clearly ignorant of hisher subject matter i.e. Moore's documentary? I by the way have mixed views on Moore but I mostly feel positive about him. He is positively NOT fair and balanced to quote the most cynical of slogans heralded by the most cynical of cable news outlets. Moore is clearly a propagandist. He by and large preaches to the choir just as Sean Hannity does. But Moore is much more talentedand funnythan Hannity and his ilk and he has deep down an infinitely stronger sense of humanity than the Fox News crowd. I don't hate capitalism but it could sure be improved scaled back and regulated. Unregulated capitalism  piracy not freedom! I agree with Moore that Reagan did some awful things to this country most of all his production of policies favoring the rich and hurting the poor and middle class. Sadly there are many middle class people and even some poor who don't realize that the policies of the Reaganitespushed even further to the right by Reagan's heirsdo NOT benefit but in fact hurt them. The middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate and this shrinkage is not the result of the policies of Carter Clinton and Obama though they are not free from a bit of blame but the policies of Reagan and the Bushes. To inform us all of this curious turn that has occurred over the past 30 years Moore is very much on target. We should heed his words even if they are not completely fair. Who says he HAS to be fair anyway? He doesn't CLAIM to be fair and balanced. He tells the truthnot the whole truth but a crucial part of it that is tragically ignored by the socalled liberal media.

The human cast however perform wonderfully in providing the light framework required to string Beethoven's scenes together.

Much less a monster dog who only drools and sheds and eats.So if you enjoy dogs and lighthearted fun Beethoven won't disappoint. There are no Machiavellian plots or cruel content. The family is wonderfully good the villains are comically bad and the suspense of their threat is enjoyable because you know Beethoven's gonna win in the end.Overall very charming with a good wholesome sense of humor. 6.5 out of 10.".

I think a lot has been built up on this film just because there were some sequel spinoffs that were more than horrible. The 3rd and 4th sequels with Judge Reinhold were some of the worst attempts at comedy. Ever. But the original was a nice familyfriendly film that accomplishes what it promised.Charles Grodin plays George Newton Family man businessman NOT a doggyman. But things change rapidly when a runaway Saint Bernard named Beethoven comes to the Newton residence. Newton's children immediately get attached to the animal but Grodin's character doesn't exactly like the fact of a big ol' slobbering dog being around his house. So there are some gags as Grodin gets mad at Beethoven for certain things he does throughout the film. But then evil animal vet Dean Jones tries to take Beethoven and Newton decides to fight back for his family and bring the doggy back home.Beethoven isn't anything very original and it isn't anything very memorable nor is it excellent quality gags. But it's a surprisingly pleasant and goodnatured family film that doesn't resort to crude humor or language like other socalled family films out there.Ivan Reitman who has brought us Ghostbusters Kindergarten Cop and Stripes coproduced this film. He's a talented director even if he sometimes makes average films. The thing about his films are that even when they're average they are still pretty funny and strangely watchable. And though I'm not sure what all a producer does on a film I think he probably did a good job with something on this film. Charles Grodin is one of those actors that I've always liked because he seems very downtoearth and regular. He is a subtle comedian that never goes OTT and doesn't come off like ANOTHER Jerry LewisJim Carrey hybrid.Beethoven isn't anything great but it's strangely likable and enjoyable. When compared to other socalled family films it's pretty nice. It doesn't skimp on the gags even if they're not very great and it never turns stupid like the 3rd and 4th film.

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have no idea what this movie is about they may think this is a movie about the famous classical music artist. Well it has absolutely nothing to do with it. Beethoven is not even a biographical or a musical it's a family movie about a St. Bernard named Beethoven after a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is played and the puppy barks at the same time as if he was telling how he wishes to be named.Anyway generally speaking this is a sympathetic family movie. Nothing super or tremendous but a simple and enjoyable movie. Of course the lovable St. Bernard is the main star and adds a lot to the movie. And anyone who loves dogs has got to love this gentle giant if not the movie.I am a dog lover and St. Bernards are one of my favorite dog breeds. They're huge beautiful affectionate and sweet dogs although they drool at lot!The story focus not only on our fluffy friend but also on the Newton family George the father Alice the mother Ryce the oldest daughter Ted the middle son and Emily the youngest daughter. They're a nice family but George isn't minimally interested in the dog unlike the rest of the family although much later in the film he has a change of heart and helps saving the day. Ryce... what kind of name is that? I hope it's not related to rice the food. Emily is a lovely little girl and the cutest of the Newtons. Ryce despite being so thin is pretty in this film and I don't think she is a tomboy.All the actors who play the Newton family are good in their roles Charles Grodin Bonnie Hunt Nicholle Tom Cristopher Castile and Sarah Rose Karr. And of course the dog that plays Beethoven is also a great actor.One word about Charles Grodin although he was in his late 50's when the movie was made he looked as if he was about 35. Amazing how someone that age can look so young.In the cast there is also an actor who is familiar from some old liveaction Disney films Dean Jones. Here he portrays a villain  the wicked veterinarian Dr. Varnick owner of a Porsche 911. His role is small nevertheless he's in great shape. Actually his role is meant to be minor. I don't think it would be necessary to make his role bigger.".

So what do they do in return? They yell at him treat him wrongly and when he tries to get rid of their dog for completely legitimate reasons the kids think he's a dogkiller and his wife complains 'all the joy is left from the house'. If anything 'Beethoven' is the story of a man abused and mistreaten. There I said it.Let's begin with the beginning though. 'Beethoven' is a dog in case you didn't know yet wandering the streets of some suburban clean cut picked fenced community where life is nice and rich and even the bullies have their certain charm. Beethoven winds up in the big house of the Newtons where the three kids pubertygirl Ryce nerdy boy Ted and sweet young Emily embrace him with all they've got as probably there isn't any 'joy' in the family at that time. What better way to bring it than a dog!But Beethoven isn't just fun as he pies all over the place drewls on the food and drags mud all over the expensive carpets. You guessed who can clean up the mess it's old daddyo George as the spoilt kids only want to have fun with the animal. So we see him as a matchmaker between Ryce and the boy she likes as Ted's saviour against bullies and as hero of little Emily who almost drowned when not attended by her babysitter.George as I said is busy with his work. He's got a company of his own something to do with airrefresheners in cars or whatever who is on the brink of a crucial deal which will expand his business. But he is being conned. Enter a crucial scene nobody knows he's being conned by his two business partners except 'Beethoven' yes people this dog knows how to read those little words at the bottom of a contract. So he takes the two evil genuises for a ride basicly ruining the deal. Now WE know Beethoven did well but as far as George his wife or the kids are concerned 'Beethoven' just cost them a serious amound of dollars. But never mind as wife and mother Alice says 'I never liked those two anyway'. If that would've been her spirit over all those years the family probably would've lived in some trailerpark somewhere without a pot to pie in and regulars on the 'Jerry Springer' show. But as long as we the audience know that Beethoven really saved the family we're supposed to be OK with it. Well for one I'm not!There's another story in here involving 'mean guys' as Beethoven's vet thinks he will be perfect for some sick experiment involving exploding bullets so the vet pretends he was attacked by Beethoven so that he can bring him to his secret lab. The same problem here occurs as in the previous scene WE know the vet is mean. WE know Beethoven meant well. But the family DOESN'T. So when the kids as I mentioned before say dad is a dogkiller and mom thinks all the joy has just left their lives take THAT you mean father! that is just cruel and unjust. As for all THEY know 'Beethoven' is a pretentious danger for the kids. In particular the mom should know better!Now you'll probably say it's a kids movie and maybe you're right but this movie is sending all the wrong messages into the world and should be slammed for it. Only the decent acting by Grodin who was 57 when this was made... he looks more like 37! and some sweet puppies make it worth the 310 I gave it.".

Surprising to see Dean Jones playing a bad guy.For the most part this is a gentle inoffensive story. It got a little gross sometimes with Beethoven slobbering all over everything and urinating in George's briefcase but I guess that's just kid humor of the nineties. I still don't know why they had to name him Beethoven. Just because he barked when she played BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH on the piano? Maybe he was trying to tell her something.

He does have an instinct for sorting out some bad people and dealing with them. The kids get it the parents don't.Dean Jones is the villain here a veterinarian who 'kills' his charges but secretly uses them for mad scientist like experimentation. Jones who was the all American hero in so many Disney films in the 60s and 70s looks like he's having a great old time as the Snidely Whiplash of scientists. He's got a pair of mooks for henchmen in Michael Tucci and Oliver Platt. In the old days they'd be played by Allen Jenkins and Edward Brophy.This movie has little kids and a big dog in it.

Beethoven makes his way into the house of the Newton family immediately endearing himself to the children Nicholle Tom Christopher Castile Sarah Rose Karr and wife  mother Bonnie Hunt. The dad Charles Grodin is another story. He's not a real dog person but reluctantly agrees to take on the pup as a pet. In your typical Hollywood fashion havoc ensues as the puppy grows into the destructive messy but also very loving big brute that Grodin knew would result. The main plot concerns a thoroughly evil veterinarian Dean Jones in a hilarious performance who collects dogs for test purposes.Watching this as an adult you can see the flaws more clearly. Sometimes this is genuinely groan inducing sometimes predictably silly. You can tell that cowriter John Hughes who uses his pseudonym of Edmond Dantes was still getting Home Alone out of his system. It's also easier to sympathize with George even though Grodin brilliantly portrays him as a fastidious grump who craves order in his life. He actually makes his family get up at seven in the morning on Saturdays. Another word of advice is that this isn't totally harmless some people not just the younger children might find certain scenes objectionable.Overall though Beethoven is passable family entertainment without being exceptional in any way. It may hit you where you live however if you're a dog person like this viewer. The perfectly cast Grodin is well supported by a cast that also includes TV stars David Duchovny and Patricia Heaton as a snotty yuppie couple and familiar character players like OLan Jones Nancy Fish and Richard Portnow. A 10 year old Joseph GordonLevitt makes his film debut as a schoolchild. It's particularly fun to see Jones playing the raspy voiced bad guy. Beethoven himself is quite engaging and sweet some of the best scenes here have him making little journeys around town.Followed by a mind boggling SIX sequels.Seven out of 10.".

Her German cousin Albert is encouraged to court her for solely political motives but following her accession at age eighteen finds he is falling for her and is dismayed at her reliance on trusty Prime Minister Melbourne. Victoria is impressed by Albert's philanthropy which is akin to her own desire to help her subjects. However her loyalty to Melbourne perceived as a selfseeker almost causes a constitutional crisis and it is Albert who helps restore her selfconfidence. She proposes and they marry Albert proving himself not only a devoted spouse prepared to take an assassin's bullet for her but an agent of muchneeded reform finally endorsed by an admiring Melbourne.";

	schema:headline " A touching romance and a gripping human drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Apart from having the longest reign in British history 63 years Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was apart from our current Queen the oldest ever British monarch living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British as opposed to English or Scottish monarch coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in Mrs Brown. The Young Victoria tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal Sarah Duchess of York whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother the Duchess of Kent a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy who was widely rumoured to be her lover. According to one unfounded rumour he and not the late Duke of Kent was Victoria's natural father. The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance. Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of SaxeCoburg to which both he and Albert belonged. The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839 when supporters of the Tory Party which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasirepublican system of government with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified whereas Melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert for example was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life and Melbourne in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent who was his sisterinlaw but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a Regency Order the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830 which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a Danger! Major clich ahead! warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in Moulin Rouge.The main reason for the film's success however is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the blackclad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused but a determined strongminded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. With the exception of George III Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues. Blunt and Friend make The Young Victoria a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I'm glad that my grasp of English history is pathetically feeble. It makes movies like The Young Victoria much more suspenseful than they might otherwise be. I of course knew that Victoria reigned for a large part of the 19th century and that she died in 1901 I also knew that she was a renowned and powerful monarch. I didn't know much about her love life and The Young Victoria filled that gap in my knowledge nicely.Emily Blunt plays Victoria with a distinctly modern edge of feminism which may feel a bit anachronistic to picky historian purists but which also works. After all women like Victoria WERE the feminists of their time forced into making their mark in what was largely a man's world by a man's terms. I'm convinced that Blunt is one of the most promising of today's young actors. She has tremendous presence on screen while she's on it you don't want to look anywhere else. That presence is somewhat wasted in this movie because her biggest competition comes not from any other actors but from the period sets and costumes. But she gives this rather light and inconsequential film some substance by virtue of simply being in it.Rupert Friend plays Albert the man Victoria eventually marries while Paul Bettany plays her chief adviser and confidant the man angling to get himself married to her for his own political gain. The cast of British regulars also includes Jim Broadbent who gets crazier with every role he plays Miranda Richardson as Victoria's doormat of a mother and notable in a small role Harriet Walter as Victoria's widowed aunt and the only person other than her eventual husband who gives her any advice that's worth a damn.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Princess Victoria Emily Blunt is in line for the throne of England. The present King William Jim Broadbent is not well and may not live long. However Vicky's scheming mother The Duchess of Kent Miranda Richandson and her aide John Mark Strong want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the regents until she is older since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet when William does pass away shortly after her 21st birthday Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First she must surround herself with the right advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne Paul Bettany who although an older man is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not the young queen should select her future mate as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile in Germany some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert Rupert Friend of the SaxonCoburg dynasty is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But since he is a minor player on the map of royal matchmaking can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend too does well as do the other actors including Broadbent Richardson Bettany Strong what a repulsive role! and the rest. Also the movie is gorgeously shot costumed and set making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking it is an extra dose of dazzle as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic at times with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However this is only a minor minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short young and old should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront director JeanMarc Valle who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life Valle instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. Valle takes this and runs making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. Everything from the costume designs sets hair styles lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever overencumbering it. Indeed while watching Valle's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes' script. Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri's original work just as well.Yet for all the poignant compositions lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. Between the sweet budding romance of Victoria Emily Blunt and Albert Rupert Friend and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic nice to look at but dim underneath affair so common with these outings.In the end it's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria. It's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. Of course it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. Valle never seems to be striving for grandeur nor does he seem content at making a runofthemill escapist piece for aficionados. Somewhere within this gray middleground lies The Young Victoria sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions beautiful memorable but most of all human.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

	schema:headline " A warm and moving love story beautifully acted by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite some reviews being distinctly Lukewarm I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon' so what? It is good to see a warm touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy who was desperate to control the young Queen is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of Victoria as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England which prospered as never before under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.".

Here she competes with no one and does a nice job of carrying the film based on the early years of Queen Victoria. If you are rusty on your British sovereign history she ruled from 18371901.For 20 of these years she was married to her true love Prince Albert played well by Rupert Friend. While the two meet as youngsters the bond between them comes from their letters ... an early precursor to eHarmony?? We know Victoria mostly from royal portraits so it's nice to see her as a rebellious youngster trying to learn the tricks of the trade even while being manipulated like a pawn by her mother Miranda Richardson and her lover Mark Strong. We get to see her tenacity blossom as she matures and literally grows into the monarchy.While Ms. Blunt's performance is strong Julian Fellowes' writing is not at the level of his previous work in Gosford Park. We do get some of the same power plays but it is missing the nuances of that much better film.".

I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.Story wise it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.Overall The Young Victoria is a good film and it would have been even better if it was longer so that events could be properly explained without rush.".

	schema:reviewBody "The cinematic interests in the British monarchy continues with The Young Victoria 1837 to 1901 after having seen in recent years the efforts with Keira Knightley's The Duchess Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth films and Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman's take on the Boleyn sisters with The Other Boleyn Girl. More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death.Each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas ok so some may dispute Johansson or were the flavour of their moment and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured and in fact Elizabeth had enough to span two films. However The Young Victoria as the title already suggests is a liteversion of the young queen's life and if you're looking for that definitive event or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady selfserving politicians unfortunately there's nothing of depth here.That's not to say The Young Victoria is without. Directed by Canadian JeanMarc Vallee best known for CRAZY and written by Julian Fellowes this film chronicles in very plain terms the life and times of Victoria Emily Blunt soon becoming the new It girl when she was a child the troubles she faced before Coronation such as the eagerness of her mom The Duchess of Kent Miranda Richardson and her adviser Sir John Conroy Mark Strong to appoint themselves as jointRegent to her throne as already planned for by reigning King William Jim Broadbent. As if that wasn't enough the political power play enters the picture with Lord Melbourne Paul Bettany being a Prime Ministerinwaiting trying to gain the trust of the new Queen and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace. On one hand you'd understand the need for a young and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions but on the other are they really acting in her interests or in the interests of others?Even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with Prince Albert Rupert Friend where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film and pretty much everything already included in the trailers. For both they've been brought up under the influence of others and told each step of the way exactly what to do. Even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding and to do so with the help of each other. Instead of being pawns there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling and at times absurd rules and regulations. Trust also becomes a much valued commodity and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean.However all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative from childhood to romance marriage and children. In fact there's so much fastforwarding here especially the last few minutes filled with intertitles that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more and room of course for another movie which I suspect would probably not see the light of day but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response and come out with a miniseries or such. It's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of characterdefining adversary.With its starstudded cast one would expect more but one would be left wanting more instead. Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just came back from seeing The Young Victoria. What a beautiful movie! Despite some flaws I think it's probably the strongest costume drama we've had since 2006's Amazing Grace although unlike Amazing Grace I don't think it's going to become one of my favorites. Let me set out by stating my problem with the movie the pacing also a common criticism of AG but one that I considered unfounded in that instance. A large portion of it consists of a flashback and a very awkwardly set up flashback at that however even putting that sequence aside the narrative structure is just odd. The various scenes and plot threads just seem to be cobbled together without any dramatic purpose. But then again I caught myself thinking that this approachwhile questionable artisticallymight better reflect real life than a more typical scriptwritingediting job. The ending too doesn't feel particularly conclusive but again this seems to be a conscious decision. Whether these things sink the movie or not is debatable but they certainly distracted me.However The Young Victoria is also one of the best most human love stories I've seen on the screen in many years. If what it shows us is factual Victoria and Albert were a couple who really loved each other in every sense of the word in spite of each others' mistakes and in spite of the political maneuvering going on around them. Their refreshingly chaste courtship makes the intimacy they achieve in marriage that much more beautiful and satisfying many of the scenes during their honeymoon period are highly sensual without being explicitly sexual and the whole presentation just reeks of taste and class. But their relationship isn't idealized either. They fight rather bitterly at one point but make up later. This scene does go rather overthetop when Victoria accuses Albert for walking over her simply because she's a womana comment that seemed a little too modern in a movie that otherwise sticks close to the values of its period.Emily Blunt and Rupert Fiend do a beautiful job portraying this fascinating couple. Blunt manages to make Victoria a strong woman without falling into many of the standard Hollywood Strong Women clichs again she seems to be very much a woman of the period but one with her own moral convictions. Friend's performance is similarly refreshing. Too often men in period movies are so charismatic and in control that they don't seem quite real Friend's Albert on the other hand is timid quiet and has struggled with many of the same social inhibitions as Victoria. At the same time he never comes across as a ninny. Kudos to them both!The rest of the cast is quite strong with Paul Bettany Miranda Richardson Mark Strong and Harriet Walter all giving laudable performances but not star turns. This too is in keeping with the film it is Victoria and Albert whom we are supposed to remember. The costumes and cinematography are simply gorgeous and the soundtrack by Ilan Eshketi whom people may know from Stardust is going straight to the top of my wishlist.Recommended to all costume drama lovers.".

However it was actually my youngest daughter and her obsession with the British monarchy that got me to watch this film. I am happy to report that this film was far better than I expected as I usually HATE costume dramas because they are very dull and stuffywith way too much emphasis on clothing. The Young Victoria succeeds because it attempts to show the viewer insights into the personality of the princessnot just show you a series of events from her life that are recreated on screen.When the film begins Victoria is still a year from ascending to the throne. How her mother and her mother's lover attempt to manipulate her is the subject of the beginning of the film. However surprisingly who will manipulate and control her next seems to be the gist of the rest of the film. But as Victoria was a strong woman over time she learned to strike a balance and chart her own course. This was not without a few hiccups along the way however and a few of them are shown in the filmthough one of the more famous blunders of the period involving a dead ladyinwaiting is skippedmostly because the film just wasn't long enough to include this sticky business.Much of the last third of the film involves her marriage and learning to trust and rely on Albert to be her husband and confidant. I really liked this part of the film as the movie became amazingly romantic and touching. According to the movie Albert was one heck of a guyknowing that he died extremely prematurely made this all the more touching.All in all there is a lot to like in the filmeven if it DID take a few liberties with the truth. For example when an assassin tried to shoot his new bride Albert is shown shielding herwhich he DID do. However in this and two subsequent attempts by other maniacs Albert was NOT shot in the process! It made for better drama to have him shotbut it's just not true. But we sure wish it was!! By the way I'd sure like to see some followup films from this production companyperhaps the middle period of her reign would be a great subject for another filmthough I am sure a few would be turned off by how utterly sad such a film must be as her beloved Albert died at only age 42.".

By the way I'd sure like to see some followup films from this production companyperhaps the middle period of her reign would be a great subject for another filmthough I am sure a few would be turned off by how utterly sad such a film must be as her beloved Albert died at only age 42.";

The plot's political conspiracies are not deceptive enough to carry the story so tends to falter and the two love interests do not see enough of each other to make this film burn with passion. The decision to fictionalise parts of the story by allowing Prince Albert to get shot while trying to protect Victoria from an assassin just makes the flaws in the narrative all the more obvious. It is a shame because the cast is full of strong actors and the story of Queen Victoria and the era in which she reigned is fascinating. Personally I would like to have seen more of the intense desire and attraction that Albert and Victoria shared which produced nine children and led her to mourn his passing everyday for the 40 years that followed his death.Stunning costumes  tick. Gorgeous scenery  tick. Romance and Intrigue at court  tick. The Young Victoria is a paint by numbers historical drama beautiful to look at but could do with a little more originality and substance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up and down stairs? Having others taste your food before you eat it? Everyone including your overbearing mother dictating how you live? These are only a few of the obstacles which the young Victoria has to deal with in this film there's also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life. Needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.I had only previously seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada and little else. As she was in that film she is once again the standout here. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria and thought she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the film to the Queen Victoria she becomes later entirely believable. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control. Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. She's  quite simply  exquisite commanding your attention every second she's on screen. She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film.Rupert Friend proves to also be wellcast as Victoria's love interest and eventual husband Prince Albert. The actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements but you can tell that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this film. The lessfocusedupon people are wellportrayed also given what little screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash is memorable and makes an impact in the film.Although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life  especially at the end  and instead tells us what happened with her and Albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see. This is after all a film about 'The Young Victoria' not 'The MiddleAged Victoria' nor 'The Old Victoria'. While there are some embellishments made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do  which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power.The movie looks amazing the costumes Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it. It's powerful especially at the beginning when Victoria is crowned it packs an emotional punch where needed and the end credits song performed by Sinead O'Connor is one you'll want to sit through. Like the film and lead performances 'Only You' is simply beautiful. The movie is exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days it is actually a good length as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out.It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt. She's in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather importanthistoric role. This is one finelycrafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen. If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a mustsee.".

Also the production is outstanding in every way style substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen later marrying Prince Albert than ending with the birth of their first of nine children. It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen's attention than securing her love before Lord MelbournePaul Bettany was engrossing to watch. Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother which was fury at times as with her mother and King William whom also disliked her mother. The acting and scenes were captivating highly emotional. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era and indeed anyone who loves a compelling true romance story".

	schema:reviewBody "Emily Blunt displays enough star wattage to light up an Empire and smart editing and sumptuous production design add to the overall positives of Young Victoria. While not a particularly engaging or stimulating movie it manages to keep one interested.Blunt plays the title character a teenager about to inherit the throne of Great Britain at about the time of its worldconquering zenith 1837. Victoria is to be a constitutional monarch bound by the strictures of popular will. She is also bound by other forces including the connivances of a court that doesn't always wish her well. In such straits she needs the love and support of Albert of Belgium Rupert Friend a real prince who also proves a prince of a guy.I know what it is to live alone inside your head he tells her while never giving a clue as to your real feelings.Friend presents Albert as a likeably awkward man of real depth a deserving match for the ravishing Blunt. Like nearly every other reviewer here I'm in awe of what she brings to the screen beauty and charm in equal measure. I can't say she's a great actress here just a compelling star with her two killer expressions Earnestly Pained and Serenely Pleased.That's all she needs though in a movie that works more by way of effective montage sequences than dramatic arcs or character building. Young Victoria tries something I haven't seen before where one scene ends and another begins while both alternately play out on the screen for a minute or so of seamless crosscutting. Director JeanMarc Valle and his editors Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner make this costume dramachick flick an easy experience for those of us outside Young Victoria's target demographic keeping information on a fast boil and served up with the right amount of energy and easy flair.This helps a lot considering any lack of real conflict. When you think of it there's really nothing going on in this film that isn't resolved with considerable ease.SPOILERS We are told in the opening moments that Victoria is fighting an attempt by a conniving noble to seize power from her by getting her to agree to a regency but even before the title credit we see her saying no and pretty much settling that. The nasty noble manhandles Victoria a couple of times and even kicks a dog just so we can hate him better but winds up out of gas by the time she takes the throne. Then we get a constitutional crisis that doesn't really seem serious especially once Albert returns to claim his queen. Albert has his own people to get free of back home in Belgium who want to profit politically from Albert's new love but he just ignores them and that takes care of that. SPOILERS ENDThere is little to distract from the spectacle that seems Young Victoria's main purpose. Given the fantastic locations where the crew was allowed to film you'd understand a tendency to bask in long costumed sequences with Zadok The Priest playing overhead but Valle doesn't stay static. Changing up camera angles and perspectives he keeps his camera on Blunt and lets her stares and reactions fill the screen.Most of the time she's ravishing. Sometimes she's even interesting. One moment offering a rill in this otherwise still mill pond features an argument with Albert where she screams at him about defying her queenly authority even commanding him to stay so she can scream at him some more. He declines saying he is concerned for the health of the unborn baby she carries and leaves her to huff alone.Blunt in that scene asks you to not simply bathe in her beauty but laugh at her character succeeding well enough to make you think she has a future in movies long after her cheeks lose their rosy glow. Young Victoria seems mostly about those cheeks though and doesn't do badly by them.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE YOUNG VICTORIA 2009 directed by JeanMarc Valle is a simple love story and performs a great job at romanticizing such by wooing the heart of many a teen and twentysomething girl who still wish they were a princess with a showcase of glamorous balls elaborate costumes and a goodlooking prince with a sharp accent. For every other demographic watching the film this reviewer included the political intrigue of a dying king an overbearing mother and a manipulative PM however isn't quite as rewarding.Emily Blunt who as it has been noted fought for this role passing on the opportunity to costar in the comicbook film IRON MAN 2 proved that she had every right to play the monarch and did so with a beautifully royal countenance. Along side of her Rupert Friend is both dashing and enjoyable as her loving paramour bringing an elegance to an otherwise everyman role.Where the film fails if the telling of two people successfully in love is a failure is that aside from the romantic yearning and positively  ahem  Victorian dating rituals practiced within the viewer does not get to witness the social policies that her reign was responsible for or any true conflict thereof. She has almost already won before the film ends. In contrast Shekhar Kapur's ELIZABETH 1998 weds the yearning of romance with hard statewide deliberations and a very dangerous conflict thus creating a more compelling film.The conflict in this film comes as a result of two different characters and types of love. The first is Paul Bettany in an outstanding performance as Lord Melbourne Queen Victoria's PM. Melbourne courts Victoria and offers love but his is a love of power with wedding Victoria as a clever and manipulative means to grabbing all. The other is King William played by Jim Broadbent truly the king of acting nobility who loves his niece and realizes that his own paternal instincts were denied by allowing the Duchess of Kent her mother to control every aspect of the young soontobequeen's life. Alas Broadbent's scenes are shorter than a drink of champagne and Bettany's are as political as the U.S. President in any Jerry Bruckheimer presentation.THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an enjoyable romantic film to watch with clever dialogue and outstanding locations. However the Young Victoria will always be a girl when compared the rich majesty that was Elizabeth.".

	schema:headline " A Good Period Piece Depicting Queen Victoria's Early Life";
	schema:reviewBody "This is first of all a beautiful period piece with exquisitely designed sets and costumes. Set in the period just before and in the early years of Victoria's reign as Queen of England there is a definite sense of authenticity that flows throughout this movie. The story itself revolves essentially around two aspects of Victoria's early life. The first deals with the troubled relationships that existed within the royal family. Victoria's uncle was King William IV  a man who only became King at the age of 64 and had a touch of eccentricity about him. Since William was childless the heir to the throne was his niece Victoria. Victoria's mother and her partner Sir John Conroy who many believe was her lover conspired to take control of England themselves by convincing Victoria to establish a regency. William however survived until Victoria's 18th birthday and Victoria  hostile to Conroy and unsympathetic to her mother  refused to consider a regency instead reigning in her own right. This was an interesting view of royal life and of some of the intrigues taking place behind the scenes as well as a somewhat rare depiction of William IV who's largely forgotten today. The second part of the story dealt with the growing relationship and eventual romance between Victoria and her cousin Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha. This took up the bulk of the movie although I would say personally that I found the political machinations within and without the royal family more interesting. It was however a good and corrective look at a side of Victoria rarely reflected upon. The image we have of her tends to be of her later life  after Albert's death when she went into extended mourning. Her name sums up an era the Victorian widely seen as passionless and frankly somewhat dull. Thus it's refreshing to see Victoria shown as passionately in love with Albert which she was in truth.Emily Blunt's performance as Victoria was topnotch with Rupert Friend offering a very good performance as Albert. Friend was appropriately in Blunt's shadow for most of the movie just as Albert would have been in Victoria's. This is an interesting take on Victoria's early life. It's not especially exciting and adds nothing really that anyone with knowledge of the outline of Victoria's life wouldn't know already which of course also means that it isn't hopelessly romanticized although the scene in which Albert takes a bullet for Victoria is complete myth as was the idea that was mentioned that Victoria's marriage made her more popular when in fact her marriage to Albert was not popular at first with the public but it's still a good watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Young Victoria luckily has a story and even better than that it has good actors. That's where a film like The Other Boleyn Girl fails. The acting just didn't match the characters. Emily Blunt who has quickly risen up the ranks into Hollywood Alist status gives one of her better performances worthy of her Golden Globe nomination as the famed English monarch Queen Victoria.The film follows Victoria in the year leading up to her coronation and into the first few years of her reign including her relationship of Prince Albert Rupert Friend. Victoria was a very protected and sheltered princess who was under constant surveillance by her mother and close friend and adviser. Victoria was next in line to take the crown once the King had passed on so naturally a lot of attention as to when she would ascend to the thrown and how was being discussed. One thing is clear Victoria does not want to be treated like a child.Her budding romance with Prince Albert starts before she is made Queen. The Prince is selected to try and win her affection as a political ally but one thing leads to another and the two become smitten with each other. Albert is aware that the two of them are very young and must look out for one another especially in the realm of politics. So called friends can become powerful influences on the crown especially in the case of Lord Melbourne Paul Bettany who imposes his political party's agenda upon the queen in a back door sort of way surrounding her with his own people.Victoria learns quickly and so do we that the game of politics is a dicey one. It's hard to see which side people are really on and by the time you do it might be too late.I was pleased with the pace and direction of this movie. It could have been too much about the fashion or too much about the politics but it balanced the two out pretty well. Blunt and Friend are fine opposite each other playfully going back and forth with their Victorian era flirtations. There is a definite bond their that shows up well on screen.The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Bettany Miranda Richardson as Victoria's mother the Duchess of Kent Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy the Duchess' adviser and a nice cameo by Jim Broadbent as an ailing King William. Bettany in particular plays his role quite well never really telling us whether he is helping the Queen out or trying to do good for himself alone.The costumes are quite authentic and well made. They don't always distract the viewer's eye but at times they are a bit showy. I guess those were the times. The sets are incredibly detailed. I particularly liked the attention paid to the little knickknacks and pieces of furniture in the bedrooms and studies. It felt like people were living there.It wasn't a perfect film and it did have it's dull moments. I thought it ended nicely and didn't wander off to take us places where we didn't need to go.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about historical epics that make us movie fans flock to the movie theaters in raw expectation and stop my beating heart if that historical epic were to be an accurate wellresearched and moving romance. What greater delight is there than watching a nice good romance while learning a good portion of history all enveloped in an exquisitelycrafted film? JeanMarc Valle's charming The Young Victoria skillfully lives up to the aforementioned characteristics and creates a feelgood movie experience that has your heart guzzling and your mind racing in excitement throughout its entirety.Yes we love monarchs and their epic largerthanlife experiences. One such monarch we all fondly remember is Queen Victoria born in 1819 and assuming the throne at a very early age. King William Jim Broadbent is soon to die Victoria is soon to come of age and all around Europe rise interweaving conspiracies and plots to have Victoria sign an order of regency extending her powers to someone else andor having someone seduce her with wit and modern political ideas and therefore influence her reign towards favoring a particular country or political party. But Victoria isn't as silly as everyone thinks and she has a mind of her own...which is constantly been careened back and forth between diverging influences such as the Duchess of Kent's Miranda Richardson trying to make her renounce power to the evil Baron Stockmar or Lord Melbourne Paul Bettany gaining her favour to help establish himself as Prime Minister...or Albert Conroy Rupert Friend King Leopold's nephew who begins to fall in love with her while being part of a plot to earn the queen's protection of the Belgians.Among all these conspiracies and mindboggling plots is the shy growing romance between Victoria and Albert. The film is about history politics and the nature of regents but above all these subjects the love these characters feel triumph above all else and end up in one of the best regencies England has ever seen and one of the best love stories ever told. JeanMarc Valle does a wonderful job in toning down the film to a lighthearted level where the history is enjoyable and where the love story unfolding isn't stale and clichd but original and refreshing. And Emily Blunt's performance as the young strongwilled and charming Victoria is excellent and enthralling she wins you over from the start and opens up Victoria's heart and mind to the audience making it easy for us to love Victoria the Woman and to relate to her and her life problems no matter how epically different they are from our own.The screenplay is dazzling such as we've come to expect from screenwriter Julian Fellowes Gosford Park and the film has that sublime breathtaking ageold beauty we can expect from lush sweeping cinematography mellow and inviting score and topnotch costume design. It's a film that doesn't depend on the acting screenwriting or directing alone but whose every part fit perfectly together into a pleasing wellcoordinated whole.The film never lags but sometimes it carries a particular emotion too far to the point where it loses it strength or sometimes it cuts abruptly between scenes and countries in its attempt to fully involve us in every conspiracy or in every character's setting that we lose interest in most of the secondary characters and await impatiently to the flowering letterdriven romance between Victoria and Albert. And what's with the rushed ending? You're enjoying the film completely taken in by the story and all of a sudden we get a black screen with an epilogue. It's not a grand flaw of the film but it does inhibit it from becoming a masterpiece to rival such productions as Shakespeare in Love or Elizabeth.I highly recommend it! It's a crowdpleaser that will make you smile.Rating 3 stars out of 4!".

For example the main 'boy' character's main feature was no character whatsoever... he was akin to an emotionless robot and the main 'girl' character... well she was annoying on multiple levels with he inability to communicate.. not that she couldn't she has some kind of 'disorder' but the fact that over half of her utterances are just sighs moans 'ooohs' and 'ahhs' to the point that it almost seems like audio porn. Irritating and disgusting considering it's a 12 year old.All in all the story refused to explain itself throughout and ended with such an anticlimax I wanted to smash the screen in rage. Just because it's an adult oriented Anime with mature themes and pretty artwork does NOT make it any more palatable than an episode of Teletubbies!Stay away from this one and save yourself an hour and a half of your time.".

Yuko goes missing and was thought to have been a murder victim. With this Mio breaks Makino out of the system with her Magic hacking abilities and they meet up with Kono in order to find out what has happened. You'll find out that the story is more about Kono despite it being in the eyes of Makino.The art is quite cute. The cast is wonderful. The music and overall experience were enjoyable. It is not too hardcore has a bit of violence but appropriate enough for younger viewers.I'd give the move an 810 but I see there's a LOT of unfair votes putting this movie down to 510 so I'll gladly vote 1010 for this one.

As a gamer who put more value in story than the action I would personally say that the DOOM3 storyline was better than the movies completely changed storyline. In the game the city plays a central role. In the movie you never leave the work areas you never get to see the old ruins. The city isn't even mentioned beyond the intro. Beyond 2 10 second scenes you do not see the Mars exterior. You barely register that these events take place on Mars not on earth. The artifacts that played a central role in the game is not mentioned or present in the movie. The entire Hell is loose plot was completely cut away the events of the movie blamed onto something COMPLETELY different. The theme one man against hell became a few men and their issues. The ghost of the little girl one of the games scarier parts did not make it to the move.DOOM3 was also a horror experience playing both on achluophobia fear of darkness and Monophobia fear of being alone this was an aspect missing in the movie where areas was lit and the characters was always going at least two and two. I almost think the movie could have been better if they hired less actors and put more money on storywriters.Another aspect completely gone is the ambient red tone of being on mars something that could have added a more artistic flavor to the movie. Except for very short moments in the beginning of the movie you never see that these events in fact take place on mars.I was not happy to see the storyline almost completely changed and the horror downscaled to almost not scary at all with nothing better added to it. There are no deep questions asked here no philosophical submessage to the audience to go home thinking about. This is a lighthearted actionmovie and that's it.The most faithful part to the game is the labs and the monsters. he developers who made the game gave the areasmonstersweapons an unique design that wouldn't have been right to move away from. If you care zero about the plot then yes this is DOOM.There's also the first person sequence in which we get to follow a series of events through the eyes of a soldier when he runs around and shoot monsters in corridors. It was fun although I would say that it failed to capture me. I was mostly annoyed with the choice of music and it could have been more scary.I see some ways this movie could have been made better with the material it's based on but I did not expect it. At least the action is well done. If you want 2 hours of entertainment that wont change your world DOOM offers just that. If you do not watch many movies and want some extra quality when spending time on one you can jump this one.Gamemovies so far are between awful and ok. This one was ok.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doom is not a masterpiece. However for what it is a video game to movie franchise it does a decent job. I was watching this film when suddenly my parents came in. They immediately sat down and watched the last 50 minutes with me. Surely that's an indication that the film itself wasn't too bad. My favourite part of the movie was the FPS scene. It showed a level of originality which has been absent in other Video game movies such as the Resident Evil franchise. Another Pro was the casting of the Rock as Sarge and Karl Urban as Reaper. Both made decent performances in the movie.The level of action was decent and I was happy that the film branched out a bit further than the 90 minute restriction. Furthermore I particularly enjoyed the fact that the makers decided to use models and suits similar to Alien rather than rely on CGI. It again shows a level of originality that implies the makers wanted the film to stand out and was not there just to make money.The cons were that overall the acting was not great. The other marines for example other than The Rock and Urban did not put in great performances and Rosamund Pike I think was particularly bad. They seemed an ordinary group of guys thrust into battle. They just didn't seem to act like a group of elite disciplined soldiers. It just didn't feel realistic. Another con is that the film was not particularly scary. The actual game is deemed to be one of the scariest games out there to play. So it feels an opportunity missed that the film was not a terrifying rollercoaster ride filled with suspense and was more like a variety of action sequences containing grim monsters.All in all Doom is a movie which is by no means perfect is a decent film for what it is.

	schema:reviewBody "So many people everywhere have some sort of Doom memory. Whether it be playing with friends siblings or hell even family Doom seems to be something that anyone who's played enjoys. If anyones seen the film Alien and Aliens  the difference between the original dooms and Doom 3 is exactly the same. Doom 3 being more like alien more horror with less action and the originals like Aliens more action with some horror.Now the film review. After seeing my title Faithfull no? Good film? Yes. your probably wondering how it could be unfaithful to the games and still a good film at the same time  i'll explain.Anyone who's played any doom game as much as I haveWhich is a lot will DEFFINTLY be disappointed in this film. It's got light rough elements of the original games in there yes but not enough. Lets not even talk plot for a moment. Say the whole 'hell' involvement thing didn't even matter. Think demons think weapons think actionhorror. Thats what dooms always been about more then anything right? Right. Which is why this film comes to a disappointment.Lets talk demons first They included 4 of the demons from the doom games The zombie The imp the pinky and the baronhell knight whichever you want to call it it really dose't matter in this case. The zombies behaved well like zombies. You don't see much of them but you see them none the less and they never do crap. You just see them die. Thats it. The imps and barons? They don't shoot fireballs anymore sadly. The barons use brute force while the imps either just scratch or attack you with their tongue to turn you into an imp IF your souls 24th chromosome is declared Evil. If thats not bad enough you don't even get a good look at them or see them very much! The pinky he was in one very short scene and pretty much just acted like a slow CGI monster so it was kinda obvious. It was fun to see it get slashed with the chainsaw one of the few moments that everyone loved in doom. Though in doom 3 they at least explained why chainsaws were on mars..Weapons You see the rocket launcher picked up but never used. You see the shotgun shot ONCE in a very dark scene meaning you see flashes and hear a shotgun sound and thats it. The big mini gunchain gun was used ONCE to shoot a monkey. Other then that you see the machine gun used the WHOLE time and the BFG used twice. The double barrel shotgun and plasma gun don't even get a mention! The chainsaw just happened to be on a random table and used to kill the pinky. The pistol was used a few times. Shooting wise  this film was dull. The first person section was really the only place you felt doomish other then the 2 times the BFG was used. Not to mention the BFG color changed from green to blue..The action  horror You don't see much of it. You see some action here and there but it's mostly random. You don't see much shooting and stuff dieing. You do but it's dark not very gory and hard to see. The horror? Absent in this film sorry to say. They tried 12 cheap scares which didn't even work..Plot I'm not going to go into this. Only one thing to say  Not doom. The plot of hell and demons was taken out and replaced with a genetics plot. Not much else to say.Now i've explained why it's very unlike doom i'm going to say one more thing on the matter and thats that the soundtrack was nicely doneRemiended me of the original doom music sort of.. and the sets were constructed mostly very well and close to the game.The next part of this review Good as a movie.Anyone who's never played a doom game can DEFFINTLY enjoy this. Anyone who's never played video games Can ENJOY this. They won't understand the FPS section maybe but you can still enjoy it none the less. As a sci fi film it's not the best out there no but it's pretty well done and if you don't see it as seeing Doom the movie and just some sci fi movie on mars you can DEFFINTLY enjoy the film.The plot is out there yeah but it explains why some people are infected and others are not. It explains a lot about chromosomes and hey they even included an ancient civilization bit which was in the game AND makes sense in this plot. Don't worry about knowing nothing about the games  it won't matter. You'll be able to understand it all.Overall you can defiantly enjoy the little action mixed with the strange sci fi plot into a nicely mixed film that lets not refer to as doom.My final judgment If your a doom fan see it but don't expect to like it. You may enjoy it as a film but you won't like it as doom. If your a video game fan see it you'll probably find yourself enjoying it. If you like SciFi give it a go if you haven't seen Sernity yet which is the only other sci fi playing to my knowledge at the moment. If you just want a movie to see on a Friday night with some action go for it. If your looking for a in depth rich story lined sci fi action combined film go rent aliens..I gave this a 610 because though unlike doom it was still a well done film and maybe one day Hollywood will learn to make a successful video game adaptation..".

The atmosphere wasn't scary enough. The monsters were frankly pathetic. A guy in a rubber alien suit covered in KY jelly to make him look slimy may have worked 30 years ago but not now. Where were the horrific biomechanical perversions of nature that characterised doom? i.e. Spider Demon. Where was the demonic imagery? The torsos hanging from spikes in the ceiling? The five pointed stars painted on the floor in blood?The plot had nothing to do with the original games. The whole 24th chromosome thing was actually less believable than a portal to hell and undermined the tension when you found out that the creatures were actually human once.There was no point to the film. No objective. Just people walking round corridors with guns. That may make a good game but a film needs more than that. Even in Doom 3 the game there is a series of objectives i.e. crossing the base to get to the transmitter and call for help. That's what this game needed  an objective for the marines to accomplish other than killing things. Without this the film rambles on and the dialogue is superfluous with no influence on the storyline whatsoever.I wonder if the producers of this film have actually every played Doom. The film did a fantastic job of incorporating none of the atmosphere of the games. It wasn't scary enough it wasn't gory enough and it wasn't evil enough.To summarise it was crap. And I'm gutted ".

The Rock as Sarge is absolutely perfect! i just couldn't imagine Karl Urban doing a better job then The Rock when it comes to Sarge. Although many have branded this film Resident Evil in Space and yeah it is but that doesn't subtract from the film at all. The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles c'mon who didn't laugh?.The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of. Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100 identical too its source material Doom 3 then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Overall a lot better then what i was expecting too see".

The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles c'mon who didn't laugh?.The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of. Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100 identical too its source material Doom 3 then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Overall a lot better then what i was expecting too see";

If you think the movie is shallow it is but its supposed to be. Anyone who complains about the movie being a mindless shooting movie should realize that this is not the movie for them so they should go watch one of their emotional movies if they want. However if you need a break and just want your testosterone pumping so you can take a break from life and just be a manly man. If you don't like The Rock then go watch a romance or comedy this movie isn't for you. However if you like the video game and like mindless action this is the movie for you. Remember not every movie has to have some deep meaning or evoke emotion some movies are just for fun. This is one of them.".

The dialogue that was intended to be clever and witty made me actually want to rape and kill the nearest nun or person of the cloth.The acting wasn't all that bad but some of the characters seemed outrageously stereotypical. You have the radical Christian guy who slices open his arm for taking the lord's name in vain you've got the creepy white guy who peddles drugs and makes 'hysterical' jokes like I'm afraid I'm eh gonna have to uh strip search you fine ladies and you've got the diehard nononsense sergeant who'll stop at nothing to get his men home safely. Of course he does shoot one of them in the face for no particular reason.The Rock undergoes a complete and instantaneous personality change partway through the movie. He watches a video that shows doctors injecting a serum into a man strapped to a table. After watching this The Rock screams I DIDN'T SEE SHT! I AIN'T PAID TO SEE SHT! From that point on The Rock decides it's his duty to murder all the civilians he comes across when before that he was a relatively nice guy.And if you expected this to be a scary movie you can wipe your hopes right off your face. The scariest part of this movie is a monkey hiding in an air vent. Yeah that's right. A monkey. In a vent. It jumps out and goes CREEWEAEAE! Instead of getting scaring the hell out of people like it was intended to do half the theater was laughing. What kind of lame movie needs a cheap CatInTheCupboard scare to keep it interesting?Doom.

But it does not work on everyone some people when infected mutate into large monsters that have detachable tongues which pass the infection onto others. Confused yet? There's more.

The camera angle never quite knows what it wants to do and the lighting where there is any is just irritating.The filters are not subtle they use lots of red probably because it's set on Mars and a fair bit of everyone's favourite green because it's postMatrix But the most laughable part has to be the five minute long first person sequence which looks exactly like Doom 3 on Xbox the CGI in this scene is laughable although possibly deliberate and it ingeniously shows the big hulking monsters attacking the main character with a chainsaw which he later uses against what can only be described as a boss All in all this film is terrible. Less of a film more of a Labotomy on celluloid. Spend your 3.75 renting price on something more worthwhile like paying Lenox Lewis to punch you in the face it would be more fun I assure you!".

The video game style of the movie was limited pretty much to one scene.

Upon discovering most of the scientists dead they soon realized they were not going to stay that way. I do not want to give away much more than that but there is more to this movie.Sarge's team consists of Destroyer Deobia Oparei the religious Goat Ben Daniels Duke Raz Adoti Portman Richard Brake The Kid Al Weaver Mac Yao Chin and John Grimm Karl Urban who happens to be the twin brother of one of the scientists Samantha Grimm Rosamund Pike.Doom started off pretty slow but once the ball got rolling it resembled the game more and more and kept the excitement up as well. All of these actors pulled off their parts to great avail. Really how could they go wrong? I went into this movie with extremely low expectation. Especially after reading some of the reviews so I was very pleasantly surprised. I can recommend this movie to those who love a good bloody action movie. Basically if you can relate to Sin City then Doom is also the movie for you. 910".

Then my fanboyism got a hold of me and realized it was not doom. Honestly if this movie would have been called UAC Marines Viral Apocalypse or something else random this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a scifi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission To Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard scifi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment. The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fanboysgirls? out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a about 510 minute segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but cool nonetheless. Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a scifi movie checkout DOOM if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game I suggest you just keep playing the video game.Visuals 7 Sound 9 Gore To Idiocy Factory 3 It's there and does what it needs to do. Not over the top or retarded to the point you just wonder why it's there in the first place Clich Catch Phrases 5 Standard SciFi Overall Score 6".

Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a scifi movie checkout DOOM if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game I suggest you just keep playing the video game.Visuals 7 Sound 9 Gore To Idiocy Factory 3 It's there and does what it needs to do. Not over the top or retarded to the point you just wonder why it's there in the first place Clich Catch Phrases 5 Standard SciFi Overall Score 6";

Rumours began emerging saying there would be no hell no Mars and no teleports all essential parts of the original games. Ok these are just rumours I thought to myself putting my faith in the games' development team ID Software which I thought would keep an eye on the production and keep it true to the games. Fortunately later on it was confirmed that it would indeed be set on Mars and that kept my hopes up even though they decided to go with Brate actors.After seeing the movie I felt disappointed realizing ID Software had completely sold out itself. Nothing in this movie is worth the title DooM except for the props the monsters and the weapons. The movie to me felt like a Resident Evil clone set on Mars and if you ask me this movie should have been titled Resident Evil In Mars... with Bigger Guns... and Bigger Monsters.A major disappointment for me was that the producers decided to remove hell from the movie. The idea of the monsters originating from hell was an important aspect in the games. I'm guessing the producers decided to remove the hell part from the movie because of the large population of Christians in USA thinking it would scare them away from the box office. Doing so they completely betrayed the gamers so their plan backfired badly.Viruses cheesy oneliners untalented actors and not staying true to the original games' themes compel me to give this movie 3 stars. One for the creative FPS scene one for the monsters and one for the props.If you ask me this movie doesn't deserve to be called DooM!".

Granted it doesn't take a DeNiro to play the part but he does it well and very convincingly. Cudos for that I am even thinking about checking some of his new films out as well not.Of course I have to find something that annoyed me and it was called Rosamund Pike....my god how can an actress this boring and express less ever get a part in a film? I grabbed myself several times wondering this question. He seriously stinks.But  to be honest I think she was the only downer in this film. I didn't expect Oscar material and obviously that's not what I got either but I got a lot of action and enjoyed all of it especially the gameinspired shoot'em downup scene quite awesome carried out.Cudos to everything...apart from Rosamund Pike 710".

I loved all three Doom games but didn't play the expansion for the third installment and for this I am sorry and I must say this is the best movie from a game since Mortal Kombat.This movie did a couple of new things on stuff you thought you knew. Your gamer's instinct or movieperson's instincts are often misguided by a new and innovative twist on simple things this is what is refreshing and stimulating about this movie.You got the good old' things and no more old' bad stuff. The old' bad stuff has been replaced with some new good stuff. Well the 'Doorway To Hell' is gone but 'Hell' has been given a whole new meaning. This isn't a shootermovie it's a shootermovie with an excellent script.Don't believe me or call me a liar I don't care. I just think this movie rocked both worlds.So they made some changes. Big Deal. It's a movie not a remake of the third game.I would've changed one thing and that was a longer ending battle having the bad guy come back one more time but bigger and stronger but apart from this Doom blew away all my expectations for a gamemovie.The Music rocked. The Visuals shocked me in the good kind of way. The plot and coming together of the little puzzle pieces towards the end just had me by the throat and wouldn't let go.Believe what you want.

I've played them all from the original to II to the Ultimate Doom and so forth up to the recent Doom III which was somewhat of a letdown in ways but nowhere near that of Doom The Movie. I'm sad to say that because I was in high hopes of the movie regardless of post discussion and people criticizing that The Rock was in it and not to mention previous video game to movie disasters Cough Tomb Raider Resident Evil Cough.My review from what I can remember It's been a week or so  I've tried to forget.I went with a friend 1030PM weekday. My friend already had low expectations but I tried to lift his spirits with encouragement that the movie would be good. The movie began outer planet shots then some scientists something crazy happens they all start screaming and running. Out of nowhere Rock music begins to play not in unison with the scenes or anything. Guy locks the door before some other scientist can get in and her hand gets plopped off. Then off to title or whatever. I felt like after that scene it was going to be some people filming a movie about the game inside the movie. If you understand what I mean. I say this because the opening felt cheesy. At any rate my friend wanted to leave but I encouraged him to stay more. We're only like 15mins into the movie at this point.Movie continues Rock is introduced YAY! No not really His performance is nothing special in this movie. I recall him blabbing about how his character would be so tough tough as cotton candy. His acting was just bland and not believable. Maybe it was the script he had to work with but for some reason I doubt it. Supporting cast was about as good as the The Rock. Most of the movie is them walking around these endless hallways of what appears to be a labyrinth. I found only 2 monsters to my recollection in the entire movie and I didn't see the second one because I walked out 15mins before the movie ended literally 15min. Which I'll bet all the money I spent and got back that the best parts of the movie were in that last 15mins but I simply didn't want to pay to see them.The worst points I can recall of the movie were one scene the marine's taclight on his weapon just happens to go out ... similar to horror flicks when the person's flashlight goes out but the way it went in this movie was just dumb noone else had a problem with their taclights just him and some may say oh it was the evil forces messing up his taclight but whatever seems like the rest of the marines used Energizer batteries and homeboy used the great value brand. Another scene the marine falls into some pit they said it was a holding cell or something and then the 1 of 2 monsters goes after him and he attempts to fire his gun at the monster and it what appears to JAM. His gun jams?!?!?! The marine has fired 0 shots since the beginning of when they appeared so it isn't as though he ran out of ammo. So his gun JAMS and he is forced to then attempt to shoot it with his pistol before he is thrown as I recall then gets up and uses this 15ft or so cable that is connected to your average looking computer monitor and continues to swing and beat this monster with it before of course getting killed. RIDICULOUS. WE HAVE FIREARMS THAT DON'T JAM. He is a marine in the future with SPACESHIPS and his rifle JAMS. Whatever. They also cock their guns and say they are going in hot and loaded or whatever like 10x. I guess they felt the need to announce that each time to get the full effect. The FPS scenes I saw were soso nothing special I did get the feeling at a point I was in the videogame but then other times with all the first person turning around corners I got a bit dizzy might just be me. I more than likely missed the real FPS scenes that were in the last 15mins probably. I missed the storyline if there was one BESIDES the fact there was no communication to the scientists and blah blah blah. I never really saw real characteristics of the game besides the BFG which appeared to be a footprint in the movie. Oh I forgot to mention cheesy rock music did begin to play out of nowhere in action sequences etc.In the end Doom was crap. I'm glad I got my money back for the hour I wasted. Rent it if you really feel the need to. I hope this review was helpful I tried to cover everything I could remember and wanted to. My apologies for any bad grammar spellings etc. In bit of a rush.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very rarely do prequels match up with their predecessors. As I'm not the biggest Underworld fan I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting much. However I should've expected more as the latest yet earliest installment is easily my favorite in the series. It ain't art but it's the shining example of why we go to the movies to escape into a world of mythology fantasy and crazy vampirewerewolf action.For the first time in the series the filmmakers have decided to leave out the rock that probably was the reason the films have been successful Kate Beckinsale. I'm guessing this was a production riskchoice but it seems to have paid off. Selene's absence from the story is necessary to tell the story of how the Lycans rose to power how Viktor was driven insane though we pretty much already know how and as off topic as it may be how simply awesome Michael Sheen is.Very rarely do the actors make an action movie good. Most action movies rely on explosions and surprise! action to enhance the quality and generally feature run of the mill copycat characters. Sheen's Lucian and Bill Nighy's Viktor will always stand out in the realm of actionfantasy characters to me and it's easy to see why. Sheen's turn as Lucian is fierce determined and one of my favorite performances in an action movie I've seen in years. Despite playing a mostly villainous role in the first film Lucian is the hero of this film and it totally gives you a new spin on things. Sheen's brave and dedicated performance really makes the character work while Bill Nighy is once again effectively creepy as Viktor. Rhona Mitra's presence as Sonja is welcome though she doesn't carry the same charisma that Beckinsale does making her an ill advised choice to be Selene's replacement as she so obviously is.The action in Underworld though obviously restrained by a lower budget is once again great. There's some nice dueling the obvious gore and blood galore and a nice Lord of the Rings style battle at the end. What it comes down to is that Underworld does nothing new but does everything right in maintaining a steady river of entertainment. I was never bored and I don't think you will be either.The film does answer a lot of questions and provides some nice insight to the Lycans which were my favorite parts about the first two films though it suffers from the same fate as most prequels do...even a casual viewer of this series knows which characters will live which will die and how it will end. The film isn't really about the resolution but rather the journey to the end. In fact it's made in such a way that you can certainly watch the trilogy in chronological order.When it comes down to it I liked 'Lycans' a lot. It's a worthy installment in the series and certainly not a disappointment to me. It's got good action a wonderful lead performance from Michael Sheen and should satisfy fans of the series and fans of mythological stories altogether.".

I've seen the first two movies and I have to say I'm glad they brought back Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy the second film just wasn't quite the same without those two. Lucian is the character you love to sympathize for and Viktor is the character you love to hate.I'm so very glad the story was more focused on Lucian as it's a nice change from Selene and Michael being in the spotlight not to mention Michael Sheen's arguably superior acting ability. As for Rhona Mitra I won't say she was better than Kate Beckinsale but I can't say she was any less of an asset. Not only did she look great but she executed her lines superbly. I will however say that I find Sonja's character much more interesting than Selene's. The chemistry between Lucian and Sonja was much better than that of the chemistry between Michael and Selene.The story was much more intriguing emotional and tragic than that of either of the previous two expeditions this being of course subjective as many who recall the flashbacks presented within will agree. It was also faithful to the material and it's good that they didn't compromise for the sake of improving the story.Overall I can't think of another prequel that brought such raw emotion to the table and regardless of the fact that Len Wiseman was not directing this one though he was at the helm in other ways you wouldn't know by watching it as it did a good job maintaining the same feel as the first two. The score also added to a lot of the emotion.In regards to the possibility of a 4th movie if they choose to continue on from this prequel as I think they should they should bring in Amelia as she is one of the few characters that has yet to be explored fully.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rise of the Lycans on the surface makes a perfectly well working prequel. The loss of Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman is compensated by a great Rhona Mitra and especially Michael Sheen's titanic effort. The look and the action are amazing considering the somewhat lower budget and the story makes sense to prepare us all for the things to come in the other two movies. All in all the trilogy is round now and does not disappoint in any department unless you are taking everything a bit too literally and wonder how werewolves can make babies.It is interesting however to peek below the surface. The makers mentioned in interviews they see similarities to Romeo  Juliet insofar as Lucien and Sonja are lovers not allowed to get together. One crucial difference however is that Romeo and Juliet came from two noble families whereas in Rise of the Lyans Sonja is a member of the aristocratic pale vampire rulers who are sipping glasses of blood on the castle while Lucien is with the ugly hairy slaves the werewolves exploited as cheap labor force. We don't really get to see what this work consists of except carrying stones around. Also the love story isn't explained enough in the running time of not much more than 80 minutes PAL until the credits start to roll. But the point is that Rise of the Lycans is a hardly disguised class struggle story. Similar to the Italian socialist cinema of the 1960s which would show the rebellion of poor farmers against the rich property owners the working class has to realise their value in Lucien's words we are more than animals and claim their human rights. When Lucien says this is just the beginning it may seem to the audience that he jokingly refers to other other two movies which have shown us already how the story continues after this prequel. In the subtext though he is making a very serious statement that freedom is the foundation of a life worth living and everything else will be built up now upon this basic condition. It's a pity that the movie doesn't elaborate more on that and doesn't spend some additional time on the character development either because it could have been the best of the trilogy. Alas I voted almost equally 877 for the three movies.".

This movie seems to take place a short time after the creation of both races but some time before the events that open Underworld Evolution. The entire story of the feud between the vampires and lycans is told in 90 minutes with plenty of action interspersed throughout. My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer with more character development. An hour and a half is hardly enough time to tell a love story which is what is at the heart of this movie. Also a little more depth could have been given to Raze's character as his origins are shown but not in much detail. These plot points are sacrificed to keep the action scenes rolling but the action is great. There are several clashes between vamps and lycans that put those of the first two movies to shame. The special effects are amazing as usual. My hope is that Rise of the Lycans will do well at the box offices and we will all be treated to an extended directors cut on DVD. The plot themes of slavery forbidden love and revolution could use a little more screen time in my opinion. Oh and lets all hope for another sequel.".

The special effects are amazing as usual. My hope is that Rise of the Lycans will do well at the box offices and we will all be treated to an extended directors cut on DVD. The plot themes of slavery forbidden love and revolution could use a little more screen time in my opinion. Oh and lets all hope for another sequel.";

What a great movie THAT would have been.What I got...was somehow...better. I honestly can't say that I'm disappointed although I just KNEW I would be if they left off that bit. What they give us is storydriven rather than effects or actiondriven. I know that sounds ridiculous when talking about a movie in which action and effects are completely necessary in order to properly tell the story but in all too many cases they end up overshadowing the story and eliminating any sense of storytelling. I am happy to say that such is not the case with Underworld Rise of the Lycans.I won't spoil the movie as so many have. I will say that the obvious parallels between Sonja and Selene's characters are endearing and Sonja's love of Lucien is breathtaking. The overall feel of the movie is as dark and Gothic as the original work beautifully echoing the brilliance of that film which caught us so by surprise in September of 2003.This still leaves a few small questions and I would have loved to see Kraven make the deal with Lucien and cut Viktor's mark off of him but you can't have everything and all in all this will run back to front with the original. All that's left now is an extension of the Story of Underworld Evolution one that either gives the viewers a satisfactory ending or perpetuates the species...of Underworld films that is.All in all? This ROCKS! It rates an 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "Again the eternal fight between vampires and werewolves in this exciting prequel set in the Dark Ages. This original and goresoaked vampires film begins centuries ago. Unknown to humanity centuries old blood feud raged between aristocrat vampires and subdued legion of werewolves known as Lycans who work as slaves. For centuries Sonja  Rhona Mitra  is a loyal soldier of the vampire clan but she falls in love with the Lycan Lucian  Michael Sheen . The tale traces the origins of the confrontation between a ruling class of bloodsuckers and their onetime slaves the werewolves . A young Lycan named Lucian emerges as a powerful rebel who rallies the rebellious werewolves to rise up against Viktor Sonja's father and the brutal vampire king . Lucian is joined by his secret lover Sonja in his struggle against the Vampire army and his fight for Lycan freedom . Neverheless  the war was not as it had seemed. In one night the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Sonja has formed a secret alliance with Lucian ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor  Bill Nighy  vampires leader who has enslaved them . But Viktor's lust for power and domination has failed. As Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe . Soon the hunt would be on for his killer . As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly  they decide to launch a fullscale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.This amazing movie displays noisy action  thrills ride stirring fighting  graphic violence  brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty amusing . It packs large loads of guts and gore  there's a huge body count this one actually knocks off an immense amount several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half including some of the most tears ever that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent makeup department . The film blends horror suspense struggles riproaring action terror and lots of gore. Set design is of first class  settings are stylized Gothic scenarios  and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Specials effects are breathtaking part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bonechilling and atmospheric musical score by Paul Haslinger and colorful and dark cinematography by Ross Emery. Spectacular and moving direction by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of Underworld I and II and known blockbusters such as 10.000 BC Indepencence day I robot Resident evil Pith black  among them . The interesting screenplay is written by Len Wiseman who directed the former entries  along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux . All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings with exception Kate Beckinsale  being well replaced by Rhona Mitra as relentless action woman . Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampireswerewolves films or those enjoy in general.".

Although nothing Oscarworthy it's really worthy of your time.The special effect is quite amazing. Looks like those 1980's horror flick. Very classic in a way.The tone is everything! I really love the moody tone of the movie. Very effective in this type of movies.The BAD Although I mentioned some goods there are a few bads. Everything just wasn't enough.The castle looks very small. Hence really takes away the epic feeling to it.The war was also quite small. Walking into the theater I was hoping for an epic war between the Vampire and the Lycans. But no the fight focuses on the main characters.I was also expecting more for the special effects and costumes. Especially in this era of moviemaking. The filmmakers should've gone a step further in bringing us the realism of the picture.OVERALL Underworld Rise of the Lycans is a great movie to catch. Full of drama and action.

	schema:reviewBody "I was going to wait until Sunday to go see this with my niece and her friends but I was a little apprehensive about how violent it was and wanted to check it out first...Okay okay that was part of the reason. The other reason I went to the first matine showing on opening day was because I was so nervous about this film. I so wanted to like the Underworld franchise. I love fantasy scifi and especially vampires and werewolves. I am always anxious to see how another writer actor director or other artist brings them to life er so to speak. I however have never been quite so underwhelmed and disappointed as with the first two of this series. I can appreciate what Len Wiseman and Patrick Tatapoulos were trying to achieve with their new version of werewolves  lycans  but I was actually embarrassed by their world's version of vampires. What a bunch of poseurs! Well Bill Nighy aside. Even Kate Beckinsale whom I do like as an actress failed to give me a female that you go girl pumpedup feeling about a toughasnails heroine. In fact  and I'm not so sure this hasn't been the intention all along  it gave me a whole new appreciation for werewolves. Oh yes and Michael Sheen.I'm not even really going to touch on Underworld Evolution because it was excruciating to sit through and except for Tony Curran Marcus and getting to see the protowerewolf William it was a waste of celluloid. Underworld 3 should have been Underworld 2 or 1 even.So hence my apprehension. I really wanted this movie to be good but had already been fooled twice by this franchise. What brought me back? Three things Len Wiseman wasn't directing Kate Beckisnale's Selene character was not an integral part of this plot and Michael Sheen's Lucian was. Lucian and Viktor Nighy were the only things that kept me in that theater seat in the first installment. The second I watched on a Starz movie channel couldn't even bring myself to rent it. Well I went and saw it and my anxiety has abated and I somehow feel...vindicated. This movie seriously rocked it out. First of all it made sense. I had to watch the first movie a few more times in pieces to really get a grasp of the whole story. Second the characters were engaging. Rhona Mitra while not really allowed to show off much but her gorgeous figure and face was still a much more sympathetic character than Selene ever was. Edit After a second viewing I've had a new appreciation for Mitra. She plays a perfect tough but tender kinda broad and that final scene between her and Sheen...guhhhh! Ripped my heart out. And maybe this is because I'm a girl but I seriously missed the romance from the first two. Truly the SonyaLucian angle was the only one  forget whatever that was between Selene and Michael...and what was that??? Third the creatures are absolutely fantastic in this. Rarely did I ever get that feeling in this film that I was playing a video game. And fourth well actually fourth and fifth Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy. I don't know if it's their British accents to my American ear that allow them to bring gravity to an otherwise sparse script or the fact that I'm still trying to rectify in my mind that these are the same guys that I just saw in FrostNixon and Notes on a Scandal respectively. Michael Sheen a sex symbol? Yeah believe it. I'd love a nice lifesize Lucian poster for my room. blushes Ahem anyway where was I......Right. The movie is only an hour and a half long and it flew by for me. The other two were hovering closer to two hours and they both felt twice as long and I was fidgety in my seat the whole time. It is a violent movie natch but with the bullets replaced by arrows it was no less bloody but maybe a bit less jarring and a little easier on the eardrums. And maybe I enjoyed it a bit more this time with a nice balance of romance. It's no Academy Award winner but then again I don't put much faith in Oscar these days. If you've never seen the other two movies don't feel you have to see them to appreciate this one. It is a prequel but should have been first. It is a nice bit of fantasy escapism. If you are delicate about violence and gloom this might not be for you but I for one am looking forward eagerly to seeing it again on Sunday.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rise of the Lycans. That's a pretty good thumbnail view.I liked this third outing of the Underworld series of movies. 7 of 10. No Kate Beckinsale as Selene as this is actually a prequel to the Underworld series of movies. Enter the beautiful Rhona Mitra as Sonja. Folks may know Rhona Mitra was Claire Radcliff in the wonderful TV series The Gates A vampire and werewolf TV series that was sadly canceled after the first season. Off topic a second I can never understand that when one of the networks has a hit series they are compelled to dump it in such a way as to frustrate as many people as possible. The cables like TNT AE etc. seem infinitely better at making the cancel series decision but I digress.The point I slipped off of is that if you're inclined to beautiful goth women in vampire type movies Rhona Mitra is not a step down from Kate Beckinsale.Rise of the Lycans is another double down of the Romeo and Juliet plot which made Underworld as touching as it was exciting. Because of this plot the movies except perhaps Evolution should have at least some appeal to those who crave some romance in their movies.It is entertaining to see what they've done with this movie in relation to the other Underworld movies. They've taken some of the backstory that is hinted at in Underworld and filled in many of the blanks. I watched this third as it came out third but if I had better knowledge I would have watched this one first in the series of movies.If you're looking for a review that critiques acting cinematography CGI how realistic stunts were etc. this is the wrong review for you. I watch movies to be entertained to relate to the characters and essentially enjoy myself. Unless it is just bad like SyFy seems they must fill that nook I don't notice much of that because I'm into the story. And this movie has one. If some technicality made it difficult to watch I'd say something but this movie doesn't get in the way of the story.This movie is dark! What does that even mean? Vampires underground no sunlight dark. Or is it because the characters aren't politically correct does that make it dark. This movie does move quickly. A twist in the plot a surprise an unexpected turn I call that fun. Only better way to get that kind of fun is to read a book or do exciting things like skydive or something.Finally a confession I actually had no interest whatsoever in the Underworld series until I checked up on an old favorite screenwriter of mine J. Michael Straczynski. Turns out he is the writer of Underworld Awakening. So I wanted to get the earlier movies in my head before watching Awakening. That JMS associated with the franchise and even wrote a script for it was enough to spark my interest. I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie and the two earlier movies. Now on to the JMS screenplay Underworld Awakening.".

To be honest if it hadn't been for the return of Raze I might not have given this a chance at all Kevin Grevioux is just plain a badass. That's his real voice! Seriously listen to interviews with him. While I would have liked more of him in this I'm honest enough to admit that the entire 80 minute running time could have had him in every shot and I'd still be saying that it's not enough. For Tatopoulos having relatively little experience at directingI guess he got tired of being consultant for when giant mutated lizards attack he does rather well. And this definitely has a gorgeous Gothic look and the dark tone of the first two. The cinematography and editing are great and the use of handheld is effective although several bits go by so fast that you can't tell what is going on. Nearly everyand certainly every lead performance is impressive Sheen continues the stellar work Nighyapart from being over the top at points is marvelous of course and I wouldn't mind seeing Mitra be the lead in something else. I hadn't seen her in this large a part before and she does well. The action is cool intense and fun of course given that this is a prequel you may miss the shootouts and carchases of the prior 2 entries. With that said the swordfighting is great. The FX are excellent and smoothly integrated. To its credit at its core this is a story about slaves rising up against their masters and it does engage pretty well. There is plenty of brutal bloody violence a little sexualityhot though not graphic and this has eye candy for both genders and brief male infant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informative and amusing commentary track three welldone featurettes of 9 20 and 13 minutes length respectively a music video and a handful of trailers. I recommend this to any fan of the franchiseand this is best watched after the others. 710".

However Sonja saves Lucian and he escapes with other prisoners to the woods. When Viktor discovers that Sonja is pregnant and in love with Lucian he locks her up in her room to force Lucian to return to the castle to rescue her in the beginning of the feud between the two bloodlines.I usually do not like prequels and sequels of successful movies but Underworld Rise of the Lycans is an excellent prequel of one of the best trilogies I have ever seen and maybe the best of the three great movies. The tragic romance between Sonja and Lucian has elements of Romeo and Juliet and is engaging providing a great justification to the beginning of the feud between vampires and Lycans. The cinematography is wonderful giving a stylish support to the outstanding screenplay. Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale that makes a cameo in the very last scene and shows a great chemistry with Michael Sheen.

And so is Michael Sheen who brought Lucian back to life again. Rhona Mitra is superb beautiful and HOT as she takes the character Sonja Viktor's beloved daughter. Kevin Grevioux returns as Raze as does Steven Mackintosh as Tannis. Both are given considerably more to do this time and both are welcome familiar faces and characters. The single omitted character was Kraven a slight dissatisfaction but not one that discolors the film.There isn't a great deal to state here other than getting the full backstory of the prohibited love between Lucian and Sonja which eventually leads to the Lycans's war against the vampires. Sheen and Mitra have an incredible chemistry and anyone knowing their love story on screen is to anticipate fatal outcome. Fans of Underworld won't be saddened here. I wish that the next movie will get back up with Selena and Michael now that the origin of the story has been fully told.Well all in all one fine prequel".

It seemed to focus around Selene kicking butt and mindless explosions and gore.But this movie totally blew me away. I'm writing this review over a day after I've seen it and I'm still jittery from how good it was.Okay bad points there are only a few main onesThe sex scene  not as bad as the one from Evo but we could've done without it. If I had a say in the matter I would say just edit out the last part. Those who have seen it will know what I'm talking about. While very original it made everyone go WTF.Luka  not quite sure what was up with her character but it was kind of a meaningless character that they introducedA couple of scenes or shots were a bit awkward like Lucian falling off a cliff with two vampires  it seemed like that scene from Psycho when Martin Balsam's character falls down the stairs Some of the dialog was off  either cheesy or too predictable.WAY TOO SHORT! I know a lot us would've liked to see more development in Sonja  Lucian's relationship and starting it where it did just kinda left some us going ?Good points plenty hereRHONA MITRA. From the beginning I've been supportive of her taking on the female lead. The writers did a good job with her  independent strong witty rebellious without being annoying. She played the character extremely well! Going in I didn't think I would be so attached to her character at all  and I wound up liking Sonja more than Selene in the end and this is saying a lot!. Sonja has more depth than Selene did especially after Evo. Kudos writing staff and Rhona.Chemistry. I couldn't help but feel so much for these Sonja and Lucian characters that weren't even on my top three until the end of this movie. Now they're at the top. Their relationship although rushed was truly touching. I found myself invested in their fates and getting emotional over something I knew was coming.The writing was pretty good  better than Evo. There was a story and the dialog did justice to all the characters. Tanis and Viktor who I was afraid I would wind up hating now that Kraven is not there were written in a way that you just had to admire and love the more. The addition of Raze as well as some clips from the first Underworld tied ROTL with the first one.The acting. I think there may have been one weak character and the rest of the cast worked well together and alone. Michael Sheen Bill Nighy Steven Macintosh Rhona Mitra and all the supporting cast were superb. You simply cannot ask for a better ensemble!The music in my opinion was added at the right timescenes at the right volume. The score and soundtrack have the same feel as the first movie which it should considering it's the same fabulous composer.The beginning and the ending I would not change a thing. It was perfect. The beginning is a wonderful introduction to the movie and the ending is a nice connection to the first movie.I think this movie worked out so well because it has a nice mixture of what made the first two movies good in my opinion. It had most of the original cast and characters a strong female lead with a strong male counterpart it wasn't so long that it lost your interest and it had a strong enough plot line to carry the movie in spite of a few weak points.Overall this was a pleasant surprise for devoted Underworld fans that waited 3 years and 3 days to see it and any newcomers that were looking for a decent movie to watch in theaters.VOTE 9.010".

Here the plot is easy to follow and in some ways this is very good film but someone behind the scenes didn't care so you're never completely drawn in simply put there is a lack of passion in how the film proceeds. I can't blame the script which moves along at a good clip nor can I blame the cast which includes Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen since they sell the material in more ways then it deserves.

Michael Sheen as Lucien as always was awesome only in this one there's so much more of him scenes and personality. The story is good the action is GREAT!!! In this one you really see why Lucien was such a menace to the vampires and not just an inconvenient annoyance. Just saw it last night and could have gotten in line to see it again when it ended.

At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic. Spoilers now. Castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps ? Enemies that don't attack during the day ? Big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a fledgling lycan leader after a minute or so ? Werewolves that den close to their enemies ? Lycans that raid armouries... for what ? They don't use axes and swords or armor ! A vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him ? The romance is so unconvincing its sad.So I don't recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some of the action is good to OK. Certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting. Otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie just a few hours ago at the Cleveland International Film Festival and I found it to be an excellent movie.I must strongly disagree with the other reviewers who've panned the movie.I'll admit that the movie has a few Hollywood elements and betterthanindie production values.  It also has an understated but important plot element that involves religion. It's also sentimental it could be classified as a date movie or even a family movie.This is a wonderful movie about freedom and redemption.  I found it wellcrafted wellacted Albert Finney is just terrific and for a movie with a bit of fantasy very much believable on that level with few plot holes.  Yes you just might figure out a few things half or threequarters of the way thru the flick but so what.I would urge anyone thinking about seeing this movie to reject the toocritical reviews. It's not a Coppola flick and it doesn't pretend to be. But it's not Ghost either.  This movie delivers what it promises  a good yarn told acted and directed well.On a slightly peripheral note I see that this movie finished in 2000 has yet to find a distributor.  This movie would be a winner at the box office. I'm not a moviemaker but I have a few friends who are.  I've heard them complain about not being able to find distributors for their very indie movies.  NOW I understand.Want to just have a nice enjoyable evening out at the movies?  Then go see Milo.".

It also has an understated but important plot element that involves religion. It's also sentimental it could be classified as a date movie or even a family movie.This is a wonderful movie about freedom and redemption.  I found it wellcrafted wellacted Albert Finney is just terrific and for a movie with a bit of fantasy very much believable on that level with few plot holes.

The first thing Elmore does is to take the young boy who is having a hard time adjusting to his new surroundings shopping at Bloomingdale's. After all if he is going to reside in New York City he'd better be well dressed! Elizabeth the young mother to be has had problems in her own life. Her own father left her when she was a girl and although happily married to Kevin a young artist even the impending arrival of their baby doesn't fill the void in her life. When she appears to be ready to deliver it turns to be a false alarm because of Milo's refusal to be born at that moment.Life on earth turns out to be what Elmore was looking for. He made a hard bargain in order to guide Milo around. When he meets an attractive woman they take a side trip to Atlantic City bringing Milo along because since the boy is lucky playing cards he wants to capitalize on the fact. Little does he know children are not allowed in the casinos. Elizabeth who also had come to Atlantic City because she feels lucky too meets Milo and bond. This convinces Milo to take the trip back to earth but Elmore is duped since he has to bring the boy back and he will not be able to go out again. Since his job is accomplished Elmore receives a complimentary move upstairs.Nick Castle's film is a fantasy. While most comments in this forum tend to be negative we thought it was a light comedy with charming characters and although we realize where Mr. Castle is taking us the ride proves to be fun.The film marks the film debut of Anton Yelchin an angelic looking child actor who has gone to bigger and better things. He is totally adorable without being bratty. His low key presence in the film works well. Albert Finney appears as Elmore the man who dares to bargain with a superior force. Mr. Finney is fine conveying what this man is like and he gets to recognize where he went wrong in his own life. Bridget Fonda plays Elizabeth the expecting mother. Campbell Scott a wonderful actor doesn't have anything to do as Kevin. Leslie Ann Warren Allison Lohman and the others in the cast to a good job under Mr. Castle's direction.Watching this film without expectations will probably will have the right effect on the viewer thanks to Nick Castle and his collaborators.".

They all appear to be young children and as each one exits a hand appears out of a great white light. The children are excited and happy for Milo.

The officials are desperate for a solution. Babies must be born in order and no babies can be born until Milo changes his mind. In the real world the big news story is the lack of births anywhere.Someone must accompany Milo to the real world and show him it is not such a bad place. The perfect candidate currently in limbo but content needs to do good deeds to get into Heaven. That man is Elmore.No one is supposed to leave this wonderful place. The door is an entrance not an exit. The waiting room looks like a nursing home except the people are welldressed. The desk clerk can't believe anyone would leave but an exception has been made. He wants Elmore to go. And so it happensElmore and Milo exit the door into the bustling New York City.Elmore is excited. This is the greatest city in the world! Milo is frightened and runs away. But it's not the only great city. When he was alive Elmore loved to gamble and Atlantic City is the paradise for gamblers. At least on the East Coast. And Anna is there to provide ... companionship.Elmore has 72 hours to change Milo's mind OR ELSE. And it's not going to be easy. But once no more babies are borneverthat's the end of the human race.Meanwhile Elizabeth must solve her problems. One is the fact that her father abandoned her when she was young. And the description of her father sounds a lot like someone we know ...Albert Finney does an amazing job. He has so much enthusiasm. He is the perfect bluecollar New Yorker who isn't quite perfect but who is everyone's friend.Anton Yelchin does a good job too. Milo is just naughty enough and just appealing enough but not overly sweet.I didn't care much for Bridget Fonda but she is attractive.It was disappointing to me to see the woman I knew as Cinderella playing a bimbo. But she does a good enough job.This movie has important lessons to teach us about family and what is really important in life. And while it has a few bad words and acknowledges that some people don't wait until marriage it is a family movie that older children can watch. At least I think so I can't recall if it was edited.This movie delivers!".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone.  He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver.  I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly it's about a little boy who is about to be born but as his mother goes into labor he refuses to come out!  This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born.  So Finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the Big Apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live.Despite the ridiculousness of the plot I could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical Hollywood sentimental moralistic message film.  Directorially the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem incapable of resisting.He further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment.  Whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story unraveled.  It was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away.Even Finney in his performance though satisfactory seemed a bit awkward and out of place and the little boy with curly locks though he was supposed to be cute was in fact rather dull.  Bridget Fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate Demi Moore's performance in 'Ghost' shedding tears at a moment's notice.I understand that the film has been unsuccessful thus far at getting distribution in the U.S. which surprises me as I think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit appealing to both kids and sentimental adults.  As far as the quality goes it's not an awful film it's just not very good.   4 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Delivering Milo is a mild fantasy set between earth and a mythical place where young children are waiting their turn to be born. It's sort of an eternal kids' domain where children around seven years old wait until it's their turn to enter life. They then walk through a door into a bright light and the next scene is a mother delivering a baby. Milo is a boy who doesn't want to leave the comfort of the place he's in. He's nervous about the unexpected. He'd rather stay where he is. It's not nirvana or heaven. There seems to be no activity other than sitting around and waiting. There are no things known in life  eating games shows working etc. It's just being. You might say Milo has no ambition or interest in anything. The trouble is that he can stop the whole process of children being born by not going through the door. This is just one of a few kooky aspects about this fantasy about life living and being born. Another one is the guy who's given another chance to reach a goal... probably heaven. He's in some other place that's not purgatory or hell and he comes to take Milo in his current age to New York city to see what life is really like. Albert Finney plays Elmore Dahl who has charge of Milo for this one day or two. Another part of the story is about Milo's mother and father as they wait for his delivery. She's nervous and worries that her husband may leave her. Her dad had abandoned her mother and her after she was born. Putting two and two together one might guess where this film goes from there. After one day in which no children were born anywhere in the world Milo meets his mom and decides to take the step to be born. Before that he was turned off on life because of the environment that Elmore favored. Finney's character is distasteful and doesn't seem to fit the story very well. Except for Bridget Fonda and Campbell Scott as Milo's parents the characters and story seem listless. This is supposed to be a comedy fantasy but it's a real stretch to find much humor. Here's a line that reflects the type and level of humor. Elmore Dahl Go ahead you'll love it. There's no way anyone can teach you about the pleasure of eating. You gotta do it yourself.I enjoy truly inspirational and moving stories. But for the life of me I can't see what some other reviewers find is so uplifting in this film. Unless it's Milo's desire at the end to be born. And that's just the natural inclination of all new life.".

When it comes to this movie however I'm not sure whether I believe in the big set or the little set. It's halfway between. In some ways the premise is familiarthere's a heaven of sorts where children hang out waiting for the appropriate time to be born. It's sort of like a big residential school all the children wearing neat school uniforms tended by young people in their late teens or early 20s in a space that's half neoclassical and half office building and all suffused with golden light. One of the children is Milo Anton Yelchin a curlyheaded kid adept at card tricks and telling fortunes. He likes it therewherever there isand so when Mr. Gordon pronounces him Ready To Go he's reluctant. The kids sit calmly in a big room scooting over in line as each of their friends walks through the Door into the bright light and takes the mother's hand and gets born. A nice whimsical conceit that manages to be matteroffact and sentimental at the same time. But Milo is apprehensive and refuses to go. This means the next kid can't get born and the team in the goldenlight place are worried. Meanwhile in New York there's a couple waiting for their first child to be born Elizabeth Bridget Fonda and Kevin Campbell Scott. They're an interesting pairhe is quiet and handsome and involved in some sort of wildly successful artistic production that involves glassblowing and a gigantic Manhattan warehousestudio and a large jovial assistant and he is kind and sympathetic most of the time and loves Elizabeth and even rides a motorcycle in his spare time. The problem is Elizabeth who is successful at whatever she does and is welldressed and quite lovely and happy with Kevin but she has doubts and selfdoubts stemming from the fact that her father walked out on her and her mother when she was little. She wants the baby but she's afraid. And just at the time Milo is waiting in the Door chamber she's going into labour and then when he runs out it stops. And so do all other births everywhere in the world. The attendants in conference get a telephone call from Upstairsa little piece of business the phones are the chunky old rotary ones but there are no cords. Somebody is going to take Milo to the world for a day to induce him to agree to getting born. It turns out to be Elmore Dahl Albert Finney a crusty jovial cardplaying con artist who wasn't bad enough to go Downstairs but certainly wasn't good enough to go Upstairs. He insists on a deal that if he succeeds he gets some more time alive and He agrees. Elmore and Milo take an elevator down to an intake unit sort of a hotel lobby also illuminated by the golden light and out they go onto the streets of New York. What follows is predictable Elmore takes Milo to his favourite places the Carnegie Deli Central Park the Statue of Liberty and buys him ice cream and other good foods. Milo is amused but then he's terrified by a Bosch painting in the Met and even when they get to Atlantic CityElmore has gotten himself attached to lush laughing eager divorce Anna Leslie Ann WarrenMilo is reluctant. And he's disturbed to learn that Elmore abandoned his family and he can't miss the signs of selfishness in Elmore's sometimes grotesque jollity. So everything is about to faileverythingthe Door will close no more babies will ever be born. Elmore gives up and tries to go to bed with Anna. Milo wanders on the boardwalk and runs into a weeping Elizabeth who's been reminded of her absent father enjoyed a freakish run of good blackjack luck at home with a pack of Atlantic City cards and then lost at the blackjack table. Milo is drawn to her and tries to cheer her up using the same techniques Elmore used on him and it works. Telling her fortune with a deck of cards Milo realizes who she ishis motherand has a change of heart and at the same time so does Elmore. They almost don't make it back Milo collapses outside the intake door as Elizabeth goes into labour again and Kevin shows up on his motorcycle to take care of her and Elmorehis grandfatherhas to choose to carry him back thus ending his brief reincarnation. He grimaces as he does so noting it's a case of the scammer scammed. Mr. Gordon says He works in mysterious ways. Milo is born and suddenly births happen again. Elmore is dischargedupstairs. In some ways the plot line is so predictable that one gets the feeling of dja vu and yet it's done so cleverly with a nice touch of dry humour in heaven and with a gigantic performance by Finney whose New York accent is pretty good and who is both lovable and outrageous and with solid performances by Fonda and Yelchin the very gifted Campbell Scott is underused herewith all this working in its favour the movie is surprisingly good in spite of its potential shortcomings.".

The problem is Elizabeth who is successful at whatever she does and is welldressed and quite lovely and happy with Kevin but she has doubts and selfdoubts stemming from the fact that her father walked out on her and her mother when she was little. She wants the baby but she's afraid. And just at the time Milo is waiting in the Door chamber she's going into labour and then when he runs out it stops. And so do all other births everywhere in the world. The attendants in conference get a telephone call from Upstairsa little piece of business the phones are the chunky old rotary ones but there are no cords. Somebody is going to take Milo to the world for a day to induce him to agree to getting born. It turns out to be Elmore Dahl Albert Finney a crusty jovial cardplaying con artist who wasn't bad enough to go Downstairs but certainly wasn't good enough to go Upstairs. He insists on a deal that if he succeeds he gets some more time alive and He agrees. Elmore and Milo take an elevator down to an intake unit sort of a hotel lobby also illuminated by the golden light and out they go onto the streets of New York. What follows is predictable Elmore takes Milo to his favourite places the Carnegie Deli Central Park the Statue of Liberty and buys him ice cream and other good foods. Milo is amused but then he's terrified by a Bosch painting in the Met and even when they get to Atlantic CityElmore has gotten himself attached to lush laughing eager divorce Anna Leslie Ann WarrenMilo is reluctant. And he's disturbed to learn that Elmore abandoned his family and he can't miss the signs of selfishness in Elmore's sometimes grotesque jollity. So everything is about to faileverythingthe Door will close no more babies will ever be born. Elmore gives up and tries to go to bed with Anna. Milo wanders on the boardwalk and runs into a weeping Elizabeth who's been reminded of her absent father enjoyed a freakish run of good blackjack luck at home with a pack of Atlantic City cards and then lost at the blackjack table. Milo is drawn to her and tries to cheer her up using the same techniques Elmore used on him and it works. Telling her fortune with a deck of cards Milo realizes who she ishis motherand has a change of heart and at the same time so does Elmore. They almost don't make it back Milo collapses outside the intake door as Elizabeth goes into labour again and Kevin shows up on his motorcycle to take care of her and Elmorehis grandfatherhas to choose to carry him back thus ending his brief reincarnation. He grimaces as he does so noting it's a case of the scammer scammed. Mr. Gordon says He works in mysterious ways. Milo is born and suddenly births happen again. Elmore is dischargedupstairs. In some ways the plot line is so predictable that one gets the feeling of dja vu and yet it's done so cleverly with a nice touch of dry humour in heaven and with a gigantic performance by Finney whose New York accent is pretty good and who is both lovable and outrageous and with solid performances by Fonda and Yelchin the very gifted Campbell Scott is underused herewith all this working in its favour the movie is surprisingly good in spite of its potential shortcomings.";

There is something very valuable about seeing ourselves through the eyes of others. In Atlantic City assumptions about the American way of life the American dream and the America reality circa 1978 are examined through the artistry of master French film director Louis Malle Murmur of the Heart 1971 Pretty Baby 1978 Au Revoir Les Enfants 1987 etc.The film begins with a shot of Sallie Matthews Susan Sarandon at 34 at the kitchen sink of her apartment squeezing lemons and rubbing them on her arms her neck her face as Lou Pasco Burt Lancaster at 68 watches unbeknownst to her from across the way the window of his apartment looking into hers. She works at a clam bar in a casino on the boardwalk which is why she smells like fish which is why she is squeezing lemon on herself to get rid of the smell.

It turns out that he is Sallie's estranged husband a deceitful little guy who has found a bag of cocaine that he intends to cut and sell and she is Sallie's not too bright sister very pregnant. They need a place to stay and have the gall to impose on her.Both Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances as was director Louis Malle and writer John Guare for his script. But none of them won. This was the year of On Golden Pond with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn taking the Oscars while Warren Beatty won Best Director for Reds. Best film was Chariots of Fire with Colin Welland winning the Oscar for his original screenplay. Nonetheless Lancaster and Sarandon are outstanding and they are both beautifully directed by Malle. Lancaster in particular demonstrated that at age 68 he could still fill up the screen with his sometimes larger than life presence. The familiar flamboyance and sheer physical energy that he displayed in so many films e.g. Come Back Little Sheba 1952 From Here to Eternity 1953 The Rose Tattoo 1955 Elmer Gantry 1960 to name four of my favorites are here properly subdued. He moves slowly and is easily winded. He is a sad cowardly old man whom Malle to our delight will miraculously transform.Sarandon's performance is also one of her best on a par with or even better than her work in Thelma and Louise 1991 for which she was also nominated for Best Actress and also did not win. She is an actress with legs this is a pun and an allusion to an inside joke about her famous other attributesnicely displayed in Pretty Babyover which perhaps too much fuss has already been made!an actress with legs as in a fine wine that will only get better with age. She like Goldie Hawn Catherine Deneuve and a few others have the gift of looking as good or better at fifty as they did at thirty.Louis Malle films are characterized by a tolerance of human differences a deep psychological understanding a gentle touch and an overriding sense of humanity. Atlantic City is no exception. What Malle is aiming at here is redemption. He wants to show how this pathetic old man finds selfrespect in an ironic way and how the clam bar waitress might be liberated. But he also wants to say something about America and he uses Atlantic City New Jerseythe lungs of Philadelphia the mafia's playground the New Yorker's escape a slum by the sea saved actually further exploited by the influx of legalized gambling in the seventiesas his symbol. He begins with decadence and ends with renewal and triumph and as usual somewhere along the way achieves something akin to the quality of myth. Even though he emphasizes the tawdry and the commonplace the untalented trio singing off key the slums semicircling the casinos where Lou sells numbers the boardedup buildings the sad tiny apartments about to be torn down Robert Goulet as a cheap Vegasstyle lounge act etc. in the end we feel that it's not so bad after all.I should also mention Kate Reid who played Grace the invalid exbeauty queen widow of a mobster who orders Lou about. She does a great job. Her character too will be transformed.If the late great Louis Malle was running the world the gross transgressors would surely get theirs and the rest of us would find forgiveness for our sins and renewal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Louis Malle his cast and his location really put this one over. It's well above the routine. Malle knows how to tell a story conventionally without screaming shock effects or outsize explosions or inyourface directorial banner headlines. When a pistol is fired it doesn't boom like dirty Harry's. It simply pops unobtrusively. It all flows along smoothly. And it's aptly titled. The story is as much about Atlantic City as it is about the residents and visitors we meet. It's like a Robert Altman movie except that it has a fascinating narrative that draws us in. We see the city first. A decrepit faux urban setting whose good days are long in the past. Woodrow Wilson used to summer nearby. It was called the lungs of Philadelphia. It boomed as a summer resort before commercial airlines vulgarized travel and brought Miami and Bermuda within easy temporal reach of the Northeast corridor. The older apartment buildings the ones with Queen Anne towers are being demolished to be replaced by the casinos that everyone assumes will bring prosperity back. They never did. The money stayed in the casinos or went out of state. But those sturdy old brick palaces were built to last and the apartments we see are shabby but cozy too. People have made nests in them over the years. The residents have accomodated their existences to the frames of the places they live in. People work in oyster bars or run numbers in the fallingapart rubbishstrewn black neighborhoods. They can if they have the money to do so dine in reasonably good restaurants or stroll on the boardwalks and we can almost hear the hoofbeats of yesteryear.What modern Atlantic City is to its brassy past Burt Lancaster is to his own history. He stalks the streets in his overcoat wearing the only tie he owns mutters things about how important he used to be once having shared a cell with Bugsy Siegal. He used to have to kill people once in a while he tells a young man confidentially. He always felt bad about it afterward and used to take a long swim in the ocean to feel clean again. I never saw the Atlantic Ocean until today says the kid. Lancaster turns around and looks out to sea and waves expansively. You should of seen the ocean then he says. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. His glorious career it turns out has about the same epistemological status as that of the city he hasn't been outside of for the past twenty years. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. What a line! And Lancaster handles it well too. He's no Crimson Pirate here just a quiet older guy with curly white hair trying to make a buck by running errands for smalltime hoods and trying to sell a silver cigarette case a memento of his past for a double sawbuck. He looks exactly right too. Not old exactly but well aged like a mature burgundy. His generously featured face hasn't drooped with the passage of the years. His eyebrows are dark and set off his surprisingly gentle eyes. He doesn't clip off the terminal contours of his sentences as he did before. It's a splendid performance.His performance is matched by that of the other principle actors. There are some quietly amusing episodes between him and the woman he takes care of. There is also a pretty gruesome lethal stabbing although without blood. Only the villains are onedimensional villains. Susan Sarandon is marvelous as the young oysterbar employee who wants to become a casino dealer even if it means putting up with hits from the oily French guy who teaches the fine art of dealing in a school run by the casinos. He smokes with a cigarette holder and sounds like Charles Boyer the swine. What a fine actress she is. Even here dressed in threadbare clothes her skirts around her ankles wearing clumsy boots her hair a mop of Scottish red she fixes a viewer's interest when she's on the screen. She's as vulnerable under those oyster shells as Lancaster is when he discovers he can't protect her from the villains. And the two of them have a tender love scene together and later a more raucous good time. In the end they go their separate ways  Lancaster back to his destiny and Sarandon in search of hers. The characters in the film bounce around at first at odds with one another or simply unaware of the others' presence but Malle draws them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care about. It's a fine movie.".

And the two of them have a tender love scene together and later a more raucous good time. In the end they go their separate ways  Lancaster back to his destiny and Sarandon in search of hers. The characters in the film bounce around at first at odds with one another or simply unaware of the others' presence but Malle draws them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care about. It's a fine movie.";

This time he's Lou Pascal an oldtime small hood playing out his days in pathetic manner in a dingy Atlantic City. In fact seedy describes Atlantic City in this picture.There's nothing seedy about the opening scene however. It's an attention grabber at least if you're a male. We see Susan Sarandon squeezing lemon juice over her breasts at the kitchen window. Later we see her do the same thing.The film is no lemon however. It's an excellent film and Lancaster Sarandon Sally Matthews and her husband Dave Robert Joy comprise most the early going. Joy's role as Sally's loser druggie husband was ugly but he doesn't last long in the film. The second half of the film features mostly the two stars both of whom were up for Academy Awards for their performance and lost out in a sentimental vote for the On Golden Pond crowd. Not only do Lancaster and Sarandon excel but so does director Louis Malle.Malle makes this almost a modernday film noir with the grittiness of the characters and the setting when Atlantic City looked its worst. It's just solid filmmaking allaround and few people could play intense characters young or old as well as Lancaster.My only regret is the transfer on the DVD. It's a little grainy and this film deserves better treatment. although come to think of it  the grain is appropriate considering it's a gritty story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Atlantic City features some interesting characters whose paths cross at a time in the city's history when it's undergoing radical change and many of the decaying old edifices are being demolished to make way for modern casinos. This movie is both an unconventional love story and a crime drama but it's also a story about past disappointments and dreams of a better future.Sally Matthews Susan Sarandon is an ambitious young woman who left her drab life in Canada to look for something better in Atlantic City. She works at a local oyster bar but is also learning French and training to be a blackjack dealer as she dreams of someday working in a casino in Monte Carlo. At the end of her working day she returns to the run down apartment block where she lives and routinely cuts lemons and rubs the juice into her upper body to eliminate the smell of fish.Lou Pascal Burt Lancaster is an elderly numbers runner who lives in a neighbouring apartment and regularly watches Sally's nightly ritual. In the past he used to work for some notorious gangsters who he greatly admired but these days he takes care of the bedridden Grace Pinza Kate Reid who's his old boss' widow. She lives in the same building and habitually insults and humiliates him because she knows he depends on the money she pays him.Sally's past life is brought back into sharp focus when her exhusband Dave Robert Joy unexpectedly turns up with her pregnant sister Chrissie Hollis McLaren who's the current woman in his life. Sally is angry that they've followed her to her new home but even more serious problems follow as Dave has stolen a substantial quantity of cocaine from some mobsters in Philadelphia and they're on his tail. Dave gets to know Lou and uses him to help to sell the dope.When the Philadephia mob catch up with Dave and kill him Lou is left with the cocaine and a significant amount of money. This transforms his life as he suddenly has the means to buy a new suit and hat and be generous to Sally as they begin a relationship. Suddenly this impoverished lonely old man who's nostalgic for the good old days and tells people exaggerated stories about his exploits and importance in the criminal world finds himself financially well off. Even better however when Sally's threatened by the gangsters who think that she must have their stolen cocaine he steps in and protects her and this makes him feel incredibly proud and exhilarated.Neither Sally nor Lou genuinely expect their offbeat relationship to be forever but it does nevertheless have a very positive effect on both their lives.Atlantic City is well written and skilfully balances the poignancy of its story with some moments of humour and a very unexpected ending. Its greatest quality however is its ability to convey so powerfully the plight of its two main characters who are both regretful about the disappointments of their pasts and preoccupied by dreams of a better future. Their circumstances are portrayed with great sensitivity and warmth and placing them in an environment that is also undergoing a period of transformation is extremely effective.Burt Lancaster is equally as convincing in portraying Lou's pathetic nostalgia for his fictionalised past as he is at conveying his immense pride and excitement when he successfully protects Sally. His performance and that of Susan Saradon are top class and contribute massively to the success of this wonderful movie.".

Back in the life though unwittingly he sells the coke to an ongoing poker game in one of the suites in a new hotel bit by bit and falls into the romance of his dreams with young Susan Sarandon whom he watched every night from his hotel room as she bathed her breasts with lemon juice in her room across the way. Like the refurbishing city its set in he feels rejuvenated and in one instance even fearless in the face of the ruthless Philly dealers. The film put Lancaster back in the limelight for a while and refreshingly so. Its gritty realism and characters especially Joy who makes an excellent hippie conman marked the end of an era of that realistic 70's urban crime drama genre that deftly mixed romance with drugs and violence and portrayed the underworld mostly minus the cops so well.".

The paths of all the characters cross yet as I said again it's mostly low key most important the relationship of escape routes develop for the lives of both Lou and Sally upon meeting. And the scenes of seeing Susan Sarandon wash and bath by rubbing lemon juice from squeezed lemons was very sexy! Clearly one of the more erotic memories in cinema history. Louis Malle wrapped it up well by being low key ending with both male and female lead characters getting what they wanted escaping to a new life. The scenes of A.C. was great and to top it all off Burt Lancaster was very classy and smooth in his performance.".

Lancaster plays Lou a smalltime mobster from the old days of Atlantic City. He is handsome dresses very grandly and pretends that he used to be in the bigtime. Actually he worked in some menial job for a mobster and now takes care of his widow Grace Kate Reid who appears bedridden at first. He takes care of her dog makes her food rubs her limbs to increase circulation and occasionally sleeps with her. She's verbally abusive to him. Grace came to Atlantic City in the '40s as a contestant in a Betty Grable lookalike contest met her future husband and never left.Lou meets a young waitress and wouldbe croupier Sally and their lives soon collide. He's attracted to her. Sally's sister has run off with Sally's husband and the two show up to stay with her. Her sister is pregnant. Sally's husband Dave is there to do a drug deal he meets Lou and stores the cocaine in Lou's apartment. People are after him so he sends Lou to someone's apartment on a delivery and Lou is to pick up the money. When Lou arrives home after the errand Dave is dead. The thugs didn't get their dope so eventually they turn to Sally. In fact Lou has the dope and also the money from the first delivery. And he plans on taking up where Dave left off.This is such a welldone film hearkening back to the old days of Atlantic City just as the city is being rebuilt as a eastern Las Vegas. Lou is part of the old days Sally is ambitious and wants to better herself. Lou never anybody now longs to be somebody for her.The acting is wonderful. Burt Lancaster is magnificent as Lou an old man who still has young dreams. It's a very subtle performance very touching and sometimes funny. Susan Sarandon does a great job as Sally creating a totally believable character.John Guare has written a great script the first important component of a film and it was in the hands of a master Louis Malle. The film was made in Canada and I recognized many Canadian actors but the location shots are excellent.Highly recommended a sublime experience.".

The director Louis Malle has incredible discipline in holding back and treating his story and details with excellent care. That ability to hold back is very rare in movie directors it's just so much easier to go ahead and produce a cheap thrill for the audience.   The actors and acting is definitely a large part of the movie's charm. Burt Lancaster is great his oldtimer disdain and worldweariness practically drips off this man. But he's not so bitter and dried up that he can't enjoy life. Sarandon is outstanding i think. She's also very sexy. Her large and liquid eyes are incredible!Overall a great movie.

	schema:reviewBody "In his fourth Academy Award nominated role Burt Lancaster essays the role of Lou Pasco low level numbers runner and guardian and service provider to Kate Reid a former gangster's moll from the old days. As you might have reasonably guessed from the title role this all takes place in Atlantic City which in 1980 was undergoing a rebirth.The one time resort town was undergoing a facelift when this film takes place. Legalized gambling was coming in and a lot of the old town was being torn down to make room for spanking new casinos. Burt's story parallels that of Susan Sarandon who is working in one of the hotel buffet lines and also going to school to learn to be a dealer when new casinos do finally open up. They live in adjoining buildings.But like the proverbial bad penny her husband Robert Joy shows up with a pregnant Holly McLaren. Joy has stolen a nice little package of heroin from the mob and he's looking to make a quick sale. He brings Lancaster into the deal but manages to get himself killed in the process. That forces Lancaster and Sarandon into an alliance of convenience but who would think at Burt's age and he was 76 when he made Atlantic City he'd find love as well. Both Lancaster and Sarandon are so good as players they don't look foolish in the romance department.And after over 30 years in the lower levels of the underworld Burt finally makes his bones. It's a surprise unto himself.Atlantic City was shot in Atlantic City an Atlantic City we'll not see any more because it's now looking so different than what you're seeing in this film. Some interior stuff was shot in Montreal and the film wrapped on the last day of 1980 and released in 1981.Atlantic City got Oscar nominations for Lancaster and for Susan Sarandon and both ran up against On Golden Pond and lost to Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. Director Louis Malle and the film itself were up as well but lost to Warren Beatty for Reds and Chariots of Fire for Best Film. Chariots of Fire writer Colin Welland also beat writer John Guare for Best Original Screenplay. Five nominations but not a winner for any of the categories.Still Atlantic City has become a minor classic and it did revive the career of Burt Lancaster somewhat. Lancaster was aging and he knew it. He transitioned nicely into character parts in his last productive decade as a result of Atlantic City.Not a bad reason for him to take this film assignment.".

Atlantic CITY deservedly won several accolades at the time  including the Golden Lion Prize at the Venice Film Festival and quite a few plums to Lancaster himself  but then it was criminally neglected at the Oscars even if the film was up for the 5 top awards and was in my opinion better than most of the eventual winners!".

For lack of a better tag and because both city and script are built around the magnetic lure of easy money the film might be called a crime story but the richness of John Guare's screenplay filled as it is with broken dreams and rose colored memories says a nostalgic Bert Lancaster You should've seen the Atlantic Ocean back then can't be pigeonholed so lightly.";

It's pleasingly voyeuristic without crossing the line into perversion and hey it's just a nice way to start the movie.At first I found it a little hard to accept Lou Pascal Burt Lancaster 67 yearsold but still ten times as dapper as you or I will ever be as the smalltime former gangster that he's evidently supposed to have been. How could Burt Lancaster have ever been known to his mob cronies as Numbnuts I wondered. By the end of the film he had me convinced that he really was a smalltimer who'd lucked out and gotten one last shot at being what he always wanted to be. I still wondered exactly why he'd never made good before but for me the fact that he convinced me but still left a lot of unexplored depth to the character is what makes his performance so great.Director Louis Malle strikes exactly the right balance between nostalgia and a bizarre sort of hopeful redemption. You'll know what I mean when you see Lou's exhilaration towards the end at a deed which shouldn't really leave one feeling exhilarated is that a spoiler. He's just so happy that despite his various criminal undertakings you can't help but feel good for the old guy.The cinematography made me feel good too Atlantic City is really a beautifully shot film. There's a great synthesis of natural and artificial light that makes everything look just a little better than realistic. Speaking of nostalgia this sort of cinematography is a talent that sadly seem to have fallen off these days. If you haven't seen it in the theater or on DVD you should do so it's a world apart from the grimy cable version I first saw.".

At the same time waitress Sally Sarandon steals money from Lou despite their romantic overnighters. And that's after he's offered her a glorious life for them in sunny Florida. But behind that charming smile lies an unrelenting brain as she drives on toward her card dealing dream in ritzy Monaco. Perhaps tellingly we're not shown her upshot unlike what happens to Lou. Then there's the bedridden Grace Reid. Her dream may well be regaining mobility instead of just lying in bed complaining and imposing on Lou for her daily needs. With that dream fulfilled thanks to Lou's newfound and nonmercenary commitment she finds reason to walk.Perhaps this is what underlies that final dignified shot of Lou and Grace walking together along a rebuilding Atlantic City whose own yearnings are underway. That last shot is a portrait of dreams maybe not well understood or morally deserved but at last fulfilled. Thus an unusually thoughtful 100minutes is topped off.".

Shortly after her arrival a local preacher Cort is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest Herod. Herod is also the owner leader and ruler of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gunshowoff so that the preacher who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod acknowledging Cort as one of the best is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ...";

	schema:headline " More style than substance but good fun as a modern spin on the spaghetti genre";
	schema:reviewBody "In the Western town of Redemption John Herrod runs everything they say he gets half of every dollar spent or earned.  In order to face his enemies face on he runs an annual quick draw contest where fights battle each other until only one remains.  The winner takes home a small fortune  the losers leave wounded if they are lucky.  Into this contest comes a group of hopefuls including a woman who has personal reasons for signing up.Looking at the list of names it is evident that the casting director is very good at hisher job as they managed to catch several big names get several stars who were a few years away from hitting big and also get veteran faces as well.  The ensemble of well known faces suits this film as the focus is very much on style and appearance than it is on substance.  As a plot it takes the well known genre of the revenge western and makes a sort of pastiche of it.  Thus we have the OTT and hyper direction of Rami and gun fights that are delivered with energy and shots that have no bearing to reality.When I think about the actual plot it really should bother me more than it does.  The plot is pretty thin and contains nothing that you can't see coming from about the first 20 minutes of the film  certainly the woman's secret' will be no mystery to anyone who has seen Once Upon A Time In The West' which it clearly apes in this regard.  What exists in the place of a wider plot is characters and style.  The style is fun and energetic and will appeal to fans of Evil Dead etc.The characters themselves are also pretty good each has a little back story which helps to fill out the running time without getting too serious.  Stone does surprisingly well in the lead she's no Clint Eastwood but she leads the cast well  which is no mean feat when you look at the credits.  Hackman is a gleefully good villain  even more mean and unrepentant that his character in Unforgiven.  Crowe and DiCaprio were both a few years from the levels of stardom they now hold but both are engaging and enjoyable.  The support cast is also full of names and faces you'll recognise  either as solid support actors of recent films or older faces.  For example  Henriksen David Sinise Hingle Bell and Blossom.Overall this film might infuriate you if you are looking for a film that has more substance than style as this is the other way round.  However fans of Rami's style andor revenge westerns will find much to enjoy here.  Every time I see it I always find it hard not to get caught up in the atmosphere it creates.".

This movie was a spaghetti western it was ABOUT spaghetti westerns and it was also a weird wonderful nightmare where your options are limited you're a superhero and your enemy is allpowerful. That's adolescent silly and totally compelling.Raimi has always done brilliant visuals I don't know his history but I suspect he read a lot of pulp comics as a kid. The early scene where Stone gets up after playing dead and you see her shadow putting her hat back on with the obvious bullet hole in the brim is sheer visual brilliance.Gene Hackman is of course great MST3K line He's good in everything!. Sharon Stone has gotten a lot of static for doing what Clint Eastwood built a legend on bad acting done intensely. And in Stone's case in this flick I think purposefully. Leonardo D. is wellcast as a cocky yet needy bada in his own mind type. Russell Crowe who nobody knew at the time especially me is great in his role as a survivor of a 12step program to help fight a dependence on violence complete with backsliding moments.Do not look to this movie expecting anything like realism believability or moderation. This is pulp fiction eye candy nightmare surrealism wanton entertainment. It's trash culture saluting trash culture and if you can appreciate that it's a hell of a great ride.".

Bottom line this is a high concept film that is much more entertaining than you would guess. The timeline is fascinating. In the 1960s after a halfcentury run and massive exposure on the new medium called Television the classic western started to disappear. But as they say nature abhors a vacuum and at the same time the sun started to set on the traditional western it started to rise on something called the italian westerns or reimaginings of the genre from Europe. This is for example how Clint Eastwood went from forgotten TV actor Rawhide to 1 box office attraction. This new genre lasted barely 15 years or so and soon disappeared as well. Yet out of nowhere 20 years later someone in Tinseltown gets the idea to reimagine the ALREADY REIMAGINED western this time starring a female. Sharon Stone was past the apex of her career by this point making the project more of a challenge. The other talent was awesome. A preOscar Russell Crowe a preTitanic diCaprio and all backstopped by Hackman I mean wow. The big question did it actually work? Answer yes. It was uneven in parts and an argument could be made that Hackman overdid the bad guy role or alternatively the part was overwritten. Stone was awesome proving she had the chops to take on a bizarre role and make it hers. Actually gets better with each successive viewing.".

There is some spectacular cinematography and creatively conceived shots from director Sam Raimi and his team. A particularly memorable shot is the one of the sunlight shining through the bullet hole of the victim's head. In my opinion the two drawbacks of The Quick and the Dead are the thin plot and the relative scarcity of dialogue. With a cast like this it's a bit of a shame that it is underutilized.

The preacher in here is questionable as such. No real preacher uses the Lord's name in vain which Crowe did twice here. His theology also is not Biblically more like clueless Hollywood stereotypes. Also there was a bit too much of the feminist slant in here. Then again since Stone coproduced the film it's not surprising.

Hes famous for that and is always enjoyable to watch. Seeing Dicaprio and Crowe in one of their earliest films was the most fun to watch. These are arguably the actors of the decade and seeing them perform at such a young age is very absorbing. Who I found annoying was Sharon Stone. The idea of her role was stupid the way it was performed was ridiculous and its just not a role to be taken seriously.As I was watching the movie I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie this was or even attempting to be. At times it seemed like a drama or an action flick. At other times it seemed like a parody and sometimes it even looked like it was heading towards the direction of a romance. The bottom line is that this film is confused within itself.

	schema:reviewBody "The Western is my favorite movie genre and I've seen hundreds of them. After a while it's difficult to find anything unique about them because it's usually the good guys versus the bad guys and when you get to the end justice is generally served. The Quick and The Dead combines elements of your typical Western themes the evil town boss who rules with an iron will gunslingers out to prove who's the fastest draw and the noname stranger who hits town seeking revenge for a past wrong. There's even a former outlaw who's turned to the Bible in an effort to seek redemption adding some resonance to the name of the town where the story takes place.What I think is cool about this picture is the stylized approach director Sam Raimi brings to the project  not quite parody but definitely not a straight on revenge Western. Many of the characters are brought to life with their own over the top characterizations my favorite being the card sharp liar Ace Hanlon Lance Henricksen. You know he's good as a quick draw artist you just don't know how fast he really is until villain Herod Gene Hackman chews him up and spits him out. Other outrageous characters include Scars Mark Boone Junior and Dog Kelly Tobin Bell who add some zest to the picture.The twist to the story if there is one is that the main protagonist is a woman Sharon Stone as the unnamed Lady until she's named by preacher Cort in their showdown. The Lady's history is told in flashback throughout the picture to prepare the viewer for the eventual finale. So when you see Cort Russell Crowe gun down The Lady it's an instinctive 'Oh no' moment that seems to undercut the basis for the story. Yet it's just another clever ruse thrown in by Raimi to divert our attention and set us up for the final showdown.What Western movie purists will object to are some of the cartoonish elements used to overemphasize a point such as Ace Hanlon's back flip over his horse to shoot the ace card or the bullet hole through Herod's head when Ellen gets her revenge. I have to admit I was put off by some of those antics upon my first viewing but now take them in stride as the kind of excess that bring an element of fun to the movie. That and the great assemblage of players who appear here many of whom were yet to hit the big time. Instinctively I get the impression that this was a blast to make for all the principals involved.".

	schema:headline " The end of Sam Raimi the innovator";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1995 Sam Raimi had become known as the director of a rather quirky and original horror film that in spite of being shot full frame with terrible actors displayed a talent for composition not seen in some time. However he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be cool with a horrorcomedy where violence has no visible consequences and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera. Individuals singing Raimi's praises will have you believe such was the best thing Raimi had done at the time. Unfortunately what it really was was Raimi demonstrating that he had run out of ideas that he could call his own and was now getting his repertoire fed to him by the most disingenuous moneymen of the industry. In spite of a heroic attempt a few years later to return to the style of creating characters with The Gift The Quick And The Dead can be labelled the moment where Sam Raimi the innovative new voice behind The Evil Dead or Darkman was gone forever.While it is all but taken as read that a Sam Raimi film will be a hamfest with more clichs than a filmmaking class nowadays nobody was quite prepared for how he displayed the fact in The Quick And The Dead. They say that when you put together a film in which the characters are the story you best have good actors behind them. Unfortunately with the exceptions of Russell Crowe Lance Henriksen and Gene Hackman every actor in this film comes off as being utterly terrible. Even Lance who by this time had the making of great characters out of terrible scripts down to an art comes off as a complete nonentity here. Hence I have no hesitation at all in placing a share of the blame upon writer Simon Moore. For all of his faults Raimi at least knows how to salvage a character in the editing process. And when your cast includes the men who played Bishop or Lex Luthor it is hard to blame the problem on the actors. Henriksen's performance however will get the more ignorant placing the blame on the cast.Sharon Stone makes that an easy mistake to make unfortunately. From the second she enters the town set she makes it abundantly clear that she has seen one too many Sergio Leone films and thought I can do that. And to be fair for those who have not seen The Good The Bad And The Ugly or Once Upon A Time In The West Stone appears to be doing a good job. Compounding the problem however is that neither writer nor director seem to have any idea which scenes they should not be stealing from. The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gobsmacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end. It was literally the final word. Unfortunately Raimi tries to oneup Leone's signature scene in a flashback where Hackman forces Stacy Linn Ramsower as the young Ellen to shoot her father dead. Not only is the tone of the scene entirely off the total absence of any proper leadup completely undercuts the drama of the sequence.Equally terrible is Leonardo DiCaprio as Fee or The Kid as he is called during the film. DiCaprio has finally proved in such pieces as Blood Diamond or The Departed that he can act but after The Quick And The Dead anyone could be forgiven for thinking DiCaprio came straight from a high school drama. During the entire film The Kid is only a whiny brat who starts to bawl when things do not entirely go his way. When he meets his end the scene is so perfunctory so devoid of weight that while Hackman lends some muchneeded credibility with his totally unmoved reactions Stone destroys the whole thing with some incredible overacting. It is not entirely DiCaprio's or even Stone's fault as the script gives them absolutely no development or buildup for this moment. DiCaprio is clearly in over his head playing a character that the writer and director apparently could not give two figs about. The sad thing is that with all the weight Stone was throwing around on the set it would have done wonders if she had recognised this problem and addressed it.This partly leads me to believe others may be right when they say that The Quick And The Dead needed another hour of footage or script in order to accomplish its goals. With more time and development in the early stages the constant parade of characters both minor and major could have had some impact. Unfortunately with very few exceptions and minor ones at that the deaths in The Quick And The Dead are merely a parade of images. Perhaps The Quick And The Uninteresting would have been a more appropriate title. And when one remembers that this film was put together by the same man who gave us such a haunting creepy atmosphere in The Evil Dead or such a horrifyingly real tragic hero in Darkman it makes The Quick And The Dead such a bitter pill to swallow. Not that we honestly could have expected much more. The Western as a genre has been thoroughly tapped out and it would take a truly incredible film to give it new life. The kind of film that The Quick And The Dead is not.The Quick And The Dead is a four out of ten film. I have seen plenty of films that are worse but in light of what its director used to be capable of I have seen very few that are so incredibly frustrating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a typical western motif and mix it with a huge cast of recognizable faces and you have this genre throwback. Including Sharon Stone doing her take on 'the lady with no name'. With a dark past she comes into a town gone straight to hell that's run by a nasty outlaw played by Hackman who usurps his power over the townsfolk that equally hate and fear him. It's here where these characters meet for the town's last man standing duel. Where the prize is to die for and of course many will before it's all over. I really gotta talk about the cast compliment. It's the meal ticket. Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman I've already mentioned but also Russell Crowe and Leonard Dicaprio both before stardom Lance Henriksen Pat Hingle Gary Sinise Keith David and a bunch of other bit players you'll probably recognize too. Stone's got her role down pat. Gene Hackman does justice to his mean embittered role almost relishing it. Russell Crowe shows a glimmer of what's to come from him although his character isn't that deep. Lance Henriksen as the slick gunfighter Ace Hanlon is a treat while Dicaprio is given a pretty straight laced role while not restricting doesn't allow him much place to go.I don't think its unfair to say the story is rather predictable but it's still worth tuning in for. For no other reason  let's be honest  the gun battles. The showdowns. Yes characters and a story go along way but you want to see people get kablamed too. On that angle this movie performs nicely with fine camera work and direction by Sam Raimi of all people. Using a large town clock with a big 'ol wooden pair of hands that creak when they move was a masterful touch.It's first and foremost action that wins out but contains enough goings on in the thinking department to be satisfactory. With subplots ranging from hidden agendas broken pasts and character morality. Some are there to win the trunk load of money others are there cause they've got nothing to lose. Some are there to prove themselves. May it be to others or to themselves. Gritty yet slick satisfying to a classic western fan 'The Quick and the Dead' is a modern slice of spaghetti bravado.".

The plot if you'd care to call it one goes sharply downhill from there dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus.

That said it is very funny with some good gags. Plus the french locations are stunning the car chases are awesome and the martial arts sequences are absolutely great. Other pluses are the snappy direction a cool soundtrack and a smoking hot Emma Sjoberg aka Wiklund.

Just a ordinary very funny comedy.Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal return when a Japanese minister comes to France for some kind of new defense strategy. Of course that strategy has to be showed and than it goes wrong. The Japanese minister is kidnapped and the police tries with the help of Samy Naceri to get him back.The final of the film is a bit overdone when almost a dozen policecars hit each other near to the Eiffel tower. Absolutely not realistic but that's not such a bad thing isn't it? It's the result of a great carchase before and the things that happen then are so dumb but so funny irresistible. The greatest moment of the movie is when Samy Naceri Frederic Diefenthal some Japanese girl and the military father of Samy Naceri's girlfriend jump out of a plane. And when they come down...great great great great!Taxi 2 is a real mustsee. Typically French but great fun.".

Taxi 2 in my opinion is definitely an improvement over the first one since it's even more crazier than the original but also it's far more interesting as well definitely a good sequel to the first. 910".

Her father is called away but as he leaves his car is hit it will be up to Daniel to get him to airport to greet the visiting Japanese Secretary of State for Defence. It turns out he is in France to look at various projects including a new car which is apparently impregnable. A problem with the airbags means the official driver can't demonstrate the vehicle so Daniel is asked to take him for a spin! Meanwhile a group of Yakuza are plotting to kidnap the visiting dignitary it will be up to Daniel and his policeman friend Emilien to thwart their plans.This sequel was a laughriot from start to finish the action is delightfully over the top and hilariously silly. We get numerous scenes of Daniel and his taxi racing through the streets at ridiculous speeds and even being parachuted into Paris! There is also the hilarious scenes where Emilien is repeatedly beaten during judo training and a senior police officers attempts to teach his officers a few words of Japanese not to mention his casual racism.Samy Naceri does a fine job as Daniel making us believe in the character despite the things he gets involved with. Frdric Diefenthal also impresses as his friend Emilien especially in the scenes between his character and Petra a fellow police officer. Marion Cotillard does a good job as Daniel's girlfriend Lilly but is sadly rather underused. Overall I heartily recommend this to anybody wanting a really good laugh it may not be realistic but it is hilarious.".

This is a film that I sat down with my boy to watch and he absolutely loved it. A ton of car chases and a fantastic number of action sequences make for an enthralling film and an absolute must see.Again this is a thousand times better than much of the CGI faked scenes that we are accustomed to with only Vantage Point in recent years coming close to giving us what we get in this film.Fantastic fun!".

Its a comedy at heart and its got that beautiful 406 back wings anyone?Yamakaze makes its input onto the big screen a very french thing. Yamakaze is the popping of walls. big falls and surviving.All your favourite charicters are back and its just as intense as the first but not as good. Its a steady 7 outta 10".

Which is no bad thing really. The film seems like a computer game all the way through. High on action low on story at only 84 minutes. The cars new wings seem to have been lifted straight out of the game San Francisco Rush 2049 but I wouldn't have thought Luc Besson would actually have played it. Coincidence?

The driving scenes are awesome once again.  And a GREAT first 10 minutes that puts you back in the mood of the original.Two characters Gibert and Bertineau are very funny indeed.  The Ninja stunt by the Chief is hilarious and the gnral will probably become a recurring character in an other film or series maybe he already is !.  In fact they steal the show as the other characters are not as good as they were in the first movie.  The film uses all the talents and flaws of each character seen in the first movie and stretches them.  Two times is okay but I hope they will find a new angle in the next one.I suppose also that the final scene was an hommage to The Blues Brothers otherwise it's a steal OR they ran out of budget to do it as big as the original.The thing that bothered me though was the pace of the movie.  In Taxi 1 there was a rythm much closer to american cinema than French.  In comedy timing is everything you have to give the audience that half second needed laugh at the joke.  I have always felt that French comedy movies were way too speedy especially in editing and dialog  even in other French blockbusters like Les Visiteurs 1 and 2 I always had the feeling the French are hyperactive in word and action having met some this is obviously not true.  Taxi 2 was closer to these films than Taxi 1 though much more bearable.  I hope that the 3rd one will come back to a good plot with a better slowed pace.But other than that  a fun movie.  Fast food cinema. Yummy.".

But the movie isn't just about car chasing and crashing in the streets of Marseille and Paris. The heart of this movie is its great humour due to the excellent dialogues. But you have to watch it in french if you understand french because the translation of it can never come close to what it means in its original language.

The Belgian criminal slightly stupid gangsters terribly inept policemen shootouts chases fights drugs football  everything is mixed up and served so hot so immediate so tasty and so refreshingly funny. This is a great example that Part Four sometimes may be very good.";

	schema:reviewBody "The fourth and last so far entry in the longrunning Taxi series is a mild disappointment. There are few carchaseandcrash thrills and lengthy talky passages have taken their place. Instead of a climactic chase we get a belated Scarface parody. However the enduring appeal of these characters some good laughs Yes the Belgian confessed everything. We used the opportunity to close a few other cases too! and a fun cameo for football soccer for Americans fans at the start help keep this sequel painless. One of its best points by far is the return of Emma Sjberg as Petra. In this one she goes undercover as a brunette and she reminded me of Jennifer Garner in one of her Alias disguises. In fact considering her Amazonian looks and matching fighting abilities briefly shown here but showcased better in Taxi 2 it's a wonder that her film career basically consists only of this series and a Dennis Rodman vehicle.

The ingredients of the taxi movies are excellent but the script was quite lacking this time!! Luc Besson has to make a part 5 to keep all lovers satisfied!! though it is nice to see all actors are still in place! like family you haven't seen in a long time! commissaire gilbert is far out the most excellent person in the movie! The part of Belgium Vlaanderen is known for speaking dutch and from the Brussels region it is french and dutch so one comment isn't quite fair to say they got it wrong with the language! The bankemployee was from Brussels so it could be true! however the french are known for being very chauvinistic so if you look closer to this movie and for example wasabi and earlier taxi parts you notice Japanese people and Germans speak perfectly french! I think it is better to make the movie more international with other languages spoken. Not just one phrase in German or Japanese and that's it... The car in this movie is hot!! I do hope everybody agrees in that?!".

Sure the whole gang are all there but unfortunately the action isn't. There must have been less than 20 minutes of decent chases crashes and other action in the entire movie and the gags and humor were getting a little tired after the 3 previous movies. I didn't hate the movie but I wished I'd spent my money on something else once I discovered it paled into insignificance compared to the original. I'm not sure what Luc Besson was up to or was on when making this movie but I find it interesting that there's a new 'mobile internet' website for finding taxis on your mob phone with the exact same name  t4xi.mobi  and that on youtube right now there's ' T4XI ' video clips all over the place! Whether this is some last minute attempt to cross market or boost ticket sales I don't know but it's interesting to note that the t4xi.mobi site appeared at almost the same time as T4XI the movie. Hmm... Could be marketing but could be just coincidence. It's so hard to tell nowadays! Anyway after seeing Taxi 4 I was thinking that maybe I'd just out grown that sort humor but no it wasn't that at all. It was just plain b ! I can't bring myself to say that 3 letter 'b' word not of Luc Besson so I'll just say it was lacklustre! I really think T4XI has taken its last ride!".

	schema:reviewBody "After the misstep of the American Taxi film which compressed the three French films into one gender reversed tale Luc Besson tries to strike gold again with a new film with the original cast.Picking up several years after the last film with the two buddies Taxi driver Daniel and Cop Emilien dealing with their own kids as well as a Belgian super criminal the police force is assigned to watch for 24 hours. Of course things go wrong and the criminal escapes leading to assorted troubles along the way.Its an amusing revisit with some good friends. More amusing than than funny though there are enough laughs to make it worth a trip this is a rambling film that would have been better had it not been a Taxi film. Forgive me the previous Taxi films have set a rather high bar for controlled insanity and car chases. here there is insanity and silliness but of a kinder gentler sort. Other than the opening get the passenger to the soccer pitch there really isn't any car chases and Daniel is given very little to do but be a dad which is fine but I really wanted another chase or two. Those wanting action scenes will not be disappointed by the over the top send up of Scarface that ends the film which does provide the film with some solid laughs.I liked the film. I laughed a great deal. I shouldn't be picky especially since the characters are still the characters and anytime with them is well spent.If you're a fan this is definitely worth a look. If you've never seen a real Taxi film The American version does not count see one of the others first preferably all of the others in order they are some of the best comedies of the last 10 years".

	onyx:emotionText "After the misstep of the American Taxi film which compressed the three French films into one gender reversed tale Luc Besson tries to strike gold again with a new film with the original cast.Picking up several years after the last film with the two buddies Taxi driver Daniel and Cop Emilien dealing with their own kids as well as a Belgian super criminal the police force is assigned to watch for 24 hours. Of course things go wrong and the criminal escapes leading to assorted troubles along the way.Its an amusing revisit with some good friends. More amusing than than funny though there are enough laughs to make it worth a trip this is a rambling film that would have been better had it not been a Taxi film. Forgive me the previous Taxi films have set a rather high bar for controlled insanity and car chases. here there is insanity and silliness but of a kinder gentler sort. Other than the opening get the passenger to the soccer pitch there really isn't any car chases and Daniel is given very little to do but be a dad which is fine but I really wanted another chase or two. Those wanting action scenes will not be disappointed by the over the top send up of Scarface that ends the film which does provide the film with some solid laughs.I liked the film. I laughed a great deal. I shouldn't be picky especially since the characters are still the characters and anytime with them is well spent.If you're a fan this is definitely worth a look. If you've never seen a real Taxi film The American version does not count see one of the others first preferably all of the others in order they are some of the best comedies of the last 10 years";

Is it because of the real life judicial troubles of Daniel actor's Sami Naceri that prevented a more important presence in the movie? Possibly but then why did Besson had to release the movie that early? Greed may be? The humour is there some action too but the spirit is gone.

The plot it's so simple has a child movie with constant hommages to SCARFACE. It seems that Luc Besson wrote only for the money and with no interest at all and I can believe that we talk about the same guy he wrote LEN NIKITA and THE FIFTH ELEMENT. The history tries to be supported with it's characters' jokes and with the action. But in this one the characters here are abnormal and the action in addition it's forced sometimes is almost non existent.The only normal character is Daniel Samy Naceri you look at his face and it seems that the actor wants to return home with his family in every scene. The other characters have already became retarded. milien Frdric Diefenthal is dumb and unable to do nothing without Daniel's corrections and sometimes he acts like a damn baby who doesn't even know that 11 is 2. For example the scene were he's incapable to recognize his wife Petra only because she's wearing a brown peruke and nothing else... That burned by brain down. One thing is Clark Kent's glasses but this is STUPID.And the rest of the characters are not better... If the earlier films Gibert was dumb in this one... Even milien and Daniel's children's doesn't in the movie. The children's are only there for one sequence when they help one of the Belgian's thugs who's is a professional who cannot use a computer.The villain is flat and unfunny to me I don't know if he's great or not in his country but he doesn't make me laugh. The actor seems he's always trying to stand out but the bad script stops him. Even the TAXI has presence in the film. Only in the first sequence and that all and it's actually the one who's in the TITLE.The movie is garbage I have seen Z movies with better scripts and smart characters.

Sure the acting isn't great some of the dialogue is flat the costumes and hats are ridiculous but this film is enjoyable especially if you gravitate towards exotic adventure stories with a grecoroman flavour.

It combines scifi with Greek mythology very well. Although it is very much a fantasy film the pretitle sequence where the narrator talks about the things in the Old World and the New whose similarity which must be more than coincidental is quite thought provoking and you wonder what the real reason was for there being cave paintings of elephants in America and paintings of witches being similar on both sides of the Atlantic. It was made in the early sixties and it seems also to be making a statement about nuclear power with one crystal being used for lighting and heat and another being used for destruction. That scene seems to be a veiled warning about controlling our technology and not letting it run away. The rulers of Atlantis seem also to be a metaphor for the Nazis with their ideas of racial superiority and their desire to conquer the world together with their use of slave labour. A good film for all the family.".

Back in the late 50s early 60s Hollywood was putting out a lot of science fiction fantasy films like Seventh Voyage of Sinbad Jack the Giant Killer Mysterious Island and all of the sword and sandal Hercules movies with Steve Reeves and other musclemen. What could you not like about this film as a kid? A beautiful princess a submarine in the shape of a fish giant monsters fighting our hero in a firewater pit animal men with bull heads and horns a giant sea monster Neptune showing our hero and his princess through the pillars of Hercules on their way to Atlantis and plenty of evil sorcerers and villains. A good love story to boot with our hero Demetrious winning the love of his lady Antillia and getting out of Atlantis just before the submerging and destruction of the mythical land. Edward Platt who was on the TV show Get Smart as the chief in a role as a ministerprophet who foretells the doom of the fabled continent. I fell in love with Joyce Taylor the princess Antillia way back then....only problem is that our hero played by Anthony Hall looked like he could have used some time in the gym training with Steve Reeves. On the very thin side for a hero to fight giants and evil rulers. Great science fiction stuff for the 60s.".

I can recall as a child waiting patiently for his TV programs involving his enormously popular Puppettoons. His films always touch the core of movie fans' imagination with such classics as 'The Naked Jungle' 'The War of the Worlds' and my all time favorite 'The Time Machine'. In this film Pal reaches deep into the human Psyche and selects a fabulous story which originates in the ancient scrolls of Plato. Here a Greek Fisherman Demetrios Anthony Hall nets a strange woman who claims to be from the mythical island of Atlantis. Unable to prevent her she returns home where the Fisherman becomes a prisoner of the mightiest kingdom of all time. Promising himself he will yet escape his chains Demetrios meet Xandros Jay Novello an aging slave who made that claim years before. During his stay he is not only permitted to witness the great wonders of Atlantis such as a submarine and a powerful solar Laser but is informed of it's impending doom by a sincere and penitent scientistpriest named Azor Edward Platt. His stay is precarious and subject to change at the whim of Sonoy the Astrologer Frank De Kova and Zaren John Dall the chief adviser. The movie is entertaining and enjoyable if slightly hampered by the personal ideology of the director who injects it into his work. Nevertheless the films of George Pal continue to fascinate audiences of all ages. Due to his expertise this film serves to strengthen our continuous belief in the Legend of Atlantis. ".

In fact the only part I remember from my first viewing even after seeing it again as an adult is the cool laserlike weapon shooting at the fleeing ships at the end. I loved that part when I was young. As a result this film will always have sentimental value to me.Therefore I still enjoy watching this film every few years. However I am also simultaneously very disappointed in the special effects and moderately disappointed in the story. Atlantis of course is a classic story which is why Disney chose it for an animated movie so it's very much a shame that such a classic story wasn't given better treatment than this.The worst effect is probably the laserlike weapon where the beam is shown as a fakelooking superimposed red streak of color leading to and surrounding the target each time it fires usually followed by an outofposition scene of the destroyed target. The ray's effect isn't even consistent. In one case it melts an urn in another case it blows up a fishing boat and in another case it turns a man into a skeleton. So is it is heat ray a coherent light ray an antimatter beam or what? The halfman halfanimal effects were also weak with obvious masks. And the lava flow just looks like muddy red water which it probably is. Also the hypnotism scene was unconvincing and scientifically unsound.Some of the effects are very good however. I love the scene where the submarine surfaces in the background behind Demetrios and Antillia while they are chatting oblivious to the sub as it spots them circles back and begins following them. The laser demonstration that melts a small urn was likewise very well done. The priest's wisdom about the effects of decadence isolationism warmongering the good vs. bad sides of technology and ignoring nature's warning signs will always be applicable and this gives some nice depth to the plot.For my taste there is a little too much focus on the cruel sordid side of Atlantis instead of on the beautiful side that has always fired people's imaginations. They could have shown inspiring views of classical architecture treasure rooms exotic pets like peacocks or giraffes hot air balloons master artists and musicians clever modern conveniences and more but instead they emphasized gladiator battles audience drunkenness whipped slaves a pig a vicious wildcat and the turning of men into halfbeasts. These depressing scenes on top of Antillia's despicable personality are then followed by horrific scenes of Atlantis' cataclysmic destruction. Obviously you're not going to come away from this movie feeling inspired with beautiful imagery in your head so that aspect is a significant drawback to the film as a whole.This is a movie fully deserving of a modern remake but there's no hurry. Atlantis is a classic theme that won't get old no matter how many remakes are done about it and no matter when they're made.".

	schema:headline " Good American Peplum from George Pal!";
	schema:reviewBody "Leonard Maltin's Movies on TV lists this as George Pal's worst film. This is overly harsh and will steer you away from a fun film. While Atlantis is far from Pal's best it's definitely better than Conquest of Space or Doc Savage both of which have embarrassing scripts bad acting and heavyhanded direction.Anyone who knows anything about Pal knows MGM rushed Atlantis into production before the script was refined and it shows. Still the major problem is not so much the script but the casting. The two leads Sal Ponti as Demetrius and Joyce Taylor as Princess Antillia are terrible particularly Taylor. She is beyond unlikable when she allows Zaren John Dall to make a slave of Demetrius after having been rescued and returned to Atlantis by him. If her performance suggested she suspected Zaren responsible for having Demetrius placed in irons it would have softened her making her later reunion with Demetrius believable. Unfortunately she displays so much venom towards him when he verbalizes his suspicions of her betrayal believability never recovers. Yet Ponti is equally at fault. If through a look or gesture we could see that perhaps he didn't truly believe she would have made a slave of him the film would have been improved immensely. Other actors fare better but John Dall hams it up about as much as anyone could making his also hammy performance in Spartacus appear to be Oscar bait by comparison. And Edward Platt as Azor is a bit too holier than thou though he is quite restrained. That he became the Chief on TV's Get Smart later doesn't help sell his believability in a serious role but his performance can't be held accountable for interesting career decisions. The actor who runs away with the picture is Jay Novello as Xandros a Greek who Demetrius saves in the slave camp. After having thrown mud at the princess who he assumes is responsible for making him a slave Demetrius is sent to an evil scientist to be transformed into an animal to be used as a beast of burden shades of H. G. Wells of course. Demetrius escapes this fate but Xandros does not. Though we see the signs of an ox reveal themselves on his ears and nose Xandros struggles to maintain his humanity as the animal instinct grows. Novello who gave a campy but fun performance in Irwin Allen's The Lost World 1960 actually evokes some reasonable compassion in Atlantis as we watch him struggle to hold on to his humanity. His ox makeup is effectively creepy without being overdone and his facial features lend themselves to that look. I don't know why more people haven't recognized this actor.Where the film shines is in its atmospheric sense of place. Prior to Pal's Atlantis the only other version of the Atlantis myth to be seen on screen were the various versions of Atlantide with Queen Antinea and the remnants of the empire of Atlantis discovered beneath the Sahara desert. A very dry prospect. Pal's Atlantis is a place that has to be reached by sea and ultimately by submarine one in the shape of a fish. Even King Neptune is shown in a dream sequence. The film feels aquatic and very Greek somehow particularly the look of the city the costumes and war machines. This definitely gives the film a mythological quality the Atlantide films don't possess.And of course Pal's attention to color and production design in spite of the fact that much was stolen from earlier productions pluses the less than adequate budget. In general what the film is is a very good American version of Italian peplum sword and sandal epics shot at Cinecitta. It's a much better film than Steve Reeves' Hercules or any number of peplum from the late 50s and early 60s and it's not dubbed either  aside from the use of Paul Frees who dubbed Demetrius' father's voice and a few others.Yes Pal swipes footage from Quo Vadis for the destruction of Atlantis and for some wide arena shots. The mattes of the Colosseum are up to Pal's usual standards. It's just that he didn't shoot the original footage. But the visual effects that Pal's team did create are for the most part well done. In fact Atlantis probably boasts one scene that stands with the finest work Pal ever did the submarine fish's approach to Demetrius' boat and its arrival at Atlantis. First we hear the whirring sound and we see the metallic vessel surface in the distance behind Demetrius unaware of its approach towards his boat. Though the sub's arrival at Atlantis uses earlier footage too the combined result of seeing Atlantis from the circular window as the sub rises then cutting to the vessel pulling into harbor with people in togas cheering is one of the most memorable scenes in just about any fantasy film from that era. Though some of the miniatures used for the sinking of Atlantis look like what they are the designs themselves and the lighting make the shots highly atmospheric. Along with Miklos Rozsa's score to Pal's The Power Russell Garcia's scores to The Time Machine and Atlantis the Lost Continent are the best of Pal's long career. Garcia did the two films back to back and are both perfectly suited to their subjects. With Atlantis Garcia created a miniepic. Regal and majestic swirling with magical and diabolical moments the music elevates the film beyond the peplum it really is. The film totally depends on what you expect going in. If you expect peplum you'll be nicely surprised. If you expect The Time Machine it couldn't possibly stack up.".

The first was the acting.  Anthony Hall was so wooden in this film he could have attracted termites in fact most of the acting wasn't great.  The only one who seemed to have an at least okay performance was Edward Platt as the high priest. Another flaw was the fact that the film relied a lot on stock footage Pal lifted a lot of footage from Quo Vadis?.  Except for these two flaws this is an okay film.

George Pal produced a really neat show for juveniles and it came out at a time when Italian studios were turning out dozens of these films based on classical ancient times. Looking at it more than five decades later I can now appreciate the great cast of character players brought in to support a pair of less than charismatic leads. Any film that has John Dall Edward Platt Berry Kroeger Frank DeKova Jay Novello and Edgar Stehli should not be missed.Our leads are Anthony Hall as Demetrios a poor but humble Greek fisherman who catches Joyce Taylor a princess from a far away land. She's run away because she doesn't want to marry Dall and considering he's more than a bit off kilter who could blame her. She still insists on royal prerogatives in dealing even with her rescuer.In the end Hall takes his little fishing boat beyond those Pillars of Hercules at the mouth of the Mediterranean and they find Atlantis or Atlantis actually finds them in a metallic submarine that Dall is captaining. After that Hall is taken to the island of Atlantis where Edgar Stehli is the king Taylor his daughter Kroeger a mad scientist physician who has created a race of mutants DeKova the court astrologer and Platt a priest. Each one of these people gets to strut the stuff that we expect from them. Pal gave them all their heads and they run with it. As an adult this is what I love this picture for.Especially Dall working that death ray machine. The man is truly achieving orgasm as he zaps people into nonexistence with a phaser like device. The Atlanteans all dress in classical Peplum style but have made some really far advances.Juveniles will still love it many adults will too. But as Atlantis falls didn't someone think to save that submarine. Whoever did would be ruling the planet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although cheesy and corny at times this lavish George Pal spectacle still packs a punch today with some agreeable oldfashioned special effects and a little bit of everything in the plot. Sure it's not a perfect film but what is? Occasionally dated and sometimes juvenile ATLANTIS THE LOST CONTINENT more than overcomes its flaws with a story populated by interesting characters plenty of incident and interesting factors in the plot.The film begins as a romantic adventure yarn as a beautiful Princess  as played by Joyce Taylor who is very good and charismatic in the part  falls in love with a simple Greek fisherman a freshfaced lean youth played by Sal Ponti as a fearless indestructible hero type. Once the action moves to Atlantis the plot thickens with the introduction of many supporting characters each with their own motivations and numerous subplots.From this point there are plenty of ominous rumblings and omens which point to the demise of Atlantis which of course is saved for the finale. Up until then we follow Ponti as he becomes a slave and rebels against the cruel guard as led by a young William Smith. There are some fun swordandsandal type battle sequences involving battles between guards and slaves which highlight the action. Meanwhile Ponti finds himself facing the gladiatorial fire and water challenge in which he battles a brute of a man in a pit of hot coals which is then flooded with water. Again a rousing moment the highlight being the point when Ponti sets his opponent's head aflame! Another plot strand involves John Dall's Zaren the King's righthand who is effectively running the show and plans to become master of the world by using a crystalpowered death ray to destroy all of the other countries. Dall is the kind of slimy yet charismatic villain you just love to hate and kudos to the scriptwriters for not portraying him as a bad guy at the beginning of the film  instead it's a gradual process.Yet another subplot involves prisoners being converted into beastmen by the evil scientists of Atlantis and sadly this is the most juvenile and poorlyrealised portion of the film with silly makeup effects and a lack of the tragihorror combination that the writer was looking for with the beastmen. Thankfully this unwanted element is kept to the background in the movie. The special effects and fantastic elements are kept to a minimum up until the finale which is where the budget seems to have been spent and boy does it show. As Atlantis cracks up we're treated to spectacular shots of bubbling lava exploding volcanoes collapsing buildings the city on fire rubble and masonry crushing people floods and the city sinking beneath the ocean. On top of all this the death ray comes into play to destroy numerous ships and lives before it finally skeletonises the bad guy and goes berserk causing yet more destruction. A truly satisfying conclusion to the movie and worth waiting for.Even in the quieter moments there is much to enjoy in ATLANTIS THE LSOT CONTINENT's colourful cinematography and imaginative set design including a weird temple with a huge Minotaur statue. In all this is a splendid  if minorly flawed  retelling of the classic legend and an allround crowd pleaser bolstered most by the likable leads and Pal's uniqely oldfashioned approach to the adventure.".

Now I am an old dog and shouldn't allow such misclassification about a genre that provides lush opportunities for at least 20 movies to be made with boxoffice success. The problem is as I see it perhaps lack of good scenarios and even if they exist to be devoid of inner consistency because they interpret the Atlantic myth as Bronze Age culture which is not! Plato said with absolute conviction in the dialogue Critias left unfinished that the story developed 9000 years before his lifetime  a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar and those who dwelt within them. Then he gives description of the Athenian civilization where the Parthenon and other temple structures are not yet built Athenians are at agriculturalist level of development.The Atlantis island is bequeathed to Hellenic god Poseidon who fell in love with Cleito the daughter of autochthones Evenor and Leucippe which bear him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these Atlas was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean was called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor. Atlas's twin Gadeirus was given the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Hercules and the other four pairs of twins  Ampheres and Evaemon Mneseus and Autochthon Elasippus and Mestor and Azaes and Diaprepes  were also given rule over many men and a large territory. Those are the Kings of Atlantis. Then he describes the Royal Palace enclosed within three circular moats of increasing width varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size ... There is consistent effort in modern interpreters to make here an allusion with CreteMycenae structures and archaeology while in my opinion the issue lies in much older mores and races.Consider the book from Lewis Spence History of Atlantis 1927  a hilarious piece of writing would admonish someone printed for enjoyment by an Occultist and Mythology expert. It is my favorite choice if I have to work on a scenario for Atlantis film. Unfortunately the contents are not available online but I should avail myself to retell it briefly.Atlanteans are from the races of so called Paleolithic Greeks  Azilian and Aurignacian cultures those are CroMagnon men living c. 10 000 B.C. and before which had displaced Neanderthals and other ugly head savages from preceding eras.

	schema:reviewBody "Instead of becoming the tawdry salacious affair it could've easily been two masterful and textured performances from two of our greatest actresses catapult Notes on a Scandal to the echelon of arthouse entertainment. In one corner we have Dame Judi Dench as the lonely schoolmarm and mentor. In the other corner we have Cate Blanchett as the flighty but endearing new art teacher just begging for someone to take her under their wing. The film starts innocuously enough with the two women becoming fast friends with Blanchett inviting Dench into her home and family and Dench all too eager to find a new best friend. Deliciously seasoned with spicy subtexts involving the bourgeois sense of entitlement the bitterness of the lower middle class the candidness of those with everything who never seem to be satisfied the resentment of those sucked into this confidence and of course the psychosexual entrapments of all relationships Notes on a Scandal is rife with everyday tragedy. The convoluted subtexts often take precedence over what is being seen on screen until Dench's voiceover entrances us and sucks us in.In the early scenes where Dench is describing her burgeoning fascination with Blanchett the audience shares in the allure as Dench paints beautifully the appeal of Blanchett's talents as an actress. Soon though the fantasy makes way for reality and Blanchett as raw and vulnerable as she has ever been falls under the spell of a troubled 15 yearold boy with whom she begins an illicit affair. Blanchett's folly is mirrored in Dench's obsession with becoming her sole confidant.Director Richard Eyre who previously directed Dench in the superb Iris structures the film in a crisp clip. As the plot quickly goes through the motions secrets are revealed true natures are uncovered and the lives of both women become tragically entangled as they unravel.Enough can't be said about Dench's mastering of the thespian art form. She could've easily dived head first into this role and delivered something akin to Kathy Bates turn as the mad spinster in Misery. Instead she adds subtlety humor and melancholy in her perfectly balanced performance that allows you to sympathize with her character for the loneliness she feels while at the same time hating her for her opportunism and bitterness.Likewise Blanchett manages to play to our sympathies and it's easy to see why Dench the boy in question and Blanchett's husband a shockingly good Bill Nighy are completely smitten with her despite her impetuousness.With betrayal leading to hatred and a complete breakdown of all things sacred in human connections the climactic showdown between The Dame and The Cate is the type of goosebump inducing acting tour de force moviegoers dream about. There's also a sense of a symbolic passing of the torch from one generation of great actresses to the next. Far from being just the highbrow version of Single White Female Notes on a Scandal entertains and provokes those willing to enjoy the psychologically complex roller coaster.".

The convoluted subtexts often take precedence over what is being seen on screen until Dench's voiceover entrances us and sucks us in.In the early scenes where Dench is describing her burgeoning fascination with Blanchett the audience shares in the allure as Dench paints beautifully the appeal of Blanchett's talents as an actress. Soon though the fantasy makes way for reality and Blanchett as raw and vulnerable as she has ever been falls under the spell of a troubled 15 yearold boy with whom she begins an illicit affair. Blanchett's folly is mirrored in Dench's obsession with becoming her sole confidant.Director Richard Eyre who previously directed Dench in the superb Iris structures the film in a crisp clip. As the plot quickly goes through the motions secrets are revealed true natures are uncovered and the lives of both women become tragically entangled as they unravel.Enough can't be said about Dench's mastering of the thespian art form. She could've easily dived head first into this role and delivered something akin to Kathy Bates turn as the mad spinster in Misery. Instead she adds subtlety humor and melancholy in her perfectly balanced performance that allows you to sympathize with her character for the loneliness she feels while at the same time hating her for her opportunism and bitterness.Likewise Blanchett manages to play to our sympathies and it's easy to see why Dench the boy in question and Blanchett's husband a shockingly good Bill Nighy are completely smitten with her despite her impetuousness.With betrayal leading to hatred and a complete breakdown of all things sacred in human connections the climactic showdown between The Dame and The Cate is the type of goosebump inducing acting tour de force moviegoers dream about. There's also a sense of a symbolic passing of the torch from one generation of great actresses to the next. Far from being just the highbrow version of Single White Female Notes on a Scandal entertains and provokes those willing to enjoy the psychologically complex roller coaster.";

A superlative creator of character. Notes from a Scandal tells us a lot about the British penchant for relishing scandals they invented the tabloid press and also about the odd intersecting relationships that have become a nearly commonplace reality in the contemporary world. Both Blanchett and Dench as Sheba and Barbara teach at the same Islington secondary school. And both in very different ways embark on inappropriate relationships that create turmoil in their lives and the lives of their community. Judy Dench conveys the desperate loneliness of her character's life and a remarkable scene of her smoking a cigarette in a bathtub conveys the distinction between her kind of lonelinessan older unattractive single woman with no real connections in lifeand the more endurable kinds of loneliness that many of us share. This is a gripping film that moves crisply from one scene to the next missing only a very few beats along the way. A must see.".

	schema:headline " The Real As Opposed to the Convenient";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a story told through the proper subjective medium film with such painful cynical candor for how Barbara has spent a life disabusing herself of any rosetinted notion of life or people. The price? Absolute utter loneliness. The dynamic human images we see our narrated by the daybyday items in the diary she zealously keeps as a sanctuary and an affirmation. The movie fixes on acts of indiscretion and disloyalty entailing not just our scathingly wise narrator and her new teaching colleague Sheba but Sheba's husband the headmaster a teacher infatuated with Sheba and a 15yearold student. Each believes their reasons are sincere but are all entrenched in variations of selfdeception. As Barbara says in one of the most tellingly human things I've ever heard in a movie It takes courage to recognize the real as opposed to the convenient.Dench and Blanchett as Barbara and Sheba share not only a gift for deep behavioral detail but a skill at withholding or telegraphing charm and beauty as required. This may be one of the numerous reasons why they're as compelling as they are. It's definitely part of why this is some of their finest work. It's part of the drama's mechanism. Were Sheba not the breed of beauty she is a naive impressionable coddled pixie then we couldn't appreciate how intensely Barbara wants her. It's not exactly love so much as controlling envious fixation on Sheba's stunning upperclass ease. And were Barbara not a teakettle of seclusion boiling through decades of disillusionment we couldn't identify with how distorted the manifestation of that affection becomes.That's the marvel of the movie It's about the venomous influence of loneliness viewed through a tale of two people in love. But unfortunately for both not with one another. Sheba becomes smitten with a cute but cagey student. Played with what seems like natural hyperconfidence by Andrew Simpson he sees an occasion in the way she looks at him. She has no clue of how defenseless she truly is. It's not only dishonest and unethical she tells herself it's totally ludicrous but when he cups her face and says You're beautiful Miss she melts.Barbara meanwhile fosters an obsession in her diary relating thoughts precariously bordering on fantasy. Barbara's seclusion within the school is total but Sheba is somebody who hasn't experienced her acidity. Barbara can smother someone with good turns and not be rejected. She helps Sheba win control of her students. One soon learns that teaching is crowd control. We're a branch of social services. Sheba asks her to Sunday roast where Barbara describes Sheba's family with characteristically rancorous humor. Dench's delivery of these delectably spiteful lines is an triumph in vocal meticulousness and tone that is its own prize. Even when this apparent ice queen drops minute words of vulnerability like Is that why she hasn't returned my calls? there's an extra intensity in how strongly we can all relate to the insecurities of her inner voice.There are giftedly handled extraordinarily candid scenes of rage humiliation and disgrace and cruel physical and emotional clashes of immense force. The teachers are somewhat caricatured but that's because they're filtered through Barbara's misanthropic viewpoint. If it's her omniscient voice we're hearing it's through her omniscient eyes we're seeing what she describes and it's the figures who allow her access to their humanity who have profundity and delicacy in their depictions. A wholly earnest Dench brings to Barbara that frigid reserve that's somehow one with a despairing need for consolation and affection. Early on Sheba is basically an alluring figurine watched from afar. When our voyeuristic chronicler discovers Sheba's business with the student Sheba grows immense dimension.We start to see Sheba's own manner of advantaged lonesomenessor just tedium. Marriage kids it's wonderful she presumingly explains but it doesn't give you meaning. Blanchett brilliantly uses her character's advantages to betray her. The grim lesson she's about to learn from Barbara seems belated even valuable. People like Sheba according to Barbara and I'm sure you'll agree think they know loneliness but they know nothing of planning one's whole weekend around a laundry errand or being so continually untouched that the inadvertent sweep of a stranger's hand ignites years of sexual longing.What I adore about the film is this discerningly intricate moral kaleidoscope weaved in completely modern domestic terms. It's going on in your neighborhood not just Islington. There are scandals like this every year and we dismissively conjecture from what little we gather. The cunning concept here is that we're seeing it through the sieve of Barbara and whose transgressions transcend contemporary knowitall assumptions.".

	schema:headline " Rarely is a film so sublime!";
	schema:reviewBody "Every film should aspire to be as satisfying as this one is  on every level and there are so many layers to it all. Nothing is as it appears and the film unwinds in the form of comments and voiceovers from the many journals of the protagonist.Judi Dench yet again sinks her teeth into the part of Barbara Covett a cynical and acerbic history teacher putting in time in an inner city school.Enter Cate Blanchett playing Sheba Hart the new art teacher fragile naive innocent and hopeful. Or is she? Barbara quickly ensconces herself into Sheba's life becoming confidante and friend.And then the plot thickens and assumes the intensity of a thriller as Sheba's life starts to fall apart secretly abetted by Barbara. The tension does not let up until the very last frame and the viewer is never quite sure where this ride is going.Sheba and Barbara are very alike at their cores there is a fragile 'fatal attraction' theme running through their relationship shadowed by Sheba's impossible affair with a fifteen year old boy which is in turn shadowed by her Down's Syndrome son who is of an age with her student and again this is shadowed by her daughter's coming of age love troubles and overall the shadow of her own marriage to a much older man who left his wife and children for her teenage self. I found all of these themes winding again and again throughout the film. The characters are fully rounded and indeed are also shown happy in the bosoms of their individual families but with a distance portrayed as if they are never quite sure of their places within them  always a distraction and secrets.Barbara has her shadows too and they start to trickle through and become more vocalized and by others as the stories unfold.Enough said without spoilers. Bill Nighy as Sheba's husband ably enhances the two astonishing performances of the female leads.Movie making at its finest. This is being shown in two theatres in the same complex where I saw it and both were packed. It is very heartening to see a character driven and challenging movie being so popular.10 out of 10. Superlative down to the music by Philip Glass.".

	schema:headline " minor quibbles aside this is one of the sharpest tragiccomedies this year certainly regarding obsession and psychological mindgames";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have I seen Dame Judi Dench on top of her game as with Notes on a Scandal. She's usually a good show in any film she's in but here she's perfect for the role of Barbara who has been a professional teacher in a high school all her life and is well respected but can't seem to get enough of her attachments. There's a first one to a woman we won't see during the course of the film chiefly because she put a retraining order on Barbara and then enters in Sheba Cate Blanchett beautiful as ever which may be a small part of the point who becomes a focal point of attention for Barbara. And then when she discovers a terrible secret regarding her new 'friend' an affair Sheba's having with one of her 15 year old students there's a subtle form of blackmail that comes into play and that becomes a further fantasy in her notebooks. Throughout all of this Dench never breaks from making this a totally believable broken but very solid woman who's gone through a life of misery only to want to seek happiness on the other side. One might almost feel sorry for her in the end if she wasn't such a dingbat. It might be also my favorite Dench performance I've seen to date albeit I'm not all up on her complete catalog of work. She's not only convincing on the level of the obviousness of her character vindictive but sweet sensitive but cunning and always with that underlying wit that the British have even in the most dire of circumstances and I couldn't see anyone else playing her after a while.But it's not just her that makes Notes on a Scandal worthwhile. The screenplay by Patrick Marber from what must be an equally absorbing and humanistic book is sharp and intelligent in ways that American filmmakers wish they could make mindfer movies like today. There's understatement here and there that undercuts some scenes like when Sheba has to confess to Barbara after being caught with the boy the first time a very slight tension each knows on each side. And even when things start to get worse and worse and the truth comes out in the worst way possible not just for Sheba destroying her family which includes her husband played by the great Bill Nighy and her two dysfunctional children but for Barbara as well there's still some glimmers of dark comedy in there which one might think would be impossible considering the dangerous pitfalls that could come with such topical practically controversial subject matter. My favorite of this is when Sheba finds out her own darkest secret from Barbara and inexplicably in her old 80s makeup again no less.Not that I thought the film was without flaws chiefly that oddly enough it wasn't long enough at 90 minutes structurally it ended up working out but considering how good the characters made the material out to be I was surprised how quickly Marber and director Eyre got into the affair material and Phillip Glass's musical accompaniment isn't quite fit with the rest of the material most of the time I was wondering when Errol Morris would show up truth be told. But I overlook these flaws mostly for the sake of how superlative everything else is done. The performances are all uniformly compelling and with equal measures of understandings in neuroses in one another and the ending particularly leaves a chilling spell not unlike one found in the Cable Guy. It's probably the best chickflick you haven't yet seen this year.".

You hang on every word delivered as one punch after another... not mean dialog or lacerating like WOOLF but aptly exactly quietly bullseye precision to describe anyone or any scene or any action. It should and could easily win the Oscar for Best script. I would honestly say it is the most withering observation of Britain and it's inhabitants since PLENTY.

NOTES ON A SCANDAL is a film about predatory behavior in a grubby suburban British school... and who exactly is preying upon whom and how effective immoral or successful each of the protagonists are is a pungent topic of many disturbing visuals that will seriously haunt you for many days. Where do they find a kid exactly the right age and type and can act and would match it with Dench and Blanchett... and actually be photographed doing what his character does? I want to see the interview with his parents. NOTES ON A SCANDAL is massive cinema. An absolutely heartbreaking colossal achievement in small suburban torment. It is among the best films I have ever seen... especially PLENTY and EVE mentioned above. How you feel the day after you see this film will change in the weeks to follow. NOTES is up there with the most superb immoral and disturbing films ever made. Warning! do not be put off by the terrible trailer!

	schema:reviewBody "A littleknown fact about Araneae Arachidna uncommonly known as the common spider Only their nimble poise keeps them from tumbling into their webs. The slightest slip the merest topple and they'd be in as wretched a condition as the bloodless husks that litter their tacky lairs. In Notes On a Scandal which enjoyed a limited release on Dec. 25 this delicate mean is most graphically illustrated in London schoolmarm Barbara Covett note the last name whose rule in the classroom is adamantine but whose grasp of words like friend secret and love affair are as tenuous as spider silk.Dame Judi Dench's Covett is a history teacher in a British school that makes the one in Saint Clara look like an accounting firm made over by the Body Snatchers. Vicious football hooligans and wanton almostwomen abound the future plumbers and shop clerks in Covett's acid baroque. The teachers crouch in the gymnatorium trading term reports like beleaguered generals in the trenches. Covett's is the most succinct Her classes are below the National Average but above the level of catastrophe. Recommendation No change necessary. But no matter how we try to keep things status quo change has a way of sluicing in through the cracks. At the start of the Fall term change waltzes into Dench's life in the liquid form of new art teacher Sheba Hart Cate Blanchett who is as lovely as an Elf and her namesake together but as free as a Hobbit particularly about the loins which she can't seem to stop airing out around a treacherouslycharming 15yearold Steven Connolly Andrew Simpson who is determined to pluck this Bohemian rose by means artful and sincere.When Covett catches a sensuous eyeful of the twosome during a Christmas pageant this starchy spider sees an opportunity to cinch her snare shut. She takes Hart into her confidence promising not to tell for the sake of Hart Connolly and the school not to mention Covett's icy groin. Soon Covett is insinuating herself into the family life of her supple obsession appearing at every lunch outing and inning like some incestuous motherinlaw. Hart's family consists of a drolly selfamused husband Bill Nighy a teenage melancholic daughter Juno Temple and a son who suffers from Down's Syndrome Max Lewis whom Covett regards as a flimsy gauntlet between her heart and Hart.When she's not haunting the Harts' steps like an insufferablyhaughty shadow Covett can be found out at her meticulouslyclutterfree abode adorning her diary with gold stars and musing about everything from lasagna to the pubescent proles to her only true friend in the world her dying cat an uncanny doppelganger of Mrs. Norris Filch's feline in the Harry Potter movies.Of course everything falls apart spectacularly in the third act with everyone's gory doings blared across every tube and telly from Bath to Birmingham. But what's even more amazing is the way everything falls back together in the end. There are the wounds that cleave yes and those which sew us back more strongly than ever. These are the darling themes of director Richard Eyre whose previous pairing with Dench was the Alzheimer's weeper Iris.

	onyx:emotionText "A littleknown fact about Araneae Arachidna uncommonly known as the common spider Only their nimble poise keeps them from tumbling into their webs. The slightest slip the merest topple and they'd be in as wretched a condition as the bloodless husks that litter their tacky lairs. In Notes On a Scandal which enjoyed a limited release on Dec. 25 this delicate mean is most graphically illustrated in London schoolmarm Barbara Covett note the last name whose rule in the classroom is adamantine but whose grasp of words like friend secret and love affair are as tenuous as spider silk.Dame Judi Dench's Covett is a history teacher in a British school that makes the one in Saint Clara look like an accounting firm made over by the Body Snatchers. Vicious football hooligans and wanton almostwomen abound the future plumbers and shop clerks in Covett's acid baroque. The teachers crouch in the gymnatorium trading term reports like beleaguered generals in the trenches. Covett's is the most succinct Her classes are below the National Average but above the level of catastrophe. Recommendation No change necessary. But no matter how we try to keep things status quo change has a way of sluicing in through the cracks. At the start of the Fall term change waltzes into Dench's life in the liquid form of new art teacher Sheba Hart Cate Blanchett who is as lovely as an Elf and her namesake together but as free as a Hobbit particularly about the loins which she can't seem to stop airing out around a treacherouslycharming 15yearold Steven Connolly Andrew Simpson who is determined to pluck this Bohemian rose by means artful and sincere.When Covett catches a sensuous eyeful of the twosome during a Christmas pageant this starchy spider sees an opportunity to cinch her snare shut. She takes Hart into her confidence promising not to tell for the sake of Hart Connolly and the school not to mention Covett's icy groin. Soon Covett is insinuating herself into the family life of her supple obsession appearing at every lunch outing and inning like some incestuous motherinlaw. Hart's family consists of a drolly selfamused husband Bill Nighy a teenage melancholic daughter Juno Temple and a son who suffers from Down's Syndrome Max Lewis whom Covett regards as a flimsy gauntlet between her heart and Hart.When she's not haunting the Harts' steps like an insufferablyhaughty shadow Covett can be found out at her meticulouslyclutterfree abode adorning her diary with gold stars and musing about everything from lasagna to the pubescent proles to her only true friend in the world her dying cat an uncanny doppelganger of Mrs. Norris Filch's feline in the Harry Potter movies.Of course everything falls apart spectacularly in the third act with everyone's gory doings blared across every tube and telly from Bath to Birmingham. But what's even more amazing is the way everything falls back together in the end. There are the wounds that cleave yes and those which sew us back more strongly than ever. These are the darling themes of director Richard Eyre whose previous pairing with Dench was the Alzheimer's weeper Iris. Eyre is a fellow who believestruly believesin the allconquering power of love not as a Disneyfied platitude but as an attracting force binding beyond all reason even when every particle of logic screams Resist!

	schema:reviewBody "Notes On A Scandal is a nearlyperfect film a seductive little foray into deliciously dangerous territory with tons of seething undercurrent to spare.In one of the most fearless fierce and feral performances of any recent decade Dame Judi Dench pulls out all the stops in her portrayal of the notsosubtlynamed Barbara Covett the history teacher with quite a past of her own she continues to deludedly search for a 'companion' with whom to share her life without ever comprehending that love is not a commodity to be bought sold or traded  it must be given freely. When she sets her sights on the new art teacher another great performance from Blanchett Barbara winds up repeating the pattern to the same disastrous end result.A simple story basically. But it's the brilliant way it unfolds that allows the movie to succeed on many levels.The film is narrated by Barbara in the form of her journals and this sucks us in straight away. We see we're getting an intellectually ontheball character here which is always attractive and at the onset we're almost on her side. By the time we see what's really going on in her twisted version of reality it's too late we're already involved  sort of like in a bad relationship  and we have no choice but to see the situation through to its bitter end.The film also works by being dizzyingly over the top in spots. This has been seen as a detriment by some people but I think they're missing the point. The situation that spirals out of control in the course of the proceedings IS outrageous and by going for a blatant approach rather than a more sedate repressed one the film mirrors the situation brilliantly. And the actors are all playing it for real  this is not camp it's not satire  which makes the tragic absurdity of the situation resonate all the more.There's another element at play here something far more subtle. In the film Barbara has a cat whom she is abnormally attached to. A little ways in I started picking up on how Barbara herself is like a cat  a feral cat seeking another more domesticated cat over whom she can exert control. When her cat dies Barbara is subconsciously trying to replace her with Blanchett's character her new pet. There's a lot to support this. Blanchett's name in the film is Sheba. A brand of cat food. There is also a lot of talk about 'stroking' and there is a scene where Barbara mentions feral animals how they can sense fear. There are also at least 2 scenes between Barbara and Sheba where Barbara who is done being cordial literally snarls at her clearly reverting to her primal and vicious feralcat state. And it's no coincidence that both of the females to whom Barbara is attracted Sheba and at the end Sheba's potential replacement are shown with cream on their upper lips something that Barbara finds perversely endearing.This would have been a perfect film if it hadn't been for one bit of sloppiness toward the end the way in which Sheba's character learns of Barbara's true motivation and true feelings is written really badly. I just couldn't believe that ol' Barb would become so complacent so as to let Sheba find what she finds which lets the proverbial cat out of the proverbial bag. Other than this however Notes On A Scandal is very much like Barbara Covett herself quite the piece of work.".

	schema:headline " An excellent script is topped only by brilliant performances from Dench and Blanchett";
	schema:reviewBody "Right after I saw the trailer for Notes on a Scandal late last year I knew it was going to be a good movie. I also knew that Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett were destined for Oscar nominations. Sure enough the film got rave reviews and the two actresses popped up on the Oscar ballot. Going two for two cannot be a bad thing but I never got a chance to see the movie until now. And I was very impressed.The film tells the story of Barbara Covett Dench a teacher at a local high school who is melancholic and just about ready to retire. She longs to find someone to love and to love her back. As she enters into the first day of school she comes across the new art teacher Sheba Hart Blanchett who she becomes attracted to almost instantaneously. But as she gets closer to Hart she uncovers a rather alarming secret that may prove to be of good use to her.Yes by now most people should know which secret I am referring to. But as the explanation unfolds no more than twenty minutes into the film the after effects of hearing it are still as shocking as before you knew it.The grim picture of blackmail deceit and sexual perversion that unfolds during the movie is nothing short of excellent. The story is very well written and is even better narrated by Dench through her character's diary writing during the film. The bold language conveyed may be a little much to take at first but it really makes the unnerving experience all the better. Not to mention the fact that such a dark film the settings and images are pretty gloomy as well. The ruminating score is also very well done and really makes many of the scenes all the stronger than they already are.Another significant element to the film is the language mentioned earlier. At once it is saucy enigmatic and witty. Listening to these characters talk is like reading poetry. It is wellversed and almost comes off like a brilliant play it helps that it was adapted by a playwright. The language is not just higherup sounding because it is British it is because the film is deeply indebted to the academics. Yes this may just be a very aroundthebit way of saying everyone in the film is a snob but they are not. They are just very polished and intelligent.The film more than belongs to Dench. She always acts at the most illustrious of levels. But here she is at her absolutely best or at least from what I have ever seen her do. Her scheming and brooding performance as a hellbent lesbian is simply astonishing. She brings flavour to every scene and her emotional range is just off the charts. It is very candid in some ways and a very honest portrayal of someone who just wants to be loved. Her character is really a ticking time bomb. At many moments she is very restrained and holding back in a good way mind you. But in others she really gets going and more than just blows up. She ignites and lights up the screen in a way that only the older British actresses can. After seeing such a dazzling performance from Helen Mirren in The Queen and a downright wicked Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada I was not expecting another performance to be more than deserving of an Oscar. But Dench hits this out of the park and more than deserved her nomination.Much the same goes for Blanchett. Although she brought all that she could to Babel you had to know that she was being very withdrawn from her usual level of intensity. But that is all brought back for her performance here. While she is not nearly as incendiary as Dench she holds her own and pulls off a hell of a performance. Her emotionally wounded character goes through much of the film as an excuse for disgusted pathos. But as the dust settles Blanchett really opens up and blossoms into something of an enigma. Is the audience to feel for her or should we want something bad to happen to her? The character's sinful nature really tests you much the same as the two leads in Hard Candy and the audience will probably get that doubleedged sword of emotions as they watch her on screen. She is very calculating and she is very strong in her role. And for all of what she has to put up with on screen I doubt anyone could have pulled off as nearly a strong supporting turn to Dench as Blanchett does.But where does that leave the rest of the cast then? Overshadowed and underplayed is where. Bill Nighy a great character actor is given very little to do but stand and question what is going on around him. You could say that Nighy doing nothing and doing it well is attesting to how great an actor he is. But for a character that should be much more important in the scheme of things it just comes off as a bit of a disappointment. Much the same goes for the young Andrew Simpson. He is an even more important character but his great work as a misunderstood juvenile is very unobtrusive. When his character really should do something he does not and the audience is left to wonder what if?On the whole Notes on a Scandal is very well written and brilliantly acted by Dench and Blanchett. It feels like it drags itself along in some scenes and gives very little for any other actor in the film to do but the two actresses more than make up for it. It is clearly one of the best films of last year and more than likely one of the most little seen.910.".

Cate Blanchett makes a difficult character sympathetic. This is a great film with superb acting and true pathos. It is about real people who sometimes act out of loneliness and frustration. Even people with good intentions and good morales make poor judgments and they must reap what they sow. Rarely does a film about the ordinary seem so extraordinary.".

	schema:headline " Electrifying psychodrama about two complex women drawn to each other for quite different reasons";
	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant psychodrama about an intense relationship that develops between two London high school teachers. Barbara Covett Dame Judi Dench who teaches history is cynical lonely and close to retirement Sheba Hart Cate Blanchett an art teacher is 37 married and the mother of two teens surprisingly nave a new arrival on the faculty. Both women are complex characters vulnerable needy and these shared attributes draw them toward one another.Sheba gets off to a rotten start at the school unable to control her students' behavior. Barbara who brooks no misconduct having honed over the years skills that would do a drill sergeant proud comes to Sheba's aid after a terrible row in Sheba's classroom. Barbara reaches out to befriend Sheba after this and we gradually come to understand that Barbara a spinster is in fact a well closeted lesbian who remains bereft after another teacher spurned her and actually fled her job and the city to get away from Barbara the previous summer. Now attracted to Sheba she makes a number of well calculated efforts to insinuate herself into the younger teacher's life.Trouble is Sheba is preoccupied not only with the challenge of her new career but also with her unfulfilling marriage to an older writer Richard Bill Nighy and the demands of her post pubescent boy struck daughter Polly Juno Temple and Downs son Ben Max Lewis. As if there weren't enough already on her plate Sheba who has no clue about nor interest in any erotic entanglement with Barbara or any other woman lets herself become involved in a sexual liaison with one of her young students 15 year old Steven Andrew Simpson.Barbara fortuitously discovers their affair lets Sheba know she knows then hastens to pledge to keep their secret if only Sheba will end her little romance before real damage is done. It is through this manipulation that Barbara intends to intensify her grip on Sheba. From here a series of misadventures unfolds and no one is spared a stiff dose of humiliation and dislocation not Barbara not Sheba Richard Steven or anyone else associated with them. A scandal of broad proportions is indeed in the making.The director Richard Eyre has done very good work with Judi Dench before in Iris. The sizzling screenplay by Patrick Marber was adapted from Zoe Heller's 2003 novel What Was She Thinking Notes on a Scandal. Marber pushes the psychodynamic limits here moving the viewer close to the tipping point for suspension of disbelief as he did in his equally accomplished screenplay for the marvelous 2004 film Closer adapted from his own stage script.There are two developments in particular that test us. Why should Sheba yield so readily to young Steven's amorous overtures? And later why should the usually cool headed Barbara make such boldly possessive demands of Sheba right in front of Sheba's family in the nasty encounter the day Barbara's cat must be put down? The answer in both cases has to do with the vulnerability the longing that these women have been enduring expressed by each in a manner consistent with her psychological makeup. Both are close to desperation.We've been told and even shown flat out after all that Sheba has a vicious and unloving mother. Presumably she was twisted to severe neuroticism long before she ever married her older professor. She persevered raising two kids one a tough challenge but now stressed by her teaching job and out of love at home her reserves have run dry and she is at high risk for impulsive behavior. Barbara we can surmise has struggled through painful decades of despair over her largely unfulfilled homophilia.This is a splendidly constructed and enacted drama of the heart full of scathing humor from Barbara as well as cliff hanger suspense and emotional tension. All the players named are good and they are aided by others all the roles are uniformly well performed. For Ms. Dench it's a turn on a par with Helen Mirren's Elizabeth II in The Queen  these are the best two film performances by an English speaking actress in 2006. Indeed these two are perhaps Britain's finest female actors of their generation. Ms. Blanchett's work is evolving toward a similar distinction among performers of her generation.

Richard Eyre Iris The Ploughman's Lunch whips up a rich tart stew of heated melodrama bitter comedy cunning social observation and knockout acting. The result is pungent and toothsome a blend of Evelyn Waugh Harold Pinter and To Die For  a bracing concoction decidedly not for the delicate of disposition.Judi Dench stars as Barbara Covett an spinster high school teacher of North London who holds the world around her in contempt and makes her way like a hungry spider spinning webs of sticky charms to coax friendships from younger women who have no idea of her true nature. One September morn her attention is drawn to the new substitute art teacher Sheba Hart Cate Blanchett a shimmering willowy presence in whom Barbara invests a reservoir of longing.Invited for Sunday lunch Barbara is introduced to Sheba's husband Bill Nighy her children and her bohemian past. Presently she learns even more Sheba is enmeshed in a sexual affair with one of her students Andrew Simpson who like the character he plays is beyond the British age of consent of 16. For Sheba this is a shattering situation with implications of scandal divorce and even prosecution. For Barbara though remember her surname it's a pry bar through the use of which she can break into Sheba's life and assert herself as adviser best friend and perhaps more.This barebones account of the plot gives an idea of the sort of sensational tactics available to Marber and Eyre. To be sure they aren't in the least afraid of using them liberally Scenes of sex stalking vengeancetaking mental breakdown and violent explosion happen throughout the film. It's as lurid a domestic drama as you could crave.Yet the details of the story cannot compare in sheer scalding impact to the dialogue Barbara mocking Sheba's schoolgirl romance with a firm You are not young! or Sheba rubbing Barbara's girlcrush in her face with a sneering You think this is a love affair? or the dozens of heartless observations that pad Barbara's diaries from which the narration is drawn. Marber who wrote both the play and the film Closer as well as some inky comedy for Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge character drops these lines into the script like mortar shells and Eyre never lets up on the pace to give us a chance to recover from them.Its raw nastiness alone might have recommended the film but Eyre has populated it with extraordinary performances that make it truly first rank. Dench is haggard and spiteful and manipulative and wheedling and cruel a catalog of human failings and neediness as credible as the best Iago. As Sheba Blanchett has a fully believable frailty and spaciness bred in a combination of privilege and vacancy. Nighy fast becoming one of the most irreplaceable actors in the cinema truly feels like someone decent on whom a series of incomprehensible catastrophes has fallen. And young Simpson has both the altarboy shyness and the astounding cheek to make his character seem entirely real. It's simply a bravura festival of fine acting.There's a lot of disquieting material in Notes on a Scandal and many people will be put off by depictions of a liaison between a grown woman and a teenage boy or of a tacitly lesbian spinster as a spiteful harridan. But it's staged and played with such razorsharp technique and feels so much like a slice of actual if not ordinary life that its accomplishments simply trump such reservations. Eyre and his collaborators spring wicked trap after wicked trap and the deeply human pain you feel and witness is utterly delicious.".

I found this movie highly disturbing and although it was well done and very clever it left a bad taste in my mouth. In terms of Oscars I would give Judi a nomination and Mr. Glass but that's about it. I guess in terms of personal taste this was not my kind of plot line but I must admit I was interested in what was going to happen next the whole time. The characters became very alive for me. So all in all a very good film but not great. The main problem for me was the touchy subject matter. At times it even became ridiculous. I'm not sure if this was the story's fault or the director's but there was an element of absurdity to moments of the piece which actually made the film less powerful.".

	schema:reviewBody "For any boy growing up when I did back in the late 1970s it was well understood that Guns of Navarone was the sine qua non of adventure films a movie you called friends about when you saw it listed in next week's TV Guide. It's hard to believe so much time has gone by both since my boyhood and since the film was made but Navarone still holds up very well a characterdriven film alive with nuance and subtlety. It moves at an assured clip not rushed or forced making the viewer follow its story through every agonizing twist and turn.What makes the film especially good is the crisp dialogue lines that point up the moral and philosophical argument at the heart of the film and which resonate today as much as thenMallory The only way to win a war is to be just as nasty as the enemy. The one thing that worries me is we're liable to wake up one morning and find we're even nastier than they are.Franklin I can't say that worries me!Mallory Well you're lucky.Good performances abound but the best by far is David Niven's Cpl. Miller a complex character whose smooth front and witty banter conceals much of the conflict of the film. It's he who tangles most often with Gregory Peck's Mallory and has at least three scenes in the film that are toprate. We may like Miller because he keeps things humming and provides welcome comic relief but he's no less the center of the film than Peck or Anthony Quinn the two wellcast leads whose relationship is enriched at least from our remove by the unique vow Stavros has made to Mallory about the unsettled business between them.The plot is a thing of beauty moving with all the synchronicity and clever precision of a diabolical cuckoo clock. The special effects have suffered more than a bit from the march of time though one should remember that was the only part of the film that won an Oscar in 1962. Some process shots are cringeinducing now. But the pace is still gripping and the payoff spectacular. Here's the film that was the template to every popcorn actioner that came after its imprint recognizable on everything from the James Bond movies to Star Wars to Indiana Jones. That's impressive but more so is that Guns remains as entertaining as any one of them and more thrilling than most.".

Mr. Peck David Niven Anthony Quinn et al. are in top form each of them bringing their respective characters to life and the story likewise. The action scenes are impressive even by today's standards but in my opinion they are only a secondary pleasure. The main pleasure is watching the divergent and forceful personalities cooperate conflict confound and finally triumph. Suspense is maintained throughout. I also liked the way complex moral issues were addressed. Another bonus is the portrayal of the Germans. Here they are not all depicted as impersonal inhuman cruel monsters. The full mosaic of human personalities is shown on their side too. But don't get me wrong they are still a formidable enemy who keep the outcome in doubt. Strongly recommended 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow  I used to think Guns Of Navarone was a tryhard almostthere type of nearclassic war film that had muffled sound used a bad coloring process was poorly lit was limited by budget and the technology of the time. Boy was I WRONG  I had seen this film several times all on conventionalcable TV VHS and even Laserdisc prior to the recent UCLA restoration now out on DVD. I never completely engaged in the realityexperience of this movie. It was as if I was listening to Beethoven's Ninth on an AM clock radio in an adjacent room. The newlyrestored DVD in its original widescreen format showcased on a big screen TV in surround sound is the ONLY way to fully take in this piece of art unless you perchance get lucky enough to see it in a cine complex.Unless you have viewed this film in its original condition in a theater or restored letterboxed with propersized screen and sound your previousfuture comments have ZERO merit as far as I'm concerned. So many people here have commented on this film lacking action and being a bore  I could not disagree more. Although I have not read the book something I rarely do anymore due to an unfortunate accident years ago this movie resembled a wellwritten novel. It was FULL of REAL character development bringing you mixed emotions  at times you love feel for loathe or despise them  even the German army officer during the interrogationcapture scene which I will not spoil had a warm admirable quality about him. I will purchaserentborrow an audiobook of this if at all possible because Alistair MacLean has some of the best written adventure material ever brought to film. The action in this film was aplenty  maybe not a Schwarzeneger thrillride but that would have made it completely unbelievable. The character development internal conflict and subplots more than adequately fill the nonaction lulls if you want to call them that. One reviewer here commented on a shipwreck scene of 15 minutes that seemed like forever  the entire realistic shipwreck sequence was barely five minutes long FYI. Without going into too much spoiling detail there was constant suspense while the Germans were nipping at their heels all film long. It contained espionage several handtohand combat sequences several shootings knifings carstrucks being blown up carjackings explosions dive bombings mortar bombardments strafings assassinations etc. With six men and two women against several dozen Germans you can't justifiably get much more action packed into a script unless you would unnecessarilyunrealistically insert more just to intensify the film. The film did not really need intensifying as the plot was strong enough on its own merits  as were all the characters and the subplots surrounding them.The editing is topnotch. This film is lovingly woven into a tapestry with nice artistic dissolvesfadesgraphics transitioning scenes chapters and furthering character development and story lines  the accompanying music only enhances those transitions like adding melted butter andor salt to cooked vegetables enhancing their flavor. To me this film is very warm and comfortable when it needs to be but also cold and abrasive at times to make its social commentary. Carl Foreman scripted another great masterpiece with his usual proantiwar statements wrapped neatly in an entertaining adventure that makes one think. The end retrospective sequence with the Dimitri Tiomkin score is indelibly touching and unforgettable  a rather unorthodox approach for a war movie.The sweeping landscape photography and several cultural touches truly captured the beauty and flavor of Greece and its proud people. Ironically when at Blockbuster I coincidentally chose this film to view with my son  on the Opening Day of the XXVIII Olympiad being held of course in Athens Greece. I read somewhere that the people of Greece still hold this film in high esteem and wereare very proud of the way their nation was portrayed  they should be. Unlike many other movies made abroad Guns Of Navarone affectionately honored its host country and its people. My 7 yearold filmmakingwannabe son absolutely LOVED this movie even better than his most recent film classic viewings... The Magnificent Seven and Bullitt. When I told him many here at IMDb said this film was boring and overrated he commented are they nuts? This coming from a kid who loves James Bond Superman Jaws Jurassic Park Star Wars Star Trek Power Rangers Lost In Space and Jonny Quest as well as Classic Rock film scores Legos Hot Wheels plastic model kits gymnastics and PS2. Guess there is hope for the future generation after all.Some of the very best actionadventure films ever made have very little constant action FYI. I recently overheard a teen boy in a video store who said Raiders was a slow boring film  of all things. No wonder the cumulative votes of classic films on IMDb do not entirely mirror or reflect what critics have historically said when they initially rated andor reviewed them. I try to overlook the current technological advancements of today when compared with films of yesteryear in order to objectively critique a film. GUNS OF NAVARONE is no exception  made before traveling matte blue screen technology and CGI effects. Sure the rearscreen projection photography and miniature work was not perfect but no other film of its era was either. Those factors aside this film is EXTREMELY underrated  this film is a standalone classic of its genre and amongst other alltime great films... a genuine piece of art.Ranking just under the tenstar rated Bridge On The River Kwai Guns Of Navarone is an instantclassic and will always be so on a LARGE SCREEN in its original widescreen format due to its solid foundation of high production values endearing score good writing strong plotcharacter development the fine actors to play those characters and loving direction. Kudos to all who worked on this film. 9.510".

	schema:headline " This has everything that I'm looking for in a classic war movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I was a little boy I've watched several classic war movies with my father. He was an absolute fan of this kind of movies and I guess I've inherited that passion from him because since then I try to watch and buy as many classic war movies as I can find. So far I already have several of them in my private DVD collection but until now The Guns of Navarone wasn't a part of it. The main reason for that is because I hadn't seen it before and therefor didn't know what to expect of it. But now that it was finally shown on television I was able to tape it and to watch it.When in 1943 the Germans are attempting to bully neutral Turkey into joining the Axis 2000 British troops are trapped on the small and strategically unimportant Greek island Kiros. Something has to be done to save them and there is only one way to get there by boat. But it's impossible to come near to the island because the only sea route is defended by two gigantic German antiship batteries deployed in a massive cliff side bunker on the island of Navarone. An air attack has been attempted before and proved to be useless and the only option that is left is sending a team of six Greek and English mountaineers to meet up with partisans to try and dynamite the guns. The team does not only face the almost impossible task to conquer the difficult terrain they also have to try to get past a German garrison and to make things worse there also appears to be a traitor among them...About one thing I'm already certain I'll buy this movie on DVD as soon as I can find it. This is one of the better classic war movies that I've seen lately and I really had a good time watching it. Not only does it give a more realistic view on the war the characters are also a lot more realistic. They aren't as invincible as you sometimes see in other classic war movies think for instance of Where Eagles Dare 1968 in which the Americans or other allies seem to carry some kind of magic shield around them that can't be penetrated by German bullets while they can kill hundreds of the enemy with only one bullet. In this movie they have to deal with all kinds of difficulties like difficult terrain a traitor... and yes even the good guys can get killed or wounded.What I also liked was the fact that this movie was shot in Greece and therefor gave a realistic feeling to the setting without feeling like a brochure for a romantic holiday like Captain Corelli's Mandolin. I know we all expect that and believe that it is normal when we see it but I've already seen otherwise and it's something you didn't always get at the time. Think for instance of the movie The Battle of the Bulge 1965 which was supposed to be situated in the Belgian Ardennes but which was shot with olive trees in the background and in a desertlike terrain. And trust me I'm Belgian myself and I know the region all too well so I know that there really isn't such a type of terrain to be found there.Next to the good story and the correct decor this movie also offers some fine acting from a great classical cast. With Gregory Peck David Niven Anthony Quinn Anthony Quayle... you get some of the most famous actors at the time and they all did a very nice job in this movie. Add to this the fact that story was very good that the action still looked nice that everything was shot in the right country and that everybody spoke the correct language. Then you know that there is absolutely nothing more I could ask for in this movie. I give this movie a well deserved 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "The way I see it we have three choices  take him with us leave him here or kill him.This simplistically summarizes the moral dilemmas at the heart of Alistar MacLean's classic novel and the superb Carl Forman film from which followed. The Guns Of Navarone at first looks like a basic mission  in 1943 a key channel in the Aegean Sea is commanded by two gigantic German siege batteries on the island of Navarone these guns prevent the reinforcement of a British island garrison nearby and if the garrison falls it will persuade Turkey to join the Axis powers an outcome Berlin is counting on as the war in Russia has turned against it with the defeat at Stalingrad. The guns cannot be bombed by air despite heroic efforts by the RAF and so is brought in a key Allied operative who has been working in occupied Crete since its fall to the Germans in 1941.  Captain Keith Mallory not only can speak the languages of the area with superb fluence he is Keith Mallory the Human Fly the best mountaineer in the world.  He feels he cannot climb the 400 foot precipice atop which the German batteries sit but he likes nothing better than a wellorganized setup upon seeing that he has no choice.  With the help of his closest combat comrade Stavro Anthony Quinn Mallory is assigned with Major Roy Franklin to ferry British commandos  one of the a wisecracking explosives expert Corporal John Anthony Miller David Niven on the perilous journey to the back door of Navarone.  But the infiltration is fraught with danger and when Franklin is badly injured the real crest of the story unfolds the moral dilemmas of the team as they must complete the mission while deciding how to handle an injury they cannot treat.  And as if that were not enough one of the Greek resistance operatives helping the team turns out to be a traitor after Miller finds his explosive equipment has been tampered with.  It leads to yet another of the several arguments that ensue through the film between Miller the soldier who does not want the responsibilities involved and Mallory who is determined to finish the job.  While one of the arguments doesn't make much sense  Miller is horrified when Mallory admits lying to Roy Franklin so that upon eventual capture Franklin will give away inaccurate information this is by far the most humane solution to the intolerable dilemma the team has faced  overall the clash between Mallory and Miller adds enormously to the film's tension thanks in no small part to the excellent performances of Gregory Peck and David Niven.The sets and props of the film are superb and overcome the comparative cheesiness of some of the special effects.".

Captain Keith Mallory not only can speak the languages of the area with superb fluence he is Keith Mallory the Human Fly the best mountaineer in the world.  He feels he cannot climb the 400 foot precipice atop which the German batteries sit but he likes nothing better than a wellorganized setup upon seeing that he has no choice.  With the help of his closest combat comrade Stavro Anthony Quinn Mallory is assigned with Major Roy Franklin to ferry British commandos  one of the a wisecracking explosives expert Corporal John Anthony Miller David Niven on the perilous journey to the back door of Navarone.  But the infiltration is fraught with danger and when Franklin is badly injured the real crest of the story unfolds the moral dilemmas of the team as they must complete the mission while deciding how to handle an injury they cannot treat.  And as if that were not enough one of the Greek resistance operatives helping the team turns out to be a traitor after Miller finds his explosive equipment has been tampered with.  It leads to yet another of the several arguments that ensue through the film between Miller the soldier who does not want the responsibilities involved and Mallory who is determined to finish the job.  While one of the arguments doesn't make much sense  Miller is horrified when Mallory admits lying to Roy Franklin so that upon eventual capture Franklin will give away inaccurate information this is by far the most humane solution to the intolerable dilemma the team has faced  overall the clash between Mallory and Miller adds enormously to the film's tension thanks in no small part to the excellent performances of Gregory Peck and David Niven.The sets and props of the film are superb and overcome the comparative cheesiness of some of the special effects.";

A great deal of debate about the feasibility of the whole operation has raged with military historians. The reason that the British Army and forces from their Commonwealth countries was to keep Turkey in the position of benevolent neutrality. At least this was one of Winston Churchill's stated aims and The Guns of Navarone makes the case for it.But specifically this film deals with a pair of menacing looking naval guns embedded in a cliff with a big rock overhang. The RAF can't get at the thing to destroy from air so a commando team is put together under the charge of Anthony Quayle. A couple of native Greeks are along Anthony Quinn and James Darren an explosives man David Niven a tough antifascist resistance man whose service dates back to the Spanish Civil War Stanley Baker and a mountain climber Gregory Peck.Peck has to get the team to climb a forbidding cliff which is the only area of the beach the Nazis don't guard because they think nobody can land over there. Peck gets the job done but Quayle becomes injured and Peck gets the responsibility for the whole mission.The Guns of Navarone is filled with tension as the men keep getting into and out of one situation after another. The film crackles with excitement and really should be seen on the big screen it's the only way you can appreciate the special effects which got The Guns of Navarone its Oscar.The film marked a screen partnership of Gregory Peck and director J. Lee Thompson they did four films together. Thompson specialized in these action adventure films. Later on Thompson partnered with Charles Bronson in some of his best films of the seventies and eighties.To get the young into the theater current teenage heart throb James Darren is in the cast. We even gets to hear him sing in Greek which is in fact Darren's own ancestry. Irene Papas is also in the cast as his older sister and Gia Scala is her silent friend.Despite setback and betrayal our team continues on. The climax of The Guns of Navarone is exciting and unforgettable and should not be missed.".

There are no irritating annoying people either which is very refreshing. Everyone in this group is pretty much on the same page.It's just a straight World War II adventure with no sappy romance subplots to take away from the story either. In other words this is man's movie pure and simple and a good one that still holds up today.Despite the good cast the story takes center stage. The visuals or sound aren't anything to write home about even with the latest superduper DVD edition.

Many scenes take place without dialog or score merely background noises like wind feet crunching gravel and the like. Some of the tensest scenes are made more so by our hearing only what the characters would hear. For example early on in the film the lead characters undergo a storm at sea and approach a dangerous narrows and until the scene's climax all we hear are howling wind driving rain and slamming waves. A musical score tells viewers how they are supposed to feel and often telegraphs shifts in plot or mood. As used in this film the absence of music heightens the drama and makes the action more immediate. What score there is is thus more effective earning its composer an Academy Award.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alistair MacLean's The Guns Of Navarone is a very straight forward WW II adventure thriller that is given a more complex big screen rendition. I feel the book excels at presenting the grueling physical endeavor involved in blowing up the guns as well as presenting plenty of obstacles for the saboteurs to overcome. In the novel only one character Andy Stevens has an internal problem to solve which is his fear of fear. This character does not make the transition to the big screen. The other characters Mallory Andrea Miller and Brown are all very professional at what they do and there is no philosophizing over the moral ambiguities involved in war. The characters played by Irene Papas and Gia Scala are male characters in the novel. Although it is tempting to think that the addition of the female characters is used strictly for the purpose of having someone for Gregory Peck to kiss Foreman uses their inclusion to great dramatic effect. In the novel it is Miller who shoots the traitor named Panayis. To illustrate how different the novel is from the film thematically this is how that scene is described in the book. Carefully accurately he shot Panayis through the heart twice blew out the candles turned his back and was halfway towards the door before the man had crashed to the ground. I think it is the way Carl Foreman chose to adapt the novel as well as many of the gripping visuals brought to the screen by director Thompson that have made this such a memorable film for many people over the years.".

It was probably quite primitive by todays standard but very impressive for it's day and everyone loved it! The story was also quite good although fictional and the acting is top shelf.

There is not a lot of emotion expressed at seeing Major Lucky Roy Franklin but the two men are glad to greet each other as comrades. But the movie's first emotional tailspin is when Squadron Leader Barnsby gives a report on his group's failure to attack Navarone. You can see the fatigue on Richard Harris' face as he tells the bloody truth about what is being asked of him and his men. A fine cameo by this late great actor. The characters don't smile or joke too much and when they do the viewer can plainly see that there's more to tell underneath the surface. This was a great job of acting by all concerned and they are given wonderful dialog to accompany the stress and tension of the time. The top scenes are when insubordination looms among the characters not because the person in charge is being sadistic or unfair but because of the fatigue of everyone. The action and stunts are great and this is the first movie I've seen that has both cliff climbing AND cliff diving!".

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst it would make few people's All time top ten lists I'm hard pressed to think of a film which is so relentlessly enjoyable as Kelly's Heroes. Part war movie part comedy part bankjob caper the different elements combine seamlessly to produce a distinctive and memorable film.Clint Eastwood in an unusually subdued but nonetheless commanding performance plays the leader of a platoon of restless GIs in the chaos of post DDay France.  When he captures a German officer who just happens to be in possession of a solid gold bar Clint extracts the necessary information and before you can say Three Kings he's hatched a plan to make it 30 miles beyond enemy lines to nab the 16 million stash.  He can't do it alone of course but has no trouble in convincing his fellow troops that if they're going to be killed in this war the reward for them should be worth the risk.  Enlisting the help of Quartermaster Crapgame Don Rickles Sergeant Big Joe Telly Savalas and Sherman tank driver Oddball Donald Sutherland among others Kelly and his platoon of ironic heroes are soon on their way to an eventual showdown with the German Tiger tank unit guarding the bank...All too often crossgenre pictures can be let down if the balance isn't right but that's not the case here because each element is as good as it can be.  The action and battle scenes are well executed especially that in which Oddball and his Shermans attack a German depot.  The comic relief is genuinely funny rather than cheesy and includes a beautiful scene at the climax of the movie which gently parodies Clint's spaghettiwestern days complete with the strains of codMorricone music.  The suspense is well maintained where necessary such as the scene where the platoon is caught exposed in the middle of a minefield with a truckload of Germans bearing down on them.  And of course there is the ensemble cast which is uniformly excellent.  Keep an eye out for a young Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser who is better known as Uncle Leo in Seinfeld.  Sutherland's protohippie Always with them negative waves Moriarty! and Carroll O'Connor's manic General  Colt are just two performances which live long in the memory alongside the everreliable Eastwood and Savalas.There are a few points made about the madness and futility of war if that's what you're looking for.  Allied bombers knock out bridges by day German mobile engineers rebuild them by night... neither the Americans or the Germans seem to know what's going on or where their lines are supposed to be... behind the lines our heroes are attacked by their own aircraft... General Colt  mistakes Kelly's goldinspired push for a patriotic determination to end the war and mobilizes his army to follow him chastising the staff officers around him for failing to show the same spirit!But ultimately this movie is about entertainment rather than political comment.  And as such it is one of the most successful examples of its type as the almost total absence of negative comments from this page should indicate.  The script by Troy Kennedy Martin The Italian Job is tight and direction by Brian G Hutton Where Eagles Dare equally assured. Perhaps regarded as lightweight in comparison to other more serious men on a mission movies such as Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen or Hutton's aforementioned Where Eagles Dare the film has nonetheless been influential.  For example although David O Russell's Three Kings veers off on a tangent and makes more of a serious comment on the US role in the Gulf War its matchbook plot ie that which can be written on the back of a matchbook is the same as Kelly's Heroes.  And in the speakers mounted on the side of Oddball's tanks used to blast music at the enemy and freak them out there is more than a hint of the Wagnerplaying helicopters in Coppola's Apocalypse Now still some nine years hence at the time of this film's release.In my humble opinion therefore Kelly's Heroes is a supremely enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  You will be doing yourself a favour if next time you get the chance you take a look.  It's rare that I see a film and don't think at least once that I'd change something about it but if there is something to change in Kelly's Heroes I don't know what it is. With that in mind I give it a...1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Whilst it would make few people's All time top ten lists I'm hard pressed to think of a film which is so relentlessly enjoyable as Kelly's Heroes. Part war movie part comedy part bankjob caper the different elements combine seamlessly to produce a distinctive and memorable film.Clint Eastwood in an unusually subdued but nonetheless commanding performance plays the leader of a platoon of restless GIs in the chaos of post DDay France.  When he captures a German officer who just happens to be in possession of a solid gold bar Clint extracts the necessary information and before you can say Three Kings he's hatched a plan to make it 30 miles beyond enemy lines to nab the 16 million stash.  He can't do it alone of course but has no trouble in convincing his fellow troops that if they're going to be killed in this war the reward for them should be worth the risk.

	schema:reviewBody "Utterly hilarious World War II adventure picture with some great acting by all of the leads fine action sequences and superb scenery.Kelly Clint Eastwood captures a German colonel David Hurst who inadvertently tells him where the Germans are hiding 16000000 worth of gold bars. Kelly enlists the aid of his platoon to trek behind the German lines and steal the cash.The movie features a topnotch cast of veterans and wouldbe stars. Eastwood THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY has a quiet serious role and floats through the entire picture. Telly Savalas PANCHO VILLA makes a great counterpart as the loud shorttempered and cynical platoon sergeant. Donald Sutherland THE EAGLE HAS LANDED steals the show though in a very offbeat role as a hippiestyle tank commander. He delivers some utterly 60s dialog with great style and is uproarious. Don Rickles is funny too in a smaller role as Crapgame  a rearechelon supply clerk who goes along on the trek for a profit and gets more than he bargains for. Carroll O'Connor THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE has an unnecessary but zany role as General Colt a blustering officer who can't understand why his redblooded American soldiers aren't cutting through the German army. The role is obviously a knockoff of George C. Scott in PATTON and O'Connor does an excellent job.The supporting cast is fine too though not many make much of an impact. Jeff Morris is a hoot as Cowboy a transplanted Texas hick with Harry Dean Stanton in support as his sidekick Stuart Margolin is a jittery radio operator Len Lesser is a construction officer who gets conned into going along to build a bridge for the guys and ends getting really screwed over by Kelly's boys Hal Buckley is the platoon commander who only cares about getting his yacht to Paris Gene Collins is the babyfaced youngster. David Hurst is lovable as the dimwitted German colonel and it's really a shame he gets killed  especially by one of his own tanks. Karl Otto Alberty THE GREAT ESCAPE has a nice small role near the end as a Tiger tank commander and there's an antiwar spin when Kelly and crew let him escape unscathed. Watch for John G. Heller OPERATION CROSSBOW as the German patrol leader during the minefield scene.The movie also features some terrific action scenes. The minefield debacle is suspenseful and nailbiting and eventually filled with tons of gunfire and neat explosions. The final battle in which the dozen or so heroes manage to wipe out a garrison of Germans in a small French village is expertly filmed with some great camerawork and lots of good convincing special effects. Some major aspects of this sequence were ripped off in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  Tiger tanks in the street a sniper in a bell tower machine gunners firing from bombedout buildings  the whole general look of the sequence was completely conned.The Lalo Schiffrin score is lighthearted fun and Mike Curb Congregation's Burning Bridges theme is a good song but doesn't at all fit the theme of the movie. The film was shot in Yugoslavia to take advantage of lower production costs. It actually looks a lot like central France with plenty of hedgerows bombed out buildings and such  nothing like the mountains and rivers of THE BATTLE OF NERETVA.I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies appropriately letterboxed at about 2.351 with hardly a flaw in the print. Colors are accurate and the image is pretty sharp. TNT used to play an awful orangelooking print of the movie with the dialog edited to pieces also The audio is fine and sounds clear and loud but the gunfire and explosions lack intensity. The film is also available on DVD.KELLY'S HEROES is a witty lighthearted WWII adventure which I don't think any fan can miss. If you need to sit back and watch American GIs kick German butt for 2 and a half hours for a goal as lofty as pure allAmerican greed then this is your flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm the first one to rant at ridiculous war movies. The history has to be right the uniforms and so on and so on. Plots have to be creditable or I'm the first one to cry foul. But then there comes along movies like Kelly's Heroes. It's violent and meaningless really...but funny and very exciting. The gear is accurate for the most part which is far more than I can say about the bulk of so called serious war films. Even with the infamous Tiger tank the film makers attempted to at least make the Russian built Yugoslav T53s they were using look like Tigers. I think they were T53s they did such a good job of making them look like Tigers it's hard to tell. The whole film is a 1960s antiestablishment slant thrown on a pretty standard WWII story about GIs on a mission behind the German lines. In this parallel universe John Wayne type mission these guys are out for number one. It's their mission not the US Army's or the Allies. With a headlines crazy General chasing behind them with his photographer looking to pin medals on his boys for piercing the German lines and apparently leading his charge they're heading for a town full of Germans guarding a bank with three Tiger tanks. Clint Eastwood has to pick up the means to complete this personal mission along the way without the secret leaking out. We even have 1960s Hippies in this silly war torn 1940s world. Donald Sutherland is a riot as a stoned Sherman tank commander who seems to have stepped into a timewarp and emerged in 1944 and found himself at the helm of an armored unit. Several then unknowns are in the film including Harry Dean Stanton and Gavin Mcleod. Beautiful scenery and photography shot in what was then Yugoslavia. Excellent attention to equipment detail. Good if over the top performances all around. Suspense and excitement. Very funny. And possibly the silliest pothole laden plot to ever pass itself off as a war movie. If you're a war movie buff with a sense of humor you'll love it.".

This is not a serious film about WW2.  Read some of the excellent commentaries here about the social and temporal context of this film i.e. the height of the Vietnamese war.  Yes Sutherland your fellow countryman was an active antiwar protester and fully embraced the anachronistic hippie role.  The madcap story which tweaks the nose of the establishment in this case the military establishment is plausible when you let go of the blood guts and glory of the war film genre. And it is a damn funny film.  Eastwood is at his clenched jaw cynical best Savalas is great as the Sergeant bigguy Carrol O'Conner is riotious as the general Rickles is well Rickles.  But Sutherland steals the show.  The scenes where they tanks come out blasting the Germans to the tune of twangy CountryWestern music is hilarious. Sutherland's outoftimesync ...no negative vibes... hey man...yeah baby... is sidesplitting.  The final confrontation scene between the three striding up to the German tank commander with Sutherland loosening his side arm ala Clint Eastwood in Fist full of Dollars is a riot.   This film is full of funny stuff.  And you can see it again and again and find new business to laugh about.  Buffs will delight at seeing Harry Dean Stanton in a preRepo Man role and Richard Davalos who played James Dean's doomed brother Aron in East of Eden.  This is a great piece of satire that was overlooked cast aside and has still survived to the delight of those of us who enjoy it again and again.  But hey don't just take my word for it.  Of the 30 or so commentaries here and do read them as there are some excellent ones only one was a detractor.".

It has one of the best casts around with Clint Eastwood Telly Savalas Don Rickles Donald Sutherland and Carroll O' Connor. It has action and humor what more could you want. It is a great film hands down. Do yourself a favor and view its splendor. The Mike Curb song is great and catchy the editing is on par with any other movie and the plot although improbable is entertaining. All told it gets a 9.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kelly's Heroes does not try to trivialize war. It portrays a comedy within the boundaries of war's absurdity. Quite frankly I did not like the film MASH because I felt it did try to trivialize war.What makes Kelly's Heroes a success is that the director never forgot that the point of comedy is to make us laugh. There's no message here just pure entertainment.The film is believable because it stretches but never steps over the line of plausibility. The story is preposterous but in the confusion of war we can believe something like this could happen. Those who have served in the military have all met characters like the ones in Kelly's platoon even Oddball. Yes Donald Sutherland was clearly cast out of time from the 60s but he somehow personified the rebel in all of us and that spans generations. If anything Oddball subliminally told us it was okay to view the film from our vantage point of 1970. His character worked. And so did all the others.On top of that the filmmaker spent the extra time and expense to insure reasonable technical accuracy. The uniforms were authentic and I was most impressed by the fact that the vehicles and equipment for both sides were accurate. My biggest gripe about 'Patton' was that it used M41 tanks for both sides just painted differently.The structure of the film is excellent. We believe everything is real. The early scene where the platoon is sitting on the side of the road while a seemingly endless convoy of Sherman tanks passes is a perfect example. There may have only been a few tanks but the way they were looped about continuously gave the impression of 'a cast of thousands'. The Yugoslavian backdrop was reflective of WWII Europe.Watch this film a few times and you'll catch the slight nuances not normally found the first time through. It's classic how seemingly unimportant early events or dialog enhance the humor of later scenes. For example when Oddball first shows Kelly his tanks he says they have loud speakers to calm their nerves and paint in their shells to scare the Germans. Early Sherman tanks had a low velocity shell that was ineffective against German armor. Later we roar when Kelly catches a Tiger from its vulnerable rear but Oddball forgets to fire an antitank round and instead splatters it with pink paint! The railroad yard attack scene which is superbly choreographed and tactically accurate becomes absolutely riotous when Oddball's crew plays 'I've been working on the Railroad' after destroying the place and rumbling away.Don Rickles should have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Crapgame. He congeals all the other elements and characters in the film.The parody scene of 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' is superb. Like Oddball its being out of time somehow enhances its own effect.I read somewhere that Clint Eastwood was a bit disappointed with this film because he was not allowed to give it one more edit before its release. I don't know how on earth he could have improved on it.".

To its credit while Kelly's Heroes is  antiestablishmentit is not some shallow preachy antiwar film so typical of later films of the 70's and 80's. While it shares some traits of antiwar filmsincompetent leadership and wasteful tactics it doesn't ever really take an over moralizing war is hell stance. Indeed while the heroes do rebel against the establishmenttheir officers their rebellion is motivated by plunder and personal profit not because they feel war is morally wrong or unjustified. Likewise while Sutherland's Oddball has many hippie traits as has been pointed out his tactical skill as a tanker and willingness to kill for profit are hardly hippie in nature. While the antiestablishment stance of the film is indeed motivated by the time in which it was made1970 the film could have just as easily been set in any place or time period with or without a war as a background. The setting of the film in world war 2 however helps the audience immediately elicit sympathy with the main charactersAmerican soldiers despite the illegalunauthorized action which they undertake and the neccesarily violent methods which they use to accomplish their taskkilling Nazis. Despite this the film's portrayal of world war 2 tactics and equipment are excellentand gives the film a sense of realismexcitement and seriousness that it wouldn't otherwise have.

Kelly's Heroes has its moments of wartime spectacle and lots of slambang action but it also has plenty of comedy thrown in. Many critics judged the film quite harshly groaning about how it is inappropriate for a film to mix jokes and war. But in truth Kelly's Heroes never pretends to be a serious wartime account  and the humorous undercurrent helps the film rather than hampering it.A bunch of American GIs are given a few days away from the battlefront during WWII. However they are not overly impressed with the quiet excessively peaceful and boozeless village where they've been told to relax. One member of the group Kelly Eastwood has learned of a fortune in Nazi gold bullion hidden away in a bank in a Germanoccupied town some thirty or more miles behind enemy lines. He tells the other guys about it and they decide to risk their lives to get hold of the hoard. Of course pulling off a bank robbery is no easy task at the best of times but when the bank is so far into enemy territory......Eastwood is suitably laidback here but the real stars of the show are Telly Savalas dynamic and hilarious as Big Joe and Donald Sutherland a hippy tank driver so chilledout he's happy to eat cheese drink wine and sunbathe in the middle of a chaotic battle! The pyrotechnics are wellorchestrated and Troy Kennedy Martin invests the script with the kind of amusing banter and thrilling set pieces that he gave to The Italian Job a year earlier. Kelly's Heroes is totally unsubtle and totally removed from reality  but what it lacks in tact it makes up for with spectacular destruction and bags of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great cast of popular stars are perfectly chosen for their ability to play it tongueincheek. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland in particular have demonstrated their ability to pitch anything from straight comic and crazy in other movies.It's a heist behind enemy lines. There's millions of dollars in gold just waiting for some military enterprise. Clint Eastwood plays a straightlaced GI who decides to turn soldieroffortune when he discovers this stash of bullion is inadequately guarded just 30 miles beyond their advance. The post Dday German defences are crumbling and in the confusion he and his team might just pulloff the perfect crime.Right from the outset this is a great action movie. Clint and Telly's outfit find themselves caughtup in fierce combat. There's tremendous pyrotechnics here and what look like real Tiger tanks not disguised American hardware. It's tense vigorous and exciting stuff but with a thread of ironic comedy all the way. Each of the principal characters is simply but clearly stamped. They're flawed likable and we care about them  as we should. Using a couple of 'specimen' gold bars Eastwood's character coopts and bribes whatever and whoever he needs to succeed in the caper inadvertently shortening WW2 in the process.Throughout the movie there is some of the most splendid wartime action drama in any work of its vintage. Yes the Germans are slaughtered wholesale as usual  but who cares? There is also one of the most entertaining closequarter tank encounters of just about any movie  including the epic 'Battle Of The Bulge'. Sutherland's solitary Sherman goes up against 3 Tigers in the confined streets of a French village employing its manoeuvrability and surprise.That last conflict is extremely well realised. A surprisingly generous level of base rewards the use of subwoofers as these roaring dragonlike machines compete in the rural ideal. At the same time as the ambush is prepared a simple rhythmical riff gathers instrumental complexity ratchetingup the tension in a way that is both simple and effective. The riff doesn't get faster more instruments are gradually included into the given tempo. A similar trick was employed in 'Henry V' of 1935 vintage. I'm surprised it isn't used more often.The action is realistic the humour never jars with the tragedies that befall our heroes locations are wonderfully evocative  I was convinced that this was shot in France filming editing and other technical issues all hit the spot. As a piece of action entertainment  wartime or otherwise  its hard to fault.You couldn't improve upon this movie even today. For one thing the players simply don't exist who could fill these collective characters. Neither could the combat scenes be more intense or realistic whilst retaining the comic thread.In terms of what it has to offer this movie then is very much a oneoff. Very highly recommended.".

At the same time as the ambush is prepared a simple rhythmical riff gathers instrumental complexity ratchetingup the tension in a way that is both simple and effective. The riff doesn't get faster more instruments are gradually included into the given tempo. A similar trick was employed in 'Henry V' of 1935 vintage. I'm surprised it isn't used more often.The action is realistic the humour never jars with the tragedies that befall our heroes locations are wonderfully evocative  I was convinced that this was shot in France filming editing and other technical issues all hit the spot. As a piece of action entertainment  wartime or otherwise  its hard to fault.You couldn't improve upon this movie even today. For one thing the players simply don't exist who could fill these collective characters. Neither could the combat scenes be more intense or realistic whilst retaining the comic thread.In terms of what it has to offer this movie then is very much a oneoff. Very highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody " spoilers aheadI didn't see this movie until 15 years or so after its release but when I was a little kid I heard the Burning Bridges theme in heavy rotation on the radio and it instantly appealed.  I should have known that the movie would too and this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again without tiring.  It seems to be that they really don't make 'em like they used to and the few years between the late '60s and mid'70s produced some of the best warthemed and this would include antiwar films ever made. Most of them were built around stories that could actually have been told in a similar way in another setting.  This film is an example of that principle as is Catch 22 and  though I somehow seem to have managed to miss it thus far definitely not by design  MASH Apocalypse Now is a slightly later example in that it could have been set in any conflict or as in the novel from which it drew inspiration in what passes for peacetime. The cast is great and it's probably that as much as anything that has the power to keep me watching this long film to its conclusion even after multiple viewings.  Pretty much everyone's perfectly cast and all do a great job with balancing the real nastiness of war that does intrude now and then with the more comedic elements that really define the film.  For me the primary attraction of this movie and its most unforgettable character  is Oddball the Sherman tank commander played to perfection by Donald Sutherland in all his hippiesque glory.  Every second that Oddball has on screen is classic his wayoutness being all the more exaggerated by contrast with Clint Eastwood's generally stony faade and the pragmatism of Telly Savalas' character.  The three primary leads actually make up a pretty good yinyangish kind of composite person the tightly reinedin but actually quite visionary cynic in Kelly the practical and cautioning skeptic in Big Joe and the free thinking Oddball.  All of the actors including those in relatively minor roles are superb but who could forget Oddball's all knowing facial expressions as if only he were privy to some private joke his admonitions that Moriarty quit with the 'negative waves' his outofleftfield dog imitations both of them including his other dog imitation his kicking back with some wine and cheese and catching some rays during the final battle etc etc etc.  He's a visionary too with his idea of playing music during his attacks   did Coppola get the idea for that classic helicopter gunship Valkyries scene in Apocalypse Now from this movie? Oddball's very existence makes the film somewhat selfaware but the scene that perhaps brings this home more than any other and hopefully dispels any viewer's lingering suspicion that this is primarily a 'serious' war movie is the Tombstonestyle 'showdown' with the last operational Tiger tank complete with dubbedin jangling spurs as tribute to Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western legacy.  I could see how some might not like such a movie but I love it. The producers also did a nice job of keeping things authentic other than the jarring anachronism that is Oddball and his crew of protohippies though I'm prepared to accept that they anticipated the first wave of the Beat Generation the likely explanation is that they're a deliberately contrived ironic reference to the period during which the film was made  a kind of bridge albeit not burning. The Yugoslavian locations fit the story and are convincing as a standin for WWII France.  The US military hardware is accurate as are German uniforms and as far as I could tell I wasn't scrutinizing every gun their hardware.  The SdKfz halftrack that the German patrol at the minefield used may have been a gussiedup US version  I didn't really stop to look  but that's no big deal not particularly obvious in the film and more than forgivable in that the film's makers put so much thought into mocking up Tiger I tank bodies on what were really Soviet T34 tanks.  That was a nice touch especially for a movie that does not take itself particularly seriously is not a serious study of war though war forms its background people die the pointlessness of war is highlighted and the enemy's not painted as onedimensional fiends  indeed the movie's real enemies in some ways are Allied commanders. I like that the remnants of Kelly's Heroes teamed up with the SS Panzer commander divisional markings correct for the elite 1st SS Panzer Division 'Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler' as far as I know to share the spoils too further bolstering the message that it's war itself rather than people that wear different uniforms that is the soldier's enemy. My capsule summary I guess would be that watching this excellent movie is a very enjoyable way to spend a thoroughly entertaining 212 hours.  Woof woof.  That's my other dog imitation.".

The script is a gem focusing on the mechanics of organising the perfect crime without tipping off Army bureaucracy or the enemy and is chockfull of memorable lines and authentic touches that sell the unlikely premise for example a major plot point revolves around the welldocumented inferiority of the US Sherman tank vs. the German Tiger I.Nearly the entire cast turns in memorable performances Telly Savalas as Big Joe basically Sgt.

Clint Eastwood plays his usual tightlipped tough guy and wisely leaves the jokes to the rest of the cast.Director Brian G. Hutton hot off the success of Where Eagles Dare was given a big budget to play with and puts the money to use blowing up whole companies of faceless Nazis in several spectacular battle sequences. Wellchosen Yugoslavian locations stand in for 1944 France.The DVD version released in late 2000 is of excellent quality.

	schema:reviewBody "Karl Markovics had to work hard to escape his signature role as Stockinger the funny sidekick in the popular TV show Kommissar Rex. It took a lot of serious theater work and the leading role in Stefan Ruzowitzky's Academy Award winning Die Flscher until he finally got the respect he deserved as an actor. Now Markovics goes on to prove his talents extend beyond just acting Atmen is his debut as a writer and director  and he hits the bull's eye on the first try.Apparently Markovics has worked on a lot of script ideas over the years but never deemed any of them good enough to be developed into a movie. Finally his wife convinced him to go through with one of those ideas and rightfully so. Atmen is an artistic triumph. Not only is the script brilliantly written but it is also flawlessly executed. The direction seems almost effortless as if Markovics was already an old master. He seems to know intentionally what to show when he's got a great eye for frames and unagitated pictures and an actor himself he naturally knows how to direct other actors. That's not to take away from the great cast. Veteran stars like Georg Friedrich and Karl Rott don't disappoint but the focus lies on Thomas Schubert who says a lot with just facial expressions. Obviously the movie's success depended on Schubert's performance and the first time actor lives up to the task. He's a great talent. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the future.Atmen is a touching and believable movie about life and death tightlipped but never boring bleak but in the end optimistic. It's very authentic in its depiction of Vienna its depiction of a boy who hasn't been dealt the best cards in life. And most of all it's got its heart in the right place. This really deserves an Oscar win  much more than Die Flscher did actually.".

Words seem inadequate to describe a movie that communicates so effectively with very few words words that only hold the story together but never carry the full weight of its power. But all I have here is words so I must try.Breathing is the story of Roman Kogler a 19yearold inmate of a juvenile detention center where he has lived since he was 14 and killed a boy who had been bullying him. Roman was given up by his overwhelmed teenage mother soon after his birth she had almost killed him to stop his crying and has spent his whole life in orphanages and group homes where the bullying incident occurred.He is almost catatonic with no idea how to relate to other human beings. He's like a wounded wild animal held in a cage never looking anyone in the eye and almost never speaking I didn't count but I'd be surprised if he said more than 50 words in the whole movie. Inside the tortured terrified shell is a sweet and gentle boy tired of being alone but with no idea how to come out a chance encounter with an American girl on a train is especially touching and lovely.Thomas Schubert the totally inexperienced actor who plays him never even in a school play and went to the audition only because a friend he wanted to see was going does it all with his eyes his face and his body language. To say it's a powerful performance is a pitifully inadequate understatement. He is amazing.This is a very very great movie the first feature written and directed by Austrian actor Karl Markovics. It is quiet and unpredictable and deeply moving with none of the cheap emotional manipulation gutwrenching melodrama and gratuitous plot twists I was afraid of after a lifetime of watching American movies. Breathing is beautiful simple powerful and profoundly satisfying.".

Nobody else seems to like him either. He doesn't like himself. Beset by inner demons he has committed some unspeakable crime. His only ally is the probation officer who is helping him to find a job that will convince a parole board that Roman is worthy to be released back into the community. Through the course of the movie we learn that he is a boy who has been dealt a bad hand in life. Brought up in care he has been a lost soul who made a tragic mistake that caused him to spend his teenage years in detention. A job in the city morgue proves to be the turning point in the movie and in his life. This job is the symbol of his eventual redemption. As his prison peers turn away from him in disgust at his choice of job his equally wary coworkers initially sceptical at having a convicted criminal in their midst soon become accepting of the boy and eventually encourage him to develop in his new role. A stroke of fate during a callout one day leads Roman down a path of selfdiscovery which will help him to understand why he became the person he now is and allows the audience to explore the damaged relationship which needs to be repaired before the boy can address his inner demons and move on with his life. This is stark often graphic but never dull. You will end up liking Roman. As he understands what has brought him to this point in his life he begins to like himself more. He exhibits an inner strength and confidence that belies his young years. You can be sure he will make a success of himself in spite of the bad start that life offered him.".

Directed keenly by Karl Markovics the movie is subtle quiet and reflective with an excellent touch. Performances were excellent and dialog was believable. Lead young actor Thomas Schubert follows the excellent direction and gives a quietly strong performance. One of the things I enjoyed is the storytellers went away from making the juvenile too edgy or loud. Rather he is contemplative and slowly remorseful and yet human enough to overstep boundaries and sometimes challenge authority. This movie is a winner and one of the better I've seen.

There isn't anything dramatic going on until the final third of the movie. So we're relying on this being a character study. A character study has major problems here. The actor is not charismatic and the character is supposed to be withdrawn. Again that doesn't make for compelling watching. A final reveal is very enlightening about his incarceration.

	schema:reviewBody "Atmen or Breathing is an Austrian movie in the German language from 2011 so it had its 5th anniversary last year. It is the first filmmaking work for Karl Markovics one of Austria's finest actors. You may know him from playing the main character in the Oscarwinning Die Flscher. So yeah it is his rookie effort but by now he has made another film already. But back to this one here. It received a great deal of awards recognition for example at the Austrian Film Awards but it got also picked to represent Austria at the Oscars where it was however not nominated. Young lead actor Thomas Schubert who also won an Austrian Film Award for his performance is probably not yet known to many but Germanlanguage film buffs will recognize at least Georg Friedrich who plays one of the major supporting players namely the protagonist's boss. And Markovics of course.This is the story of a young man who commits a terrible crime that gets him to jail and the movie is about how he comes to terms with what he did. A lot of it has to do with his work at a morgue where he gets an entirely new perspective about life and death. Obviously this one plot reference would not be enough for a 90minute movie so they did nicely in including a reference to his mother who abandoned him at a very young age and she says at one point that it was the best she has ever done and when she elaborated on this statement later on it is an interesting reference to what the protagonist did because surrendering to the situation is always a viable option. I also liked the scene at the train with the EnglishAmerican girl. Some may see it as irrelevant but to me it offered a lot. First of all it is the one occasion where the central character is just a teenage boy like everybody else and he experiences what life could be like if he had not done what he did and how just even the most simple things like having a beer were prohibited and on the other hand it shows that love is not yet in the books for him as the only woman he was looking for at that particular time was his mother.Overall the movie needed a while to get going and really catch my attention but the longer it went the more it did. It is obvious that Markovics had lots of experience with all kinds of filmmakers and he successful transformed this experience in his own craft as a writer and director the man in charge behind the camera. So quite a revelation for a rookie filmmaker at the age of almost 50 back then. I maybe would not share the universal acclaim for Schubert as the main character but not because he was bad or any thing but because he just did what he had to and was pretty solid especially for an actor his age. This film to me feels much more about the story as a whole than about individual performance and I don't think it may be right to put one above the others only because he had more screen time. But this is not a negative point either or at least not one that leaves a really weak note in terms of the viewing experience. Like I said earlier what maybe bothers me the most about the film is that it takes quite a while to get going and could have worked better with a superior first half. The ending was nicely again as it shows that the film is not about who he was we never see the attack but about who he became. A wellrounded effort and I applaud Markovics and the rest for it. Certainly worth checking out.".

But not really as the director explained QA at tiff 2011 it is about breathing  an sign of life. He goes on to say this is about how one did not know the tools of life finds out about these tools .. so I'm adding here this person can deal with life.But the choices made from each frame are just about perfect.

But not really as the director explained QA at tiff 2011 it is about breathing  an sign of life. He goes on to say this is about how one did not know the tools of life finds out about these tools .. so I'm adding here this person can deal with life.But the choices made from each frame are just about perfect.

According to Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh Breathing opens the door to stopping and looking deeply in order to enter the domain of concentration and insight. For Roman Kogler Thomas Schubert in Karl Markovics remarkable debut film Breathing it is simply the means to avoid suffocating in a world in which even at the age of nineteen he has already suffered many losses. Written and directed by Austrian actor Karl Markovics The Counterfeiters and winner of the best film award at Directors' Fortnight in Cannes last year Breathing is the story of a sullen young man waging a lonely battle to recover his selfhood.Having grown up in an orphanage after being abandoned by his mother there is no mention of his father Roman has spent the last five years of his life in a juveniledetention center for the killing of a young bully. I didn't murder him he died in hospital he proclaims. Taciturn to the point of mute Roman does not know much about life outside the confines of his protective but nonstimulating environment. His life consists of reading travel magazines smoking sleeping and swimming. Even when he is swimming he is alone. The other boys line up outside the pool and wait for him to get out. Hesitant and afraid he masks his fear with a swagger but no one is fooled.To have a chance at getting out Roman is told by his parole officer that he must show that he can hold a steady job. Let go from his tryout as a welder because he refused to wear a helmet he is hired to be a mortuary attendant after answering an ad but emotionally he is barely distinguishable from the corpses and is treated shabbily by his robotlike coworkers who know he is in detention. He hangs on however knowing that this may be his last chance for parole. Slowly he learns how to perform better at his job and the negative attitude of the harshest coworker changes to one of support depicted in a tender sequence where they wash and dress the body of an older woman together while her daughter waits outside the room.Every day Roman must get up at the crack of dawn to take the train into Vienna where he passes by a huge billboard advertising a vacation that ironically implores us to dive into adventure. When he returns each evening he has to undergo a humiliating strip search. Something finally clicks for him when he deals with a corpse who has his same last name. Suddenly motivated he tracks down his mother Karin Lischka to confront her about the reason she gave him up at birth. When she tells him that it was the best thing I ever did in my life he is understandably stunned. Though the mood of the film is mostly solemn there is a lovely scene on the subway where a young American girl sits next to Roman and they share a beer together which he is not allowed to do.Though he knows he will never see her again it is the first time he has smiled during the movie and it signals a process of awakening. In Breathing Markovics has woven a potentially sentimental tale into a film that is grounded in subtlety and nuance. Though raw and at times bleak it is a work that is laced with a gentle compassion and the touching performance of nonprofessional actor Thomas Schubert is a revelation. Though he still has a long way to go the panning shot of cinematographer Martin Gschlacht transporting us high above the grey city above its cemeteries above its jails and its claustrophobic environment suggests that Roman can now be tall as the sky and for the first time wide enough to embrace what it means to be free.".

A mishmash of plot lines a choppy mess and a horribly stagnated pace make the film hard to watch start to finish. I managed this and I'm proud. As a fan of Seagal's work mostly of his old days it's painful to see him star in such tripe. True Seagal's last half dozen movies or so have sucked a lot but some of them at least had some redeeming features. Attack Force is a mess. From conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes from an alien plot line to the current one about a highly addictive super drug about to be unleashed on the Romanian the film has several settings none of which are Romanian but all look like Romania because they are in Romania! populace. The film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was. Plotholes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure. That's been a problem in Seagal's last few films as well but never has the result been so boring. There's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with CTX that's the drugs cool name that is never resolved! Of course in recent years the plot's haven't been the main draw in the Seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments especially the action. Before I regard the action though all the other departments are poor. The direction is poor or perhaps better put made to look poor. Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film? Between him finishing his job the reshoots by stunt man Tom Delmar and the editing a coherent auteur vision is completely lost. The best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop! The cinematography is dull nearly inducing sleep while the droning score sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers does nothing to excite matters. The cast too are poor unable to salvage anything here. Seagal looks bored beyond recognition and is dubbed through much of the picture clearly when plotpoints are being changed. He looks tired and overweight and lethargic unlike he's looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in Seagal's recent pictures. The only redeemable cast member is Adam Croasdell as one of the villains doing a slimy Brit routine. He seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line because he's playing it inhuman. He seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion seemingly waiting for her husband Dracula.Finally the action. Well it's poor. Poorly conceived poorly shot. There's not much either and there's even less featuring Seagal. Stevo doesn't really bring out the stunt double here because there's so little to do. There's even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that intercuts occasionally with little flashes of Seagal's stand in because clearly Seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene. Seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head. Seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit but from what I understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in. Seagal will apparently not be working with these people again or with Castel Studio's who continue to deliver horrifically subNuImage that's saying something material.Overall this is one to avoid if you are not a Seagal fan. Seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again. Unfortunately his next film which has already been shot with the same people promises to be even worse than this. ".

The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a scifi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very confusing.";

	schema:reviewBody "What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force with protagonist Marshall Lawson Seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical oneliner ass kicking form. However what we get is a crime mystery bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got a 210 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! Revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven you need redemption!".

This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force with protagonist Marshall Lawson Seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical oneliner ass kicking form.

Neither Lawson or Dixon are happy  set out to get to the bottom of the gruesome murders the trail leads to a Russian bird Ileana Lazariuc  an American guy who plan on releasing CTX into the local water supply to turn the entire city into addicts for reasons I am not sure about. With the dual task of revenge  saving the local population Lawson has his work cutout he leads a team of US soldiers into the enemies base in order to stop their evil plans once  for all...This Romanian British  American coproduction apparently had the working title Harvester  was directed by Michael Keusch  for me is the single worst film Steven Seagal has made to date that I have seen  believe me when I say he has made some seriously rubbish films I should know better than to even bother with Seagal's straighttovideoDVD output but I always seem boneheaded enough to spend my time watching them in the hope that one might just be alright but generally speaking I am disappointed more often than not. Right lets start with the positives of Attack Force. Well there's a really hot blonde woman in it named Lisa Lovbrand who cowriter Seagal cheekily writes his  her character's a kissing scene who is a joy to look at  there's one minor surprise towards the end as one character has a very unexpected fate which goes against clich which was nice but apart from those two minor positive aspects Attack Force is a really really awful film. The script is almost incomprehensible Attack Force is one of the most poorly scripted  downright confusing films you are ever likely to see. There's lots of scenes of men in suits trying to act sinister to try  make this large conspiracy seem threatening  interesting but the film never really introduces anyone properly  I don't mind admitting there were parts of the film where I didn't have a clue who anyone was or what relevance to the overall plot certain scenes had. The dialogue is terrible the plot makes no sense  has some of the worst narrative ever  there's not even that much action in it either to compensate. The whole plot about the CTX drug being released into the water is never resolved  there's no explanation or reason as to why this drug makes people super strong  able to to throw people through concrete walls or why their eyes flash. For my money Attack Force is one of the worst written films I have ever seen  the worst film Seagal has made or likely to make which is saying something.Besides being conceptually awful Attack Force has production values to match you will simply not believe the dubbing in Attack Force it's so bad. Every so often Seagal's voice changes completely as he is overdubbed for no apparent reason couldn't Seagal have done it himself? The guy who dubs Seagal sounds literally nothing like him. It's very odd watching a familiar Seagal on screen but hearing a completely different voice come out of his mouth  sometimes during the same scene to make things even more laughable. The action scenes are awful there's some really lame hand to hand combat stuff that is so poorly shot  edited it's just a complete mess to watch. There's no car chases or explosions or big stunts  apart from a few forgettable shootouts there's little here to even suggest it's an action film. The makers decided to set the final showdown in a run down chteau for some reason it's actually quite an atmospheric location but Attack force is meant to be a high octane action film not a horror film. The film has very low colour levels the picture seemed far too dark to me.Apparently the budget for this was 12000000 which I simply can't believe there's no way this cost twelve big ones  if it did where did all the money go? Filmed in Bucharest in Romania. The acting here is atrocious too apart from the already mentioned Lisa Lovbrand who is a complete hottie noone is worth mentioning  Seagal is just terrible as usual as he is so fat  out of shape he doesn't convince as an action star anymore.Attack Force is an absolutely terrible film on every level this just doesn't have any redeeming features at all as far as I am concerned. Not to be confused with the Mel Gibson action film Attack force Z 1982.".

I actually knew it would be and was looking for a quick laugh as I rented it and it did not disappoint. Seagal has become one of the greatest comedians of our time. Most Hollywood comedies cannot come close to the humor of Seagal's slow and slothful action scenes. I could not help but think that Seagal shot this movie over one or two days max and the editors were left to fill in the holes with multiple stunt doubles voice dubbing and drawn out conversations that attempted to fill in the plot holes but failed miserably.OK I knew what I was getting into by renting a Seagal movie at this point in his career but I did expect to see some good action. There were a few good action scenes but most of them did not feature Seagal. The action scenes went as follows Seagal's team goes in. They kill some people and a few of them get killed. Seagal just appearsprobably right from the snack table back stage and slowly walks around with no care of whats around the next corner because he's Steven Seagal and doesn't have to worry about tactics. He finds the last enemy and kills him quickly with as little effort as possible expended. This could be a single shot to the head or a short handtohand fight that looked more like two girls cat fighting than a martial arts expert.Many times it was very hard to know who was actually talking in the movie. Since Seagal only made limited appearances in the movie he was often talking when he was not pictured. Add to this that when Seagal talked in this movie you didn't know if you were going to hear his actual voice or one of the gruff voice dubs. This made me laugh almost every time its like they were trying to confuse the audience on purpose.I know the entire plot of the movie was changed after shooting it but did they even watch the movie in its entirety before releasing it? It was almost impossible to follow especially early on. I still can't believe that a group of people put so much work and money into something like this.Like I said if you can get a laugh out of a movie that makes you ask the question What were they thinking? at least once a minute this is a MUST RENT. Do not buy it because once is enough and you'll have the great memories forever. If this kind of comedy doesn't interest you this movie will make you question whether its worth watching a new movie ever again.".

Do not buy it because once is enough and you'll have the great memories forever. If this kind of comedy doesn't interest you this movie will make you question whether its worth watching a new movie ever again.";

Is is NOT Do you AGREE with the above review? Right now I've set the scene for everyone here to find my review not helpful I'll press on ...I like ATTACK THE BLOCK ... a lot. I liked it when I first saw it on Channel 4 in 2012 and I've watched it again a couple of times since the most recent being last night. It never fails to entertain me.I will however take issue with a couple of the other reviews here ... for exampleThe girl they tried to rob and rape comes asking for seconds. Nonsense. No one tried to rape Sam at least not in this movie. The reviewer might not like the characters  I don't like them much either  but no need to try to prevent others from watching the film by misrepresenting what happens on screen.Another reviewer says that having the protagonists not apologise for mugging her drives a huge wedge between them and the audience. But to do that would have been lazy writing on Cornish's part turning essentially irredeemable characters in to tame cuddly nice guys. This kind of inner city feral teenagers are not nice people. They are what they are not what you'd like them to be.The same reviewer says that The police are especially hard done by they are portrayed as totally corrupt and not to be trusted under any circumstances. This is simply not true. The only two police officers who have anything to do here are the two who arrest Moses for mugging Sam. Which he did. We saw him do it. If he claims he's an innocent victim of a brutal police force ... WE know he's lying. So how are the police hard done by? I'm mystified.Same reviewer finds disturbingly strong misogynist atmosphere because The only criticism they the boys face is from weak female characters who are unable to defend themselves and who rely on the various male gang members for protection from violent outsiders. Gee I dunno looked they were doing okay when Tia and Dimple take down an alien with a standard lamp and an ice skate. Didn't need much help from the boys ...A reviewer from the US says we're supposed to not like these street punks at first and then admire them as they redeem themselves. Nope that's only in Hollywood movies. I don't think Cornish expects you to like these characters any better by the end of the movie. But what we do see here is a glimmer the slightest chance that these characters might be able to turn their lives around. What we don't know is whether they will take the opportunity.A reviewer from South Africa says The dialogue was apparently authentic but it sounded made up like the droogs' language in A Clockwork Orange. Yes the dialogue IS authentic. I live in Tower Hamlets on the north side of the river from Oval and that's exactly what the feral teenagers talk like. So I'd say the issue isn't with the dialogue it's with the reviewer. It only sounded made up to that reviewer. So they're essentially criticising Joe Cornish for being accurate. But enough ...ATTACK THE BLOCK is just exactly what it looks like. A lowbudget cleverlywritten alien attack movie set in the innercity deprived area of South London. The lead characters are products of that environment. Marginalised teenagers who have somehow become convinced that education has nothing to offer and that the only way out of their situation is lowlevel crime and very likely an early death. They're not heroes. They're not redeemed by the events of the film. You CAN not like them and it's doesn't make any difference. But they are characters I recognise ... raw and authentic. I wouldn't say they're Real because they're aping the mannerisms of US rappers but that IS how the kids down my endz act.Don't take it so seriously. ATTACK THE BLOCK is not a searing social document. It's not a hardhitting indictment of our times. It's just a bloody great scifi action movie. Stop criticising it for what it's not ...".

Moses the lead certainly leads us through a series of complex emotions from hatred to forgiveness and round again a few more times just for kicks.

I was expecting as I watched the film with ever more pleasure to be let down and have the aliens' presence left unexplained as with many nonblockbuster horrors. But in two mere sentences the loose threads are tied and the finale is lead into all in one great sweep of fantastic writing.Last but definitely not least the aliens themselves were phenomenal. There was a certain amount of keeptheminthedark and leaveittoyourimagination but there were also absolute gorefest moments which were done superbly though the squeamish may need to blink. The aliens were well designed and were flawlessly integrated into the movie. To be honest I don't even know if they were puppets or CGI  I was so caught up in the fastpaced running and fighting into which they were so seamlessly included.Definitely one to watch for fans of the genre fans of the creators or anyone looking for a thrill. I'll certainly be watching it again.

But in two mere sentences the loose threads are tied and the finale is lead into all in one great sweep of fantastic writing.Last but definitely not least the aliens themselves were phenomenal. There was a certain amount of keeptheminthedark and leaveittoyourimagination but there were also absolute gorefest moments which were done superbly though the squeamish may need to blink. The aliens were well designed and were flawlessly integrated into the movie. To be honest I don't even know if they were puppets or CGI  I was so caught up in the fastpaced running and fighting into which they were so seamlessly included.Definitely one to watch for fans of the genre fans of the creators or anyone looking for a thrill. I'll certainly be watching it again. And if you wanna read someone say it better than I just did  httpwww.flickfilosopher.com blog201108attacktheblock review.html remove superfluous spaces contains language in movie quotes.";

They didn't care for the characters because of their rude language their clothes Ooooh hoddies and the fact that they are petty criminals. But this is a classic bad guy turns hero story with such a great written script and talented young actors. The casting director did an excellent job finding these kids. They are real natural and very believable in portraying being born and raised in Londons Ends. I found myself actually caring about the characters and their destiny throughout the movie. Attack the Block is a horror comedy about an alien invasion. Aaaah you think I've seen this before! Bodysnatchers The Faculty and not to mention the great TVseries Falling Skies. But this movie is different. The focus in the film lies with the characters and their reaction to having their street invaded by aliens. The aliens them self are kind of cheesy but scary in a funny way. I expected Nick Frost to have a bigger role I loved him in Shaun of the Dead and Paul. But he never disappoints me funny as always  I really enjoyed this movie and if you like movies like Shaun of the Dead and Tucker  Dale vs Evil you'll probably enjoy this as well.Favourite quote from the movie  Oh man! All this weed and no skins... This is the worst day of my life!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having grown up in the 80s I was exposed to a whole gamut of movies that followed the same basic plot construction and format in which a group of young kids discovers or hopes to discover something fantastical or alien and generally ends up saving the world. Movies from ET and GREMLINS to THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD all fit loosely into this same paradigm.What director Joe Cornish has done so masterfully here is to take that pattern and turn it on its' head. Unlike another recent similar movie SUPER 8 which closely mimicked those 80s movies so much as to be a direct homage Cornish decides to use the basic framework but to provide the viewer with twists to make it new and refreshing.The first of those twists seems to be the most controversial with viewers in that this is not a group of precious innocent kids who come of age while they save the world. Instead Cornish drops his alien invasion straight into the middle of the hood the block call it what you will and the group of protagonists that we follow are far from innocent. In fact we meet them in the middle of mugging a young woman. A WHOLE LOT of reviewers on this site seem to focus in on how unlikable the main characters are and that this turns them off from enjoying the movie. I admit that I find this hard to understand. Let's take a movie like GOODFELLAS which revolves around a gang of very hardened criminals with few redeeming qualities yet this is considered a modern film classic. Part of me starts to wonder if this is more a case of white suburban middle class viewership not wanting to cheer for a group of realistically portrayed black kids from the ghetto but I don't want to go too far down that avenue.I found it to be a refreshing twist to use in a movie like this. I'm tired of the same plot formula where bland suburban kids save the world while dealing with the same reallife problems the abused kid the kid from a broken home etc. Instead for me as a viewer I started with an unfavorable view of these kids but grew to like them as the movie goes on and they find their humanity as they realize how important their neighborhood is to them and how important it is to save it.The other huge twist here from the typical Spielberg formula is that Cornish is not afraid to kill off his kids which you never see in those cookie cutter movies. In fact they die violently and with ample gore not shying from their deaths one bit. It was shocking to see as a viewer who is used to this formula keeping the kids alive even when in obvious peril.In order for this to work though it needed more than clever twists on wellworn patterns. It needed to bring us a really horrific monsters which it does in spades. I love the creature design here. I love that they didn't go with the green alien with tentacles clich or any of the other designs you've seen over and over. These aliens are terrifying as they chase our heroes. The lack of eyes the glowing teeth the blackness of their fur the realistic movement praise to Cornish for use of practical effects in lieu of CGI. I absolutely love the aliens in this movie.I'm finding that my opinion improves more each time I see it and I think this is one of the better horror movies made in the past ten years.".

I would have put money on me loving this film. What wasn't to love for a bloke in his 20's  monstersaliens groups with weapons working together The warriors anyone?! and of course Nick Frost.Well I'll tell you the reason why I hated it  because the characters we were meant to love were essentially scumbags. Being a secondary school teacher it is depressing how often I see and hear teenagers acting hard wearing hoods and trackies even if it's 30degrees! using ridiculous and often rude language and generally lacking basic morals and respect. And now here is a film that not only expects us to identify and go on a journey with these characters but also glorifies them!My hesitation began in the opening scene when they pulled a knife whilst mugging a woman and seemed to have nothing but contempt for her. I thought to myself 'Hmmm that's quite extreme as I thought we were going to like these guys?' Now that would have been OK if the story had quickly unfolded that it was just a big front and they were actually quite nice and don't really like hurting people they just do it as they don't know any better but this wasn't the case. It clumsily seemed to try to swing it this way with some of the characters the one with glasses seemed particularly easy to like but most of them continued to be little scrotes if I'm honest. The way the police were viewed and portrayed I thought was pretty disgraceful and again painted an image that it was cool to hate the police. Probably the biggest let down was that I suddenly realised near the end of the film that I hadn't actually laughed once. A couple and I mean a couple of moments of light relief from Frost was about all I smiled at. I also thought the development of the characters was poor or almost non existent especially the token weed smoking posh white boy who for me added nothing. To the films credit I thought it was shot well the monsters were good in a budgetcult like way and most of the acting was good although it seemed to try far too hard to make them all use the teenage 'buzz' words constantly. Probably why the one liners failed to work IMO. It was bare annoying. The sad thing is I can see some of the kids I teach watching this and wanting to be just like them. At least the worst thing I'd have been likely to say at their age would have been I need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle!".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start. Unoriginal alien invasion plot? Uninspiring tone? Bad dialogue? No let's start at storytelling 101  the characters.The hero characters that you are meant to empathise with are essentially teenage narrowminded thugs not the best choice in terms of storytelling as few people would empathise with them but I thought they might do something interesting with them later in the story to get you as the viewer on their side but alas they didn't.The characters are poorly established. Characters seemed to come and go for the first two thirds of the film making it very unclear which characters the film is actually focusing on never mind establishing a protagonist.Which brings me on to my next point. Why establish your protagonist and outline their background towards the end of a film? You need to establish an emotional connection between the protagonist and the audience early on and then reward  emotionally toy with the audience throughout the rest of the film. This is what makes films enjoyable to watch.The film generally consisted of the kids spouting lines that they deem clever with such consistency you start to wonder whether they are doing it for effect or the director actually thinks the lines are truly funny. Only towards the end stages of the film did I even start to find the dialogue mildly funny. Their London gangsta accents will grind on you throughout the film without fail however so don't think a few funny lines will rescue you from this.The plot was basic and predictable. Basic I can forgive as there's no need to overcomplicate a storyline as it can diminish it's impact but the fact that it took the path of least resistance to the end wasn't so forgivable. The only aspect of the plot I liked was that the woman who the kids mugged was forced to team up with them to defeat a common enemy which provided some interesting tension and humour.The only thing I truly liked about the film was that the aliens were really black really really black. So black in fact they almost aren't there. This was believable in terms of the evolution of a species which required camouflage and a cool little feature of the invaders. Aside from that I'm really struggling to find anything good to say about this film apart from one or two funny lines as I've already mentioned.In short it wasn't silly enough to fall into the slapstick horror category nor was it structured well enough to even be considered an average film. I'm mystified as to how this film has gained a 7.5 IMDb rating at the time of writing this review.".

The only aspect of the plot I liked was that the woman who the kids mugged was forced to team up with them to defeat a common enemy which provided some interesting tension and humour.The only thing I truly liked about the film was that the aliens were really black really really black. So black in fact they almost aren't there. This was believable in terms of the evolution of a species which required camouflage and a cool little feature of the invaders. Aside from that I'm really struggling to find anything good to say about this film apart from one or two funny lines as I've already mentioned.In short it wasn't silly enough to fall into the slapstick horror category nor was it structured well enough to even be considered an average film. I'm mystified as to how this film has gained a 7.5 IMDb rating at the time of writing this review.";

It didn't succeed at any of them.But worst thing of all this is a film that actually seems to glorify hoody culture it made me angry that a film that is obviously aimed at teenagers makes it look cool to carry weapons like knives smoke weed all day steal and mug people.In the current climate especially in the UK shouldn't filmmakers take a bit more responsibility. In the opening scene we were treated to 5 masked teenagers terrifying and mugging a young woman on her way home from work. I almost switched off but hoped there might be some sort of moral ending ..... no such luck the ring leader survives and is worshipped as a hero. There were only 2 educated characters portrayed in the film and they were made to look like pathetic losers all the way though. I don't know if this film set out to show gang culture and stealing as cool and fun alternative to gaining an education and working but this seems to be one of the messages it is sending out.".

I suppose the biggest problem I have with Attack the Block is that the script tries to turn character's that I didn't like into the people that save the day I am sorry but I just can't like a gang of thugs who mug a lone woman at knife point no matter how many times you have them swear which in itself isn't funny. The whole film is played as a comedy scifi horror that has obvious influences  is a decent time killer but I didn't think the central concept  theme worked the way the makers intended. I suppose the teenage muggers were meant to save the day find redemption  we are meant to sympathise with them but after seeing them mug a woman take drugs do whatever they want kill just because something annoyed them  then run around with Samurai swords baseball bats  flick knives I just couldn't like them or root for them to win. I really wished the aliens had killed the lot of them at only 80 minutes long at least it's short  it moves along at a good pace  is watchable but I couldn't the fact that I hated almost every character out of my head  ultimately that's probably why I thought it was alright but nothing else. I just didn't like the whole message about these thug's being victims rather than criminals this is a huge issue in today's society  surely people must take responsibility for their own actions. Noone else is making them mug someone are they? Quite why a fairly light hearted scifi action thriller is dealing with such deep issues is puzzling  I for one feel the makers took the wrong direction. The dialogue is also another issue I have lived here in the UK all my life  even I didn't understand half the urban gangster crap they spoke I certainly didn't find any of it funny either.The aliens almost seem secondary to the moral issues on show  they are kept virtually black in every shot they appear with only their sharp fang like teeth glowing in the dark giving off any light they look alright for what they are but I suspect budget reasons were partly responsible. There is hardly any CGI computer animation in Attack the Block I always prefer practical effects where possible so I liked Attack the Block for that aspect if nothing else. I can't say I found it particularly exciting or scary or fantastical I found it a bit bland  forgettable actually. More aliens die than humans so there's not much blood or gore a man has his throat bitten out  someone has their nose bitten off but otherwise nothing worth mentioning. In a nod to classic scifi films  author's several of the street locations are named after famous writer's such as H.G. Wells Arthur C. Clarke  Douglas Adams.With a supposed budget of about 13000000 this was partly filmed on the real Heygate Estate in London. The acting is alright again I can't say i warmed to or liked anyone but there's no terrible performances here.Attack the Block is a film that many seem to like probably for the reasons that I don't like it really irritating urban gangster dialogue lack of alien action  a moralistic stance that I personally don't agree with although having first hand experience of some of the issues here might cloud my opinion a bit.

	schema:reviewBody "So many people think this film glorifies the criminal youth sub culture. They are totally missing the point. Yes the kids are merciless violent thugs but they have an amazing capacity for heroism love and generosity. The message? don't give up on these kids they have a lot to offer. I found myself drawn to them as the film progressed. I'm not sure this is intended to be a scifi film in the same vein as Star Trek. The effects are very good but the creatures are just there to draw the protagonists together. The real story is the interaction of the characters the breaking down of social barriers and most importantly the eating of the bad guys. This is a film of hope Britain is not necessarily on a one way trip down the toilet. These kids are going to save us!! Believe Bruv.........".

It's filled with hilarious oneliners that I'll remember for awhile.

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have another film purporting to be the new 'Shaun of the Dead' and it does quite well on the score only lacking humour a coherent script a narrative arc and lead characters that don't make you wish that alien invaders were tearing out your own throat. But it does have Nick Frost so at least they have that bit right...And Frost is very very good though let's face it you knew that already. That's why you bought your ticket. Only what the trailer doesn't tell you is that this is one of those films that trick you into thinking it is one thing when it's really something else. Did you really want to spend the majority of the film in the company of a group of teenage thugs speaking a patois unintelligible to anybody over the age of 21? No neither did I. Frost is only in a few scenes and the sum effect is akin to spending the night cowering in the kitchen whilst teenage thugs set your living room alight. You only let them through the front door because they were in the company of that funny guy from 'Paul' but he cleared off the moment trouble startedI realise that I'm probably in a minority thinking this is a problem for the film. The ratings on IMDb suggest that most people think this is a betterthanaverage light comedy. I understand that view. It does develop a forward momentum that carries you along. Yet I found it hard to disregard the way it portrays the world of the inner city in a totally disingenuous way where the police are worse than the aliens were muggers are honourable so long as they don't mug from people on their estate and only wave knives in a woman's face to get the robbery over quickly. It asks for a mainstream audience but speaks exclusively to a demographic who share its moronic world view. We are even given a terrible moment of sermonising which alludes to Malcolm X's famous view of 'white man's poison'. To imply that aliens are only invading the estate because drugs aren't killing the inhabitants quickly enough is a pretty dumb attempt at political rhetoric but it's even more dubious coming from a character who had treated his own promotion to pusher of hard narcotics as though it was a great honour.Yet my biggest gripe with this film is that it's about as funny as getting mugged by street yobs. If you are 17 years old inarticulate waster who wants to spend your whole life smoking weed you might consider this film to be your generation's 'Some Like It Hot'. For me it was a flabby alien invasion flick so busy with trying to look cool that it fails to realise how annoying and utterly moronic it truly is. There might be a good film here but it just needs to do some growing up.".

Then thugs duff up and murder a defenceless alien. As first contact situations go these thugs treat our first alien visitor as just another plaything in their pathetic lives. After they murder the pregnant alien they parade its body through the streets much like a serial killer would collect trophy and then display it for their sick satisfaction.Then the Alien's pals decide to take revenge. Fair dues to them I was on their side and wanted them to win. Every time another thug died I whooped with joy. The aliens arrive without a spaceship and appear as meteors but can be killed with fireworks. Really this does not follow the logic of the story.The worst British movie of the last 50 years and yes I am saying that Love honour and obey was a Brit flick. If you live in Sarf London and say words like Blud. If you think being in a gang is cool this is the movie for you. Also if you IQ is in single figures your gonna love this but you will be too thick to read this review.

None of it feels like it's been done before and as a result the film doesn't get dull for a second.The lessthan90 minute running time is perfect for something this small never letting us stop having fun in order to make time for pointless romantic subplots or unnecessary characters. There is never a dull moment in this a film that I have no problem saying is the most fun I've had so far this year. Whoever cast these kids deserves some sort of medal because they are all fantastic and for most of them it's their first job. John Boyega in particular in the lead role as the head of the group is fantastic.At first I was skeptical about the Jodie Whittaker character and her constant runins with the group but by the end I really embraced her dynamic with Moses and actually found myself getting surprisingly emotional at the end. The whole thing is just vibrant exciting and so much intense entertainment. There are a solid amount of laughs throughout but it's not even a film about trying to make you laugh or trying to scare you. It's just about having fun and it succeeds so admirably. It feels real old school and I loved every moment. Everyone should watch this.".

Attempts to get his brother's old tire business resurrected with a black partner is rejected by the banks. When he is officially served with divorce papers everything comes apart and Richard Nixon's broken promises comes to represent all the evils that have come down on him. A news story about a pilot that landed a helicopter on the White House lawn gives him the idea for his attack. Bolting onto a Baltimore plane he attempts the hijacking.";

He's a man I'm used to seeing as well a man's man and to see him timid and frustrated swallowing so much emotion in ever bigger chunks...it was remarkable to watch his performance a credit to director Niels Mueller as well. Penn deserves another award Noami Watts and Don Cheadle are also excellent and Michael Wincott as Penn's brother makes his one scene memorable.Niels and Kevin Kennedy have done a truly masterful job with the script bringing unique voices and characters to life such as I rarely see on screen. Neils certainly doesn't look like a first timer behind the camera. Much of his framing feels emotionallyclaustrophobic while a few handheld sequences made me think I was an unwilling unwitting voyeur.All in all this is a delicately crafted yet weighty and powerful film. I believe it gets released soon in New York and LA but as Penn's Sam Bicke character might say The system is unfair and everyone has a right to see this movie so email ThinkFilm and tell them you want it in your city too. Kudos to ThinkFIlm for getting behind this movie they have another festival favorite of mine Kontroll coming out in the spring.I take my hat off to these filmmakers for their outstanding work.".

Kudos to ThinkFIlm for getting behind this movie they have another festival favorite of mine Kontroll coming out in the spring.I take my hat off to these filmmakers for their outstanding work.";

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this film at AFI primarily due to my interest in Sean Penn and indeed his performance is spectacular. But Mr. Penn's performance alone is not what makes this a truly great film. The intelligent writing welltimed and rich score and supportive performances by Naomi Watts Jack Thompson and Don Cheadle blend perfectly in this marvelously crafted feature transporting the viewer into the lives and era of the exquisitely human characters who are so elegantly portrayed. Sean Penn's performance leans heavily on the clever and complex writing which offers him the opportunity to display an impressive range of pathos. The writers have managed to depict the very human and sympathetic side of a character that would typically be cast as the villain. I think this is a hugely important film for that reason and on many other levels as well. The writers are able to very subtly include sociopolitical commentary without being in your face or at all judgmental as the political arena is viewed through the lead character's eyes yet not really distorted due to the inclusion of archival footage. The unexpected doses of humor matched perfectly with the poignancy of the lead character's plight. This film is so moving scenes and dialogue echo in the corners of the mind for days after the first viewing. I'll definitely be seeing Assassination again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see this film at the AFI Fest screening in Los Angeles this week. They say it will be released at the end of the year which is not soon enough as far as I'm concerned.Others here have commented on the brilliant performances of the stellar cast and I must concur. There isn't a weak link in the group. Particular standouts are Jack Thompson and Michael Wincott. These two actors play character Sam Byck's Sean Penn boss and brother respectively and they are the authority figures in Sam's life whose influences are palpable in the film even when they are not onscreen. Naomi Watts and Don Cheadle provide superlative performances that we have begun to expect from them as our due. Certainly one could say the same about Sean Penn. He is probably one of the highest praised and consistently wellreviewed actors of his generation and his performance in this film illustrates why. Penn's elegiac performance is delicately nuanced and precisely wrought. For me this is unarguably his finest performance to date. I hope that Academy voters won't hold it against him that he won last year because if ever a performance deserves an Oscar this is it!DirectorCowriter Niels Mueller has crafted a stunning work that is clearly heartfelt. This is a beautifully rendered character study. The level of achievement in directing writing cinematography and editing are beyond impressive. Although this film was inspired by true events that occurred three decades ago and the director and the production design team have captured the feel and look perfectly the film is timeless in the themes that it explores. Considering the fact that this film was conceived and written at least five years ago according to the director during the AFI QAbefore 911 before the Clinton Impeachment before Bush's election and reelection before the Iraq warit is uncanny how relevant and topical the themes are. If you are someone who likes inspired thoughtprovoking films that are wellwritten beautifully acted and masterfully directed then I advise you to run don't walk to see NIXON when it comes out.".

The performances are amazing and any intelligent film fan will see Sean Penn's performance as one of his best if not his very best ever.Additionally Naomi Watts is outstanding. She disappears entirely in her role as Marie and is almost unrecognizable from anything she's ever done in the past. Jack Thompson the great Australian actor of Breaker Morant and Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith fame is stunning. I can't believe he hasn't been used more in the United States. Not to mention the always great Don Cheadle and others...The story itself is chilling. This is one relevant film that everyone should see. I don't want to give anything away but suffice it to say that this film discusses with great depth and insight issues that are burning in everyone's minds these days  terrorism 911 powerlessness as a voting public etc. etc.This film is gripping from start to finish. It is a carefully crafted character dissection that takes you inside the mind and heart of Penn's character. The film couldn't have succeeded without Penn's brilliance. The art direction and cinematography are stand out as well as the editing which keeps the film moving at a very assured pace.This film is as good as they come. It's the kind of film they used to make and I was thrilled to see that some filmmakers and actors had the courage to tackle such complexities as are tackled here.Roger Ebert calls Nixon one of the best films at this year's Cannes film festival...Le Monde in France called it a near masterpiece and in Rome's largest paper they wondered why this film instead of Fahrenheit 911 wasn't garnering all the attention. I agree with all of them. Amazing what the director and cast were able to pull off simply amazing.This film is an absolute gem and a must see for any intelligent filmgoer....It will become a classic...guaranteed.".

The movie comes to select U.S. theaters on Dec. 29th and the widens. I'll mention the questions later but first the review.A very good yet flawed film. I use the term film not to be pretentious but because it is primarily a film not a movie in the blockbustery sense. It was produced independently with the documenting the assassin Sam Byck Sean Penn. It focuses on the year before he attempted true story to kill President Nixon in February 1974 by flying a plane into the White House. However the main thrust of the film was not politics but character development.Sean Penn is clearly one of the best actors today very much in his prime. He once again proves it here. Byck is a man separated from his family unsuccessful in his careers and is marginalized from his life. We watch him obtain a sense of hopelessness as he watches his dreams crumble away as he blames the American system for his demise. Similar to Taxi Driver in a lot of ways. Outstanding portrayal.The only negative was the short span of the movie. It was 95 minutes and left too little time for back story. There is not nearly enough exploration of how Byck got to the point where he could be pushed to kill. Another half hour of explaining his character would have made for a pantheonlevel movie instead of just a rather good one.".

	schema:headline " The assassination of my previous unjustified view of Sean Penn";
	schema:reviewBody "At least before watching Mystic River 2003 for the first time a few months ago I never really paid much attention to Sean Penn. In fact I was under the impression that I didn't really care for him. I haven't seen most of his filmsI probably remembered him best from Fast Times at Ridgemont High 1982 and as that guy who was married to Madonna. I can't say exactly why I thought I didn't like him it was one of those things where you remember the judgment but not why you made it but that's probably one of the reasons I haven't seen most of his films. Well that's going to change because based on the three I've watched in the last few monthsMystic River I Am Sam 2001 and now this onePenn is quickly on his way to becoming one of my favorite actors. He's probably already my favorite versatile actor because I almost always prefer actors who have strong unique personalitiesdispositions that tend to dominate some would say trample any role they tackle. But Penn is able to meld himself to roles while still bringing something unique to them. The Assassination of Richard Nixon is no exception. His performance here is spot on perfectly capturing a tragic and ultimately disturbing everyman.Comparisons of The Assassination of Richard Nixon to Taxi Driver 1976 are justified and inevitable. Both concern a man who is a bit of an outcast both with an acute awareness of politics and the persons whom they consider fellow outcasts both trying to make their place in the world both continually being knocked down from the attempt and both eventually cracking and taking similarly drastic measures against an abstraction of those they feel have wronged them. There are also equally fine performances from great actors there is equally unique artistry in the technical elements and both successfully stress an atmosphere of low class grit.But while Taxi Driver is also a masterpiece and will long be one of the cinematic benchmarks of its era The Assassination of Richard Nixon has a number of important differences that make it clear that it's not a ripoff. For one it is based on a thinly veiled true story where the major plot events are very close to the film the true story is of Samuel Byck making this one of the odder examples of fictionalizing a name to distance a film from realityPenn's character is named Samuel Bicke.More importantly Bicke although he has problems does not see himself initially as belonging to or being obsessed with a subculture. He's relatively normal and his desires in the film are all about correcting his forced deviations from normality. In a nutshell Bicke is a guy with low selfesteema lack of selfconfidence who keeps getting the raw end of the deal at least in his mind. Complicating things a bit although Bicke is relatively normal he sees many normal kinds of social interactionslike workplace relations politicians to their constituencies and even romanceas a kind of game or charade that's usually played unfairly with acquiescence to immoral tactics. Bicke wants things to be fair and moral he wants people to be kind and understanding towards one anotherat least per his understandings of these things. Because he doesn't play the game in the normal way he keeps getting kicked out of it.Thus The Assassination of Richard Nixon is primarily a tale of a loser trying to put his failed marriage back together trying to find a job he can tolerate trying to find friends who will empathize with him and so on. None of these attempts quite work but the game trudges on. Bicke has to eat and pay for housing. So even though the game keeps kicking him out he can't be out entirely he has to keep contributing Monopoly money so to speak. Obviously this is a recipe for some kind of disaster if there aren't changes in the equation. The disaster finally comes presenting the film's fantastic climax.Penn is excellent at the slight exaggerations needed for an everyman loser to end up in the state of mind Bicke ends up in. He's also a master of what we could call a dual performance. The first performance is what Bicke literally says and does. The second performance is the alwayspresent silent dialogue of Bicke's mind. Through body language tone of voice small actions and such Penn is able to communicate what Bicke is really thinking. Other actors in the film are good at this too including Naomi Watts who plays Bicke's estranged wife Jack Thompson who plays his hucksterish boss and Don Cheadle who plays his increasingly reluctant only friend. There's an entire unspoken secondary film occurring hereone that emphasizes both the implicature and the charade of everyday public social interactions.Firsttime feature director Niels Mueller achieves a subtle unbalancing through the artful regular use of handheld cameras. The handheld work doesn't dominate so much as to become distracting but it's just shaky enough to add to the sense of unease. Also unusual is Mueller's approach to montages.

	onyx:emotionText "At least before watching Mystic River 2003 for the first time a few months ago I never really paid much attention to Sean Penn. In fact I was under the impression that I didn't really care for him. I haven't seen most of his filmsI probably remembered him best from Fast Times at Ridgemont High 1982 and as that guy who was married to Madonna. I can't say exactly why I thought I didn't like him it was one of those things where you remember the judgment but not why you made it but that's probably one of the reasons I haven't seen most of his films. Well that's going to change because based on the three I've watched in the last few monthsMystic River I Am Sam 2001 and now this onePenn is quickly on his way to becoming one of my favorite actors. He's probably already my favorite versatile actor because I almost always prefer actors who have strong unique personalitiesdispositions that tend to dominate some would say trample any role they tackle. But Penn is able to meld himself to roles while still bringing something unique to them. The Assassination of Richard Nixon is no exception. His performance here is spot on perfectly capturing a tragic and ultimately disturbing everyman.Comparisons of The Assassination of Richard Nixon to Taxi Driver 1976 are justified and inevitable. Both concern a man who is a bit of an outcast both with an acute awareness of politics and the persons whom they consider fellow outcasts both trying to make their place in the world both continually being knocked down from the attempt and both eventually cracking and taking similarly drastic measures against an abstraction of those they feel have wronged them. There are also equally fine performances from great actors there is equally unique artistry in the technical elements and both successfully stress an atmosphere of low class grit.But while Taxi Driver is also a masterpiece and will long be one of the cinematic benchmarks of its era The Assassination of Richard Nixon has a number of important differences that make it clear that it's not a ripoff. For one it is based on a thinly veiled true story where the major plot events are very close to the film the true story is of Samuel Byck making this one of the odder examples of fictionalizing a name to distance a film from realityPenn's character is named Samuel Bicke.More importantly Bicke although he has problems does not see himself initially as belonging to or being obsessed with a subculture. He's relatively normal and his desires in the film are all about correcting his forced deviations from normality. In a nutshell Bicke is a guy with low selfesteema lack of selfconfidence who keeps getting the raw end of the deal at least in his mind. Complicating things a bit although Bicke is relatively normal he sees many normal kinds of social interactionslike workplace relations politicians to their constituencies and even romanceas a kind of game or charade that's usually played unfairly with acquiescence to immoral tactics. Bicke wants things to be fair and moral he wants people to be kind and understanding towards one anotherat least per his understandings of these things. Because he doesn't play the game in the normal way he keeps getting kicked out of it.Thus The Assassination of Richard Nixon is primarily a tale of a loser trying to put his failed marriage back together trying to find a job he can tolerate trying to find friends who will empathize with him and so on. None of these attempts quite work but the game trudges on. Bicke has to eat and pay for housing. So even though the game keeps kicking him out he can't be out entirely he has to keep contributing Monopoly money so to speak. Obviously this is a recipe for some kind of disaster if there aren't changes in the equation. The disaster finally comes presenting the film's fantastic climax.Penn is excellent at the slight exaggerations needed for an everyman loser to end up in the state of mind Bicke ends up in. He's also a master of what we could call a dual performance. The first performance is what Bicke literally says and does. The second performance is the alwayspresent silent dialogue of Bicke's mind. Through body language tone of voice small actions and such Penn is able to communicate what Bicke is really thinking. Other actors in the film are good at this too including Naomi Watts who plays Bicke's estranged wife Jack Thompson who plays his hucksterish boss and Don Cheadle who plays his increasingly reluctant only friend. There's an entire unspoken secondary film occurring hereone that emphasizes both the implicature and the charade of everyday public social interactions.Firsttime feature director Niels Mueller achieves a subtle unbalancing through the artful regular use of handheld cameras. The handheld work doesn't dominate so much as to become distracting but it's just shaky enough to add to the sense of unease. Also unusual is Mueller's approach to montages. There are a number of sequences with increasingly fast cuts that are perfectly constructed to suggest time passing monotony frustration impatience and so on. Mueller always gives us just the right amount of information always leaves each shot on screen for the exact right length of time.Although some people have objected to the film on the grounds of creating sympathy for or painting a glorified picture of a guy who was basically a psycho that's a way too simplified view of the film its plot and its historical background.

I am a big fan of Naomi Watts so I am very prejudiced in saying she is phenomenal. And Don Cheadle is one of the best actors around right now so its not a surprise that that is the case here also. I don't think I've ever seen a film like this. It had me and most of the audience I saw it with laughing and getting drawn in by Mr. Penn's character. And then it got very tense and very silent as the film moved toward the end  which is about the most tense sequence of an intelligent film I have ever seen. I don't want to give anything away but I have to say  I read the review of someone else on here who called it taxidriver revisited and with all respect that's about the silliest thing I've read on the IMDb. Anyone who watches this film and starts thinking about and comparing it to another movie instead of 911 and the world we are living in right now needs to stop buying DVD's and start watching the news. This movie is so relevant on so many levels. I cannot stop thinking about it. I haven't had that experience for years. I did not think Hollywood was making films like this anymore. Anyway I recommend this film big time. I hear it is opening at the end of December. Go see it that's all I can say  it is intense and stays with you a long long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways The Assassination of Richard Nixon echoes the events of September 11 2001 in that a desperate man wanted to kill then President Richard Nixon whom he blamed for everything that had gone wrong in his own life. The plot involved the hijacking of an airliner that was going to be forced to crash against the White House killing President Nixon who was occupying the mansion at the time. Fortunately that ill conceived plan doesn't take place as the actions of the enforcement force were able to deal with that man who was a menace to society.Niels Mueller who directed and cowrote the film with Kevin Kennedy shows he clearly understood his main character Samuel Bicke who as many contributors have compared to Travis Bickle the Robert DeNiro's character in Taxi Driver but all comparisons must end there in the name which is almost the same for both men.Samuel Bicke is a man that has lost almost everything he ever had. His wife and children don't want anything to do with him. His own brother Julius knows what Sam has been doing to his business and wants no part of him. Samuel is a man at the end of his rope. He has failed everybody that even cared a little for him. That is why Sam decides on an extreme action for which he will pay dearly.Sean Penn is the best thing in this movie. He is riveting as we don't dare take our eyes from him for a moment. This actor proves he has a natural intelligence to get under any of his characters in ways that others wouldn't dare. His Samuel Bicke will be one of the best creations he has done in the movies.The rest of the cast do a good supporting role. Naomi Watts as a brunette plays Marie Sam's estranged wife. Don Cheadle's Bonny is about the only friend Sam can rely on. The wonderful Australian actor Jack Thompson does an incredible job as Sam's boss at the office furniture place where Sam has found employment. Michael Wincott is also good as Sam's brother.The film's musical score is by Steven Stern. Emmanuel Lubezki did an excellent job photographing the film that tries to show those years during the Nixon's administration. Alfonso Cuaron a great director himself produced what seems to be a labor of love that he entrusted to Niels Mueller to direct.".

Sean Penn becomes Sam Bicke and the character is so interesting that I was left with his thoughts as I walked out of the theater. Especially in today's society Nixon is an important film. It is about not letting the man get you down and it is about not electing into political positions when they are just going to lie and treat us terribly. People will compare Nixon to Taxi Driver. And I understand this comparison. However Taxi had much better pacing and much more violence. The performances here are just as compelling and the 70s look of the film is absolutely perfect.There could be a few script tweakings but some people won't be bothered by those little dialogue issues.3 34 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a film. Afterwards I can honestly say that the group who went to see it were slightly shell shocked we were all a bit glum and sombre. However that does not make this a bad movie it was an excellent movie and entirely down to the superb performance of Sean Penn.I'm really glad this movie got made having heard of the problems it faced during production. The Twin Towers were attacked and the Studios became really nervous a story of a man who tried to hijack a plane and fly it into the Whitehouse was not what they thought the public wanted to see. I believe Mr Penn was a strong voice of opposition as were the team behind the movie and they pushed to keep this going. It did and the eventual release has shown it was the right choice.As the movie progresses your level of unease grows the character of XX just continually makes you feel uncomfortable there's an odd edge to him which you just can't quite put your finger on and this level grows and grows as the performance gets more and more off kilter. It's an abject lesson in how someone can loose their bearings and decide to set their life on a course of action that seems totally illogical and indeed crazy to everyone else.At first I thought that it was a poor performance from Penn that was irritating me and that was why I was uncomfortable and loosing patience. Actually it wasn't that at all when the behaviour was obvious and his actions became more radical that's when I realised it was his excellent portrayal of the slow slide from reality that was affecting me.The movie is bleak yet it retains a sliver of hope that being that from the opening scenes you know that something isn't right with the character anyway. Although even that comes apart when you understand that once he had a wife two kids a dog and a successful life.Throughout the movie there's the underlying current of the commercialism and corruptness of US society on how the country has become like the whole ethos of sales fake and full of lies. With the events that occur to the character and those that happen around him that belong to the time there is an element of sympathy and understanding with him.I can't praise Penn enough oddly I can't remember when he suddenly became such a great actor yet I do remember him being awful and a wild character. Now though there's nothing I couldn't see him taking on.The whole feel of the film is perfect for that Watergate era even to the tiniest detail. It seems that this is something that they've worked on really hard to achieve and it helps you to believe in the performances.I would say that it's a great film a wonderful performance and you really should go and see it however have something happy to do afterwards go out with friends and have some fun. If you enjoy the movie you'll be taken in by the performance and you'll feel like we did afterwards. I've never heard a movie audience be so quiet during the movie and the appearance of the credits.".

Failing in his career Sam has also failed in marriage with an estranged wife who is seeing another man and children who barely notice whether he is around or not. Trying to do the honest thing and put in the hard work needed to make a success of himself is not easy as he still requires loans to do that. As he slowly crumbles under the pressure of seeing the life he believed he should have eluding him he watches Nixon survive and sell himself to the nation for a second term. Bit by bit his anger finds a focus and his path is clear.Although I know nothing of the true story back in the seventies I am in no doubt that this film is very relevant today. Ignore the fact that Nixon was an unpopular President that took America into a war that few wanted hmmm this is relevant because many little people feel like Sam to some degree even those not in his shoes will be able to feel for him and recognise why he feels the way he does. The narrative is interesting but the really this is a character study of Sam  although I don't know if it is the real man of the true story but the character study is of a man sold down the river by the dreams he has been promised and the lifestyle he has been sold. In this way the film succeeds because the writing is great this is a man who is in a lot of pain but not totally pathetic or needy  just a man who wants the simple promise of a family a job and a slice of the good life. It is telling that he has the standard three children and dog but his white picket fence around his old home is faded and peeling. If it sounds a simple story then that's because it is but it is compelling depressing recognisable and very relevant to a world where large numbers of people feel cut off from the ruling classes and entirely left out of the dream that we are told to aim for by adverts the media and our upbringing.The writing is great but the acting still needs to be good to make it work luckily it is impressive in almost all areas. Yet again Penn gives a great performance but unlike Mystic River it is a performance of restraint and quiet moments that gripped me by how well observed it was. Watts is only in a small role comparatively but she works well as the contrast of Sam  she has been failed as well but she accepts it and just does it in the way most of us do. Cheadle is good as always and Thompson is perfectly cast as the slick embodiment of what it takes to get on  lies and spin! With this heavy support cast it speaks volumes that Penn still dominates the film and his performance is worthy of awards when the season comes but I suspect that the subject matter and the timing of the film will not make that too easy.Overall this is a strong film with a good narrative but it works best as a character study. Sam is disenfranchised feeling betrayed and just trying to make good with the qualities that he has been taught will be enough to bring him a slice of the dream. It is compelling relevant and sadly depressingly convincing as a life that many of us will at least be able to recognise if not totally empathise with.".

While both films teach us that no matter how solid it seems everything will crumble under enough pressure there is no humor to TAORN. In fact it's the most depressing film like...ever.I don't know what made me go see TAORN. I'd heard nothing of it but I like Sean Penn and Naomi Watts they were in the brilliant 21 Grams together and everything else at the cinema I had either seen or looked crap Man of the House Miss Congenatailiality 2 so I chose this hoping it to be a dark horse. It was well made and acted but it's really really heavy and I would not recommend it to anyone bored with their jobs or lives in general.Sean Penn plays the true story of Sam Bicke a furniture salesman who is estranged from his family his wife his children his colleagues...basically everything. He sees the fatcats around him growing richer and richer while he rots away in his inescapable reality of nothingness. He blames Dick Nixon for his woes the fattest of all fatcats the man at the top of the food chain. He believes that if he kills Nixon he might be able to make the slightest of changes to the racist lying world.Of course he failed but watching Sam Bicke crash and burn is a very painful thing to do. What makes it more distressing is that there is never a reason given as to why everyone deserted him. It gave the impression that anyone can be so callous and uncaring and that anyone can be driven to such insanity and desperate measures.Not a film to see with your girlfriend that's for damn sure but certainly an impressive if tough to watch piece of work.".

And having read reviews on this site before seeing Assasination I had some expectations for an experience like none since that era. I wasn't disappointed.I believe that Sean Penn is probably the only actor of his generation who could tackle this project. He is brilliant and I don't say that about actors today. Of course they don't make films like this anymore so I can't say enough about how well everyone involved in this has done. IMO Penn's performance evokes DeNiro's Rupert Pupkin character in The King of Comedy more than Travis Bickle. But I also feel that Penn has created his own lasting character here. I can't wait until this amazing piece of work is available on DVD. If you want to have a unique cinematic experience or as close as you can get in today's Hollywood and have the patience for something more than the same old tired blockbuster vehicles SEE THIS ONE!".

	schema:reviewBody "A big disappointment. Penn is a poor imitation of De Niro in Taxi Driver or Hoffman in any number of films. The overthetop angst Penn shows soon becomes predictable and I got tired of closeups of Penn's facial contortions as he schleps his way through one personal disaster after another. It's an odd performance. Penn seemed to be acting in front of a mirror and not really connecting with the other actors. Plus I just plain didn't buy the setup. What made Penn's character so different from a hundred thousand other losers in 1974 a difference that made him nuts enough to plan assassinations where others didn't? The film didn't make this clear and as a consequence the ending is unbelievable almost ridiculous. There were smiles in the theater at the pointless conclusion as people looked at each other and said Wha the heck?!! The movie would have been better if Penn's character had forgotten about Nixon and killed his boss or his brother. But you protest this is based on a real story! OK then show me the link. Having Nixon in the background on TV sets during any number of personal tragedies is not enough to make me think Penn's character would hijack a plane and try to kill the man. Hey I remember those times and Nixon actually came off pretty well on television. Obviously there was a whole dimension to Penn's character the writers missed maybe on purpose. There were dozens of leftleaning and anarchistic groups in the early seventies who were relentlessly crucifying Nixon with a manic and rabid intensity. Was Penn's character thick with any of them? Probably. And there's the link. He'll be a success to his new friends and REALLY show his brother if he knocks off Nixon. Maybe he wants to impress some revolutionary hippiebabe he's met. There were plenty around. I'd buy that. But the film only touches on this aspect. But even so just having Penn's character drop in on a Black Panther office a couple times with a donation a flaky idea and a speech is not enough IMO to justify the bloody and violent conclusion. A couple good performances NOT Penn's gives this movie a three out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "When we were kids we were taught that anybody that work hard enough can achieve upward mobility in life with hisher ability. We called this trusted belief the American Dream. In the modern age the whole idea of the American Dream is slowly become disillusioned to the point that some people see it nearly impossible to achieve due to issues like institutional racism gratuitous lust and most of all the greed of corporatization capitalism. Anybody wondering where such modern pessimism came from would probably look at the trouble 1970s for answers. Indeed it was a time where American pragmatism was at one of its lowest. Unemployment was very high crime  violence was very rampage and most of all the old American values were being soiled by dirty hands within the government and in the job market. No wonder why the American Dream becomes the American Nightmare for Samuel Bicke Sean Penn a downonhisluck furniture salesman. Directed by Niels Muller  inspired by tragic true events the movie tells the story of an irrational man so disillusion with the American Dream that he become a danger not only to his friends and family but also to the President of the United States for who he blames as the cause of his problems. Without spoiling the movie too much I kinda have to say I hate the title of the film. The movie should had been call something else. Clearly anybody who knows history knows that Richard Nixon was never assassinated. Unless it's about his career. Then yes I guess that title could work. Still the movie isn't really about President Richard Nixon. It's about his fail assassin becoming disillusion with the American Dream due to fact that he cannot find success by being an honest man. I really surprised that this movie was even made. Clearly the studio had some questions about whether it would be a good idea to produce a film where the protagonist tries to fly a plane into a famous building just two years after 911 but many of the people who work with the film persuaded them that it'd be a worse crime not to tell this story. Despite the movie being very controversial the movie was indeed wellmade both in writing and in visual storytelling. I just wish the movie had a better framing device than the odd use of flashbacks. Still Sean Penn was amazing as the trouble wellmeaning if slightly eccentric guy. You really could see the depth in his performance with powerful wellwritten scenes with both his boss Jack Jones Jack Thompson  his brother Julius Michael Wincott. He didn't go overthe top one bit and the supporting characters really help the film work. You see Sean Penn's character transforms from a normal career ambitious family man into a lonely selfhating psychological killer. There was nothing cartoony about it. A great shade of grey worth of storytelling. There is a few things I can nitpick about the film about when it comes to historic accuracy such as the last name chance and the fact that real Samuel Byck was quite a bit heavier than Sean Penn. When it comes to Sam's backstory being tweaked and altered the real Sam had four children while Sam only has two in the film. It also implied that Sam's loan fiasco happen only a few weeks before the assassination attempt while Byck's failure to secure a loan happened in 1972 two years beforehand. One of the biggest changes is the fact that the movie doesn't mention Sam going to a psychological ward in a last ditch attempt to save his marriage or the fact that Sam went to Washington D.C very often to protest against Richard Nixon way before Watergate. Still the overall storyline is much the same as the reallife events and everything that happens at the airport in the last 15 minutes or so is entirely the same as what happened in reality. The movie ends with such a powerful anticlimax downer way that you would have to wonder what was the point of the film? The movie clearly isn't trying hard to be an attentiongrabber but I have to say the movie got greenlite because the film metaphorically tells how life is living in a post911 world. While the movie is indeed set in the 1970s a lot of viewers can see a lot of mirrorlike social tones coming off from this movie such as the endless wars the deeply trouble economy and corrupt government figures. It's both a sociological analysis of the 1970s and the 2000s. If you like this movie check out The History Channel special The Plot to Kill Nixon. It's worth a watch. Overall While some people might not go see this movie due to its rough subject matter. I have to say that the movie needs to be seem due to its powerful message about government business family and social and moral roles. It's a mustsee. The film is essentially the new Taxi Driver for a new generation.".

He doesn't get near the recognition and acclaim that he deserves.Sean Penn IS this film all the way through. He carries the picture.We get the impression Sam Bicke portrayed by Sean Penn has never really been a winner at any point or time in his life. We pick up on his story with him a man in his forties. His wife doesn't care about him anymore they're separated his home isn't his home anymore and he's starting on a new job for which he really isn't suited for a boss who is a complete jerk.If I were the crying type I would have been bawling all the way through this film because Sean made me feel so sorry for his character Sam Bicke.That this film is based on a real person and is a true story makes it all the more poignant and sad.Sam Bicke is the little man. There are hundreds of Sam Bicke's out there they plod along they love too much they work as hard as they can they try to be a good person and they lose and they lose and they lose  over and over again  and nobody really cares.And finally they just can't cope any more. The world is beyond their control even their own life seems beyond their control and they're looking for answers and it seems like the only ones who have any power are the ones at the top of the pyramid. They get to thinking if the top dog was just knocked off the pyramid things could be better.10 stars for this excellent film.".

It slowly and perfectly tells the story of one man who starts of as a fragile person who tries to make things work out for him. He tries to get a steady job tries to get back to his wife and children and tries to get a loan to build up his own company with his best and perhaps only friend in life. He however is not very lucky in life and when everyone and everything seems to be turning against him he slowly becomes more and more desperate and even maybe subtly descents into madness. He starts blaming his situation more and more on the bureaucracy and president Nixon in particular which all makes him mentally an even more unstable person which eventually leads him into doing a desperate act.The movie is build up to the fantastic climax that works very powerful and is unforgettable. The movie will leave you silent afterward and will perhaps even give you a feeling of sickness and depression.Leave it up to Sean Penn to portray a understandable strong and believable character. I don't like him as a person but he surely is one of the best actors in the business at the moment. His performance in this movie is truly powerful and is the main reason why this movie works so incredibly well on almost every level. Other strong characters in the movie are portrayed by Naomi Watts Don Cheadle and the surprisingly good Jack Thompson. This is a real character movie and every character in the movie is portrayed both subtle and wonderful.Niels Mueller is certainly a talented new director who knows how to build up a movie without falling into some obvious clichs and always remain both powerful and believable in the storytelling of the movie.A near masterpiece that works very powerful.

	schema:reviewBody "Django's Cut Price Western more like! I don't know why Demofilo Fidani gets the label of 'the Italian Ed Wood' when folks like Luigi Batzella were producing crap like this. At one point a stagecoach rides right past a modern car! Every single thing about this film screams 'cheap and halfarsed'. Plus this is from the director who would give us nazisploitation films Achtung! The Desert Tigers and The Beast In Heat so if you've watched them unlikely you'll know what to expect here. Django arrives in town just as the most terrible bar fight committed to film is taking place at a local taverna. Some big fellow is throwing people around and while the only other customer is sitting at a table playing cards Django pitches in and helps the guy. I think most people would have let the bad editing terrible acting and even worse stunt work help them decide that this film was kack and switch it off but not me. I'm too dumb for that.Django is trying to track down the Cortez brothers for reasons known only to himself while the other guy is also trying to track them down to retrieve gold that has been stolen not ten seconds after this one of the Cortez brothers turns up only it's obvious to all that the dude is a lady even though this is revealed later no clear explanation is made for why this is happening in the first place. More crap happens and etcPish poor in every department from the aforementioned car in the background to it all looking like it was filmed in someone's back garden to the crappy editing to characters seemingly changing position between shots to the deplorable acting of the captive gringo lady and worst of all the almost complete lack of gunfights for the entire duration of the film this is about as bad as spaghetti Westerns get. It's still better than the Beast in Heat though!".

	onyx:emotionText "Django's Cut Price Western more like! I don't know why Demofilo Fidani gets the label of 'the Italian Ed Wood' when folks like Luigi Batzella were producing crap like this. At one point a stagecoach rides right past a modern car! Every single thing about this film screams 'cheap and halfarsed'. Plus this is from the director who would give us nazisploitation films Achtung! The Desert Tigers and The Beast In Heat so if you've watched them unlikely you'll know what to expect here. Django arrives in town just as the most terrible bar fight committed to film is taking place at a local taverna. Some big fellow is throwing people around and while the only other customer is sitting at a table playing cards Django pitches in and helps the guy. I think most people would have let the bad editing terrible acting and even worse stunt work help them decide that this film was kack and switch it off but not me. I'm too dumb for that.Django is trying to track down the Cortez brothers for reasons known only to himself while the other guy is also trying to track them down to retrieve gold that has been stolen not ten seconds after this one of the Cortez brothers turns up only it's obvious to all that the dude is a lady even though this is revealed later no clear explanation is made for why this is happening in the first place. More crap happens and etcPish poor in every department from the aforementioned car in the background to it all looking like it was filmed in someone's back garden to the crappy editing to characters seemingly changing position between shots to the deplorable acting of the captive gringo lady and worst of all the almost complete lack of gunfights for the entire duration of the film this is about as bad as spaghetti Westerns get. It's still better than the Beast in Heat though!";

The comparison is fair because the similarities are too blatant and so it's fair to also say that as ordinary as this movie is it had potential. There are qualities to the story line that are too moving wounded soldiers in the Pacific a widow tracing the last days of her Marine husband's life a love affair against the rules and the actors are too fine add Thelma Ritter as an important third to just dismiss the whole thing as a mess.The director George Seaton is really a screenwriter and though he directed a dozen features none of them are especially memorable. His real fame rests on assisting with several great movies like The Wizard of Oz and with a single brilliant coupthe screenplay for the original 1947 as well as the later TV version of Miracle on 34th St. And it is no surprise that Seaton's own screen writing in The Proud and Profane though prosaic is very good. Ah but filmmaking is about timing flow surprise drama light shadow and sounds of all kinds. This is the director's blank canvas and Seaton doesn't go anywhere in any of these areas. The light is bright and flat. The camerawork is functional and bland cameraman John Warren being a newcomer moving quickly to television including many Hitchcock episodes. The score is strong thanks to veteran master Victor Young but there is no attempt to insert diegetic music or more interesting internal sounds. Even the supporting cast is pigeonholed into clichs and there is no critical secondary male role as Clift played in the 1953 movie. Thelma Ritter is at her best more normalized than in other roles but believable and superb.I write all this for a routine movie because of Holden who is an understated and sometimes brilliant actor and Kerr who I never warm up to but who is almost designed to be too cold to like. Kerr in particular is up and down here at times so perfectly cast and so convincing you start to really watch closely but other times she has to stretch her role a little when she is dancing for example or in the cheesy beach scene early on and it's awkward. Holden is made to be an enigma and when he warms up out of uniform he's likable and when he's cold he's cold but never admirable which is what a commander needs to be at least.I enjoyed this movie because I enjoy movies but also because it has aspects that are terrific. If you really like war films that aren't about battle as I do this is a must see. And if you want perspective on From Here to Eternity you really will appreciate both films more. For just a fresh wellmade movie terrific you will need to keep looking.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Proud and Profane is an annoying war film. That's because to me the characters in particular the two leads come off as phony and unlikable. Together they form a relationship that is about as believable as a politician making a promise of any sot.Deborah Kerr plays a very annoying woman. Her husband was killed at Guadalcanal and inexplicably she joins the Red Cross and goes to the Pacific to try to find folks who could tell her about her husband. This is hard to believe but when wounded men arrive and she doesn't want to see them because it bothers her to see hurt men I just wanted to slap her. What an immature and unlikable ladymore like a dbutante going to a cotillion than a lady volunteering to help in the war effort.As for William Holden he plays a tough 'blood and guts' colonel who is VERY intense and selfish. His way of dealing with things is to tell the men to suck it up. Lost an arm? Suck it up. Paralyzed for life? Stop your whining. He even yells at the Chaplin! This guy makes Attila the Hun seem charming.So you've got too seriously unlikable characters. And they seem to have absolutely nothingNOTHINGin common. So when they suddenly starts kissing and the music wells up with a romantic strain I felt like throwing a coffee cup at the TV screen. The dialog simply was some of the worst I'd heard of since my last Ed Wood film! The sticky gooey and utterly stupid dialog. The worst might be Holden's 'Indian halfbreed' speechbut it's all pretty lame.I've noticed that this film has a respectable overall score and decent reviews. Well I don't get it. Despite top stars this is a bad film whose only interesting attributes are the bit characterswhere you get to see a very young Marion Ross and David Bagdasarian the guy who created the Chipmunks in small parts. Otherwise a complete waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The combined credits of William Holden and Deborah Kerr will contain the titles of the best films of the Fifties. But The Proud And Profane will never go down in the top 10 list of either of these stars.Kerr is a Red Cross volunteer sent to New Caledonia which was a major US base in the Pacific War in the Forties. She's a recent widow of a Marine Lieutenant killed at Guadalcanal. Now she's in her grief trying to make some kind of atonement. What we don't need here is women on some kind of pilgrimage as her new supervisor at the Red Cross played by Thelma Ritter points out. In fact Ritter tries many times during the film to give Kerr a reality check.Holden was her husband's brigade commander and one tougher than usually tough Marine. Apparently her husband was a sensitive sort and Holden is unlike him in just about every way. In fact Holden is brutally frank about wanting to get to know her intimately and does.After which he undergoes a complete change of heart. And it turns out he's married most unhappily to a woman back in the states. These two stars had all the chemistry of vinegar and peppermint lifesavers. Funny because very soon Kerr was to be cast with Robert Mitchum in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison where he plays a tough Marine and she a nun. Those two were wonderful on screen together. But no movie magic emanated from the silver screen with Holden and Kerr.William Redfield plays a chaplain and some of those scenes with Holden were like Spock and McCoy going back and forth. Redfield was way too self righteous in a way DeForest Kelley never was.Best in the film is Thelma Ritter who many times is just that. And Adam Williams has a small but key role as a gravedigger and tender in the new cemetery on Guadalcanal. He's the one who finally gives Kerr the ultimate of reality checks.Definitely a film for fans of the two stars and Thelma Ritter.".

	schema:reviewBody "In an attempt to reprise her AcademyAward nominated performance in From Here to Eternity Deborah Kerr donned a short blonde hairdo and played a soldier's widow assigned to a tropical setting in the Pacific to help soldiers in WW2 in the film The Proud and the Profane. She's very prim and proper just as she was before succumbing to Burt Lancaster's charms in 1953 but this time around she goes headtohead with a stern mustached William Holden. Given their leading lady and similar settings it's awfully hard not to compare the two films and From Here to Eternity is much better. I don't really like William Holden anyway and in this unlikable role I found him even more difficult to endure. Thelma Ritter plays a volunteer nurse and she's exactly the same as she is in every movie cold rude argumentative and abrasive. I tried to separate her performance from the written words of her character to see which I found objectionable and as usual Thelma Ritter's acting was the problem. Another actress could have put a touch of warmth and compassion in the role and if she had the underlying emotion would have added a wonderful layer to her character. Deborah Kerr seems to be the only one who tried to act in the film and while she does do a good job the story falls short of From Here to Eternity and South Pacific. If you like Deborah Kerr or classic WW2 movies and you've already seen all the good ones go ahead and rent The Proud and the Profane. It probably won't end up being your favorite but not every movie you see has to be excellent right?".

Her appearance is enhanced by a certain wistful quality. Her voice has a mild but constant tentative tremor even when she's P'd off.But Noumea and Guadalcanal in 1943 is no place for a girl like this. She's enlisted and comes to Noumea in search of someone who knew the circumstances of her husband's death killed on Guadalcanal. He was and officer with an elite group of paratroopers in the Marines. They're never buck privates. Yet no one seems to remember him. And here she is at the primitive but combatfree base on Noumea impelled to greet the wounded debarking from a ship from Guadalcanal. She feels helpless. What can she do  offer a stick of gum to a soldier who has just had an arm amputated? And at her first encounter with a victim of combat fatigue she runs off and pukes.The driving force behind Kerr is Thelma Ritter as the seasoned veteran nurse guru mentor wisecracking New Yorker. Every scene she's in belongs to her.But  cherchez l'homme. William Holden is some kind of commanding officer with the returning troops. The first shot of him with military mustache shows us a stern frowning hard charger holding a swagger stick. And we know this is one highly principled and dedicated Marine officer. We know he's tough and has little room for romance. We know too that there will be romance anyway because William Holden is a star and so is Deborah Kerr.It helps to know that the story is from a novel by Lucy Herndon Crockett. We can anticipate almost everything that takes place  the growing attraction the doubt the open conflict of sensibilities the tears the resolution. Not just because Lucy Herndon Crockett is a woman novelist but because she has three names. And after all if the delicate Deborah Kerr could turn into a slut at the first whiff of Burt Lancaster's pheromones three years earlier in From Here to Eternity why not do it again? Holden strides purposefully down the gangway and Thelma Ritter stops him asking Colonel is there anything more we can do for your boys. He brusquely replies Yes don't call them boys and leave them alone. Then he marches away without another word.Not for long though. After the usual preliminaries Kerr finds herself preggers and when she tells Holden he accidentally knocks her down and the baby is lost. He's disturbed. She's almost destroyed. She won't forgive him. He humbles himself. She forgives him.Not much new here but it's enjoyable to see the stereotypes animated again horsey aristocratic haughty woman partIndian slum kid who advances through the Marine stratosphere because of hate. Both of them too full of pride because they've been hurt but both come together at the end as the love theme swells in the background and the image of Kerr's face radiant with hope fades and we see the Paramount Studios mountain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made at the height of WWII not long after the events upon which it is based took place Hangmen Also Die is a testament to the patriotic spirit of the Czechoslovakian people under the most dire conditions imaginable. After the Nazis have invaded and conquered the country a brave resistance fighter assassinates the brutal leader of the German occupation forces SS leader Reinhard Heydrich who like Klaus Barbie was a ruthless butcher of the innocent. Heydrich subjugated the Czech people by murdering torturing and enslaving hordes of noncombatant civilians. Just before the Nazi tyrant is shot he threatens to end a factory slowdown by the murder of hundreds of Czech workers. It is this threat that precipitates the assassination. The desperate killer of Heydrich member of an underground Czech resistance group narrowly escapes capture with the assistance of civilians who suffer the consequences immediately afterwards when many are taken hostage by the Nazis with the threat of imminent death hanging over their heads if the assassin is not turned over to the Gestapo.At the center of the tense drama is Nasha Novotny flawlessly played by Anna Lee as the daughter of a distinguished university professor and patriot portrayed by character actor Walter Brennan. Nasha is instrumental in aiding Brian Donlevy as Dr. Svoboda the assassin with ice water in his veins to escape his bloodthirsty Gestapo pursuers. But when Nasha's own father is picked up by the Gestapo she is forced to question her loyalty to the resistance begins to regard the man she has saved as a deadly threat to her family and nearly turns traitor to save her father's life. Expatriate German director Fritz Lang and his scenarists show great sympathy in portraying this all too human failing. In a few simple touches they go far beyond stereotype in showing how the recalcitrant patriot overcomes her strong personal misgivings to rejoin the heroic struggle against the Nazis.Hangmen is not a movie for the mechanically minded. Its craft is the art of understatement. Many of the events dramatically most important to the story  such as the assassination  are not depicted or happen offscreen. Whole sections of the plot line are there only by inference. This is particularly true at the end of the film when the entire conspiracy to frame up an enemy collaborator is only hinted at before it is sprung as a surprise upon the audience as on the unwitting villain. How did the underground resistance fighters arrange to fabricate so deadly a case against a traitor? We can only guess but may hardly object to the ironic way in which the informant meets his end.Fritz Lang has a well known reputation as a leader of the noir school of film maker. Yet in spite of its horrifying premise the movie is neither bleak nor pessimistic but a straightforward affirmation of the struggle against tyranny. Unlike many of his less gifted followers Lang is no mere stylist but is just as much concerned with the historic and moral significance of his story as the artful way in which he presents it. To those who might object that the Nazis are portrayed as stereotyped bad men the answer is that the Nazis were precisely what the film shows them to be ugly brutish travesties of human beings. And who would know that better than Fritz Lang and his excellent scenarist Bertolt Brecht? Both of them had lived in Germany under the Nazis and escaped to the United States to strike a devastating propaganda blow against the enemy.".

	schema:headline " Good antinazi propaganda but not good history.";
	schema:reviewBody "One suspects this film registered better with viewers in 1943 than it does today. Despite being suggested by the actual assassination of Reichs Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Reinhard Heydrich better known to the Czechs as The Hangman because of his excessive brutality in dealing with residents of the conquered regions it is almost total fiction. Even so it is not bad as a rather involved drama and was very likely good antinazi propaganda.Perhaps it is well to start with what actually did happen to Heydrich on May 29 1942. Two young Czechs Jan Kubis and Josef Ganchik parachuted in from an RAF plane and managed to ambush the Hangman riding in his open Mercedes. Armed with both machine pistols and a bomb the apparently did little harm by shooting but did explode the bomb under the car. Heydrich's spleen was penetrated by bomb fragments and debris causing death several days later possibly more by infection than anything else. The two Czechs evaded capture briefly but witnesses under torture revealed their hiding place in a church and the SS killed them. In a massive retaliation Hitler picked the village of Lidice more or less at random from among places known to harbor antiGerman sentiment and ordered its total annihilation. The people of Lidice had nothing whatever to do with the assassination of course.In HANGMEN ALSO DIE we have the story of a lone assassin using an English made pistol whose getaway taxi was forced to move by German soldiers causing him to take refuge during the curfew at the home of a Czech professor. The professor's daughter Mascha had impulsively directed the German pursuit away from him. The German police suspect the girl but release her in the hope she will lead them to the wanted man. They also round up many Czechs including the girl's father and begin shooting them as hostages. The girl at first intends to give information hoping to save her father but in the end is persuaded otherwise by the Czech resistance. A plan is concocted to bamboozle the SS and save the assassin and the girl but what it is you will have to see for yourself. Be assured it is incredible.As you see this story has little to do with the historic assassination and its aftermath beyond illustrating the SS brutality but it does make a mildly entertaining wartime adventure with good propaganda value largely because of the rather low key intensely personal nature of the plot elements. Some of the characters are very real and believable e.g. the Gestapo Inspector Gruber the girl Mascha and her father all ably portrayed by Alexander Granach Anna Lee and Walter Brennan respectively. On the other hand some characters are more like cardboard cutouts and get wooden performances to suit. Brian Donlevy as Dr.Svoboda the assassin fits this category alas as do a number of others. What realism there is seems likely to have been the contribution of Bertolt Brecht rather than John Wexley who got the credit for the screenplay. One likes to think that Fritz Lang did the best he could with a mixed bag of acting talent but this can hardly be said to be his best effort.Just why Hollywood producers seem to prefer fiction to the facts when dealing with historical material is a major mystery to me. In 1943 the general facts of the assassination were known if not all the details and could have made just as dramatic a story as this fictional one. It is worth a watch though especially if you like Anna Lee.".

	schema:headline " Gripping in its intensity";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1942 the Czech underground assassinates Reinhard Heydrich the governor of BohemiaMoravia. Heydrich's assassin tries to escape capture.This is based on a true story of course  it's a wellknown episode of World War II. Czech commandos were brought in from Britain on a mission with a slim chance of survival for the selfless agents. They unfortunately met a sad end after being betrayed by a fellow Czech. The history is described very well in books such as Callum MacDonald's The Killing of SS Obergruppenfhrer Reinhard Heydrich.In 1943 when this film was made were the full details of the actual events widely available in the USA? I'm not sure but it seems unlikely.The story as presented here is the tale of what happens one day when a girl goes out to buy vegetables for supper and when a taxi driver lets his finicky engine idle. Perhaps this plot was fabricated for want of any other alternative but its sheer ordinariness adds to its immediacy.The reptilian Heydrich was one of the architects of Hitler's Final Solution. It's no coincidence that the plan to assassinate him was codenamed Anthropoid.Hans Heinrich von Twardowski plays him briefly at the beginning of the drama. He's coldblooded vicious rabid ... and a little effeminate. That aspect seems questionable. In 1943 there were at least as many reasons for knowing what his character represented as there were occupied countries in Europe. This particular embellishment seems to add little or nothing to the suspense.Twardowski himself was a German exile in Hollywood. If you can read German and have a look at the titles of the films he made in 1928 and 1929 you can probably hazard a guess as to why he was forced to leave Hitler's Germany.Brian Donlevy plays the assassin. It's not by chance that this character is named Dr. Svoboda. Svoboda is a common name but it also happens to be the Czech word for freedom.I always find Donlevy effective particularly so in The Great McGinty 1940 for Preston Sturges but he does have a certain B actor limitation on access to his character's inner thoughts. He doesn't quite have the hunted quality of someone facing certain capture and torture. A perspiring lip might have helped.Better is Alexander Granach as the Gestapo man Gruber a Bob Hoskins sort of person only sinister. He's ruthless cunning perfect in the part.Walter Brennan appears as a Czech professor arrested and held as a hostage. Prof. Walter Brennan that's right! He's very good. Considering the typecasting he must have been fighting against he's excellent in fact.My moderate criticism of some of the performances notwithstanding the suspense in the story was of the nailbiting kind I felt. I wouldn't have wanted to watch this in 1943  it's just too bleak too disturbing. When hostages are being held by the Gestapo it's a loselose situation all around. All possible outcomes are disastrous.I guess the filmmakers felt  knew  that this would be more than a contemporary audience could really handle in the middle of wartime. Hence the film has an uplifting artificial fantasy ending which arrives like a deus ex machina.That's certainly a drawback for viewers now but I can't fault anyone. The context of the times couldn't have allowed any other solution.Fritz Lang directed this return to Mitteleuropa the scene of his youth and early classic films. He runs the show like a police procedural making it all too real. He allows himself a couple of his great shots which I will allow you to discover for yourself.In real life the actual Czech assassins  Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis plus their lookout man Josef Valcik  were all killed in battle at their hiding place in the Karel Boromejsky Church in Prague on June 18 1942.Heydrich's state funeral had been held earlier in Berlin on June 9. The Nazis had Siegfried's Funeral March from Wagner's Gtterdmmerung played for the occasion probably with extra added bombast.That's the sort of heroic farewell that the martyred Czechs should have received.".

Heydrich's assassin tries to escape capture.This is based on a true story of course  it's a wellknown episode of World War II. Czech commandos were brought in from Britain on a mission with a slim chance of survival for the selfless agents. They unfortunately met a sad end after being betrayed by a fellow Czech. The history is described very well in books such as Callum MacDonald's The Killing of SS Obergruppenfhrer Reinhard Heydrich.In 1943 when this film was made were the full details of the actual events widely available in the USA? I'm not sure but it seems unlikely.The story as presented here is the tale of what happens one day when a girl goes out to buy vegetables for supper and when a taxi driver lets his finicky engine idle. Perhaps this plot was fabricated for want of any other alternative but its sheer ordinariness adds to its immediacy.The reptilian Heydrich was one of the architects of Hitler's Final Solution. It's no coincidence that the plan to assassinate him was codenamed Anthropoid.Hans Heinrich von Twardowski plays him briefly at the beginning of the drama. He's coldblooded vicious rabid ... and a little effeminate. That aspect seems questionable. In 1943 there were at least as many reasons for knowing what his character represented as there were occupied countries in Europe. This particular embellishment seems to add little or nothing to the suspense.Twardowski himself was a German exile in Hollywood. If you can read German and have a look at the titles of the films he made in 1928 and 1929 you can probably hazard a guess as to why he was forced to leave Hitler's Germany.Brian Donlevy plays the assassin. It's not by chance that this character is named Dr. Svoboda. Svoboda is a common name but it also happens to be the Czech word for freedom.I always find Donlevy effective particularly so in The Great McGinty 1940 for Preston Sturges but he does have a certain B actor limitation on access to his character's inner thoughts. He doesn't quite have the hunted quality of someone facing certain capture and torture. A perspiring lip might have helped.Better is Alexander Granach as the Gestapo man Gruber a Bob Hoskins sort of person only sinister. He's ruthless cunning perfect in the part.Walter Brennan appears as a Czech professor arrested and held as a hostage. Prof. Walter Brennan that's right! He's very good. Considering the typecasting he must have been fighting against he's excellent in fact.My moderate criticism of some of the performances notwithstanding the suspense in the story was of the nailbiting kind I felt. I wouldn't have wanted to watch this in 1943  it's just too bleak too disturbing. When hostages are being held by the Gestapo it's a loselose situation all around. All possible outcomes are disastrous.I guess the filmmakers felt  knew  that this would be more than a contemporary audience could really handle in the middle of wartime. Hence the film has an uplifting artificial fantasy ending which arrives like a deus ex machina.That's certainly a drawback for viewers now but I can't fault anyone. The context of the times couldn't have allowed any other solution.Fritz Lang directed this return to Mitteleuropa the scene of his youth and early classic films. He runs the show like a police procedural making it all too real. He allows himself a couple of his great shots which I will allow you to discover for yourself.In real life the actual Czech assassins  Josef Gabcik and Jan Kubis plus their lookout man Josef Valcik  were all killed in battle at their hiding place in the Karel Boromejsky Church in Prague on June 18 1942.Heydrich's state funeral had been held earlier in Berlin on June 9. The Nazis had Siegfried's Funeral March from Wagner's Gtterdmmerung played for the occasion probably with extra added bombast.That's the sort of heroic farewell that the martyred Czechs should have received.";

After the attempt on Heydrich's life Nasha Novotny Anna Lee gives the wrong runaway direction of Svoboda to the Gestapo agents. When Svoboda sees that he is trapped he goes to Nasha's apartment seeking shelter and he introduces himself as the architect Karel Vanek. He is welcomed by the patriarch and former revolutionary Professor Stephen Novotny Walter Brennan and he spends the night with the family. On the next morning the Gestapo captures hostages including Professor Novotny to force the population to denounce the assassin. Nasha goes to the St. Pancracio Hospital to seek out the resident surgeon Dr. Franticek Svoboda and ask him to surrender to the German authorities to protect the hostages. But sooner she learns that the occupation police has no intentions to let the prisoner go and she helps the resistance in the plan to frame the traitor Emil Czaka Gene Lockhart. Hangmen Also Die! is a flawed but entertaining war propaganda film based on a true event the murder of Hangman Reinhard Heydrich. The fictional plot of fight for freedom is engaging and it is interesting since it was filmed in 1943 before the end of the war.

This one however differs from these in that it tackles a reallife event i.e. the assassination of Heydrich  dubbed The Hangman his assassination was the subject of two more films the contemporaneous HITLER'S MADMAN 1943 and OPERATION DAYBREAK 1975  and is further elevated by the contribution of two important figures of prewar German art director Lang and writer Bertolt Brecht.It also features a great cast mostly delivering excellent performances but is saddled with a miscast and rather stiff Brian Donlevy in the lead Walter Brennan and Gene Lockhart are featured in overly familiar roles but their contribution is as ever reliable and entirely welcome best of all perhaps are Anna Lee and Alexander Granach beloved character actor Dwight Frye most familiar to horrorfilm buffs appears here in one of his last roles but as was generally the case is regrettably given only a couple of lines! Long and heavygoing with the propagandist element coming off as fairly corny now but the film is held firmly together by Lang's fine direction and James Wong Howe's superb noirish lighting the Region 1 DVD by Kino was eventually reissued as part of a 5Disc Noir set. It also involves a couple of scuffles which are quite tense and energetic Granach's death scene is especially striking while the last third resorts to the organized frameup by the Czechs of a traitor in their midst collaborationist Lockhart  which in itself is no less frightening an act than the heinous persecution of the Nazi regime! I'm confused however about the film's runningtime the print I watched ran for 129 minutes in PAL mode which would bring it to about 134 minutes when converted to NTSC even so it contains the ending missing from the DVDs released in Regions 1 and 2 which being the same version i.e. cut and having the same length 134 minutes would indicate that the Kino edition is a PAL conversion  which means a full runningtime of 139 minutes a minute short of the 'official' length as per Lotte Eisner's book on Lang! To make matters worse both the Leslie Halliwell and Leonard Maltin film guides I own cite HANGMEN ALSO DIE! as being 131 minutes long!!".

However Donlevy holdshisown in this unusual release from the war years 1943.I referred to this picture as unusual because the real heavy acting was presented by the great Walter Brennan a multiOscar winner who was usually cast as a character in westerns  possibly as the sidekick to Gary Cooper or John Wayne. In this feature he ably handles the part as a serious and highly educated gentleman with perfect speaking abilities. Mr. Brennan also had eyepower on the bigscreen. He didn't have to speak a word in order to present a heavy thought.Then there is Gene Lockhart playing a role that fits him perfectly. Mr. Lockhart simply followed the style and technique utilized in similar character assignments that he had presented so well for decades in Hollywood ... every one of them unbeatable. A bit like Walter Brennan his facial expressions revealed his true acting magic. Of most importance Gene Lockhart's character was the heaviest role in this outstanding motion picture demanding tremendous acting ability. He managed to hit every solid mark with perfection.Anna Lee and Dennis O'Keefe handled their characters very nicely but were not quite in the same classroom as Brennan and Lockhart.Brian Donlevy who was given star billing in this picture didn't sway from his general method of acting. This isn't to say his role was a failure ... he just didn't outshine those with lower billing. He simply remained Brian Donlevy but handled his role in an acceptable manner.The story content is outstanding  as is Fritz Lang's excellent direction. Hangmen Also Die is indeed a movie that will hold your attention. I've viewed it several times down through the years in order to watch the old familiar character actors as they shine in classic irreplaceable form.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic wartime thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang has done it again. He made solid work in the 30s in America but from what I've seen this is his first near classic under American production.The story follows an assassin who kills a Hangman in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia during World War 2. What follows is a twisting an elaborate thriller involving secret underground counter intelligence groups a love affair of sorts adventure and a thrilling end to a near masterpiece.Scenes that stood out immensely involve the assassin meeting with the female he whose house he briefly stayed in. She did not realize who she was and when finding out plans to turn him into the Gestapo. They eventually meet in her house again only the hero knows the room is bugged. Incorporating a brilliant scene involving them exchanging sentences on a note card detailing what to say while at the same time vocalizing as if they're having a lover's spat to keep the Gestapo fooled. Brilliant.The other scene involves trying to catch the traitor in the underground movement. Suspecting him of actually knowing German they devise a plot to have a waiter at dinner to tell a joke in German. Once the joke is finished they intensely watch the traitor for his reaction. Fantastically well done once the viewer is in on the sneaky trick you're on the edge of your seat.As a Lang film of course you get great shadow work throughout. A man entering a door the viewer only sees the shadow of a man with a bowler hat on suspense builds especially since your only implication for a few seconds is the reaction of the female who opened to see who it is.The end could have been edited down a few scenes. They tried to outstretch the capture a bit too long following under the dreaded idea that it could have ended in a few spots.  SPOILERS The final scene is also sort of a slap in the face when you find out the Gestapo report realized the person they convicted could never have been the real assassin. END SPOILER A slap in the face after just completing one of the most edge of your seat thrillers of a wartime flick I have ever seen.Often overlooked I've never seen it mentioned on any lists whether it's Lang list 40s list thriller or even noir though I would not call it a noir seems everything around this period gets that label. Definitely one to see that will remind in your mind for awhile!".

	schema:headline " Fritz Lang and Bertolt Brecht's resistance juggernaut from WW2 Czechsovakia";
	schema:reviewBody "Under the name 'Bert' Brecht teamed up with director Fritz Lang to craft this cunning and ultimately suspenseful tale that borders more than consciously on propaganda but for all the right reasons considering the period. It wasn't a period piece but something urgent of the time and place not to mention a stark battle cry from Lang who fled Germany in 1934 following a calling from Goebbels to become the propaganda filmmaker of the 30s and it stands still as one of those underseen pieces where loyalties and betrayals and doublecrosses and vendettas are all abound and the truth is something tricky and twisty on either side. The main plot concerns the dramatized story of Reinhard Heydrich the hangman who is then put on by the Nazis as a figure of the past to haunt the Czech people the assassin MUST be found. The assassin is Dr. Franticek Svoboda aka Karel Vanek who may also have another alias and is well played by Donelvy who hides with a Czech professor Brennan via a chance meeting weeks before with Nasha Anna. Once he escapes following a curfew that night many people are rounded up hundreds to be executed by the Nazis if the assassin isn't taken in. Anna's family is questioned her father on the list of those to soon be killed but what of Svoboda and the resistance or the cruel Nazis at the gestapo for that matter? It's a typical Langian procedural in the very tense and exacting sense and it's a lot of tense fun and there's always a sense of danger with how the characters cross one another in one scene to the next I loved when Vanek comes back to Anna after the first night she's mad at him but this is right after she's been questioned by cruel Gruber performed by Granach as half caricature and half powerhungry monster and there is a wire to her apartment only to have him feed her lines through index cards. It's just as intense as a more modern espionage thriller only Lang has the upperhand at crafting it with an equal hand of social indictment like M or Fury the people in the Czech city have a role to play in what happens and there's great scenes of small mobs going crazy like in the movie theater and of a more general grilling of the sadistic Nazis. There's not much room to make them very threedimensional however Hangmen Also Die! features the Nazis performed not in very simplistic ways. Maybe my favorite is the traitor a Nazi collaborator played by the large Gene Lockhart who can go from being happygolucky to frantic and pushy on a dime and is the total puppet of the sneaky inspector Gruber who is funniest when trying to get back to sleep following a night of frivolity with some girls.The storyline isn't completely free of a few heavy lines of dialog and the whole subplot involving the 'is she seeing someone else' thinking for Jan Horak O'Keefe best at looking stonefaced in semishock who is the fianc of Nasha is the least effective of the lot. But what is here is a striking example of balancing real thrills it's hard not to be on the edge of your seat in the last fifteen to twenty minutes mostly as characters talk if not in tense catandmouse theatrics and a great message at hand. Lang makes this a story meant to pull people into action the film ends with NOT and then superimposed THE END and like with M there's many a moment when the commonfolk like a maid or a taxi driver or butler become the real heroes in saying who was where or what one did at a given time. And of course Lang is also totally on top of his game at crafting this with many images of sadistic shadows watch as Nasha is prisoner and a guard comes into a second shot in silhouette and enclosing angles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hangmen Also Die is an OK sort of film fatally marred by the fact that it is pure propaganda obviously slanted towards a wartime audience. The plot involving an elaborate scheme to incriminate a Czech who is both a businessman and Nazi informer is a complete fiction! One is left with the idea that the real assassin simply got away with it! The real facts were generally available at this time and I'm amazed that Lang and the others involved here got away with this! The real story is a bit less upbeat Heydrich was killed by not one but two Czechs who fired at him and finally killed him by lobbing a bomb at his vehicle. The two hid out in a church and were hunted down and killed just shortly thereafter. Sadly not all the Czechs were as loyal to the resistance as those shown in this film. Someone informed on the killers which led to their speedy demise. This is the incident which triggered the famous reprisal carried out by the Nazis for revenge for the murder of Heydrich they destroyed an entire Czech town Lidice the locale chosen at random. Since this is very famous part of wartime history I am sad that so many viewers don't know what the real story was. The theme of Nazi reprisal is worked in very well but the film steers clear of the much more shocking and ugly truth. A pityfor the real story would have been a much clearer picture of the true brutality of the Nazis. I guess 1940s audiences weren't considered mature enough to handle the truth! Again this gross distortion of the facts here is a fatal flaw. Sad since I think the director with more accurate material could have produced a great film...tragedies such as these were more his forte.".

First I'd criticize the script as being overplotted with too many tangles and endless complications like a Baroque church with too many ornaments. Some of the dialogue has to be criticized too. I know it was written during the war and served as a propaganda tool but here we judge films as entertainment maybe even art. At several points the movie stalls while a character speechifies sounding ohsonoble but at the same time ohsounnatural. People may act nobly in real life but they seldom accompany their actions with little speeches aimed at some distant audience beautiful cookedup phrases for the ages. It's jarring understandable perhaps because of the war but it adds a false note to the realism of the film. Second at one moment I was quite shocked at the directing. Fairly early in the story Natasha angrily accuses the assassin of cowardice for hiding while the hostages rounded up by the Nazis are paying the price with their lives. The way she leans forward over his desk extending her arm to full length from the shoulder and jabbing it at him not once but twice looks completely unnatural. That's not the way a real person points an accusatory finger. It's obvious that the actress has had bad direction to move and pose in such a false manner.Yes this film is interesting to some extent perhaps as a period piece. The plot complications while overdone at least create the air of something adult and intelligent. The outdoor scenes are all done on a stage set so it doesn't have the benefit of complete authenticity.I enjoyed seeing Walter Brennan playing an elderly professor with some brains having had quite enough of his typecasting as a lovable but cantankerous old codger with that highpitched whiny voice of his.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having been to the beautiful country of Czechoslovakia and met its wonderful people it's hard not to have an even stronger feeling for the way this country has suffered at the hands of oppressors. In Hangmen Also Die director Fritz Lang captures the indomitable spirit of the Czechs using a true story the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich one of Hitler's enforcers in Czechoslovakia.In this story a young woman Nasha Novotny Anna Lee misdirects the police as they search for a man she saw running away in fact the freedom fighter Dr. Svoboda Brian Donlevy who shot Heydrich. Eventually her entire family is under suspicion because without knowing it they actually house the man who showed up on their doorstep later. Until someone in the country gives up the assassin Hitler has ordered stiff reprisals and many hostages are taken and executions carried out. The head of the Novotny household Walter Brennan is ultimately taken hostage. In order to save him Nasha wants to turn Svoboda over to the Gestapo.This is an exciting and nervewracking film if overly long. Anna Lee who played the matriarch Lila Quartermaine on General Hospital for many years here is a young woman and she does a wonderful job. Donlevy is perhaps slightly miscast. Dennis O'Keefe as Nasha's fiance is even more miscast than Donlevy  both those male characters could have used more color and depth. Walter Brennan is marvelous as Nasha's father. The rest of the cast is excellent.Marcia Davenport dealt with the Czech freedom fighters in her book The Valley of Decision  alas that section was not included in the film version of the book. Davenport in real life was in love with Jan Mazurek who was defenestrated. Hangmen Also Die is another example of bravery and heroism from the common man during an evil war.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's very simple everyone wants to win the war so you utilize lots of trickslies and other things. First I write as a comment something very different but I changed my mind after I read one of the comments here. The end of the real assassins was really tragic but Hollywood can't show that. No of course not. They need dreamers who think war is really heroic. The machine of war is hungry and needs young flesh.I haven't seen not a single motion picture that illustrate what happens to those Japanese who were burnt alive in Hiroshima and Nagasaki what about you? Of course not. Army wouldn't allow it and lots of politician find it dangerous if people think that war is awful how would they go to war and and got themselves killed? The truth is those assassins were killed and they were afraid but what we see on screen are not human beings but extraordinary superman. They didn't have any fear at all. But I saw war and it's from my experience that people don't act like that. They only want to stay alive. There is no happy ending in the war. I agree with Long on the motto at the End. Not The End.But what about ordinary people why they like these films it is a simple fact. They are not what they are seeing on the screen and they want to be it. If you show them the real themselves they wouldn't sit and your film will be a financial disaster.This film is like this for me a dwarf have a painter to paint him as an Elf.It's pathetic.But if I hate the storyline why I rated 710. That's simple. Cinema is not just a form of art it's a business too and also it's a instrument. From these point of view it's a langian film and brechtian script and it's worth watching.".

First I write as a comment something very different but I changed my mind after I read one of the comments here. The end of the real assassins was really tragic but Hollywood can't show that. No of course not. They need dreamers who think war is really heroic. The machine of war is hungry and needs young flesh.I haven't seen not a single motion picture that illustrate what happens to those Japanese who were burnt alive in Hiroshima and Nagasaki what about you? Of course not. Army wouldn't allow it and lots of politician find it dangerous if people think that war is awful how would they go to war and and got themselves killed?

Director Fritz Lang writer Berthold Brecht and many in the cast knew the Nazi mentality well and what it was like to live under them. They had the intelligence and foresight to leave while the getting out was good.We in America knew about the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich but scarce few details before the war was over. Lang and Brecht created an apocryphal tale of what should have happened. Hangman Also Die is one intricately plotted affair a lot more than you would see it in a film of this type in wartime America.Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski is on ever so briefly as Heydrich in the beginning. His performance reminded me of Christopher Plummer as Commodus in The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire. Heydrich was far from the colorful character he's portrayed here in real life. This was a man who could go home to the wife and kids home and hearth after a day's gassing at Auschwitz. Still Twardowski is memorable if not true to life.We never see the actual shooting. We do see Brian Donlevy who is a doctor as well as an assassin fleeing the scene of the attack and Anna Lee misdirecting the pursuing Nazis just by patriotic instinct. The Nazi response is swift and brutal. They start shooting chosen hostages one of them being Anna Lee's father university professor Walter Brennan.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at Brennan here who gave a well thought out and restrained performance. In the North Star I thought he was out of place as a Russian peasant. I was expecting the same but it was nice not to have expectations lived up to.The whole film is about a collective crisis of conscience for the Czech people. What do we do about this assassin do we hide him support him or do we turn him in hopes that hostage shooting will cease? In the meantime the Gestapo presses on with the investigation.Gene Lockhart is also in the cast as a collaborator. His exposure as one is one of the best scenes in the film. Lockhart played many roles like this in his film career but he was absolutely at his best in a part he honed to perfection.It should have happened this way in real life. The way the Gestapo closes the books on the Heydrich case is really well done. All I can say is that Brecht and Lang play on the characteristics of the Nazis most of all their paranoia. Intricately plotted and executed beautifully by Fritz Lang and his cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the complicated and fascinating back story of this production how the Hollywood system represented by producer Arnold Pressburger and director Fritz Lang undermined the intentions of scriptwriter Bertolt Brecht in his first and only US film effort it's amazing not only how effective the final product turned out to be but how well it holds up after several decades. Yes it's melodramatic yes there are Langian tricks yes the villains are extreme types yes there is sentimentality yes there is slick oversimplification and distortion of fact  but it still works powerfully as a tale of innocent people the Czechs fighting against a powerful aggressor the Nazis in the early days of World War Two.If you're going to make a movie about Nazis it certainly helps if the writers are German and the story by Lang and Brecht fills that bill. So there is a living breathing familiarity with the subjects with significant sections delivered in German effectively giving nonGerman speaking audiences a sense of the alienation the Czechs felt from their occupiers. There are four main Nazi villains each one of whom leaps off the screen. We start with Hans von Twardowski as Reinhard Heydrich who creates a memorably vicious almost comically cruel autocrat the kind of hateful person one wouldn't mind killing. And we don't have long to wait because his assassination is what sets the whole plot in motion. We are then presented with three finely etched Gestapo figures each horrendous Tonio Selwart a well groomed perfectly tailored ramrod straight martinet given to chain smoking and examining a large pimple on his cheek while conducting his bloody business Reinhold Schunzel flabby faced gravel voiced and highly strung who pops his knuckles and slurps tea while interrogating his victims Alexander Granach the unshaven beer guzzling skirtchasing Inspector Gruber. And then we have Gene Lockhart the epitome of smallminded corruption as Emil Czaka a businessman who betrays his own people. Walter Brennan is appropriately noble as Prof Novotny lean and lithe and stoic as he is taken hostage after Heydrich's murder. Even the splendid Dwight Frye shows up briefly but strongly as a Czech hostage.Brecht and Lang are said to have disliked poor Anna Lee who plays the young daughter of Prof. Novotny. Even if one is unaware of the nasty stresses unfairly imposed upon her during filming one gets the sense that the weak moments in her performance result as much from the script and direction as from any lack of ability on her part. Brian Donlevy as the hero of sorts was never a very interesting leading man but there is so much intrigue going on around him that his casting does no harm. Speaking of intrigue a scheme that is hatched by the Czech underground to trap Czaka is so intricate and masterful and implausible that one cannot help but recall the diabolical maneuverings of Lang's 1922 creation Doktor Mabuse der Spieler. Hangmen like much of the silent Mabuse also has an instudio look largely due to the fact that Lang had to work with a skimpy budget. The street scenes are obviously fake but what goes on in those streets is so compelling we are persuaded to ignore their obvious fakery. James Wong Howe's noirish cinematography is a plus under these constrictions.There is no way to know if a better film would have resulted had Brecht prevailed so we're stuck with what we have an action flick instead of an epic social drama. Despite flaws it's still one of the better World War Two era thrillers.".

	schema:headline " The Aftermath of the Heydrich Assassination";
	schema:reviewBody "Under the quaint nickname of 'Bert Brecht' one of Germany's leading playwrights wrote this story jointly with fellowexile Fritz Lang as part of the antiNazi wartime film effort in America. They chose as an excellent focus for their story the spectacular assassination of Reinhard Heydrich the sadistic and fanatical antiSemitic ReichsProtektor of occupied Czechoslovakia. They did not bother trying to get the story straight they created a fictional tale round the aftermath of the true event. The direction is good the cinematography by James Wong Howe excellent as usual. The film contains a wonderful supporting performance by Gene Lockhart as the character called Czaka. The other performances are by actors who were obviously secondchoices and Lang had to make do with what he could get. Brian Donlevy is a bizarre choice for the assassin and is seriously miscast. Even more miscast is Walter Brennan as a distinguished professor and every time he opens his mouth with his familiar gravelly voice of a character actor from Westerns one expects to see him spit 'chawin' tobacco' into a spitoon rather than be serious and worried about the Nazis. Anna Lee does extremely well as his daughter caught up in waves of hysterical fear and angst more familiar Lang territory. Dennis O'Keefe is fine as the fiance of Lee. The film manages to be extremely gripping despite all these shortcomings because Lang was such a pro he could make a good film with matchstick men if he had to. Perhaps it is unkind to criticise Brennan and Donlevy as they did the best they possibly could and knew how but they were just wrong that's all. There are some good expressionistic moments but not as many as we would like. This is a powerful film which packs a punch but imagine what a classic it could have been if Lang had not had to scrape round for the cast and instead had his pick of the best casting. Certainly the atmosphere of total fear and oppression under the Nazis is well conveyed and the execution of innocent hostages by way of reprisals is rubbed in our faces. We are left in no doubt just how despicable the Nazis were and this film must have been extremely effective in motivating Americans to fight the Hun with even greater ferocity outraged as they would have been at having seen this vivid portrayal of what 'German Europe' was really like.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're going to enjoy this you'd better clear your mind of any knowledge you might hold of the assassination of Heydrich in occupied Czechoslovakia. Treat this as a fictional tale about a fictional hunt for a fictional assassin in Prague.The historical facts are too depressing anyway. Heydrich was murdered by two guys. The Nazis tortured Czechs until one of them squealed. Then they tracked the assassins to a church and the two killers committed suicide. The Nazis then destroyed a village that had nothing to do with political events. See Operation Daybreak.Here we have Brian Donlevy as a doctor in Prague who shoots Heydrich. He then has to seek immediate shelter in the house of strangers in this case the home of Professor Walter Brennan and his family including daughter Anna Lee.The Gestapo are understandably upset and they organize a manhunt for the killer which centers around Donlevy and around the family that sheltered him. The Nazis round up and execute Czechs at random but nobody talks. And in the end the underground frames a Nazi agent for the crime.The Nazis aren't shown as stupid brutes. Alexander Granach the Gestapo Inspector is positively clever in a swinish almost comic way. Fritz Lang has him with a haircut that the punk rockers of the 80s would have envied. His military mustache curls up at the ends as in a moraleboosting poster left over from World War I and his plump neck hangs over his collar. His gestures are operatic his perceptions acute his consumption of beer heroic.Not far behind if in fact he's behind at all is Reinhold Schnzel as the uniformed Gestapo officer. He smiles pleasantly leaning back and tripling his chin while describing the torture that a suspect is about to undergo but in an avuncular way as if about to buy a child an ice cream cone. While the victim stands shivering Schnzel grins swivels in his office chair and cracks his knuckles one by one.Less of an actor but more of a straight figure is Tonio Selwart as the Chief of the Gestapo. Less of a caricature more of a character. He doesn't smile or squint. He speaks quietly and with sweet reason. And he wears those great uniforms with riding breeches and boots and he wears a monocle and Fritz Lang shows us Selwart peering into a mirror and squeezing a zit on his cheek.The good guys are much less interesting. Brian Donlevy is referred to as a young man but he's a little old for that. I mean the guy was in Mexico with General Pershing in pursuit of Panch Villa wasn't he? And anyway he's practically ligneous. If his expression ever changed I missed it and he walks with his chest thrown out like a pigeon's. Dennis O'Keefe in a minor part is harmless as always. Walter Brennan toothless old Walter Brennan comic sidekick does rather well by the role of a professor of history and Anna Lee as his daughter is cute as hell. Slender wideeyed shivering with fright. I love her. The problem is that all the good guys stand around spraying patriotic clichs just as a lawn sprinkler sprays water.No it's not Fritz Lang's best picture but neither is it is worst. The script credit goes to Berthold Brecht but I understand he didn't contribute much. Still I'm glad he was in Hollywood instead of gulp elsewhere. His songs for the comedy Where Do We Go From Here? are memorable. Lang was a popular director in Germany and was asked by Goebbels to head the movie propaganda program of the Third Reich. As he describes it he replied I'm tickled pink and was on the next airplane out of Berlin. He brings some of his expressionism and originality with him. The dark deep dramatic shadows of films like Ministry of Fear are already adumbrated so to speak.And he does something that should earn him a medal. Lang was fond of using mirrors in his films for some reason. Check out Woman in the Window. Here he has Granach run to a mirror to inspect some smeared lipstick on his cheeks. And  guess what  Granach looks AT HIS OWN REFLECTION and not at the camera lens. When the actor looks at the audience instead of himself it's a jarring estrangement for the viewer who is hit over the head with the realization that this is not just a movie but a clumsily directed one an insulting one at that.You know considering that so many of the cast were born in Germany you have to wonder just how often directions were given in English. Lang was quite an authoritarian. I can see him now strutting about with his boots riding breeches and monocle bellowing orders through a bullhorn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gay comedies are a hard genre to master with any subtlety one side of the fence is occupied by movies made to mock gays for 'straight' amusement and the other side is to mock straights for 'gay' amusement. Right off the top I'll say that I enjoyed this film. Not wildly as 20 years ago I enjoyed 'La Cage aux Folles' yet nevertheless it was involving good characterization welledited and paced. Yet yet . . . . One of the hurdles for most viewers is that the film is deeply rooted in the French gay cultural scene. And if the viewer isn't familiar with that milieu it will seem as if the film was set in the late '70s or '80s. Everything that the viewer knows or may have heard about gay life in the USA in those years seems very alive here. The point is that IS the way Paris is even now. While trendsetting on a variety of fronts France has NEVER set the pace for gay culture that honor belongs to the USA. Thus there is a soundtrack out of the Gloria Gaynor days different songs but reminiscent of 'Priscilla of the Desert' and the large background cast of gay characters are reminiscent of times long gone on this side of the Atlantic. If the viewer can accept that '80sstyle gay party life is still alive and well in Paris in 1996 then there won't be any jarring sense of whoa  when was this film made? The topbilled star is Patrick Timsit in the role of Adrien the gay main character who loves Eva longtime friend and owner of a gay establishment. He thinks of her as family and even says so at one point in the movie. But the STAR of this film is Fanny Ardant Eva who easily steals every single scene she is in and not without reason. There is a rather flimsy opening setup about how all the characters meet  Adrien is negociating a deal with Alexandre a banker played by Richard Berry sorry Gtran but he's the banker not the client and soon various wives lovers 'tricks' and others are all in on the act. For anyone not familiar with Ms. Ardant she is an undiluted joy go rent 'Ridicule' now!. Ferociously handsome wearing her emotions on her face and her clothes quite well toowhile keeping her heart hidden she engages the viewer as few actress do anymore French actresses have a talent for that. I found Mr. Timsit arch and shrill at times without the underlying tenderness and pathos that invested every moment of Michel Serrault's Zaza Napoli of 1978 but he suffices. Richard Berry does a fine job as a 'hetero' forced to open his horizons a bit while pursuing Eva. Michle Laroque has the unenviable job of the 'clueless wife' but her hesitancy and luminous beauty play very well here. Jacques Gamblin as Lemoine Alexandre's aide tries very hard to portray a man still caught in the 'it's hard to come out' milieu of Paris which is sadly still true but he lacks a certain je ne sais quoi to quite pull it off successfully with time he may very well become a great actor. There are a thousand and one jokes in this film that will only be understandable to francophones  and Parisian French is fast clipped and very argotic I can't speak about subtitling as I saw a VO version originale but I can imagine the inability to relay the sense of the original in subtitles. If you can speak French WELL you'll laugh a lot. The nod to '90's21stcentury sensibilities about AIDSawareness is lastminute and feels very false thrown in as a sop. Rent the movie  it is a cult classic in France for a variety of reasons. However I will give you one more as you watch this film ponder the differences between American and French culture and consider why in France of all places homosexuality is still shameful.".

It is in a way a variation on the more successful La cage aux folles an international success that was adapted by Hollywood as a Robin Williams vehicle after it was a hit on the Broadway stage in the 1980s.The material is thin although the pleasures in watching this film come in the way of Fanny Ardant a wonderful actress that seemed to have been having a great time while working on the movie. She is Eva the lady that owns a gay club that is a place where most of the action happens. At the center of the story is Adrien played by comic actor Patrick Timsit who does a good job as the man that adores Eva but because being gay he cannot aspire to really make her love him. Richard Berry is also seen as the banker who discovers he is in love with Eva while still married to Marie his society wife.There are fun moments in the film that offers mild entertainment and a few laughs for those fans that are looking for amusement.".

This is a very rich  sometimes too rich  movie full of situations characters and moods ranging from physical comedy to very moving moments like the touching and difficult relationship between Adrien and Eva.

The movie has been criticized for recycling most of the clichs about gay culture the characters may be bank executives but they still act a little like the Cage's Zaza Napoli and for being ultimately conservative gays remain gays and straights remain straights.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this one on Amazon Prime under the title CHARLESTON  TRINITY. It's a straightforward copy of one of the successful Terence HillBud Spencer comedies that were all the rage back in the 1970s. The story is episodic and features a smalltime scammer going up against some bigtime hoods occasionally aided by a musclebuilding priest.As far as genre standards go this isn't one of the best. Too much of the screen time is occupied by cheesy romance material that goes nowhere. Spaghetti western stalwart Giuliano Gemma take on the Hill role but doesn't have much depth to his character occasionally smirking and running around a lot and that's about it. The unknown Swedish actor Ricky Bruch is much better as the hulking priest even though this was his film debut and the brawling action of the climax excites and entertains even if the rest of the film is strictly average. Once again THE STING seems to have been the main source of inspiration for the Italian production crew.".

Is it deep or profound or intellectual? Not really...unless you read really deeply into the script. It's just a great sexy romp through obviously fake crimefighting adventures by teen girls but it's really gorgeous to watch! Also for those in the LGBTQ community I might mention that one of the characters is not sure if she's gay at the start of the film sorry small spoiler she IS of course and so in that sense it is also helpful for those comingout or questioning.".

Not because it was the greatest story ever told but for just the opposite reason it was treated in a very casual manner. There are reviews that state this move would be terrible if it weren't two women or it would be so much better if it wasn't two women. The whole point is it IS two women. Just like Thelma and Louise would have been a totally different movie with two men this one breaks ground by being a cheesy silly spy spoof for lesbians. I also think it's important to state up front that this does involve two women. With a PG  13 rating I know there will be some parents horrified to have their kids see two women in love. I may not agree with their politics but I agree with their right to disagree.Also anyone who can appreciate a movie on a shoestring for Hollywood budget will really appreciate this very slick effort for 4 million dollars. Good writing well directed and some good chemistry between the actors. Also killer soundtrack. I think most 20 to 40 somethings with a sense of humor and a willing suspension of disbelief would enjoy this movie.".

I think I speak for all my fellow teenage lesbians when I say that there really isn't much out there for us in the entertainment world... and a lot of what is out there is edgy or dramatic or horribly tragic and soulsearching.

Don't get me wrong I enjoy the mainstream cheesy chick flicks as much as the next person but I do feel rather under represented sometimes.There are a few times the movie misses it's mark a little but the rest of it makes up for that.

Oscar material this movie ain't but if you're looking for a funny creative satire with interesting characters and a sweet tastefully executed lesbian love story this is the film to see. The acting is flawless through the majority of the film these are people who do comedy extremely well but falter slightly in the face of more dramatic sceneswhich thankfully there are few and Jordana Brewster in particular is stunning and subtle in her portrayal of the criminal mastermind Lucy Diamond. All in all this was a film well worth the money paid to see it. I give it two thumbs way up and I am most definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters in 2005.".

Honestly there are no major aspirations in this film and audiences should discard any major expectations too. Essentially this is a movie that relies on a concept that has long been drained out of filmmaking  fun. The story itself though weak in true substance is hilarious and satirical. The characters are each interesting and worthy of further elaboration. Inevitably the lesbian love story will always be the central point of D.E.B.S.'s popularity but somehow it deserves to be. The romance between the hero and the villain a concept that's a parody in itself is especially charming.So forget all your movie snobbery and just watch the damn movie.

Jordana Brewster has Bette Davis eyes on steroids and the amount of devilishness comedy cleverness sexiness and emotion that she conveys so effortlessly and relentlessly with these brilliant and most deadly of all the formidable weaponry that appears in this She SpiesWhen Lucy met Amy extravaganza is staggering and endlessly enjoyable. I'm sorry but Jordana is a revelation. I know this is a goofy movie but seriously she deserves any and all awards possible for her performance. The writing and fashion and dialog and sheer cheekiness and utter girlness and goofiness of the plot and the sets are simply priceless. In fact there are several absafrigginlutely Priceless characters in this move.Jordana Brewster Lucy Diamond Sara Foster Amy Bradshaw Janet Jill Ritchie Scud Jimmi SimpsonParticularly Lucy Janet and Scud. There is simply not one scene that any of them appear in in which they are not quite simply priceless. Watchable again and again and again and again. When Jordana and Jimmi lip sync Erasure's A Little Respect in a montage scene I can literally watch it over and over for hours.When Lucy and Amy first come into contact they collide in a warehouse chase scene go down and come up pointing their huge guns at each other it is one of the smartest funniest silliest and sexiest scenes in cinema history. I'm sorry but it is!! Every look every facial crinkle every lip curl every line and every flash of the eye could not be improved one bit whatsoever period end of story.But perhaps most of the kudos for this kitchy catty silly lezurely masterpiece should go to Angela Robinson who came up the idea when she was in film school as she explains in the extra footage on the DVD. It is clear that this project is near and dear to her heart and she put so much into it as it was her first major film and there are so many tributes to so many other movies that it's hard to count them all. She had to coach Jordana Lucy Diamond into acting like a rock star in order to get her to appear so convincing in her pursuit of Sara Amy and it in the process she created a monster for which I will ever be in both of their eternal debts.It has been said that Jordana channels Demi Moore but she is so much sexier and funnier and smarter than Demi ever was. The simple little touches and dialog are what make this movie so worthy of my undying madly inlovewithness.Here as Lucy and Amy are having their first fight Lucy the goody two shoes of the pair tries to justify her existenceJust because I'm not some bad ass master criminal doesn't mean what I do isn't important There is line after line which will make you chuckle until you can't chuckle anymore....And when Lucy Diamond wants to turn the continent of Australia to burnt toast with a Dr. Evil style supermegadestructo gun after she can't have her way with Amy well again watchable a hundred or a thousand times over. But through and on top of it all is a very clever touching and believable love story in the midst of all the goofiness between two incredibly hot women but the hotness is not in sex scenes which were deleted to get a PG rating but in their expressions conversations kisses but mostly in the way their lips and their eyes are used when they are not kissing but when simply engaged in conversation.I stumbled across this movie on accident on YouTube. And YouTube is the reason I went out and bought the DVD the very next day. I simply had to have this movie in full length and full quality. Go YouTube!! Keep infringing copyrights Go independent thinkers writers and fun loving producers and studios for making movies like this come true!!THANK YOU ANGELA ROBINSON!!! You are a rock star!!Anyone who does not like this movie is probably a Republican. Or dead.".

It is hard to imagine how it can go wrong beautiful young women guns and consistent jokes. Jordanna Brewster does a nice job of bringing a great deal of sizzling sexuality to the character of Lucy Diamond. Likewise Sarah Foster Devon Aoki and Meagan Good are equally sensual and fun to watch. Jill Ritchie is terrific as the airhead who is striving vigorously to earn her stripes. While Jimmi Simpson displays strong comedic timing which adds to the diverting and catchy feel of the movie. Kudos to Angela Robinson and the cast for bringing the proper energy and creativeness to the this flick.".

It is hard to imagine how it can go wrong beautiful young women guns and consistent jokes. Jordanna Brewster does a nice job of bringing a great deal of sizzling sexuality to the character of Lucy Diamond. Likewise Sarah Foster Devon Aoki and Meagan Good are equally sensual and fun to watch. Jill Ritchie is terrific as the airhead who is striving vigorously to earn her stripes. While Jimmi Simpson displays strong comedic timing which adds to the diverting and catchy feel of the movie. Kudos to Angela Robinson and the cast for bringing the proper energy and creativeness to the this flick.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hey this isn't a Jane Bond flick so if you're looking for a serious spy yarn then this isn't the movie for you. It's also probably not the movie for you if you're more concerned with movie politics and the message that movies send for those folks it'll be either too controversial or not controversial enough. Are we talking serious character development here? NO. Are we talking plot holes large enough to drive a MACK truck through? Yes. But that's not all we're also talking a fun campy movie that's just a hoot to watch and has a sweet love story at it's core. Jordana Brewster is positively enchanting as Lucy Diamond a successful super villain who has become desperate for love and is willing to go to any lengths for the right person. Amy Foster is sweet as the girl who got the Perfect Score on her SPY SATs and as such is expected to be the perfect spy unfortunately she doesn't want to be a spy she wants to be an artist and live in Spain. This movie really focuses on Amy discovering who she is and who she wants to be Super Spy or Aspiring Artist and on Lucy growing up leaving behind her flashy Super Villain career for a less exciting and more rewarding life with someone she loves. It's a Saturday afternoon popcorn matine flick fun and frivolous and well worth a watch.Now that I've given it a hearty recommendation let me touch on what many folks will object to the message. There are three types of folks out there who may have problems with the message of this film social conservatives LGBT activists and serious cinemaphiles.Social conservatives might object to this movie because of the love story plot line that involves Lucy Diamond Jordana Brewster and Amy Bradshaw Sara Foster. Let me stake out my position now I AM A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE I vote and advocate generally conservative principals but I am not thankfully blind to the fact that you can't control who you love or are attracted too. The love story between Lucy and Amy is about as sweet and inoffensive as can be think any 80's Teen Film and that's what you've got so if the fact that you have to see two girls kiss and profess their love for each other bothers you then you really need to reevaluate your thought process because you've got issues.There are also going to be LGBT advocates who won't think the movie goes far enough to establish it's bona fides as a lesbian film well that's probably because it's NOT a lesbian film. It's a romantic comedyspy spoof where the romance is between two women. If you're looking for something that is involved and complex and explores the vagaries of a lesbian relationship between two young women and the challenges they face in coming out to family and friends then I'd like to suggest Better Than Chocolate. This is a COMEDY. It is not serious social commentary in film form. It is not designed to change hearts and minds nor speak to the audience about lesbianism. There is no antigay villain here. No one comes down on Amy for being in love with Lucy because she's a woman they come down on her because she's a super criminal. All of the heat Amy deals with over her love affair with Lucy is based on her Amy's betrayal of trust to the other D.E.B.S. not the same sex nature of their relationship. It's a sweet romantic farce people  deal with it! Finally to you cinemaphiles out there Yes I know the character development is sparse. Yes I know that the supporting acting is uneven and in some cases I'm looking at you Devon Aoki we're talking flat and uninteresting. This is a farce a light hearted romp take the stick out of your butt and enjoy it for the sweet unpretentious little jaunt that it is. Watching a movie doesn't have to be a life altering experience or something that makes you think it can be just fun. If you feel guilty enjoying this movie then you can always watch The Hours  that ought to suck the joy right out of your soul and put you back in curmudgeon mode.".

	schema:headline " Audrey Rose An Underrated Supernatural Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Wise may have directed West Side Story and The Sound of Music. But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers including The Curse of the Cat People The Day The Earth Stood Still but most notably The Haunting. However hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called Audrey Rose. It is another film from the famed director that in my eyes is very memorable and atmospheric.Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter Audrey Rose died in a horrible car accident and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now when Audrey Rose first came out in 1977 it was subject to mixed reviews mostly because it was seen as a horror film and I can understand why. It was released a few years after The Exorcist when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see Audrey Rose as a horror film. Instead I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one.Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta creator of The Entity and director of Dark Night of the Scarecrow Audrey Rose is a nifty thriller for three reasons.First Robert Wise gives superb direction. He registers the exact amount of passion that he had for The Haunting and he has chosen an effective story that challenges the beliefs of the viewer. Do we choose to believe Hoover in that his daughter has come back in the form of Ivy? Or is Ivy simply an ill child in need of psychiatric help? It is a great story.Second the acting is quite good. Anthony Hopkins and John Beck give very nice performances as Hoover and Bill. The wideeyed newcomer Susan Swift is especially believable in the scenes in which Ivy shows off the nightmarish behavior of Hoover's dead daughter. But I and many other people who have seen the movie feel that the greatest performance belongs to Marsha Mason star of The Goodbye Girl as Janice. Once Audrey Rose takes over Ivy Janice's fear of losing her daughter shows and Mason's acting intensifies as the movie goes on.Third the film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scenes of rain pattering on the windows as Ivy screams for her daddy are incredibly creepy and so are the scenes at Ivy's school and inside the banal hospital.There are plenty of movies about possession and bad seeds but a reincarnation thriller is very uncommon. Audrey Rose may be a little long but it is a supereffective supernatural thriller that is very creepy. It will leave you with questions and raise ideas about reincarnation. Robert Wise has given us a thriller to remember.".

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Wise may have directed West Side Story and The Sound of Music. But he has done a fair share of horror films and thrillers including The Curse of the Cat People The Day The Earth Stood Still but most notably The Haunting. However hardly anybody seems to remember a 1977 film called Audrey Rose. It is another film from the famed director that in my eyes is very memorable and atmospheric.Janice and Bill Templeton are leading a very happy marriage with their daughter Ivy. The last thing they want is a strange man by the name of Elliot Hoover stalking them. Worst of all he sets his eye on Ivy. Soon enough they are able to talk to Hoover. He explains that his wife and daughter Audrey Rose died in a horrible car accident and that his daughter may have crossed over into Ivy. Of course Janice and Bill dismiss Hoover as a lunatic. But that's when Ivy begins to exhibit strange behavior. Could Hoover be correct? Is Ivy really the reincarnation of Audrey Rose? Now when Audrey Rose first came out in 1977 it was subject to mixed reviews mostly because it was seen as a horror film and I can understand why. It was released a few years after The Exorcist when horror films were becoming more modern and faith was being challenged. But I don't see Audrey Rose as a horror film. Instead I perceive it as a supernatural thriller with a touch of family drama. And it's a very good one.Based on the novel by Frank De Felitta creator of The Entity and director of Dark Night of the Scarecrow Audrey Rose is a nifty thriller for three reasons.First Robert Wise gives superb direction.

And the ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.The basic story of a girl who was killed in a fire at a young age and then reincarnated into Ivy is a very good story.

I saw Audrey Rose on a cold Halloween night for my annual scary movie viewing and I was disappointed not by the film but by the fact that it really isn't that scary. It's chilling ultraatmospheric and very suspenseful but by no means terrifying. At the end I felt empty something the director probably intended because that's basically what the story suggests. The plot based on a source novel by Frank De FeLitta was inspired by an actual event in which Felitta's daughter played the piano perfectly despite having never touched one in her life. Some of his preachiness manages to seep into the screenplay sometimes resulting in little moments where someone who completely doubts reincarnation would roll their eyes. However the audience is so captivated that they accept what's going on. This acceptance should be accredited to Wise who found the idea of returning to the world fascinating but knew not everyone would be under the spell. For compensation he puts the atmosphere at the fore front keeping everything on a segue. Sure the film sometimes allows the material to appear sententious and John Beck's performance is as wooden as hell but the disorienting camera work and acting turns from the three leads Hopkins Mason Swift are all virtuoso. Anthony Hopkins here in a role before James Ivory and The Silence of the Lambs and even Richard Attenborough's Magic gives a performance so perfectly minimalist that his character's emptiness might evoke Donald Sutherland in Don't Look Now a film primarily fueled by its structure coat fit for Hitchcock. But now 40 years after it's initial release this supposed Exorcist ripoff proves as ambitious as Contact and utterly original.".

The story centers around a Janice Marsha Mason and Bill John Beck Templeton a New York city couple who have a wonderful daughter named Ivy. Their lives are fairly normal that is until a stranger Anthony Hopkins begins to stalk Ivy claiming that within her body is the reincarnated spirit of his daughter Audrey Rose who burned to death in a horrible car accident. Of course the Templetons think this stranger named Elliot is a madman. But when Ivy begins having horrible nightmares running through her room and banging on her bedroom window with her fists they begin to wonder if Elliot's claims may just be true...From the director of the horror classic The Haunting Robert Wise comes this bizarre but spooky little tale of reincarnation. The story is based on Frank DeFelitta's novel of the same name and the plot is interesting. Reincarnation was a topic that hadn't really been addressed at the time but while this film is constructed all around the basic idea of reincarnation many people have mistaken it for some sort of Exorcist ripoff mainly because of the fact that it displays horrible events plaguing a young girl. It's an intelligent premise and a wellwritten plot but the problem with the film is that it is quite plodding and almost too slow for it's own good.Don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with slowgoing stories but I think most people can agree that the pacing here is a little tedious at times. On the plus side there are some genuinely frightening hysteria sequences involving the young Ivy along with the awful car crash death in the beginning that is the basis of the film. As far as the acting goes it was all good  some of the hysteria scenes were obviously overacted but aside from that it wasn't bad. Marsha Mason conveys a very emotional frantic mother while John Beck isn't given much to work with. The brilliant Anthony Hopkins plays Elliot in one of his earlier roles before The Silence Of The Lambs fame that he earned later in his career quite well which isn't surprising because he's always good. And Susan Swift who much later appeared in a Halloween sequel plays the tormented Ivy. I'm surprised we didn't see more of her as an actress she seems to have had the potential.To sum things up Audrey Rose is a decent horror movie. The storyline is excellent but unfortunately the pacing here breaks a lot of tension. On the plus side there are some frightening scenes and a few memorable sequences plus the story is intelligent and original. While it's a decent horror movie it's not the kind of movie you can sit down and watch if you're in a tired mood because it will likely bore you. Go into it with an open mind but don't expect anything in terms of The Haunting or Wise's other films. 610.".

In an instance the car driven by Slivia is knocked over on it's back and bursts into a ball of fire killing both mother and daughter. The time of the accident is 820 AM October 3 1965. Some 375 miles way in New York City two minutes later on 822 AM Janice Templeton Marsha Mason gives birth to her first child a girl and she and her husband Bill John Beck name her Ivy Susan Swift.It's now some 12 years later and Ivy has been having nightmares of being burned alive waking up with mysterious blister on her hands. There's also this strange and creepylooking man who's been following Ivy at school and even to her apartment building doing nothing but just watching her as he knew Ivy all of her life. We and the Templeton's later learn that the man is the president of Unified Steel Corp among other titles that he has Elliot Hoover Anthony Hopkins. Mr Hoover turns out to be the father of Audrey Rose Hoover the girl killed in the October 3 1965 car crash!Hoover had been left a broken man after his wife's Silvia and young daughter Audrey Rose's tragic deaths. Over the last seven years Hoover has gotten involved with the occult and the mystic Eastern and Oriental World cultures that believe in Reincarnation and the indestructibility of the soul and that it's as real and alive as both being born and after dying. With the help of a number of oculists and mediums Hoover had tracked down his late daughter's soul or being in the body of Ivy Templeton due to the time of her birth and her nightmares about like Audrey did being burned alive. Now that Hoover found her he feels that he has to look after Ivy or Audrey like some guardian angel. It's Hoover's annoying behavior and almost fanatical determination to be near Ivy that leads Bill to both verbally and physically have it out with him! This leads Hoover to be brought up on charges of both harassing the Tempeltons and even at one point kidnapping little Ivy. It's Ivy's mom Janice who strangely becomes convinced that Hoover is on to something. Since he has the uncanny ability to get Ivy to stop crying and in some cases injuring herself with his fatherlike attraction to her whenever Ivy goes into one of her uncontrollable fits or spasms. The very depressing ending of the movie has both Bill and Hoover have to Janice's objections Ivy regressed by Dr. Lipscomb Norman Llyod back in time. It's then where she returns to her previous life as Audrey Rose Hoover and relives the horror of that accident at the beginning of the movie with first devastating and later deadly results.I at first had difficulty understanding what exactly Elliot Hoover wanted with Ivy since even if she possessed the soul of his dead daughter Audrey Rose she was still the flesh and blood and legal child of Bill and Janice Templeton. As the movie started to slowly explain itself through Hoover and a number of experts on Reincarnation it became evident to me that the very fact that Ivy was born so soon just two minutes after Audrey Rose's death had left her a both physically and emotionally crippled little girl! It also became evident that Ivy's soul didn't have the much needed rest and time to heal itself from the unbearable trauma that it just went through as Audry Rose.The tragic ending in the film didn't at all seemed to effect Hoover it was as if he expected it while both Bill and Janice were left numb with shock. It's at the very end of the movie Audrey Rose that you begin to realize like Hoover did all along that Ivy wasn't meant to be born. In being born so soon just two minutes after Audry's death her life would be hell resulting from the terrible memory of her previous incarnations as Audrey Rose terrifying death. This would have Ivy either like a moth be attracted to a flame like she tried to do at a Catholic School snowman bonfire and end up immolating herself or end up so traumatized that she would never have a happy or normal life.Janice as well as Hoover with Bill still not being able to accept what happened in the end learned that Ivy's death was not a tragedy but in fact an escape from a life of suffering that awaited her. In the near future she'll be reborn again to a loving and caring couple with her troubled and tortured soul healed from what she suffered in the tragic lives that she lead as both Ivy Templeton and Audrey Rose.".

If the soul is free as his hodgepodge of Eastern mysticism purports why does Ivy suffer death due to Audrey's trauma? Her soul didn't look any too free when it was thrashing around on fire trapped in nightmares of its previous incarnation's demise drawing Ivy to the same doom. What good then does Hoover do when he calms his daughter's souldescendant in her panic? Does she recognize him as Daddy? Do I care? Not much but apparently more than De Felitta and Wise did. Rather than consider any of these questions Wise and his scribe prefer to linger for leaden minutes on the minutiae of police medical and legal procedure. This stuff is supposed to be creepy a banality of horrortype thing but it's merely frustrating. Sure those elements worked in EXORCIST but there was a movie behind them.Anthony Hopkins is a dependable manic and Marsha Mason even when married to John a jaw is a fine substitute for a talent Beck is a credible and sympathetic performer.

So utterly grating was her high pitched screeching that I lost any sympathy for her character. I wanted someone to just clock her good to shut her up. You can tell she was directed not to immediately respond to Hopkins's interventions. I was deeply annoyed at the directors for this because it prolonged the howling. Again  probably good direction in service of the story complete agony for me.Second the mother is a constant emotional wreck which is annoying to watch as well. Again I admit  necessary for the film but it got so incredibly tiresome watching this woman in a state of constant distress. Take a Valium already or go to church or just off yourself please for the love of god the constant worried crease in your brow is making me dyspeptic. Pull yourself together you miserable cow or at least please SHUT UP.Then there were the predictable plot devices where the father refuses to believe Hopkins's claims and motivations. The hostility  necessary and consistent with the believability of the plot was tiresome and obligatory. Yes we get it you think the guy's either a shyster or a nutcase and you're hostile to him. Can we please just flash forward a week or something and get past this? We know we're watching a horror movie with probably supernatural overtones. Can we all agree as audience and filmmakers that yeah the guy is all skeptical as anyone would be in real life and then just jump forward? Every stupid film dealing with the supernatural makes us go through this. The skeptic in horror films is like a placeholder. Perhaps flash a title card For the first 45 minutes of this film the father was skeptical and very angry at those who weren't. It would save a lot of screen time.It's like television too  you have a super genius but nontraditional cop who is always right over and over yet every time he posits some kind of theory his chairwarming superiors scoff at it even though the cop has solved like 400 cases in the last year and is never wrong. TIRESOME. Then as others have mentioned there is the tired 70s new age crap. I can't really expound further on this except to say 70s new age crap sucks. See the movie Serial for a fun send up of all of that garbage. Not a horrible movie by any stretch but for me at least completely unpleasant to watch. Whatever virtues there were in the story they were overshadowed by my boundless discontent.Maybe you can sit through this and see the kinda okay movie underneath all of these annoyances. But you'd better be okay with the sound of screeching children. I would also warn you that creepy mustaches abound as they apparently did everywhere in the 70s.".

The thing I am most happy well so to speak about is that they left the original ending unchanged as sad and depressing as it is. No Hollywood 'happy ever after' this time. Through the entire movie I recognized all scenes from the book. I'm not a very big Hopkins fan but here he did portray a good and sad role. The girl IvyAudrey.... why hasn't she done more movies than the 5 or so she did? She was very believable and in the end scene even though I knew what was going to happen she had me paralyzed with fear for Ivy and compassion for Audrey. Just thinking what Audrey must have gone through in her final moments is enough to make your stomache cramp and you eyes tear.".

I searched for it on DVD and was soon able to order it. Last night I watched it for the first time.minor spoilers Let me say that the movie did bring the book to live. The thing I am most happy well so to speak about is that they left the original ending unchanged as sad and depressing as it is. No Hollywood 'happy ever after' this time. Through the entire movie I recognized all scenes from the book. I'm not a very big Hopkins fan but here he did portray a good and sad role. The girl IvyAudrey.... why hasn't she done more movies than the 5 or so she did? She was very believable and in the end scene even though I knew what was going to happen she had me paralyzed with fear for Ivy and compassion for Audrey. Just thinking what Audrey must have gone through in her final moments is enough to make your stomache cramp and you eyes tear.";

Apparently it did the trick for him but Audrey Rose is nearly unwatchable primarily because of his over the top performance. The story itself is emotional claptrap of the worst kind and Hopkins layers on the goo every time he's on screen tempering it with some annoying verbal tics that probably work well on stage but don't survive the transition to celluloid. I kept hoping the film would improve if only for the sake of poor Marsha Mason but there's one absurd and laughable moment after another. My favourite is the trial scene as an Indian guru takes the stand as an expert witness on reincarnation. Oy. Things weren't going to improve much for the venerable and respected Robert Wise who went on to direct Star Trek The Motion Picture a film whose only crime is its numbing dullness. I'm not sure which movie is worse but I'd just as soon avoid them both.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like Robert Wise movies and I think he was a brilliant stylist who could always be counted on to express the zeitgeist of the age. This film however is a serious misfire on his part. Its basic and only premise is to treat the possibility of reincarnation as something dramatic shocking and even potentially scary. Even admitting reincarnation does exists the heroine's story doesn't make a whit of sense on any level or plane of reality you can name. In this film reincarnation is just another disease of the week used to justify a soap opera where Marsha Mason can shed as many Oscarbaiting tears as she wants act all motherly irrationally change her mind every five minutes while crumpling her handkerchief and filling the screen with the sound of mucus. Whereas Anthony Hopkins is a compelling presence stating an interesting case in an interesting way John Beck as Ivy's biological father is clearly a studmuffinwithbunsof steelofthemonth actor whose part demands nothing more than the ability to look tough use his fists occasionally and remain an uncompromising and uncomprehending lanternjawed heel from beginning to end. The film starts with a stomachchurning idyllic exposition of what a fun place Manhattan can be for families who have no money worries and whose bread winner exercises an unidentified profession that vaguely has something to do with advertising. The Templetons live in the bosom of luxury with their pampered and obnoxious daughter in the apex of gracious living quarters in an era when burnt orange brown beige and dark oak were considered an acceptable colour scheme and offwhite neocolonial plush furniture was considered the epitome of good taste. That itself is scarier than anything else the script can come up with. Historical note the mixture of horror scenes and a trial setting could have given interesting results if one is to judge by the recent Exorcism of Emily Rose very good film but no relation unfortunately but in this film it just adds another layer of absurdity to the proceedings. Robert Wise has always been able to absorb the spirit of his times without being subservient to it e.g. Eleanor's car trip and the spiral staircase scene in The Haunting are an homage to the same scenes in Hitchcock's Psycho and Vertigo respectively while remaining personal but in this film one senses a willingness to compete with the memory of Rosemary's Baby The Exorcist and Don't Look Back as well as the impossibility to do so because the underlying material and the reason to care are simply absent. I for one was thankful to stop hearing the little brat whine at the end of the film. But the thing that dates the movie the most and definitely relegates it to the putrid pile of 70's new age crap is the fact that nowadays the person who would be put on trial for murder is the irresponsible hypnotist quack whose work we are asked to respect and take seriously.".

If it wasn't for a friend mentioning this movie title I would have passed it up. But I trusted his judgment since he is a horror aficionado and I read some decent reviews in some of my old issues of FangoriaGore Zone.The acting is silly but it is obvious that this is the way it was written. The key difference between a movie like Ticks Infested and some really bad SciFi Channel movie is that everything is done in the Evil Dead 2 Bad Taste slap stick kind of way. And they go for the gross out money shots in every other scene lots of pulsating blistering skin waiting to explode etc. And thank God this didn't have any of the cheesy computer animated gore and FX. I love the latex goo and prosthetic body parts of the old school even if it does look fake. At least you know the actors are actually interacting with it rather then a green screen.So gather a few friends kick back a few beers or Mountain Dews and be prepared to rewind a few scenes so you can watch them again!".

Don't get me wrong it is a B movie but the superb direction and special effects more than make up for the lame plot.  Seth Green is the main character and upon viewing this movie the first time about three years ago I realized that he could actually act and now everyone is picking up this movie because of name recognition.  That's fine by me but to the Seth Green fans out there he plays a total geek in this movie.  Seth Green may be the main character but this movie is tailored to the die hard B movie fan with Clint Howard and Ami Dolenz doing their usual bits and Peter Scolari The other Bosom Buddy doing his best not to laugh as he delivers his lines.  Oh yeah the guy from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air is in this too and I believe he and Howard did some of their best acting in this film.  Unfortunately Dolenz is wasted as her character is never even remotely close to effecting the plot.  She's there as something to look at and for the posters and box covers.  Roselind Allen also goes through the motions and is also wasted in her role.  Like I said at the start this is a special effects and directorial masterpiece but cheesy dialogue a weak plot and limited acting ability hurt this film.  Still if you're into effects this movie is better than most especially considering the perceived lack of a budget.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I was watchng this movie I couldn't help but think that while Peter Scolari was filming this Friday the 13th meets Arachnaphobia low budget horror his Bosom Buddies costar Tom Hanks was off earning an oscar for Forrest Gump.  Don't get me wrong...I like Peter Scolari he just seems so out of place in this movie.  That aside if you're a fan of this genre especially of the straighttovideo variety you won't want to miss this one.  It has everything for you twodimensional characters gore bad dialogue gore cheesy special effects no plot or storyline whatsoever and oh yeah I almost forgot...gore.  My only real complaint is that there is little to no camp.  It's those moments of overdone camera work and melodramatic line delivery that make these Bmovie romps real gems to have in one's video collection.  The closest we get to any kind of decent camp is in the characters of Sir and his sidekick henchman Jerry.  Only these two offer us that overly theatrical style of acting that has the viewer thinking they've got to be geniuses!You will also want to check this one out if you're a fan of Seth Green. Much of the action centers around him as he has quite a bit of screen time. A very talented actor Seth is the only cast member that actually attempts to flesh out his character and add some dimension to the role. Unforunately this venue won't allow him to do that.  It is also fun to watch Seth not take the whole thing too seriously.  Watch him carefully in the vet's office during the autopsy scenehe's actually trying to hold back some laughter!  All of this put together does make Ticks a worth while 85 minutes to spend watching it.".

I mean you have this potentially great story cool slimy giant blood drinking ticks annoying character's who the audience want to die in the goriest way possible  the obligatory isolated location but Infested fails to take advantage of any of these things. Instead it would rather have lots of dialogue no deaths an unnecessary sub plot about drug growers  not much else. There is also a flashback scene of which nothing ever becomes of. Having said all that Infested is OK I suppose it moves along at a fair pace  is watchable if ultimately disappointing.Director Randel doesn't do anything to liven the film up it's competently made but it has no real style or flair to it. The ticks themselves are OK they are just puppets covered in slime although I have no idea where the giant monster one comes from at the end. The gore is very sparse there are plenty of slimy tick pods  the little critters running around but they only kill one teenager throughout the entire film just one. They also kill three drug growers as well but when three of the four deaths happen within the last fifteen minutes you can probably understand why Infested becomes frustrating to watch. I mean I'm not watching a film about mutant killer ticks for the high drama the emotionally driven wonderfully realised dialogue or the superb Oscar worthy acting am I? No I ain't I want to see the mutant killer ticks do what mutant killer ticks do best kill annoying teenagers.Technically Infested is alright even though it was madeforvideo which is never a good sign it's generally well made but nothing stands out as being particularly brilliant. Some of the special effects are fairly impressive while others are far from impressive. The gore is tame someone's face  body splits open  a huge tick crawls out plus someone's leg is caught in a bear trap  there are a few splashes of blood here  there but that's it. I want my money  85 minutes of my life back. The acting doesn't impress particularly.Infested is a clichd predictable disappointing  frustrating film throughout. It could have been so much more. Average at best  only worth a watch if there's absolutely nothing else on or if you can get hold of a copy cheap very cheap that is.".

As you might expect considering the fact that this film was a direct to video release most things about it aren't exactly brilliant. However it's obvious that the most important thing about a film like this is the gore and Ticks certainly isn't lacking in that department! The story is obviously just a means to an end and sees a class of delinquents going out into the forest for some sort of moral building exercise. However their little trip is interrupted by a bunch of bloodthirsty ticks that have grown to massive sizes because of chemicals put on weed plants to accelerate their growth. Unfortunately for the kids the ticks' appetites have grown with them and now they are on the menu...The film has a good basis for gore as it's directed by Hellraiser 2 director Tony Randel who also directed the less than impressive Children of the Night and the executive producer is one Brian Yuzna who every gore fan should recognise. The plot doesn't contain a lot of surprises although it deserves some plaudits for staying interesting for most of the way through. The story progresses in the usual way for this sort of film  i.e. there are a few clues that something bad is going to happen then bad things do happen and eventually everything gets out of control. The film doesn't pay a lot of respect to it's insect star as there aren't many references to real life ticks but then again I didn't go into this movie expecting a natural history lesson. The cast is only notable for the fact that it stars a young Seth Green although he really isn't that much of a highlight. Alfonso Ribeiro who is more famous for playing Carlos in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air also makes an appearance which is completely unlike his TV persona though he is underused. The film ends well though too many people survived for my liking but all the same this is good fun and recommended.".

	schema:headline " Ticks in all the clich boxes.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ticks is another entry in what seems to be an ongoing competition between Bgrade filmmakers to produce movies featuring the most harmless and innocuous of creatures turned into monsters frequently made gigantic or at least larger than they normally are. Killer Ticks aren't the most ridiculous menace ever created in one of these movies as anyone has seen Night of the Lepus killer bunny rabbits or various 50's Bmovies will attest but they certainly aren't convincingly threatening enough to be the monster in any movie. That is the main problems with Ticks which is basically a serviceable Bmovie. The Ticks are certainly icky little creatures which have grossout value which is used to good effect here and the prospect of having one of them attached to you and sucking your blood is not a pleasant thought. The SFX used to portray the Ticks are actually pretty good and they are suitably gross little critters a case of practical special effect doing a better job than CGI ever could and the gory scenes of them burrowing into the flesh of their victims are quite well rendered. My favourite scene was that of a Tick with a syringe stuck into it skittering across the floor complete with the silly movie skittering sound. However the Ticks could only be seen as a real threat in the most contrived of circumstances which the movie does it's best to provide via an area selective forest fire toward the end of the movie and are certainly not enough of a threat to pad out a 90 minute movie.It is clear the makers realised this and added in other elements such as the some human bad guys in this case some gun wielding dope growers to generate some more conflict and danger Not to mention running time into the proceedings. None of this is particularly interesting nor is the clichd character interaction between our group of main characters some troubled teens from LA out in the woods with their counsellors on some kind of bonding. get back to nature program The details are never made clear. The characters are barely sketched in and their interactions and conflicts are painfully hackneyed e.g. the teenage daughter of the lead counsellor who resents her father for dragging her along on these excursions and hates her stepmother. We don't even get a lot of detail about what the problems of these trouble teens are in some cases none at all. The acting is pretty average and you get the impression that nobody is trying too hard.Despite this there is some fun to be had. The Ticks are actually pretty cool little creatures even if they aren't a believable threat and there is enough blood and goo around to liven things up between the bad character stuff. There are some really bizarre plot twists which succeed in making the movie more entertaining such as the contrived circumstances in which the forest fire is started and the uberridiculous way in which an even bigger monster tick is created in the movies climax. I didn't know steroids could do that. I also liked the fact that the ticks became the way they were not because of government experiments or evil big companies dumping waste but because of weird growth agents being used by the Marihuana growers. It doesn't make much more sense but it is at least one lame clich avoided. Then again it still has time for the lame clichd kicker ending. I also got some entrainment from seeing a young Seth Green on screen before he developed much personality and Alfonso Ribiero AKA Carlton Banks from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Anyone familiar with the character he is on the show will find his performance as the tough guy from the streets here most amusing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ticks is another entry in what seems to be an ongoing competition between Bgrade filmmakers to produce movies featuring the most harmless and innocuous of creatures turned into monsters frequently made gigantic or at least larger than they normally are. Killer Ticks aren't the most ridiculous menace ever created in one of these movies as anyone has seen Night of the Lepus killer bunny rabbits or various 50's Bmovies will attest but they certainly aren't convincingly threatening enough to be the monster in any movie. That is the main problems with Ticks which is basically a serviceable Bmovie. The Ticks are certainly icky little creatures which have grossout value which is used to good effect here and the prospect of having one of them attached to you and sucking your blood is not a pleasant thought. The SFX used to portray the Ticks are actually pretty good and they are suitably gross little critters a case of practical special effect doing a better job than CGI ever could and the gory scenes of them burrowing into the flesh of their victims are quite well rendered. My favourite scene was that of a Tick with a syringe stuck into it skittering across the floor complete with the silly movie skittering sound. However the Ticks could only be seen as a real threat in the most contrived of circumstances which the movie does it's best to provide via an area selective forest fire toward the end of the movie and are certainly not enough of a threat to pad out a 90 minute movie.It is clear the makers realised this and added in other elements such as the some human bad guys in this case some gun wielding dope growers to generate some more conflict and danger Not to mention running time into the proceedings. None of this is particularly interesting nor is the clichd character interaction between our group of main characters some troubled teens from LA out in the woods with their counsellors on some kind of bonding. get back to nature program The details are never made clear. The characters are barely sketched in and their interactions and conflicts are painfully hackneyed e.g. the teenage daughter of the lead counsellor who resents her father for dragging her along on these excursions and hates her stepmother. We don't even get a lot of detail about what the problems of these trouble teens are in some cases none at all. The acting is pretty average and you get the impression that nobody is trying too hard.Despite this there is some fun to be had. The Ticks are actually pretty cool little creatures even if they aren't a believable threat and there is enough blood and goo around to liven things up between the bad character stuff. There are some really bizarre plot twists which succeed in making the movie more entertaining such as the contrived circumstances in which the forest fire is started and the uberridiculous way in which an even bigger monster tick is created in the movies climax. I didn't know steroids could do that. I also liked the fact that the ticks became the way they were not because of government experiments or evil big companies dumping waste but because of weird growth agents being used by the Marihuana growers. It doesn't make much more sense but it is at least one lame clich avoided. Then again it still has time for the lame clichd kicker ending. I also got some entrainment from seeing a young Seth Green on screen before he developed much personality and Alfonso Ribiero AKA Carlton Banks from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Anyone familiar with the character he is on the show will find his performance as the tough guy from the streets here most amusing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Being an outdoor instructor I have had my fair share of ticks. The thing is I have been constantly amazed by the number of people who don't even know what they are. So if you don't know here it is. They are little insects about 2mm in size. As you walk through the hills or woods of Britain they jump on to you from passing foliage and crawl up your leg  body. Then they try to find the darkest warmest and juiciest part of your body hmm..yep somewhere around THERE bury there heads inside you and drink your blood for a few days before dropping off and finding another food source. If you ask anyone who spends a lot of time in the outdoors it won't be long before you find someone who has a tick story about a disturbing place they have found one or more ... I have mine but that's another story.So anyway the movie. Well for starters I feel that this show is somewhat stolen by the rather entertaining character 'Panic' because he never panics apparently. He seems to be trying to be a badass Gangster come eighties breakdancer throwback. Now this guy swears threatens to kill geeky kids plays basket ball on wasteland has violent outbursts throw axes and wears a trench coat and shades some of the time. All in all he sounds like a bit of a hard nut. that is until he spends half the movie wearing pyjamas and no matter how much effort and believe me he puts in too much effort he puts into his role he will always be Carlton from the 'Fresh Price of Bel Air'. hmm.The ticks themselves actually look like ticks. Except for the fact they are the size of your hand. But a movie about 2mm insects that suck blood out of your genitals wouldn't be that great a plot and probably quite hard to sell to the movie companies. For a crap movie though the effects are pretty good. In fact this movie is a little bit too good to be considered a real bad movie. But it's just too bad to be considered a good movie. Its one of those movies that float in the zone of watchable trash. Which is a shame. It had so much potential to be terrible.In ConclusionWorth a watch just to see Carlton in the final scene and for the quote I'm infested!!".

NEVER!";

The star could have been more voluptuous but then that's kind of what i liked about this movie...none of the standard gore sex and slash. The slightly open doors of the dark closets which hid the monsters of our childhood as they observed us worked for me I made sure my closet doors were shut that night. Also the abandoned pool scene was somewhat of a flashbackfright for me. All in all I thought this was an entertaining movie that was technically well done. Contrary to most i also liked the ending. They definitely works better on viewers who are home alone at night...those dark areas of the house seemed a bit darker and all the little unexplained creeks and bumps a sleeping house makes seemed more meaningful. I do wish they would have expanded more on the brief theory that darkness may be the channel used to travel from one dimension to another... In truth there is really a limit to how many different ways a horror movie can scare you we've seen them all over and over...it is just like a thrill ride we all know what is going to happen the challenge in a horror movie is to touch something in us that results in a fear response i guess therein lies the key as to whether you like or dislike this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating  out of In this era of modern horror it's really the little films that come through and surprise me the most so I'm glad to include They among this recent bunch which also includes the terrifically frightening Dead End and the surprisingly funny Monster Man. I must admit to having relatively low expectations the film was promoted with the heading Wes Craven presents and the film's director Robert Harmon hasn't done anything worth mentioning in years.But the movie works and if it's not particularly original or outstanding it's at least very well made and makes smart decisions i.e. a more atmospheric quietly creepy approach that lesser films would have avoided. In fact the movie is so lowkey I'm surprised it wasn't just given a straighttovideo release as nothing in this picture screams box office success the way a noisy thrill ride approach that Darkness Falls employed might.They stars the very cute Laura Regan sporting an adorable haircut! as Julia Lund a psychology grad student who's contacted by an old friend of hers. They reunite in a coffee shop with the friend mentioning some halfcomprehensible blather about they then kills himself right before her eyes. At his funeral Julia meets a couple of his more recent friends played by Ethan Embry and Dagmara Dominczyk and upon a few conversations discover they all have something in common. They've experienced night terrors as kids and believe something in the dark that once branded them as children is now back to collect.Even running at a scant ninety minutes it could be debated They still runs too long. The subplot with Embry and Dominczyk doesn't really go anywhere and only provides the opportunity for two lengthy sequences where we know these two are going to meet a particularly horrifying fate. Had these two scenes been less effective I might have complained but these setpieces are directed with the right amount of buildup tension and atmosphere making the payoff worth it. And at least those two aren't as fundamentally useless as Marc Blucas who plays Julia's disbelieving boyfriend. It's a clich role and nothing about him stands out in the slightest see The Grudge for a very similar role. As the lead Laura Regan proves a very competent performer who's sympathetic and likable. The little discoveries she makes are creepy and intriguingly enthralling. There's hints of an alternate universe these creatures live in and the brief views we get of this world are among the film's most visually engrossing moments. The monsters themselves are mostly kept out of plain sight kept hidden in shadows and darkness so that what little we can see only enhances the scares. The sounds they make also build a nice sense of unease a trilling noise that gives the creatures an otherwordly feel to them not unlike the mysterious creatures in Signs.The film is mostly a collection of effectively frightening setpieces. Most of the concepts the movie introduces are left both satisfyingly and frustratingly unresolved there's just enough to fascinate but maybe just a few more answers or theories would have been appreciated. They comes to an abrupt end but that works in favor of the movie finishing things off on a startlingly high note.".

A very simple storyline which does its job well. I found myself questioning 'has she gone mad? or is she truly in danger from these monsters?' only to the very end do you find the answer. The story lasts about 1hr and 30mins and fits everything in nicely. I recommend this film to anyone with a good imagination.. Best watched with the BoyGirlfriend...

We don't know what all we know is  they are going to get us. They is a well crafted modern horror with a slight old school vibe. Forget all the new high budget best CGI Hollywood offerings. This is far better. It's now 2008 and They still remains in my top 10 favourite Horror movies of all time. Why? It's everything you want in a great Horror. Scary eerie creepy unsettling claustrophobic  that's what we want right? When making a Horror movie that you want to be successful you have to have suspense  great suspense. They has a tremendous amount of suspense from start to end. It has all of those No don't go in there moments but not like your typical average Horror. It's different. It understands it's audience and what the audience wants. It delivers in all the right ways. I've read a lot of bad reviews for this movie  why I don't know. It makes no sense to me. Does no one know what a great Horror movie is anymore? Has almost everyone been fooled by the oh so generic Hollywood cheap scare tactics?  maybe so. One thing I do want to point out is They was released in 2002. Darkness Falls was released in 2003. So Darkness Falls took all of They's ideas. I'm tired of reading reviews were people are complaining saying how They ripped of Darkness Falls. Get all the facts before you accuse. All in all They is one of the best Horror movies I've ever seen. It scares you to your core. It leaves a lasting impression. It's genuinely frightening. It will leave you feeling more than satisfied. Well what are you waiting for? Get They now!".

I don't know how they managed to find that country scene with mists the moon a country road and everything just perfect!It also succeeds in scaring the viewer quite a few times with startling attacks and creepy camera work. I would even have liked to see more of this but true it might become repetitive and we know how how we hate repetitive stuff in the world of the short attention span! Also sound is used to scare like the telephone ringing in the 'Exorcist' at a tense moment.It also slightly over uses the monster coming to get the camera scene where a scary monster comes at the camera viewer. These are good methods of scaring people.There are some terrible logic errors and they do spoil the film for 'thinking' people. If it was a real scenario her boyfriend for example wouldn't let her out of his sight! Much of the plot relies on the people isolating themselves from others for anything to take place. The strange thing is even though they know they are in danger they still go off on their own where no one is there to help them. Whenever there are people present nothing happens.This flaw ruined the film a bit for me. I kept thinking why is she doing THAT when nothing would happen if she did THIS. Very frustrating... but I guess they were out to make a movie about people being attacked when they were alone and this is what they ended up with. The British Lenny Henry Show did a great parody of this kind of movie with the actors always saying We've got to split up it's more likely we get chopped up that way! and ohoh the music's changed that must mean  here comes the bad guy!Also without spoiling anything there are some places where people just seem to willingly ignore the facts. Like when a window is broken inwards into a closed chamber. No one even noticed that and one is left asking  and then what? Just another missing person from a locked room? How many of these can there be? Where are the paranormal investigators when you need them? Where are the university geeks want to become the ghost busters? They investigated stuff like this in The Entity and that was supposed to be based on a true story.Coming back to the positive side I can imagine the actress playing the main part was chosen because she bears a striking resemblance to a young Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby. Those types are always believable when scared to death. One seems to identify with a skinny almost anorexic was that possibly the comment they were making with her vomiting in the railways station? sweet young thing. Her boyfriend is far too conservative for his own good. Letting her sleep alone in a double bed! What kind of gentleman is that in this day and age! Just think If her impotent shrink had been played by Bruce Willis he'd have followed up on her story and we'd have seen some aliens splattered all over the subway!  Now that'd been juicy! Sorry wrong film. That's Mimic.They is one of these movies that end up being rather annoying the more you see it. From all sides... and I agree there was a LOT of potential in there. Just not quite enough attention to detail. Still  5".

	schema:reviewBody "When Julia Lund goes to a late night diner to meet friend Billy she assumes he is on something when he starts babbling about how they come for him in the dark and how he has to work nights to survive. However she did not expect him to kill himself claiming that it is his only way to escape the monsters that he fears in the dark. At the funeral she meets some friends of Billy who seem to believe his ramblings and tell her stories that cannot possibly be true. When Julia herself starts seeing things in the dark she starts to doubt her own sanity.Opening with a scene that trades nicely on childhood fears of the dark and dark spaces this film continues with the one idea that there are monsters out there but cannot ever get above the level of basic and rather obvious horror. Not that this is a bad thing in itself but put it this way  it is very much a Wes Craven Presents affair even if his name was taken off it for wider release. The story isn't great as really it is just enough narrative to string together lots of flickering lights shadowy movements and jump scares it never gets below the surface and is never intriguing enough to really engage but then I suppose that is not what the film is aiming for. Rather it just wants to be a horror that trades on sudden things and half seen creatures and as such it works well enough. The creatures stay hidden even when you see them a good thing and the ending does not betray the mood of the majority.The cast aren't anything to write home about but they are as good as the standard you expect for such films. Regan is impressive even if a lot of her role involves screaming she still does manage to descent convincingly and her fear is believable. As director Harmon enjoys the ominous places such as cupboards and corners and he uses them well even if he is never above having something suddenly jump out  it is hardly Ring but it suits the type of film he is trying to make.Overall this is not a great film but it is an enjoyable genre film  a horror with unseen beasts and lots of basic jump scares. It doesn't work above that level but thankfully it doesn't really try to. It may be bad grammar but if you like this sort of thing then They is worth checking out even if it is a bit samey and predictable for the majority.".

It may be bad grammar but if you like this sort of thing then They is worth checking out even if it is a bit samey and predictable for the majority.";

It is really hard to understand this low ranking of the title perhaps its because many people cannot really connect anymore to their younger self to address the emotional level of this movie. You cant really enjoy this movie if only what you like is heckslash zombie horrors or gross entertainment... This movie is simple fear and you are gonna get it right or you are not at all... don't watch it with biased comments just watch it...You might just love it not because of the comments here but because you really would do...910".

Don't expect stupid obnoxious teenagers who can't act in the leadroles don't wait for silly embarrassing oneliners don't relay on cheap CGI not even on expensive CGI for that matter. What we get is a tense horrorthriller well acted throughout by a cast of fairly unknowns which relays on atmosphere minimal special effects and leaving a lot to the imagination of the audience which as most of true horrorfans know can't be beaten by the most expensive and amazing FX. To my opinion great horrorfilms are those which are taken seriously by the creators the actors by everyone involved. Take a look at Night of the Living Dead 1968 The Exorcist1973 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 Dawn of the Dead 1978 Halloween 1979 The Thing 1982 etc. to name only a few of 60ties 70ties and 80ties horror classics. What they have in common is seriousness. They might contain some humour but it never takes over the movies to a degree that the audience is allowed to lean back in their seats and grab a next handful of popcorn in anticipation of the next shocking sequence... What these movies are capable of is to keep the audience at the edge of their seats to scare the audience into believing and fearing what its sees and not sees but make believe seeing it and to make the audience go home afterwards with a feeling of unease. That is what THIS movie does very well make the audience uneasy because it deals with a primal fear darkness and what may be IN the darkness. Its a little gem and i think it will be considered as a classic in years to come.".

People boo hoo in other reviews stating whahwhah we don't get a nice neat explanation as to why the creatures are here and where they came from think about it.....how would any of the characters in the movie gain these clues or information? It's not like one of the creatures would leave a book behind or talk about their motives! I guess most people can only enjoy this type of movie if it A. explains the origin of the terror B. explains their motive C. exploits their weakness  D. shows the character triumph in the end.I enjoyed guessing wether everything is real or mental and the bleak but eerie ending answers that! I DID NOT like the alternate ending on the DVD which pes on the audience and says the last 90 minutes was a delusion of a mental patient SUCKER!!! NYAH NYAH there are no monsters! That ending would've made the beginning pointless and the whole movie. The alternate ending has also been done several times in other movies which would've made it more lame! The normal end was perfect to me.THEY didn't have any gore or action fight scenes but that actually makes it more creepy you see the creatures for a split second and they attack swiftlyquietly and efficiently.This movie reminds me of a '90s comic called Dark Dominion I believe in which there is a parallel world of demons and certain people can cross over into it.Why do some movies always arrive in the studio with an evil twin? examples VolcanoDante's Peak LeviathanDeep Star Six Armageddon  Deep Impact This and Darkness Falls ARE twins....must stay in the light a drawer full of batteries etc. Darkness Falls just like Jeepers Creepers went downhill when the creature is seen by EVERYONE in the police station which makes it more like a Godzilla type of monster.The DVD could use some more features but I will definitely buy it once the price is right. If your looking for a creepy thriller to see at night go ahead and rent this movie!Noah".

Is she insane or really being stalked by demons?  Will they get her or will she escape?  Every single scene is dark and gloomy providing plenty of opportunities for these dark demons to attack...even the ones that should be brightly lit.  There's a true sense of isolation and hoplessness.Having said all that there is very little meat to this movie.  It is basically the story of one woman fleeing from demons both symbolicly and literally.  We are never told where the demons come from or where they go to or what they want....  We never really see a lot of backstory or resolution.  It's just a chase.  One long chase...but a suspenseful one.".

I found it really gripping to watch and loved it's atmospheric take on the whole psychological horror subgenre.Released previous to the Asian horror remake boom They is an odd hybrid of a monster film and an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It's slick well executed and oozes good looks and thoughtful production. The film is a largely successful update of the fun horror of 90s films like Mimic and The Relic. All this taken into account I firmly recommend it.However They has its flaws. Main character Julia played fairly well by young actress Laura Regan is a good enough lead but her aloof nature and damning view of the rest of the cast make her tricky to like at times given she seems to be surrounded by concerned friends yet assumes they couldn't possibly believe what she's going through. Watching the film you can't help but feel the eventual denouement was inevitable given she never showed anyone what was happening or tried to get help.On top of this They is another film that at times mistakes not being able to see what's going on for scariness. In a good chiller I need to see enough to make me scared but not enough to kill my morbid curiosity as to just what that was and whether I saw what I thought I saw. They barely shows you anything. As far as I could tell the monster looked a bit like a Greystyle alien crossed with an Aztec mummy but it's so fleetingly shown that you go through scared and start to become frustrated.That said They is both very effective and bravely different. It could so easily have been another run of the mill horror thriller with a vapid cast and an attempt at selfdeprecating humour but instead it's a discomforting dark and bleak thrill ride with tons of scares and a very unnerving premise. It won't be for everyone and I've heard a LOT of complaints about the ending but I thought it was great.".

It could so easily have been another run of the mill horror thriller with a vapid cast and an attempt at selfdeprecating humour but instead it's a discomforting dark and bleak thrill ride with tons of scares and a very unnerving premise. It won't be for everyone and I've heard a LOT of complaints about the ending but I thought it was great.";

I had a field day with the Blair Witch Project and They was one of those movies.  Instead of explaining what They were we were kept in the dark allong with the heroine of the film making us just as confused and frightened as she was.  At the end where it ends abruptly we still have no idea what they are or what they want only that they are real.  I find this to be more frightening than actually knowing everything.  Do i wish that there was a little more explanation? Sure. Am i disappointed?  Not at all.  I love a challenge.Typically this could be considered a stalk and slash film.  People were being hunted by an assailant attacked and ultimately consumed by they. What sets it apart is it's psychological impact.  The fear of going crazy and the things that can drive a person to reach the end of his rope so to say.  The introduction of They seemed to follow severe traumatic episodes. In the case of the heroine after the death of her father and then after the suicide of her friend.  You have to wonder if Billy had not killed himself bringing out repressed feelings of guilt and hopelessness would the leading lady sorry i forgot her name have been in any danger.  We do not know enough of the other characters to know if this is true or not but we do know that they didn't have episodes with They until after billy's death also.Furtherly is that a word? the only knowledge we get of the creatures is through Billy's journal.  The man was obviously an obsessed addict with serious mental problems.  It is possible that he was the catalyst for everything that had happened since we know that he was always a little weird  His obsession could have easily imprinted itself on other troubled people.  Our heroine even says so while trying to self anilyze herself during the film.Now to the ending and if you haven't seen the movie and don't want it spoiled i suggest you stop reading now.  I mean it don't read anymore. I warned you.in the end the girl has apparently totally flipped out and is placed in an asylum.  This is ironic considering she had been studying to be a shrink in the first place.After she realizes where she is after having been out of it for a while she is attacked and taken away by they to their dark place only to become the victim of acts unknown.This is what upset people the most.  not a traditional ending more akin to the blair witch and last years jeepers creepers short and sweet without any apparent conclusion.  However after some thought and discussion the ending actually fits and is very conclusive.  Lets break it down.Throughout the film everyone goes through serious mental stress being pushed to their limits of sanity.  They can be best described not by their apearance but by the effect they have.  They are the negetive thoughts and emotions that we all harbour.  They are the fear and insecurity that can drive people mad. see how easily it is to describe them their name having a double meaningWhen the little girl in the waiting room says that they want to eat her she doesn't mean it in that way.  They want to devour her sanity and that is what happens at the end of the movie.Our heroine has snapped and has entered the dark place in her head where all of her fears and dreads have come reality.  This place represented by the darkness where the demons come from which brings up another good point.They are referred to as demons which to me signifies inner demons.anyhow what i am trying to say is that this movie is actually a symbolistic horror about going crazy about obsession and guilt fear and insecurities.the ending simply shows us that the girl we knew and followed has lost contact with the real world and has gone completely crazy insane.  The screaming girl in the darkness is the last trace of her sanity and it is quickly devoured leaving only the dark place.well i hope that was informative and made you appreciate the movie a little more.  Mind you these are just my thoughts and i know i left lots of room for critism but that is what discussion is all about.Finally i find this kind of horror to be the most frightening.  A dangerous man with a knife is scary but completely losing your mind and not being able to do anything about it is just terrifying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mammoth is an ambitious highly contemplative take on the implications of global capitalism for individuals families and communities. Moodysson illustrates a world in which market economy as the Western way of life both encourages and obliges human action that irrespective of one's intentions reproduces unequal social relations and reinforces existing power structures.One could criticize Moodysson of presenting only conservative private solutions for the social problems caused by globalization. The protagonists do not try to face their social circumstance head on or to find political ways for addressing their situation. In stead of seeking social change through collective action family becomes of central importance. Only some vague escapist dreams are left for the disillusioned workers at both ends of the global working class.Despite the film's fatalism Moodysson succeeds beautifully in constructing a convincing and authentic interpretation of the 21st century social reality of global interconnectedness. The tragedy of highly educated Western professionals that Mammoth portrays lies in the fact that they are conscious of the disastrous social and ecological consequences of their actions yet find themselves completely unable to transform the social condition.".

Nevermind it's a fine piece of cinema great storytelling and speaks grimly to us about the world we're raping the time we're wasting and the people suffering becaurse of our western lifestyles. Mostly it's about the children who are crushed in the middle of our lost struggle to make a life buy more stuff or just to survive. Does that make sense? The movie does in a sad way.".

However the sacrifices they make are so extreme that each person becomes detached from the very reason why they made these sacrifices in the first place Their children.The film presents us with a critical portrayal of this lifestyle and as such in the end this is a tragedy.This is an excellent film highly recommended especially for those of us who must balance work and family life on a daily basis.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like Innaritu's Babel Lukas Moodysson's Mammoth focuses on groups of people who share connections with each other as well as the dilemma of family members parted from their loved ones by the need to earn a living in the global economy. At the film's opening Leo is some kind of computer game whiz living the American dream with his wife Ellen and a delightful 7 YO daughter in a vast apartment high above the streets of Manhattan. Their child's nanny Gloria resides with them but this conscientious immigrant worker's warm exterior conceals a growing agitation at being separated from two young sons who live with their grandmother back in the Philippines.The idealistic unworldly Leo must travel to Thailand for the signing of a business deal. As he sets off on his trip Ellen works a punishing schedule as an E.R. surgeon fretting that she's losing her daughter's affection to Gloria and compensating for this anxiety by getting emotionally entangled in the case of a child who has been brutally stabbed by his mother. After arriving at his Bangkok luxury hotel Leo pines for his family exchanging disjointed voicemails with Ellen while he waits for the lawyers to conclude their negotiations. Eventually he escapes the city for a remote beach resort where he befriends a young prostitute after rejecting her professional advances.The film takes its time building up the pressure but it's no great hardship watching such a talented cast heating up the stew until the pot boils over. After the storm breaks Moodysson seems determined to avoid sentimentality and tosses his characters into a whirlpool of heavyweight turmoil. When calm is restored it's clear the struggles of the poor will always be remorseless and lifethreatening  but the film's closing moments suggest that Leo and Ellen might also suffer some devastating future upheavals. In contrast to Babel's more hopeful conclusion Mammoth's audience might wonder if it deserved such a tough lesson that momentary lapses can lead to bitter consequences and bad things happen to decent people.".

	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Lukas Moodysson Mammoth is a melancholic indie feature showing how both those who have money and those who don't can be equally unhappy. On a deeper level it's also about how parents  mainly out of necessity but sometimes out of cruelty  often fail to provide their children with the care and nurturing they need to feel protected and loved.Leo Gael Garcia Bernal and Ellen Michelle Williams are a young married couple with a sevenyearold daughter Sophie Nyweide who live in a fancy loft in Soho. Though a selfdescribed hippie in his younger days Leo has recently made it to the big time by turning his nerdish obsession with internet video games into a multimillion dollar enterprise. But Leo can't quite adjust to being a part of the privileged classes and he yearns for a simpler life focused on his family something that seems to be becoming ever more difficult to achieve with his busy schedule. Ellen works nights as an emergency room surgeon which prevents her from spending the kind of quality time she would like with her daughter Jackie who in turn is becoming ever more attached to Gloria Marife Necesito her Filipina nanny. Gloria meanwhile is heartbroken at the fact that she's had to leave her two little boys back in the Philippines to basically fend for themselves while she earns enough money to build the house they will all one day live in.Leo and Ellen are united in their desire to do good in the world  Ellen by patching up broken bodies and shattered lives and Leo by spreading his newfound wealth around to those in need. In a way they're finding their own means of helping to bridge the gap between the haves and the havenots in this world. But at what cost to their family unit? The movie draws a distinct contrast between life in Manhattan and life in the Philippines where Gloria's children live with the everlasting threat of poverty hanging over their heads and Thailand where Leo goes on a business trip and where his attraction to a beautiful native girl may ultimately prove too powerful to resist.Though at times it may seem meandering and insufficiently developed in terms of its storytelling Mammoth finds its own strength in concentrating on those little moments of truth that form the essence of real life. And even though there is a surfeit of musicalmontage sequences running throughout the film it is partly counteracted by a subtle spare and haunting musical score that nicely accentuates the lyrical nature of the piece. The last half hour in particular becomes a poetic and powerful account of people learning to prioritize their own lives in such a way as to be of the greatest value to both themselves and those around them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I assume it was a great break for the director  a big budget movie with real panAmerican stars. What a disappointment! I can completely relate to his plight for abandoned and exploited children but as an art form  pardonne moi! It was fresh groundbreaking and believable in Lilya Forever showing a Russian kid abandoned by her government and parents and exploited in Estonia and then in Scandinavia. Here  a much weaker artistically emotionally and logically attempt to develop the theme into a more global tellall tale. Too bad it paints a couple of hardworking and yes sorry to mention this welloff newyorkers as complete morons incapable not only of any rational move but also of any true or at least understandable emotion. If Michelle Williams character is more or less believable assuming she is severely overworked and terribly depressed the lead first lover is just a walking caricature. There is literally nothing good to be said about this lead character played by Bernal. If people this inconsistent could reach adulthood in reality they would never achieve any success in life unlike in the movie. There are also other characters that are so clich that one could just wonder if the screenwriterdirector exercised any selfediting at all after compounding these two heroines a good whore and a wise Philippina woman. The conclusion  even as a satire it does not fly. Nobody needs a lesson on class struggle in such a naive and distorted form. Equaling being poor with wholesome goodness is even more superficial. One good thing though  the movie stimulates some thoughts of downshifting. That is why work hard if harder you work  the less happy you apparently are even if you do achieve your goal of living cushy life. A sort of stab at the American Dream. I guess many people could relate to that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie attempts to comment on the sorry state of parenting today. Unfortunately the characters are written and delivered in a ridiculously unbelievable way. I didn't buy one minute of it. The story is about how parents abandon their own children for ostensibly good reasons but the results are always bad. There's a husband and wife who are high powered professionals. They have delegated their parenting to a Phillipino nanny. The nanny has abandoned her children to come to the U.S. so that she can send money back to the Filipines to pay for a cement house she's having built. This IS a story worth telling. Unfortunately these characters are presented in a TOTALLY unbelievable way. Mostly this flaw manifests itself through Michelle Williams and the Spanish guy from E Tu Mama Tambien who plays her husband. I don't think they give bad performances. I think they gave the wrong performances for this story and this film. And that I will lay at the feet of the director whoever he or she is. I could care less to look it up right now. It takes a lot to take the time to write a bad review for a bad movie after you've just wasted 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back. But if one person reads this two minute review and decides not to watch this movie I'll consider my time well spent. The last thing I'll say is that this film could have been salvaged with a complete rewrite from the scene at the dump through to the ending. They wouldn't have had to change the ending. Just everything in between those two points. Instead it just nose dived from there to the last frame. Don't waste your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I notice that many of the positive reviews for this film are from Scandinavia. I'm not and I ran into some real holes in the story. The subject of the film is parents and children and what happens when the two are separated by necessity. The film opens in New York where Leo the main character has become fabulously wealthy and loves his kid but must fly off to Bangkok to seal a deal that will make him even wealthier. His story is the skeleton of the moviebut it's also the weakest and least convincing. Two other stories or four complete the film showing us family separationsbynecessity that are more convincing. I for one found the story of the Filipino nanny much more watchable and believable. The Philippines produces too many intelligent welleducated people for its economy to support so roughly 15 of the adult workforce are forced to leave the country to work overseas Gloria the nanny is one of them and she has to leave her children in Olangapo while she sends money back from New York. I knew about that situation going in but the film does a nice job of dramatizing it. meanwhile the main story starring Gael Bernal as the wealthybuttortured New Yorker just doesn't work partly because it's either poorlywritten or not written at all. Bernal is a good actor but here he sounds as if he's been asked to improvise his own dialogue and it sounds just like improvised movie dialogue from other badlyimprovised movies boring flat and very very very repetitious. Improvisation can be done right and when it is it works beautifully as in HappyGoLucky and The Class but not here. Whether it's improvised or not Leo's part of the film is one long boring clich. There are some other little glitches in the film that strain credulity but overall I'll ignore the Leo section and give it a 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen thousands of movies literary! and I have no troubles with watching movies which are different. What troubles me are boring movies. A film can be about everything without being boring. Even everyday life and work. But a film about everyday life needs a plot or a point to it. I guess this film is about world wide connections and about the world and making money to fulfill people's dreams. In a sick world. And it's A film with lots of use of mobile phones. More or less pointless. Maybe there's a connection I don't get here. I'm used to look out for details in film proving to be important pieces of the film puzzle later on in the movie. Here there's much pointless things happening that it ruins the experience. The important thing here appends in the last half hour and they are made almost unimportant. I find that almost provoking to both the viewer and to the actors doing their best in this.Still I have to say I'm not that sure about the theme. Did I understand it? Because I feel more and more empty while watching this. The opposite of what I expected and it annoys me. And it is getting worse and worse. The script might be confusing or just uninteresting. I didn't want to watch a film witch could have been my own working day or holiday. I really don't buy that these people are so bored.This is absolutely a great idea but it's not well made. The cutting rhythm is so annoying that it seems unprofessional. The tedious focusing of the camera is a Moodyson trade marque and it functions well in a couple of his movies but here it's not that suitable.I've enjoyed some of Moodysons earlier films but I found this very unfulfilled. Some of his work has been both good and important. But this is far off. The cutting is annoying and so is the actors and the music. Not a good way to start but the worst is that the film music promises something exciting which really never happens. The aim characters are living quite interesting lives but we almost are bored with they're every day life.Mammoth is a film which should be buried in the ice like the Mammoths. Hope Moodysons gets well soon!".

There is the contrast between people and specially children from the First and Third Worlds but nothing new. The narrative is cold and not engaging. Gael Garcia Bernal is miscast and his immature character has nothing to do with his mature wife. Sophie Nyweide steals the film with her top notch performance. There are so many tragedies along the story that in the end I was expecting that Leo had contracted AIDS with Cookie and would transmit the disease to his wife Ellen. The title Mammoth refers to the expensive pen that Bob gave to Leo but I did not understand the intention of the author with this title.

	schema:reviewBody "MAMMOTH is a sensitively written and directed film by Lukas Moodysson that adroitly traces three stories that all intertwine within the confines of one family. It touches on many aspects of human relationships but the one driving force behind each of the several stories that are woven in this film is the importance of family. It is a profoundly moving film beautifully brought to life by a fine cast of actors. Leo Vidales Gael Garca Bernal in yet another role that proves he is one of the finest actors on the screen today despite his young age is a highly successful designer of video games married to Ellen Michelle Williams a committed Physician and Surgeon and parent to a vibrant little girl Jackie Sophie Nyweide who is devoted to her Filipino nanny Gloria Marife Necesito who is living with the Vidales to make money to send home to her treasured young sons Manuel Martin Delos Santos and Salvador Jan David G. Nicdao living in the Philippines with their grandmother Maria Esmeralda del Carmen. Leo's family unit is warm and secure the only minor crack in the veneer is young Jackie's preference for spending time with the more available Gloria than with Ellen due to Ellen's long hours in the hospital. Leo is called to Thailand on a business trip to sell his ideas to Thai entrepreneurs and while there his business partner Thomas McCarthy suggests that he partake of the feminine charms readily available in this country. Leo is faithful and declines advances from call girls but eventually gives in to a beautiful young Cookie Natthamonkarn Srinikornchot only to be driven by remorse to make a quick sell of his product to return to his family. Meanwhile at home Ellen is devastated by the death of one of her young patients and in her distress she must allow Gloria to return to the Philippines whose one son has been severely beaten in his attempt to gain more money for his family so that his mother needn't work in the USA. How the results of all these traumas resolve forms the touching ending of this moving story. While each of the actors mentioned is superb Gael Garca Bernal shines in a very subtle role as does Michelle Williams who manages to make Ellen credible without becoming saccharine. Yes if the story sounds a bit like another film in the style of Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu 'Babel' or Paul Haggis 'Crash' then that is a fine comparison as this film is in many ways a more intimate version of that kind of storytelling. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Leo is faithful and declines advances from call girls but eventually gives in to a beautiful young Cookie Natthamonkarn Srinikornchot only to be driven by remorse to make a quick sell of his product to return to his family. Meanwhile at home Ellen is devastated by the death of one of her young patients and in her distress she must allow Gloria to return to the Philippines whose one son has been severely beaten in his attempt to gain more money for his family so that his mother needn't work in the USA. How the results of all these traumas resolve forms the touching ending of this moving story. While each of the actors mentioned is superb Gael Garca Bernal shines in a very subtle role as does Michelle Williams who manages to make Ellen credible without becoming saccharine. Yes if the story sounds a bit like another film in the style of Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu 'Babel' or Paul Haggis 'Crash' then that is a fine comparison as this film is in many ways a more intimate version of that kind of storytelling. Highly recommended. Grady Harp";

While Michelle Williams as motherwifedoctor is trying to save a boy's life in NYC...the happily married man  her husband  gets bored waiting for a business deal to go through and has a beach vacation with a young prostitute and I note he fails to tell his wife he might be HIV infected by the prostitute. Also I don't think the nanny would have left the girl Jackie alone without calling to tell her mother...you don't ask a 7 year old to do that. And the nanny's mother blew it by telling her grandson that the kids go at night and get money sleeping with someone. What an unfortunate reminder that it is Westerners who keep the child prostitution going there. And to add to the dreariness of the charactersthe pace of the movie was horrendously slow. There was a heaviness too...so on my list to never watch it again.".

Altho the set locations and cinematography are top notch especially the New York scenario and the family just don't seem believable. I had really hard time connecting to anything or anyone.I have to admit I've always thought both Williams and especially Bernal keep a bit of a distance from their characters. Williams delivers once in a while but Bernal just feels like his not really acting a character but rather just being himself. Or maybe he just acts the same role in all the movies I've seen from him.There is a bit of an Oscar vibe here too like there was with Babel and Crash and it feels intentional. Everythings a bit too underlined and spoon fed. Many events are easily foreseen before they happen and you're left with very few surprises.

	schema:reviewBody "Etaix proves himself the true heir to Buster Keaton in this his first feature. This is just a fantastic series of escalating gags. It's just a pure joy to watch from beginning to last. Everything works and the laughs just build and build. Etaix stars as an idle young man he was in his mid30s at the time the film was made. His parents tell him it's time to find a wife and get the Hell out of their house. Etaix doesn't know a thing about courting women. At first he tries observing the many smooth operators across Paris but whenever he tries to copy them it comes off as disastrous a lot of resemblance to Keaton's Seven Chances in this portion of the film. The film launches into the stratosphere when Etaix finally meets a willing woman Laurence Ligneres and wishes he hadn't. Ligneres is the single most annoying woman in existence with an enormous obnoxious laugh the immediate expectations that Etaix should drop all kinds of cash on her whims and a penchant for getting passout drunk. Ligneres is so perfect. You want to run her over with your car but speaking as a viewer she's really funny at being that annoying as opposed to just being annoying to watch. For Etaix it is a different story and his deadpan attempts to get rid of her are hysterical. The final part of the film has Etaix falling head over heals in love with a famous songstress France Arnel and he goes to great lengths to get backstage to see her. For fans of silent comedies this is a mustsee. It couldn't exactly play as a silent  Ligneres eardrum piercing laugh would be lost if it were  but the gags are very reminiscent of Keaton's and Chaplin's while still feeling fresh. It's not as ambitious as what Tati was doing but it's pretty much perfect.".

	schema:headline " A lost gem  French remake of Keaton's Seven Chances";
	schema:reviewBody "This French slapstick farce seems to have disappeared from the Earth which is a shame since I remember it as extremely funny and well made I saw it as a teenager at a film festival in the midsixties.It's a remake of the Buster Keaton silent feature Seven Chances about a shy young man who must get married within a few days in order to inherit a fortune. This version is partially an homage to the silent cinema but has a lot of Gallic touches as well including some Brigette Bardot jokes.There was another remake in the late nineties called The Bachelor which I haven't seen but understand was pretty bad. I hope someone will bring The Suitor out on DVD someday so we all can have a chance to enjoy it.Update 2013 This movie has finally reemerged in a restored version that was shown on TCM in April 2013. On seeing it again it was even better than I remembered it from decades earlier. Not only was it a superb homage to silent comedy I also thought it anticipated some of the wackiness of Richard Lester and Monty Python and the innovative use of sound made me think of Robert Altman. A unique and very entertaining film. Don't miss it if you get a chance to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently Turner Classic Movies showed a bunch of films by Pierre taixthe first time they've been seen in this country in decades. Because the films have been tied up in legal disputes most Americans have no idea who taix isand I was quite curious. So I recorded them and have watched them over the last few weeks. The Suitor is the last of his films they showedand so I have come to the conclusion that his films for me are only modestly funny. If you like the films of Jacques Tati which I don't then you'll probably like the droll films of Pierre taix.When the film begins you see that Pierre is a nerdy guy who spends most of his times studying astronomy. His parents are concernedhe's getting older and should settle down and get married. The problem is that he is socially ineptthough he is willing. Throughout much of the film the character wanders about Pariswatching men picking up women and then he tries to imitate them. In every case it's a disaster and I really really liked the lipstick bit. However some of the subplots went on WAY too longparticularly the obnoxious lady who laughs too loudly. Much of the film was very subtle and done much like a silent moviebut she didn't fit in at all. A little of her might have workedusing her as much as they did was in my opinion a mistake. She was funny but after a while she was just annoyingand NOT in a good way.For me this is a decent film but one that didn't excite me. However it is important to note that many people LOVE Jacques Tati and Jerry Lewisand these folks would probably love this film.".
